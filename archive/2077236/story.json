As long as she restrained herself, things would be fine.<br>\r\n\"We're just about ready, Undyne!\" came the frazzled-sounding voice of Alphys, the former Royal Scientist, -- and Undyne's steady girlfriend -- who seemed to be able to tell when Undyne was feeling impatient.<br>\r\nUndyne herself, still sitting on the edge of a vacant desk, was idly flipping a lightning-blue glowing spear in her grip. She gave a combination growl-sigh.<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, Alphys.\" she said. She'd been told something to the tune of \"almost ready\" about five or six times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow day for the former captain of the Underground's Royal Guard. A year and a half had now passed since the destruction of the Barrier and the exodus of the monsters from their age-old prison. Things were going very well for them by now. The monsters -- even the strangest-looking of the bunch -- had managed to integrate into human society over time, and progress was booming for both the humans and their new neighbors. With both human science and the incredible work of magic-infused monster science working together, both species were achieving things formerly thought impossible.<br>\r\nYet the impossible becoming possible did little to improve on Undyne's ability to wait quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alphyyyyys...\" she grumbled, her summoned magic spear dissipating as the fish-like monster dropped her fist to her side.<br>\r\nThe upper half of her girlfriend's face appeared from behind an impressive stack of papers to respond. \"Sorry, sorry... I think I've got it now.\"<br>\r\nAlphys stepped out into view, clutching a small device -- looking to be built from a cell phone -- in her clawed hands.<br>\r\n\"Ready? For real?\" Undyne asked, cracking a sharp-toothed grin.<br>\r\nHer girlfriend nodded. \"The calculations were the hardest part, but I think it's ready now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard monster switched on the device in her hands, which let off a buzzing sound as it powered up.<br>\r\n\"Just... just summon one of your spears, OK...?\" Alphys said distractedly, fiddling with the device. She managed to kill the buzzing sound, and looked back up toward Undyne, who had already brought another of her glowing spears into existence.<br>\r\n\"Just like this, right? You said it'll make the spear <b><i>huge?</i></b>\"<br>\r\n\"Th-that's right.\" Alphys said. She coughed, readying the device. \"Just hold it still, and the machine should be able to lock onto it just fine.\"<br>\r\nUndyne obeyed, swinging the spear around to her front.<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be so kickass...\" she said, still grinning widely. \"Even better than our giant sword!\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" Alphys agreed. She looked and sounded nervous, but Undyne trusted her work. \"OK, ready? Three, two, one...\"<br>\r\nThe device let off a whoop of sound, and a beam of light, looking just like a bullet of magic, shot off toward Undyne's spear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoa-!!\" Undyne exclaimed. Her spear was emanating a more and more powerful glow as the seconds passed. \"This is so freakin' cool!\"<br>\r\n\"J-just a few more seconds, Undyne!\" Alphys said, trying to be heard over the sounds of the machine.<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Undyne shouted back, unable to hear her voice.<br>\r\nShe saw Alphys' mouth move again, but still heard nothing. She frowned, her grip on her spear slackening. Was there something else she needed to do...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait-!!\" Alphys yelped, watching as the glowing spear slipped downward in Undyne's grip. \"D-don't move it so much-!!\"<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I still can't hear you!\" she heard Undyne shout back.<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Alphys muttered, watching the energy readout on the small screen of her device. A warning flashed up on the screen a moment later, and she gave a squeak of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, the device roared with noise, and a blinding flash of light burst forth from its emitter. Alphys was blinded, stumbling back as she dropped the device. <br>\r\nA cacophony of other sounds roared into her ears, and she clamped her hands over them to block it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh... Crap...\"<br>\r\nUndyne clutched at her forehead, which was stinging dully. She blinked a few times, trying to shake off the last of the blinding light.<br>\r\nShe'd fallen down at some point, and was sitting on an uncomfortable mess of some kind. Maybe she'd been knocked backward...<br>\r\nIt wouldn't look very cool, that was for sure. <br>\r\nShe was about to get to her feet when her vision cleared properly and she froze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uhh...\"<br>\r\nUndyne stared at her surroundings, blinking in confusion.<br>\r\nShe was outside. Alphys had a very nice lab out in the forest near the city, in the shadow of Mt. Ebott. It was quite a large building, too; they'd been lucky to score such a place from the humans.<br>\r\nBut she knew she'd been inside the lab until ten seconds ago. Why could she see the trees?<br>\r\nAnd... why were the trees so small...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly looked down. There, she saw her shirt, jeans, and the pair of comfortable sneakers Alphys had suggested she buy a few weeks back.<br>\r\nMore interesting, however, was everything scattered around her legs.<br>\r\nThere was a colossal mess of what looked like broken concrete and sheets of metal in a disjointed array around her. She scanned over the sight for a few seconds before something clued her in.<br>\r\nIt was the desk she'd just been sitting on, which was now lying on its side, one leg broken off. <br>\r\nThe bigger problem was that the desk was about the size of two of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spear had disappeared when she'd broken concentration, so if <b><i>it</i></b> didn't grow...<br>\r\n\"A-Alphys-!!\"<br>\r\nUndyne, still in a state of shock over finding herself increased to such a massive height that she must have outright destroyed the lab, began to frantically search the rubble for any sign of her girlfriend.<br>\r\nShe found the remains of Alphys' work bench, a mangled assortment of blueprints and design sketches...<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of a familiar cough, and looked toward the source of the noise. A yellow arm was sticking out from beneath a slab of concrete from the former roof.<br>\r\n\"Shit-... Alphys!\"<br>\r\nUndyne hastily pulled the fragment of concrete from the ground and tossed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys was lying in a daze on one of the few untouched stretches of floor remaining. Undyne hovered a hand over her, concerned.<br>\r\n\"Alphys?\" she repeated.<br>\r\nHer girlfriend pushed herself to a sitting position and picked up her dropped glasses from the floor. Alphys let out a yelp of panic as Undyne suddenly took a grip on her body.<br>\r\nShe squirmed as she was lifted from the ground to meet a yellow-coloured eye larger than her entire body.<br>\r\n\"U-Undyne-!?\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n\"Shit, you scared me...\" Undyne said, giving a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n\"M-me-!? Look at you!!\" her girlfriend replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point. Alphys was small enough to fit into Undyne's palm.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Undyne asked, cradling her girlfriend carefully.<br>\r\n\"Th-the device...\" Alphys stammered, \"It must've been overloaded by your magic... The energy levels spiked through the roof, a-and then...\"<br>\r\n\"So did I.\" Undyne said, managing a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys slowly began to return to a normal breathing rate. Her lab was a pile of rubble, and her girlfriend looked to be about a third the size of Mt. Ebott. There was nothing OK about this, but she needed to stay calm.<br>\r\n\"Th-the device-!\" she exclaimed. She'd dropped it somewhere between their positions.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... crap...\" she heard Undyne mutter.<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...?\"<br>\r\nUndyne tilted her hand a bit, pointing to a spot on the floor. She'd moved her sneaker, revealing what little remained of the little device. A few shards of yellow metal were all that was still identifiable.<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" Alphys said, colour draining from her face. \"U-Undyne, it took me three weeks to finish that-!! Even without needing to redo the calculations, it'll...!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait.\" Undyne stopped her. \"You mean I'm stuck like this until you can rebuild it?\"<br>\r\n\"A-and I don't even have the lab, so who knows how long...!\" Alphys was still panicking to herself. She only stopped once Undyne set a fingertip on her head, gently rubbing it over her scaly skin.<br>\r\nShe looked up at her massive girlfriend's face.<br>\r\nUndyne was grinning. Alphys was normally happy to see that, but right now...?</span></div></div>",

You could cause so much damage if you went into the city, w-without even trying-!!\"<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Undyne cooed, \"You don't need to get so worked up over it, Alphys. Just for you, I promise I'll be extra careful once I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys still didn't look remotely convinced. She was fidgeting wildly, resting on Undyne's palm.<br>\r\n\"I'm not hearing any more complaints!\" Undyne went on. She raised her hand up to her face and planted a kiss on Alphys, her lips covering the majority of her girlfriend's body in one go.<br>\r\nOnce she pulled away, Alphys was left dazed, wobbling in place. Undyne grinned at her and gently set her down at the edge of the clearing that housed the remains of her lab.<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll get this cleaned up in no time -- just wait there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne's method of \"cleaning\" was characteristic of her, if rather different from what most people would probably think of.<br>\r\nShe'd quickly gathered up the largest pieces of surviving equipment she could find and moved them into one massive pile at the opposite end of the clearing, and swept the remaining masses of broken materials and rubble into a spectacular junk pile elsewhere.<br>\r\nFinished, she swept her feet across the cracked floorspace a few times to knock aside any remaining debris.<br>\r\nAlphys was still watching from the edge of the area, nervousness all over her little face. Undyne crouched in front of her, still towering far over her head even like this.<br>\r\n\"You can work with this, right?\" Undyne asked.<br>\r\n\"U-um... Well, y-yes, but it's going to-\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\"<br>\r\nUndyne stood back up to her full and incredible height, leaving Alphys in her towering shadow.<br>\r\n\"I'm heading into the city now. I'll be back later.\"<br>\r\nAlphys managed to summon one last burst of courage as Undyne's huge sneakers turned and began to walk away, her footfalls shaking the ground and producing an intimidating boom.<br>\r\n\"W-wait!! Undyne!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Her behemoth of a girlfriend didn't hear her. Alphys hung her head, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne stretched her stiff arms and legs a few times as she approached the edge of the city. She could see cars halting on the highway, their occupants staring at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the city, those nearest to the outskirts could see the incredible sight for themselves.<br>\r\nMany recognized the towering fish-lady approaching the city as one of the first monsters to publicly reveal herself following their exodus from beneath Mt. Ebott a year and a half ago.<br>\r\nInevitably, screams began to echo through the city as Undyne arrived, stopping at the outermost reaches of the city limits. Even the tallest buildings couldn't quite match her incredible height.</span></div></div>",

Fitting in between them would probably be hard, too.<br>\r\nShe glanced down. The flow of traffic had made an impressive reversal. Anyone right in front of her sneakers was making a hasty exit in the opposite direction. The monster standing overhead waited a short while for the cars to clear out before she stepped into the roadway. There was a little crunch as her foot obliterated a street lamp.<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" she muttered. \"Damn, those are gonna be tough to avoid.\"<br>\r\nThere was something ahead that caught her interest. A construction site, where yet another towering building was going up. Undyne approached. The structure was clear of workers right now. <br>\r\nShe'd promised Alphys that she'd be careful to avoid hurting people, but were half-finished buildings people? That was a big \"no\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning herself before the site, she looked it over. There was a crane on the edge of one of the structure's sides. She took a hold on it and lifted it right up easily.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" she remarked, moving the vehicle around effortlessly. Her strength really had gone right up alongside her size.<br>\r\nShe had an idea. Moving her arms around the edges of the structure, she took a firm grip over the whole thing.<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but feel disappointed as she flexed, causing the entire thing to break apart in her grip almost immediately.<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Man,\"</b></i> she said with a sigh, \"This thing sucked.

She slid a foot into the gap to make her way in sideways.<br>\r\nA noisy crash immediately followed her first motion. She grimaced, looking down.

I'll be back in less than one.\"<br>\r\nHe <i><b>had</b></i> been en route to Alphys' lab, but this phone call was drawing out the visit by quite a lot. Frisk was dawdling by the edge of Alphys and Undyne's property, hoping that his adoptive mother, the Underground's former queen Toriel, would be satisfied with his promises sooner, rather than later.<br>\r\nThe monsters had been free for nearly eight years now, but time had not made Toriel any less likely to worry over her son's well-being.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" he said for what felt like the tenth time. \"And <b><i>yes,</i></b> I'll call you on the way home, too.\"<br>\r\nAt last, Toriel sounded ready to let him go. \"OK, talk to you then, Mom. Love you, too.\"<br>\r\n<i>-beep-</i><br>\r\nFrisk made an impatient noise as he at last approached the large building that served as both Alphys' lab and a house which she shared with her long-time girlfriend, Undyne. He knew that his phone's signal would meet some interference once he went inside, so he'd chosen to wait on entering, but he hadn't expected Toriel to speak for so long.<br>\r\nAt this rate, Frisk was half-expecting Undyne to arrive before he could even get in. Not to say that he didn't want to see Undyne as well, but talking to Alphys was the priority, and Undyne's presence would make that harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk had come a long way from the eleven year-old orphan boy who took an unexpected fall on Mt. Ebott. He'd freed the monsters -- after a few RESETs and a whole lot of unfortunate deaths -- and helped his new friends rejoin society on the surface, where they'd lived happily for years now.<br>\r\nFrisk himself was eighteen now, soon-to-be nineteen. He was looking into plans for his future, but he sometimes wondered whether Toriel would ever actually let him leave their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab was filled with its usual hum of electrical equipment. Alphys was making quite a name for herself on the surface as the leading mind in human-monster science.<br>\r\n\"Alphys?\" Frisk called out over the noise. He heard no reply. He walked toward the doorway leading into the \"house\" section of the building and stuck his head through.<br>\r\n\"Alphys...?\"<br>\r\nStill nothing. Frisk sighed. Alphys had left the door unlocked, which made him hopeful that she'd be easy to find. He could wait until Undyne got here from her work day at the school. She'd know where her girlfriend was.<br>\r\nFrisk turned, and something caught his eye.<br>\r\nA new machine was sitting near Alphys' main work area. It was your standard giant science ray, it appeared. He wondered what it did, approaching. <br>\r\nHe was barely within the machine's immediate area when it suddenly made a very loud noise like it was powering up.<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\"<br>\r\nFrisk didn't have time to consider moving back before the machine gave off another very loud sound and a beam of silver light burst from its front side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk blinked rapidly, a hand in front of his face as he tried to regain his senses. His vision slowly cleared.</span></div></div>",

The large machine was calming down now, its sounds becoming more peaceful.<br>\r\n(Well, I'll just consider that lucky and leave it...) <br>\r\nFrisk backed away and took a seat on a nearby chair to wait for Alphys' eventual return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne arrived first, just a few minutes later. She seemed a bit tired from her day of work at the school, but was still enthusiastic to see Frisk.<br>\r\n\"Alphys?\" she repeated once Frisk asked about her girlfriend's whereabouts. \"She'd not gonna be back for a few more hours, probably.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Frisk sighed. \"Well, could you check something with her for me once she gets here? Mom's gonna start to lose it if I'm late for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, punk!!\" Undyne's loud voice called as Frisk departed the lab shortly afterward.<br>\r\nFrisk paused at the edge of the property. The mailbox looked strange, somehow. Was it always that tall...? He shrugged to himself and pulled out his phone to text Toriel about his imminent return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething felt strange as he walked through the front door, back at home. His surroundings just looked off somehow, like they were all just a bit bigger than normal or something. Sure, the furniture was already pretty big to accommodate Toriel's height, but still...<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom!\" Frisk called as he passed by the kitchen. It wasn't time to make dinner yet, but Toriel was already busying herself in the kitchen regardless. Cleaning, Frisk imagined.<br>\r\nHe headed up the short staircase leading to the small second floor. He stumbled on the last stair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside his room, Frisk had to conclude that something <b><i>was</i></b> wrong. He thought back to the machine in Alphys' lab. Everything around him seemed bigger all of a sudden. Was he getting smaller...? It seemed just like Alphys to design a machine that could do that. Unfortunately, it also seemed like her to leave such a device active and unmarked.<br>\r\nHe dug out his cell phone to text Undyne about it. The phone seemed normally sized, so he suspected that it had been affected, too.<br>\r\nFrisk composed a brief text about the device and sent it off to Undyne, before impatiently reeling back on the edge of his bed to wait on a reply.<br>\r\nMinutes passed. Frisk became gradually more nervous.<br>\r\nHe <b><i>was</i></b> shrinking. There was no way around that. By his best guess, he was down to nearly half his normal height as he continued to wait on any reply from Undyne.<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes still brought him nothing. What was he supposed to do? If he could avoid it, he didn't like to return to a SAVE just because of something inconvenient dropping into his lap like this. His last one was from yesterday, anyway. He hated when that happened, as it always threw off his perception of time.<br>\r\nHe couldn't very well head back downstairs like this. He was under a foot tall now. Toriel would lose her mind with worry.<br>\r\nAnd yet, no reply from Undyne arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk was still sitting on the edge of his bed, but by now he'd been reduced so greatly in size that he suspected he was no more than a few inches tall.<br>\r\nHe thought that the shrinking might have stopped on its own now, at least.</span></div></div>",

With a shrug of resignation he started on his trek to the kitchen. Step one... getting down from his bed. He saw his sheets on the right side of the bed were half on the floor. Silently thanking his laziness on making his bed he very carefully shimmied down it to the floor, though at this point he found himself dreading the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... cross that bridge when I come to it.\" he muttered to himself. The walk from his room to the stairs took him about 20 minutes. As he took in the sights, Frisk found himself in awe of the common household objects around him; being this small was kinda cool in a way, and it helped him take his mind off of the bad parts of this whole situation. Though if he was being honest with himself, he had half expected Toriel to have come up in that time frame. No such luck though, and soon he was looking down the stairs. Way, way, waaaaaay down he saw his destination. \"Okay, time to get determined.\" Frisk said as he hopped down the first step, which he estimated to be about a 10 foot drop. Landing on his feet he smirked. This wouldn't be so bad! As he prepared to leap down the second step...</span></div></div>",

Down near the ground, Frisk was cramped into a painfully uncomfortable position between two very thick and heavy masses of weight.<br>\r\nHe'd become wedged directly between two of Toriel's heavy toes.<br>\r\nAside from the cramped confinement he experienced as he tried to wriggle for escape or attention, Frisk noticed a few things.<br>\r\nThe temperature here was almost unbearable in its difference from the air beyond. Frisk still wasn't an expert on monster physiology, but the cause was easy enough to spot. The light layering of fur on Toriel's feet was clearly very useful when she needed to keep warm, but for the diminished human trapped between her toes, it was far too hot for comfort.<br>\r\nThen came the smell.<br>\r\nFurred monsters like Toriel had a natural kind of musk about them, which Frisk was very used to, given that he lived with one and quite regularly visited another. Having his entire body wrapped in that scent and up this close was very different.<br>\r\nHe choked as an inhale brought a wave of stale and warm air into his lungs. He'd been wrong back in his room, when he thought that his shrinking had stopped. He wouldn't have fit into this gap if he were still a few inches tall. Was it ever actually going to stop? It had to, right? Alphys would want safety features like that in case something like this happened.<br>\r\n... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel looked curiously around at Frisk's empty bedroom. Where had he gone? She didn't hear him come down the stairs or pass by the kitchen.<br>\r\nMost of his things were here, too. He would've wanted to bring them with him if he went somewhere.<br>\r\nShe dug a cell phone out of a pocket in her apron. Naturally, Frisk's number was the first on her contacts list. She frowned for half a second at the sight of Asgore's number directly beneath it. She was much less hostile toward her ex-husband these days, mostly for Frisk's sake, as he loved the former monster king like a father, but she was still rarely in the mood to call him.<br>\r\nShe dialed Frisk's number and waited.</span></div></div>",

Frisk immediately took on a deep blush -- Undyne had apparently stripped down to her underwear. Her yellow panties and bra didn't give him much need to imagine anything, as Undyne's pale blue skin and scales were all out on display for him.<br>\r\nHer bare feet crossed the room. Frisk had covered his eyes out of embarrassment. He waited until Undyne seemed to stop moving before he looked again. She was on the bed over him, he guessed. He'd heard her up there. She must've been tired. Undyne wouldn't normally sleep this early in the afternoon.<br>\r\nAt least it would probably make getting her help easy. Frisk checked around and spotted a corner of the sheets overhead dangling toward the floor. He secured a grip on it and began to scale the soft wall to reach the top of the bed. He wouldn't need to feel so embarrassed once he got up there. He knew for a fact that Undyne slept in a black nightshirt and pajama pants when sleeping at home. She'd nearly killed him with a surprise volley of magical spears the last time he woke her up, but that was the middle of the night. She probably wasn't even out yet.<br>\r\nHe reached his destination and pulled himself onto the top of the mattress.</span></div></div>",

And <b><i>damn,</i></b> was she ever into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk shook his head vigorously, careful not to look at Undyne's enormous nude body once finished.

I came in to see Alphys, and-...\"<br>\r\n\"You're saying you accidentally shrunk yourself down, and then you <b><i>accidentally</i></b> snuck into my room and climbed up here?\" Undyne asked dangerously. Her one eye was wide open, her livid expression striking immediate panic into the miniaturized human in her shadow.<br>\r\n\"O-OK, it sounds bad like that, but-...\"<br>\r\n\"But <b><i>nothing.</i></b>\" Undyne cut him off. \"You made a big mistake, punk.\"<br>\r\nThere was nothing affectionate about the way she said \"punk\". Normally it was a friendly thing, coming from her, but Frisk had never walked in on her like this, so maybe something was different this time.<br>\r\nThat SAVE was looking pretty appealing right now. Frisk took a chance, opening his eyes again. Undyne was still glowering down at him. It reminded him of the look she wore years ago, when she fought him back in the Underground.<br>\r\nFaster than he could react, her strong arm reached toward him and grabbed his whole body in its fist.

She brought her fist down to the gap between her thighs, reclining on the bed once more.<br>\r\nThe slit Frisk was now facing down was a menacing sight. Undyne was clearly already very aroused. There was a fine layer of adhesive bodily fluids practically dripping all around here.<br>\r\nUndyne's hand turned, angling Frisk's head straight toward her damp slit.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\nShe didn't wait for an answer. Frisk thrashed and yelled, but in barely two seconds, Undyne thrust him head-first into her waiting slit. <br>\r\nHis hair was coated in fluids instantly as he pushed past her labia easily. The sounds around him went silent as he completed his entry into Undyne's body. His mouth had been open in a scream of protest, and it was instantly filled with the same thick and viscous fluids that were rapidly coating his upper body. The only sounds around him were the deep noises of Undyne's body, which rumbled through the slick walls around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Undyne groaned in surprise at the feeling. She had Frisk inside of her now, with only his ankles still free. She adjusted her hand and grabbed onto his legs from there firmly.<br>\r\nServed him right, she thought as Frisk's helpless struggles against her rapidly increased the stimulation rising from between her legs. She squirmed against her pillow, and pulled Frisk free. A long string of fluids remained fixed to his head as his body came free. Undyne took a moment to smile at the sight before she pushed him right back inside, deeper this time.<br>\r\nThis felt <b><i>amazing.</i></b> She briefly considered talking to Alphys about spicing up their nights together with some ideas like this before getting her mind back on track. Keeping a tight hold on Frisk's ankles, she carried on sliding his little body back in and out of her, trying to contain her physical reactions and avoid causing his body any serious harm. She didn't want to <b><i>hurt</i></b> him, just give him a reason not to try anything like this again.<br>\r\nThat being said, the idea of keeping him -- or someone else, she wasn't feeling picky -- at this size was seeming very interesting.</span></div></div>",

My God...\" Undyne's husky voice growled. \"Don't tell Alphys, but that was friggin' <b><i>incredible...</i></b>\"<br>\r\nFrisk didn't share the sentiment. He coughed, slipping from Undyne's slackening grip and landing clumsily on the very damp sheets below. He tried to push himself up, only making it onto his hands and knees.

Five minutes sound good to you?\"<br>\r\nFrisk just sat there, too exhausted to reply. He wanted to get the hell out of here right now. He closed his eyes and gave his best effort to bring up yesterday's SAVE. but he felt too tired from what he'd just been through.

Her thighs moved a bit as she retrieved her phone.<br>\r\nThere was a sound of tapping against the screen of her phone for a few seconds. <br>\r\n\"Shit, how long...?\"<br>\r\nFrisk managed to look up as Undyne's face came into view ahead.

Her voice was low and unusually smooth.<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Undyne...\" Alphys' voice replied. She was here, then.

Frisk struggled in her grip as she lowered him toward the bed and Alphys' nude form.<br>\r\nHe let out a mortified noise of distress as Undyne's index finger pressed straight into his back, between the shoulders, driving his whole body face-first into the slit of Alphys' vagina. Just like with Undyne before, the scent overpowered him immediately. He thrashed under the firm weight of Undyne's fingertip, but couldn't fight back. The fingertip shifted to and fro a bit, grinding his body against the warmth of Alphys' much larger one.<br>\r\n\"All yours, Al!\" Undyne said, finally removing her finger from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhm...\"<br>\r\nFrisk barely had time to try and escape before another hand clapped awkwardly down on his back. Alphys' hand was twitching and nervous.<br>\r\nThis was really happening.

It didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp jab at his upper back, and his head was pushed forcefully into Alphys' slit. He couldn't breathe. He scrambled helplessly, his hands and legs fumbling against the huge body he was being pushed into.<br>\r\n(No.<i> No. Hell no...!)</i><br>\r\nBut he couldn't stop her. Alphys pressed another finger into his legs, and he was pushed inside of her body in barely two seconds.<br>\r\nWarmth and dampness surrounded him. He thrashed, his limbs uselessly meeting the inner walls of Alphys' sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne watched with a devilish smirk. Alphys was more receptive to this than she'd expected. Hell, Frisk was completely inside her already. Even she hadn't gone that far right away.</span></div></div>",

I need you to believe me, I wasn't trying to spy on you or anything else like that. I just needed to see Alphys, and then that machine went off on me. You nearly killed me just now.\"<br>\r\nFrustratingly, Undyne smirked at the last comment. \"You're saying that you could survive a full-on fight with me when you were a kid, but now I can almost kill you just by being kinda horny? Damn, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n\"Undyne.\" Frisk repeated, this time in a firm voice.<br>\r\nUndyne's smirk didn't go away, but her face softened a bit. \"OK, Frisk. Maybe I jumped the gun pretty badly there, but hey, I had a pretty great time because of it, right? Alphys isn't gonna be back for almost a month now, so you're gonna need someone to take care of you while you're stuck like this no matter what.\"<br>\r\nFrisk frowned. \"Your idea of 'taking care of me' is shoving me into your-\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, you interrupted me when I was already going.\" Undyne laughed. \"I'm not even into guys -- you were just exactly the right size. And shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked him back up from her body and sat up.<br>\r\n\"Still, you've got a month before we can get you back to normal. I'll bet that if you stick with me, you'll be having as much fun as I am by the time Alphys is back.\"<br>\r\n\"Not if I have to go inside of you again.\" Frisk argued.<br>\r\nUndyne brought him right up to her face. \"... No promises, punk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk tried to scramble away as Undyne's fingers closed over him again, but he was too slow to react. Within a few seconds he was being carted right back down to the gap between her thighs.<br>\r\n\"I'll let you breathe this time, 'K?\" was all Undyne said before ramming his little body forward again, this time feet-first. Frisk made a noise of distress as his feet pushed their way into her body.<br>\r\nHe forced his eyes shut as his body slipped quickly into the slimy tunnel again. Trying once more to reach his SAVE, he waited for relief.<br>\r\nBut none came.<br>\r\nHis SAVE just wasn't working, and right now, he wanted it more than anything. If he couldn't escape to that, he didn't want to think about what was going to happen to him.<br>\r\nUndyne was beginning to softly groan again.</span></div></div>",

He was still sticky once he'd done all he could.<br>\r\nHe tried three more times to return to his SAVE as he went about drying himself, but none were successful. He tried to think about the possible causes, and something came to mind. From what he understood of Alphys' research on Determination, the one being in the Underground with the greatest level of \"DT\" at any one time would be the only one to possess the ability to SAVE and LOAD. He'd talked to her about it in the years since, but she had only basic theories as to why he had retained that power even after leaving the Underground for good.<br>\r\nIt was a shot in the dark, but he wondered whether his reduction in size might be responsible for his sudden loss of that ability.<br>\r\nHe sure hoped not. A month with Undyne was <b><i>not</i></b> looking like a fun experience.<br>\r\nHe was just finished with drying off when he spotted the digital clock behind him. <br>\r\n(Wait... Mom-!!)<br>\r\nHe fumbled for his cell phone. Miraculously, it still turned on without any noticeable issue, despite how long it -- along with its owner -- had spent inside of Undyne's very damp body.<br>\r\nHe groaned in frustration as a message blinked up on-screen, telling him that the phone couldn't reach any service. Alphys had rigged up this one part of the house to be clear of the interference that her equipment caused, so it must've been the phone's diminished size to blame.<br>\r\nLooking back up at the clock, he thought back to when he'd arrived. It had to have been nearly an hour since he'd spoken with Toriel on the phone. Sooner or later, she would start to worry about him. All she knew what that he was going to see Alphys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk heard the shower switch off. He waited another few minutes, and Undyne returned. She was dressed this time around, to his relief. That probably meant that she wasn't looking to ram his body into any more of her orifices for a while, at least.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Undyne said with a smile, approaching. \"You ready to have some more fun?\"<br>\r\nFrisk thought to make some comment about how out of place the word \"more\" was in that sentence, but he didn't want to push his luck. Undyne scooped him back up in her hand.</span></div></div>",

Undyne brought him to the bathroom to clean him off a bit, and then headed for the little living room down the hall. Once there, she dropped onto the couch and placed him on her shoulder, moving her fiery-red hair aside to keep it off of him.<br>\r\nShe put on an episode of some anime -- Frisk couldn't tell which one it was, Undyne and Alphys seemed to fall in love with half a dozen more every week -- and while she seemed to enjoy watching it, the little human on her shoulder found himself distracted.<br>\r\nToriel would have to come looking for him sooner or later. What would happen then..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the episode had ended, Undyne stood up quite abruptly, realizing her mistake a second late. She barely managed to swing a hand around to catch Frisk as he tumbled off of her shoulder and down toward the couch.<br>\r\nShe grinned down at him once she had him secure in her grip. \"Sorry...\" she said, though she didn't really sound the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk had no say in what Undyne did next. She carried him through the house, heading back into the wide-open lab area.<br>\r\n\"Undyne...?\" he asked nervously. She was bringing him toward the same machine that had caused him to shrink.<br>\r\n\"Hold still for a minute, would you?\" she asked him quite suddenly. She approached the machine and fiddled with a few switches on it. \"There's something I've been dying to try, but Alphys was all, 'it's too risky, Undyne'... There we go.\"<br>\r\nShe backed up again as the machine began to rumble to life. Frisk, still clamped tightly in her hand, didn't have a clue what she was planning. If Undyne knew how to operate the machine, why did she claim that they needed to wait until Alphys eventually came home to help him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there...!\" he heard Undyne say from overhead. Frisk watched from a gap between the monster's fingers as the machine suddenly let of a jet of silver light, just like before.

He panicked, expecting a long drop to the hard floor below, but to his surprise, he landed almost immediately.<br>\r\nThat said, the impact was hardly soft. He groaned, checking himself over for any injuries. He found none.<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, shit.\"<br>\r\nFrisk looked up and was met with another surprise. He saw Undyne before him, but she didn't look quite so incredibly large any more.<br>\r\nEverything else was still enormous, but Undyne herself looked positively <i>normal.</i><br>\r\n\"... Undyne, did you just-...\"<br>\r\nHe didn't need to finish the question. What had happened was obvious: Undyne had mistakenly caused the machine to shrink her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't happy. Having grown up since his time in the Underground, Frisk knew quite a long list of interesting swear words, but the tirade Undyne went into in reaction to her mistake included quite a few he'd never heard before.<br>\r\nHe waited a bit, but tried to calm Undyne down.<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Calm down!?</b></i>\" she roared, her numerous sharp teeth flashing dangerously. \"I <i>am</i> calm! <i><b>Look at how calm I am!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\nNeeding something to vent her frustration on, Undyne whirled around, producing a glowing-blue magical spear as she went, hurling it upward at the machine. The spear came close to its destination, but fizzled out of existence before it got there. Unfazed, Undyne tried several more times. The best result she got was one spear managing to embed itself in the metal plating of the machine before vanishing like all the rest.</span></div></div>",

This just looked plain <i>wrong.</i><br>\r\nHe knew what Undyne had used the machine for, at any rate. Holding him out before her body, Undyne was giving him a clear view of the machine's results.

Without further warning, he was unceremoniously tossed in the direction of the bed, bouncing on impact and rolling to a stop against a crumpled blanket. Fortunately, Undyne had taken a moment to change out the sheets since her last \"use\" of him, but considering what she was about to do, Frisk wondered whether that would make much difference.<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to give this much thought.<br>\r\n\"Heads up, Frisk!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely back on his feet, Frisk's eyes shot wide open. Undyne had just jumped off the floor, and was hurtling straight toward him. He whirled around and tried to scramble up onto the folds of the blanket before him.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground bounced him upward like a rocket as Undyne's weight crashed down just behind him. He sailed through the air, flailing helplessly, and saw Undyne's grinning face looming there for a moment before he fell back down to the bed.<br>\r\nHe landed against the blanket, with an upside-down view of Undyne in front of him. Her breasts were <i><b>huge</b></i> up-close. Maybe it was just the angle, but it almost looked like she'd made them individually bigger than her head.<br>\r\nShe grunted, shifting about in place.<br>\r\n\"Hmm. These are more awkward than I thought...\"<br>\r\nUndyne's eyebrows sprung up as a sudden sound of fabric tearing split the air.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... crap.\"<br>\r\nFrisk slipped back down to the mattress as Undyne pushed herself up on her elbows. She fiddled with her shirt. Frisk could only stare on in shock as the shirt slipped away entirely, having apparently been torn by the stress of containing Undyne's newly enlarged chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shirt gone, Undyne's bare chest was out in the open once again. Her breasts hung there like a pair of blue-tinted air balloons, each marked by a darker blue nipple.<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said slowly, \"It's either change these back once we're done, or replace my entire wardrobe. Gonna have to think on that one.\"<br>\r\nFrisk didn't know whether to respond or not. Moments later, Undyne shrugged. \"Ah well. We've got other stuff to think about right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Frisk's only warning. Undyne dropped back to the bed, her downright frighteningly large breasts landing right before him again. Frisk wanted to get away, but he had no room to run in any direction.<br>\r\n\"In you go, already.\" Undyne said somewhat impatiently. She brought a hand in toward him, giving him a little slap on the back. Frisk staggered forward, and before he could stop, he landed face-first in the gap between the colossal tits before him. He might've managed to push away, had Undyne's fingertip not arrived a second later to tap against his back again, pushing him right into the tight gap.<br>\r\nHe couldn't move his upper body, as it was now quite firmly wedged into place. His legs remained free, but they left the ground behind shortly thereafter, as Undyne stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne couldn't help but crack a wide grin as she poked around at the underside of her chest and located Frisk. His legs were the only part of him still free of the tight crevasse between her enlarged tits. She placed her index finger right between his legs to push him upward and get him properly secured, but she hesitated as she noticed something.<br>\r\nFrisk might've been uncomfortable with what he'd gotten himself into, but Undyne could still feel the stiff little lump between his tiny legs.<br>\r\nShe laughed and shoved her finger against him, ramming his body right up into the gap until he was totally concealed.<br>\r\nBringing her hands around to the sides of her chest, she got a good hold on both of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a long and dizzying battering from the heavy masses of slightly scaly skin consuming Frisk's entire body. Undyne was making no small effort in applying squeezes and caresses to her chest, making sure he felt every last motion.<br>\r\nTo make things worse, there was a throbbing going on between his legs that was getting increasingly hard to contain.</span></div></div>",

Undyne herself had a bit of a blush tinting her cheeks again, but she didn't look finished.<br>\r\nFrisk tumbled down as Undyne dropped him back onto the bed once more. He watched, checking over his body for injuries, as she turned around, presenting her imposingly large ass to him. It loomed there much like her chest had, though she was still wearing her denim shorts, leaving a bit more to Frisk's imagination.<br>\r\nHe caught himself letting a hand drift in the direction of his own crotch. This was <b><i>not</i></b> the time.<br>\r\nUndyne's hand came down to pull her shorts downward, leaving her panties -- coloured dark red, much like her hair -- alone to cover her backside.<br>\r\nFrisk couldn't muster the energy to move as Undyne's ass came down at him.<br>\r\n<i><b>-WHUMP-</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne gave a little sigh, settling on her bed with her shorts looped around her ankles. She slipped a foot free and raised her leg to stretch it upward, enjoying the futile wriggles Frisk was producing from beneath her in reaction. She shifted about, twisting her rear against his little form. This continued for a while until she had another thought, which very quickly demanded attention.<br>\r\nShe slipped her hand in beneath her crotch and located Frisk. Pulling him along, she tugged him free, making sure to press him up against her panties as she went. Already she was starting to feel eager to reintroduce him to what was inside that layer of fabric.<br>\r\n\"That looks kind of painful.\" she remarked once she held Frisk up to get a look at him. His pants were clearly under strain from the tent pressing against his crotch. \"You should really just-...\"<br>\r\nUndyne trailed off. Her phone was buzzing on the bedside table adjacent. She snapped it up and checked the screen.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\nFrisk watched, hanging from Undyne's grip as she answered the phone, putting on a valiant effort to sound casual when moments ago her voice had been low and husky.<br>\r\n\"Heya, Toriel.\"<br>\r\nFrisk snapped to attention. <br>\r\n\"Frisk? Uhh... Yeah, he was here earlier. He, uhh... He wanted to see Alphys, but she's out of town.\"<br>\r\nFrisk could faintly hear a familiar voice on the other end of the phone, but words were hard to make out.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... no, no, I don't think-... Actually, y'know, you're right.\"<br>\r\nMidway through that remark, Undyne's tone had changed quite suddenly. She had a devious look in her eye that Frisk didn't feel especially good about.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you think the kid's missing, I'm up for helping out. Come on by ASAP.\"<br>\r\nUh oh. Frisk might have been glad to know that Toriel was on her way over, but the way Undyne was speaking made him worried. What was she thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel wasted no time in rushing over to the lab where Alphys and Undyne lived. Frisk hadn't come home yet, nor had he sent her so much as a text. He wasn't the sort to do that.<br>\r\nShe arrived, knocking on the door. To her surprise, it swung open on its own, like it hadn't even been properly closed. She stepped inside.<br>\r\n\"Undyne...?\"<br>\r\nShe didn't see her anywhere. Didn't she understand how urgent this was?<br>\r\nBriskly crossing the room toward the doors leading into the \"home\" area of the building, Toriel didn't notice the hum of a machine nearby, its front end pointed toward her general vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Frisk's frantic wriggles of protest, having been tucked into her pocket, Undyne readied the device and hit the large \"FIRE\" button as Toriel was passing by.

It was bad enough that she'd taken his inadvertent shrinking as a chance to turn him into her own little living sex toy, but now she was messing with Toriel? With his <b><i>mother?</i></b><br>\r\nEven if he managed to get out of Undyne's pocket, he'd have no way to get to the ground.

Toriel showed no response. \"To-orielll...?\"<br>\r\nUndyne waved a hand before her face and Toriel finally seemed to snap out of her daze, blinking a few times.<br>\r\n\"Oh... Hello, Undyne.\"<br>\r\nToriel still appeared dazed. Undyne just hoped that the machine had done what she wanted.<br>\r\n\"You look a bit off,\" she said, setting a hand on Toriel's shoulder. \"You wanna sit down?\"<br>\r\n\"... Yes, thanks.\"<br>\r\nUndyne gestured to a wide chair and Toriel sat down. A few seconds passed without either monster saying anything.<br>\r\nToriel was the one to break the silence. She was looking at Undyne with a curious look in her eyes. \"... This might sound a bit... a bit <i>forward,</i> Undyne, but...\"<br>\r\nUndyne grinned. It would've been surprising if Toriel didn't notice the adjustments she'd made to her body's proportions. She crossed her arms, using them to push her breasts upward a bit.<br>\r\n\"You've noticed, huh?\"<br>\r\nImmediately Toriel looked rather embarrassed. \"Sorry,\" she said, looking away, \"That was rude of me.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, can't blame you.\" Undyne replied. \"They're as big a difference to me as to you. I just fixed them up.\"<br>\r\nToriel glanced back with an eyebrow inquisitively raised.<br>\r\nUndyne's grin widened. She pointed off toward the size-altering machine near the double-doors. \"See that big death ray-looking thing? Alphys just finished working on it the other day. It can change the size of anything you can get into the beam.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Toriel inquired, her expression taking on a disparaging look. \"And you decided that the best way to use something like that was on your <i>tits?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Undyne's pocket, Frisk stopped what he was doing. Had he really just heard Mom use the word \"tits\"? <br>\r\nHe wasn't completely oblivious. He knew that Toriel made a habit of speaking much more politely around him specifically. She'd been doing it since they first met. He'd heard plenty of things from her when she thought he wasn't listening that she'd never have said in front of him, but this was still pretty surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne gave a subtle eye-roll. \"No, not <i>just</i> my boobs.\"<br>\r\nShe spun around, jabbing a thumb in the direction of her rear.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she heard Toriel say in surprise.<br>\r\nTruthfully, Undyne was starting to get concerned. Had the other machine worked on Toriel or not? She thought back to when Alphys built it.<br>\r\nIt was supposed to make alterations to a person's sense of judgement. One use was making them more receptive to suggestions they wouldn't normally consider. Alphys had blushed up a storm when Undyne pried into reasons for building such a device.<br>\r\nMaybe she ought to test it more bluntly.<br>\r\n\"Wanna give it a shot yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was a bit taken aback by Undyne's suggestion. How had their conversation gotten here again...? As a matter of fact, she was having some difficulty remembering why she was even in the lab in the first place.<br>\r\n\"... I suppose it's worth a try.\" she said, almost surprised to hear herself going along with this.<br>\r\nBut then, while she was <i>very</i> old as far as monsters went, she hadn't aged <i>physically</i> in quite a long time. What harm was there in a little experiment...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, Undyne was behind the size ray, readying the beam. Toriel was standing opposite.<br>\r\n\"Ready? Just hold still.\" Undyne said, finalizing the settings on the device.<br>\r\n\"Ready.\" Toriel replied.<br>\r\nUndyne adjusted the aim of the device, and fired the beam.</span></div></div>",

He thought his heart might have stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously, Alphys' lab had been in the midst of a forest clearing.<br>\r\nThe forest appeared to be gone. At least, Frisk couldn't see a single tree to speak of around. In nearly every direction, a sheer wall of white stood high into the air, nearly as tall as the entire lab had once been. Strands of fur as thick as great trees sprung out from the towering walls, which had decimated the entire outer structure of the lab, leaving only ruins and the few pieces of furniture and equipment that had been spared.<br>\r\nJust how big had Toriel become...?<br>\r\nFrisk scrambled upward against Undyne's curled fingertips for a better view.<br>\r\nHis mouth dropped open completely.<br>\r\nThose vast walls were just the sides of two of Toriel's <i>toes.</i> She was so impossibly tall that the diminished human in Undyne's grip had no possible idea of how to quantify it. He doubted that any of the tallest buildings over in the city came close to her height now.<br>\r\nToriel's vast toes shifted, and Undyne suddenly clamped her fist shut over him. Frisk shook awkwardly in her grip. She was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne sprinted headlong into the open space beyond Toriel's insanely expanded foot just in time. The gargantuan monster moved her foot, and without intending to, her big toe obliterated all that was left of Alphys' lab. Running over the rubble like the world's most dangerous bulldozer, Toriel's slight twitch completely erased everything that remained there.<br>\r\nUndyne whirled around again to look up in disbelief.<br>\r\nShe'd screwed up big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's eyes were pointed straight at the ground beneath her.<br>\r\nA solid chunk of the forest was gone, flat under her vast footprint. She felt afraid to move even slightly.<br>\r\nWere Undyne and Frisk alright?<br>\r\nLooking up, she could see the city. It looked as if she was substantially taller than any building it had to offer. Even the greatest skyscraper barely looked big enough to come up to near her waist.</span></div></div>",

Toriel was dressed rather casually for the summer weather, and with her chest and rear freshly re-sized, she looked, to put it bluntly, a hell of a lot sexier in record time. It wasn't the kind of adorable hug-me-forever-please look she went for in Alphys, but she could give credit where it was due.<br>\r\n\"Mmh...\" Toriel grunted, sounding a bit uncomfortable. She tried to adjust the shirt she was wearing, which was suddenly a lot tighter. She began to wish she'd taken it off first.<br>\r\nHer bra was under considerable strain now, as well. It wasn't used to being two or three sizes too small.<br>\r\n\"Undyne, could you...\"<br>\r\nUndyne approached, offering help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk didn't have a clue what was going on. Just going by what he could hear, he almost thought that Undyne had actually convinced Toriel to try the size ray on her own body, but that was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<i>... Wasn't it?</i><br>\r\nHe continued to try and escape from the confines of Undyne's pocket, though no more successfully than he'd been so far.<br>\r\nThings weren't looking great for his escape effort until Undyne's strong fingers suddenly reappeared, sliding toward him and lifting him out of the pocket with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne was standing behind Toriel, who had asked her to help with her suddenly much more uncomfortable clothes.<br>\r\nShe took a moment to flash a teasing smile at Frisk, having just quickly slipped him out of her pants pocket. He was probably pretty shocked at what he was seeing right now.<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said, \"Just kinda rest back on my knee.\"<br>\r\nUndyne raised a foot off the floor, holding her knee in the air for Toriel to sit against. Immediately before Toriel did so, Undyne slipped Frisk into place on her leg, right over the knee.<br>\r\nShe could barely contain a satisfied smirk as she felt Frisk's little body being flattened, prone between her knee and Toriel's heavy rear.<br>\r\nGiven how easy it had been to get Toriel to agree to this, Undyne had a good feeling about her receptiveness to a few more ideas of hers. She just had to decide on one thing. Did she want to tell Toriel about Frisk's situation, or keep it a secret?</span></div></div>",

Oh, my-... Somehow, I'd forgotten. You haven't seen him, have you?\"<br>\r\nUndyne liked the sound of this. If the machine <b><i>hadn't</i></b> managed to shift the boundaries of Toriel's thoughts, she definitely wouldn't have forgotten about Frisk for even a second. Toriel was the type to worry herself sick over her adopted child.<br>\r\nUndyne glanced down toward her own leg, where she could still feel Frisk helplessly wriggling in place beneath Toriel's weight. \"So, like I said, Frisk came by earlier. Thing is, he had a bit of an accident with one of Alphys' machines.\"<br>\r\nToriel tried to crane her neck back to look at her. \"He's alright, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n\"Ohh, yeah.\" Undyne said, reassuringly patting her shoulder. \"Frisk's doin' <i>juuuust</i> fine. As for the machine, though, it was the size ray there.\"<br>\r\nToriel looked confused.<br>\r\n\"So, long story short...\" Undyne said, finally managing to tug the strained shirt free of Toriel's upper body and leaving her there in her equally strained bra. She nudged Toriel back to her feet and deftly made to scoop Frisk's prone body off of her own leg. She flinched as she realized that he wasn't there. \"Uhh... Uhh, long story short...\" <br>\r\nShe located Frisk, barely withholding a loud laugh. He was stuck to Toriel's backside, firmly pressed into the fabric of her pants. \"Hold still a second, Tori.\"<br>\r\nShe reached down and pulled Frisk free, eliciting a startled little noise from Toriel. She held him up for Toriel to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel examined the little figure in Undyne's palm for a moment, then clamped a hand to her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n\"... Frisk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk tried to push himself up, but his arms felt heavy. He'd taken a pretty severe beating from Toriel's weight resting on top of him like that. Just laying flat on his back in Undyne's palm, one leg dangling from the edge of her hand, he looked up at Toriel's shocked expression.<br>\r\nWhatever she and Undyne were saying, it just sounded like a slurred mess to his pounding head.<br>\r\nOnce his senses finally started to clear up, Toriel's voice broke in.<br>\r\n\"... -doesn't sound like him at all, Undyne. But, then again... he <i>is</i> a young man now. It's not too hard to imagine.\"<br>\r\n\"I sure wouldn't have imagined it.\" Undyne's voice chimed in from directly overhead. \"But there he was, climbing right up to see me while I'm totally naked. I didn't think you'd raised him to be a perv, honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... What? She couldn't be serious. There was no way Mom would ever fall for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk could only manage to widen his eyes in shock and gently push himself halfway toward a sitting position as Toriel replied, \"You've got a point. I can't just let Frisk go around doing things like that. You said you had an idea for, er... scaring him straight, we'll say?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Undyne said, a familiar -- and right now, unwelcome -- sound of self-satisfaction in her voice. \"Follow me.\"</span></div></div>",

Their words were muffled.<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, Undyne uncurled her fingers again, letting him sit in her palm. Toriel's voice was the first one he heard.<br>\r\n\"... That could work, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd bet you anything it will. Frisk won't even <i>think</i> about bothering a girl without permission.\" Undyne replied.<br>\r\nFrisk took his chance to turn and face Toriel. <br>\r\n\"Mom-!!

Her chest looked almost twice its appropriate size, and despite how uncomfortable the mere thought alone made him, Frisk's eyes were unavoidably drawn to it. When at last he managed to look away from the air balloon-like assets Toriel was now sporting, he found her looking down at him with a familiarly stern frown.<br>\r\n\"So Undyne was right, then, Frisk?\" she asked him sternly. \"Even if it's me, you can't resist?\"<br>\r\nFrisk wanted to speak -- no, <b><i>scream</i></b> -- to the contrary, but Undyne spoke over him. \"It's a serious attitude problem he's got. You want to give it a shot first, Toriel?\"<br>\r\nBefore Frisk could manage an outburst of protest, Toriel raised a hand and closed it over him, lifting him out of Undyne's palm.<br>\r\n\"That does sound best. Could you help me with... this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk bounced against Undyne's mattress as he was dropped from Toriel's grasp. He landed again and tried to regain his bearings.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nHis SAVE still wasn't responding to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked up, another mortifying sight met his eyes. <br>\r\nUndyne was behind Toriel, who had her hands behind her back. Both seemed to be working at something, which was identified a moment later as the large bra covering what little still remained unexposed on Toriel's chest fell away, swinging to the side in Undyne's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's enlarged breasts dropped just a bit, seeming to expand even further as gravity took hold. Near the centre of the two downright frightening mounds of femininity, a pale-coloured nipple marked a patch of thinner fur. Frisk's eyes felt forced open. He watched in disbelief as Toriel raised a foot to climb onto the bed over him.<br>\r\n\"Y'know what...\" Undyne suddenly interjected. Her hand returned, grabbing Frisk by the legs. She dragged him off the bed, turning him over in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Hey-!!\" he managed to shout as Undyne took a firm grip on the leg of his pants. He couldn't stop her as she tugged them right off of him, bringing his shoes and socks with them. Next, she snagged the back of his shirt, but when she found she couldn't just slip it free, she instead tore the fabric apart at the back, splitting it right open and throwing away what remained.<br>\r\nFrisk was left in nothing more than his current set of navy-coloured boxers. Apparently satisfied, Undyne tossed him right back onto the bed, where Toriel was now resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed with a bounce once again, ending up splayed on his back, with Toriel hanging overhead.<br>\r\n\"Mom-... <b><i>MOM-!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\nToriel didn't seem bothered by his protests. She spread her legs backward and began to lower her body toward him. Her staggering breasts swung downward, and for the first time in most of a decade, Frisk feared death.</span></div></div>",

The heaving mammary knocked him off his feet with its sheer bulk, throwing him backward to once again land in a crumpled heap on the sheets.<br>\r\nHis head was pounding. He pushed himself halfway up onto his elbows. Toriel's inverted face, mostly obscured by her hanging breasts, swam into view.<br>\r\n\"... not used to taking up this much room, Frisk.\" she said. \"Just try and bear with me, alright?\"<br>\r\nFrisk, breathing heavily, tried to think of any possible way out of this. To his side, there was only the drop all the way down to the floor. He'd never make it, and even if he did, Undyne or Toriel would stop him.<br>\r\nHe'd waited too long.<br>\r\nToriel shifted, rolling onto her side. Her breasts heaved ominously on impact, and Frisk was too distracted to spot her hand approaching. She grabbed him, and with extreme prejudice, she pushed his body right up against the centre of her lowermost tit.<br>\r\nFrisk coughed, the colossal impact of Toriel's nipple against him knocking the wind out of him. As he struggled to regain control of his breath, Toriel's hand caught him once more. She began to drag him along, running his body over her areola in circles around her nipple. He could feel the sparse hairs here tickling him as they dragged by.<br>\r\nHe'd barely managed to begin comfortably breathing again before he was being moved again, this time directly into the veritable canyon between Toriel's up-sized breasts. The whole world vanished as he was consumed by an entire continent of tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, he could only assume that Toriel was squeezing and kneading at her chest by the way the soft yet crushing walls all around him battered his useless body.<br>\r\nIt definitely wasn't something he'd planned, but in all this \"excitement\", he was sporting a truly painful throbbing between his legs.<br>\r\nThe torturous motion of the walls carried on and on, and once the strain he felt in his boxers became too great to control, Frisk gave a strangled groan right between incredible pleasure and intense discomfort.<br>\r\nThe pressure let off, and in the confinement he remained trapped within, he felt his boxers become horribly damp and sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Toriel's motions didn't stop for a while yet. Eventually, however, Frisk finally felt the crushing weight of her tits release him. He rolled uselessly down as gravity took hold, dropping like dead weight against the sheets of Undyne's bed yet again.<br>\r\nHe vaguely registered two loud voices overhead, but no clear words reached him. Seconds later, he lost consciousness.</span></div></div>",

Most of the time, seeing a familiar face looking over him as he woke up would have been comforting. The fact that it was Undyne's face, and that she still looked to be quite a lot larger than him majorly dulled any positive feelings.<br>\r\n\"Here, don't push yourself.\" Undyne said, bringing a hand over to him. It was only as her fingertips grazed against his skin that Frisk noticed something rather uncomfortable.<br>\r\nHe was naked.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa-!!\" he sputtered, wrenching his sore arms off the ground to cover himself. Above, Undyne laughed at his reaction.<br>\r\n\"I've seen plenty already, Frisk. But if you want...\"<br>\r\nShe reached for something out of sight.<br>\r\n\"... Put these on.\"<br>\r\nFrisk, still making a valiant effort to cover his own nudity, watched as Undyne dropped a very small bundle of fabric in front of him.<br>\r\n\"... You aren't serious.\"<br>\r\nUndyne just laughed again. \"It's those, or you keep going nude, punk. Here, I'll turn around if you're so embarrassed.\"<br>\r\nFrisk waited until she did so before properly examining the fabric she'd left him. As he expected, it was set of very small clothes that he suspected Undyne had borrowed from Alphys' collection of anime collectibles.<br>\r\nHe groaned to himself as he slipped into the somewhat baggy outfit. A Mew Mew Kissy Cutie shirt and alarmingly thin pants covered most of him. There were no socks or shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking <i>goo-ood, </i>Frisk.\" Undyne said with a wide smirk across her face once she'd turned to look at him again. \"You're gonna pull in the ladies like crazy wearing that.\"<br>\r\n\"I hate you.\" Frisk said flatly. \"We're not friends anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww... That sucks.\" Undyne replied. She was reclining in a chair, and now that Frisk looked properly, he could see that he was standing on the little desk against the wall in Undyne's and Alphys' bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Where are <i>my</i> clothes?\" Frisk asked. Undyne looked down again and shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I kinda just... tossed them. Could've landed anywhere, really. 'Cept for your boxers -- I don't think you wanna wear those, though, considering the big stain you left on them.<br>\r\nFrisk suddenly remembered what had been happening before he passed out. He clamped his hands to his forehead, trying to banish the memory.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Toriel went home.\" Undyne went on. \"Said I could hold onto you 'til Alphys gets back.\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I was surprised, too. She really went to town with you once you passed out.\"<br>\r\n\"Stop.\"<br>\r\n\"Like, <b><i>man.</i></b> You complained when I stuffed you up <i>my</i> snatch, but-...\"<br>\r\n\"Dammit, <b><i>stop!</i></b>\" Frisk interrupted, only getting more and more uncomfortable by the second. Undyne laughed once again.<br>\r\n\"Well, bottom line,\" she said, leaning right down to bring her face up-close to him, \"You're gonna be my little toy for a while longer. That's OK, right?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd rather jump off this desk and break every bone I have.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit.\"<br>\r\nUndyne scooped him back off the desk and stood up. On the way up, Frisk noticed that she had apparently restored her chest and rear to their original proportions. Clearly she knew exactly how to operate that size ray, so she was just toying with him now. She yawned.<br>\r\n\"I'm ready for bed again. How 'bout you?\"<br>\r\nShe didn't wait for him to reply. Taking a leap from where she stood, she landed on her bed with a staggering crash that nearly threw Frisk out of her grip. \"One last thing.\" she said, adjusting herself against her pillow.<br>\r\nFrisk didn't want to hear it, whatever it was.<br>\r\n\"Gotta decide where you're gonna sleep.

Up here, Undyne's skin was reasonably smooth and soft. She didn't have many scales around her chest. Her rhythmic breathing made for a relaxing motion, too.<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Good.\" Undyne replied. She didn't give any warning before suddenly sitting upright. Frisk yelped, tumbling downward, past her chest and into the depths of her shirt.<br>\r\n\"Oof-!!\"<br>\r\nHe hit the waistline of her soft pajama pants, but didn't come to a stop until he'd landed right between her thighs.<br>\r\nAbove, Undyne was stretching her arms over and around her head.<br>\r\n\"Mmm...

She scooped him off the mattress and shoved his body up against her crotch. Frisk immediately tried to fight back, but as expected, he had no chance.

This was going to be a very difficult month, and it didn't look like he was getting out of it. If Undyne could use Alphys' machinery to manipulate even Toriel into treating him like a toy, there was little room for hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last the distant shower switched off, Frisk heard Undyne exiting the stall and crossing the room. Her arm appeared, still dripping water, and switched off the tap. Her upper body loomed over a moment later.

His feeble struggles barely noticeable from his prison as he quickly gave up, instead listening to the hum comeing from another room. Glancing around the darkened room of the spider girl didn't help Frisks fear, her decor was borderline Gothic with cobwebs attached to black walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before spiders started to move across the floor, dragging boots and other clothing items out of the room Muffet was in. Frisks struggles resumed as he watched a pair of black laced underwear scoot across the room, dragged by three spiders on their way to the laundry room. A few spiders entered from another door, sloshing around a hot cup of tea, their efforts almost made Frisk forget what was happening as he watched them hoist it onto the dresser. His struggles even stopped until the hum of Muffets theme started to creep in, louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah- thank you my little darlings-!\" Chirped Muffet, entering the room with a swagger, an excited grin plastered to her face. She expertly navigated the room as spiders emerged from the frame work, scuttling towards the exit as she grabbed her tea. Happily taking a sip, Frisk began to hope she had forgotten him as her eyes closed, her arms rested happily on different objects while she enjoyed herself. All hope was lost when she finally opened her eyes again, focusing on the tiny dangling boy before her. <br>\r\n\"Wait- hey! I've never hurt a spider before!\" Frisk cried out as she scuttled closer, a playful twinkle in her grin as she set down the cup on a nearby stool. \"I- bought some spider food once!\" He cried again, Muffet nodded her appreciation before snipping the web that held him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Frisk was in the hands of the spider. One claw scratched at his head affectionately,<br>\r\n\"That it why I am not baking you into a pastry-\" Muffet smiled, slowly bringing Frisk lower. Her smile could only grow as she gently put Frisks screaming face onto her clit, enjoying the vibrations for a moment before roughly jabbing his body inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrashing and calling out, Frisk tried to escape once more before common sense came in, his body stopped moving and he attempted to be as still as possible in the tight cave. Her walls crashed together a few times, squeezing him down for a moment before a voice echoed around his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffets smile had died down into a sadistic smirk as she resisted rolling her eyes at the tiny ones efforts, she elegantly picked up her tea and wandered out towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"You arn't getting out until I cum-\" Muffet spoke outloud, \"You being there isn't really an inconvenience-\" she stopped walking to glance through her stock, deciding on a spider biscuit to dip in her tea. Just as she grabbed one, her whole body froze up as her toys movement continued. She let out a relieved breath, happily scooting towards her room. Her food and drink were quickly drained in her excitement, getting left hastily on the floor before she hopped into bed. She gave a small moan as she wiggled down, a fuzzy smile fluttered onto her face as her hand stroked her well toned body. In her haze, she slid out a few pictures from under her mattruss to gaze at some cute guys while she masterbated. Her fingers flicked her clit as she scanned through her random fashion books until she saw someone that seemed attractive to her. She grinned happily, glad that she had some form of material lying around. With all her spiders friends crawling around she couldn't really leave naughtier books, what if the young ones saw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk didn't have time to understand Muffets moral compass of putting spiders above all else, seeing him as an object to use an abuse. His world constricted and bounced as something deeper inside started to pump out liquid over his body. Even if he wanted to stop moving and wait it out, it was impossible now with the hectic environment, his body simply bounced around before getting squeezed still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the sadistic spiders fingers were nimbly wrapping around his leg. Knowing what this meant, the lone boy could only brace as he was pulled out, then in. The slick sounds of the movements deafened him as his body was covered in a thick slime like substance. Struggling to breath, he thrashed and clawed at whatever he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffet rolled onto her stomach, her ears barely hearing the squishing sound between her legs as she slowly masterbated. Her eyes casually skimmed over the pages as a blush formed on her face, her mind switching to the thought of what was happening to Frisk down there as she quickened the pace. Her perverted grin attempted to hold in her drool as a pair of hands idly supported her rocking head. She slowly turned the page as she quickened the pase again, biting her lip as she came close to the edge. Her fingers clumbsily rammed her toy in and out before her hips bucked. A small squeak of surprise turned into a sigh of pleasure as she instinctively pushed Frisk into her. His final weakening screams rode out her orgasm as she clenched around him, panting happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk's unconcious body slowly slipped out in the second wave of orgasms, he didn't hear Muffet drop her magazine in her fit or see her body automatically bucking another orgasm out over her sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body must of been adapting however, as he soon woke up to Muffets pointed teeth, her tongue slipped out to encompass the beaten prisoner. His body refused to move however as Muffet continued her tongue bath before pulling him away.<br>\r\n\"Oh my! You're awake already?\" The spider exclamed, her voice seemed heavy and a blush was still hovering over her face with a look of bliss. She smiled, giving her toy a terrible bolt of fear as one hand tossed a tissue from the side of the bed. Frisk attempted to say something but the giant girl didn't seem to be in the mood to talk, instead she simply strapped a web around the tiny ones mouth before laying back down on the bed. She petted you almost affectionately as she drifted off to sleep with a perverted grin. \"Make use of this break- because we are definitely doing that again\" She chided, letting her eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to go through that again, Frisk quickly stood up, noticing the string of web going from him and his sleeping 'babysitter'. With a little bit of hope in his heart, he attempted to break the bindings on his mouth and his make shift leash as Muffets breathing got slower and more drawn out.</span></div></div>",

She suddenly felt her toys attempt at biting her, sending a shudder down the girls spine before she jammed her fingers into herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStubbornly, her toy held on- crushed between finger and her inner wall, the tiny being managed to only get his legs caught. A chuckle almost escaped the playful spiders lips as she made sure to push his complaining face into her clitoris.<br>\r\n\"Ah- I should probably get a shower after this-\" She mumbled, feeling her toy grab attempt to fight against her finger tip as she slowly jammed him fully into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small, wet sound- Frisk was gone from the outside world, leaving a fidgety monster girl to her own devices as she tried to hold still- fearful that even the bedsprings would wake up the young spiders around her. With closed eyes, Muffet imagined the struggles down below with an embarrassed face on- her hand and Frisk slowly bringing her to breaking point as the need to cum welled up inside of her. Frisk's gargled cries- his frantic movements, his weak body crammed deep inside of her- all these thoughts began to ram through her head as she dipped her fingers in herself. Her face flashed with embarrassment as she noticed her spider friends waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No... please wait...-!\" Frisk weakly spoke, the spiders nerves at getting caught masturbating like this causing her to quickly dry up. \"I'm... so close-\" Frisk gagged- watching the light disappear as Muffets vagina slowly closed up- sealing him within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a pair of underwear and a loose shirt from her caring spider friends, Muffet instantly decided to forget about her toy for now. Slipping her panties on under the covers and loosely buttoning up her shirt she couldn't help but feel disappointed about forgetting what her erotic dream was about.<br>\r\n\"I think I understand what blue balls are now-\" Muffet sighed, quietly, to herself, thanking the spiders for bringing her slippers as she slipped them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Muffet gently stroked where she thought Frisk was- unsure if she could feel a bump or not as she wandered into the kitchen to make food. <br>\r\n\"What would you like me to make today?\" She chirped, unaware that every movement she made chewed up her little toy- who was struggling to survive in the sticky dungeon he found himself trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small yawn escaped the spider girls mouth as spiders helped clean her giant body. Her caring movements while she cooked ensured they were all safe as they looked after her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to get all the meals done for her friends- she smiled happily as she sat down herself to eat, casually feeling her toy slowly slip out.</span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes slowly and was greeted by two sets of giant breasts hovering over him. Everything came back to him all at once and he started gasping for breath. He had nearly been killed by his mother\u2019s boobs. More embarrassingly, he had also accidentally cummed in his pants. Shuddering as he remembered the experience, the two giants noticed he was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you he just passed out from all the excitement. Little perv was having the time of his life before your massive tits knocked him out.\u201d Undyne told Toriel. They were kneeling on the bed over him, their fun ruined when their sex toy decided to go limp. It had actually been Undyne who had stopped everything as Toriel had gotten so into things she had been ready to stuff her child up her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right, the two of us must have been too much for him,\u201d Toriel sighed before her giant furry hand reached for Frisk. Remembering the last time his mom had handled him, he tried to run, but her fingers were just too fast. Pinching him between her fingers, she lifted him up to her face. Frisk stared at his giant mother, who was looking at him sternly as he squirmed between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been very bad, my child, but I understand. You are a young man and have desires and urges you can not control. Do not fear child, I will help you understand and teach you how to properly respect women. What you did was wrong, but I still love you.\u201d Frisk opened and closed his mouth as he struggled to come up with the words to fix this misunderstanding, but was silenced as Toriel let go of him. He fell quickly, but Undyne\u2019s soft blue palm caught him before he could hit the bed. The fish monster grinned at him, enjoying how everything had turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I got you into trouble, Frisk, but you've gotta learn your place. I know when this is over you\u2019ll understand.\u201d With Toriel\u2019s eyes on her tiny child, Undyne winked at the shrunken boy as she suppressed a snicker. This had turned out better then she had ever planned, not only did Toriel have no problem with Frisk being her sex toy, she seemed just as interested if not more in playing with him. All those years alone must have made her pretty lonely for some physical affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-!\u201d Frisk screamed, the situation spinning even further out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, child. Now, I think it\u2019s time I go.\u201d Toriel said as she rose from the bed, her new chest wobbling around. She was going to keep the alterations to her form, for now at least. She dressed quickly, her clothing barely able to handle her increased ass and breasts. Turning to Frisk and Undyne, she smiled and\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made a noise of slight distaste.<br>\r\n\"You'll need to get cleaned up as well, child.\"<br>\r\nFrisk was wearing perhaps the largest frown he'd ever managed. Was this really his life now? Reduced to a toy for Toriel and Undyne thanks to Alphys and her eccentric scientific works?<br>\r\nHe could only ponder this in silence as Toriel slipped him into a pouch on her purse and slung it over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to their home was uneventful. Frisk tumbled about a little in Toriel's purse as it swung gently on her arm, but not much else to speak of occurred during the wait.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Frisk, but I don't have dinner ready yet. I put it on hold when you didn't come home on time.\"<br>\r\nToriel lifted him back out of her purse as she set it on the dinner table. \"Still, you can get washed up while I prepare it.<br>\r\nFrisk was left on the table as Toriel walked off toward the kitchen sink. She dug through the cabinet above it and retrieved a large bowl. Filling it with warm water from the sink, she brought it back and set it next to him.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and undress. I'll help you in once you're ready.\"<br>\r\n\"... What?\" Frisk asked blankly. Was she serious?<br>\r\nToriel rolled her eyes with a little smile. \"Come on now, Frisk. It's not as if your mother has never seen you in the nude before.\"<br>\r\nFrisk just shook his head slowly, barely believing what he was hearing. Whatever Undyne had done to Toriel to get her to act this way, he wasn't a fan of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really have a choice. Pulling off his clothes, stained as they were with sweat and the large sticky patch he felt no less ashamed of than half an hour ago, he tossed them aside in a pile. Toriel was still watching him, causing an unavoidable blush to overtake his face.<br>\r\n\"Alright, hop on.\" she said, offering her palm. Frisk sighed and accepted.<br>\r\nToriel lifted him into the water bowl. He landed with a light splash. The water was about chest-deep.<br>\r\nHe waited for Toriel to finally leave. She was still looming there over him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Frisk nervously asked. Toriel\u2019s warm, comforting smile was usually reassuring for the human, but right now it made him incredibly uncomfortable. Just continuing to smile, Toriel scooped him out of the water and held him in her big furry palm. Frisk covered his crotch as he laid in her hand, blushing even harder as her face loomed close enough to him that he could feel her hot breath hitting his wet, naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember when you first came to live with me and we used to take baths together. You were so stubborn back then, telling me you were too old to be bathing with your mother, but I insisted -- maybe if I had continued bathing you as you became older then you wouldn\u2019t be peeking on monsters in their bedrooms,\u201d Toriel wistfully sighed.<br>\r\nShe dipped a finger into the water, her fur soaking it up like a sponge and lifted her finger to the shrunken boy. Frisk flinched as her finger approached, unprepared as she started scrubbing his face with her giant digit. Toriel was surprisingly gentle with him, just applying enough pressure to properly clean his filthy skin. All the sweat, sexual discharge, and other filth came off easily as she washed her child. Frisk relaxed a little, even as a finger that could easily crush him slid off his head and started scrubbing his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom about that, it was an accident, I swear. I wasn\u2019t trying to see Undyne naked. She\u2019s my friend -- <i>was</i> my friend -- I don\u2019t know right now after what she did to me,\u201d Frisk meekly explained, still hurt over being used as a sex toy by the fish monster. At least Toriel was treating him right, maybe things wouldn\u2019t be so bad now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to lie, child. I understand why you did what you did and forgive you. You are my child and I will always love you,\u201d Toriel told him as her finger moved to his chest, washing there before moving down to his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d Frisk got out before the finger dipped down further and Toriel was pressing her pressing the tip of her finger against his groin. She started sliding her finger up and down carefully, stroking the tiny cock with the utmost precision and care. Her soft, wet fur felt incredible on the young man\u2019s boyhood, quickly getting it to full hardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have been so full of lust, unable to control yourself. I blame myself for not noticing sooner. I\u2019m going to help you now my child, in the only way I know how,\u201d Toriel sweetly said as her finger moved faster, pressing down just a little bit more to stimulate the young man\u2019s aching cock. Frisk gasped and moaned, his hands grabbing the giant finger to push it away. He grabbed on as hard as he could, but Toriel\u2019s finger wouldn\u2019t budge. She pushed him down on his back, trapping him between her palm and molesting finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop,\u201d Frisk squeaked, his face going bight red as the finger rape continued. This was just like her breasts all over again, unwanted pleasure from the monster he considered a mother. Gasping loudly, Frisk tried to resist the urge but failed as he shot his load onto Toriel\u2019s finger. The goat monster stopped immediately, her finger pulling away with his seed dripping down the tip. As Frisk curled himself up into a ball of shame, Toriel brought to cum stained finger to her mouth and licked off the meagre offering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever fear, child -- I will help you,\u201d Toriel said, the warm smile on her face ruined by the redness in her cheeks. She had enjoyed that far more then she let on, her heavy chest heaving in excitement as she stared down at Frisk with less than motherly thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was <b><i>not</i></b> feeling good about Toriel's expression, nor her words.<br>\r\nHis adoptive mother loomed over him for a few seconds more, and finally, she took in a heavy breath, her imposing chest seeming to momentarily expand in his view as she let it out again. Her shirt was still straining to hold in her new body.<br>\r\nA red tint still lit her face as she said, \"But that can wait. You must be feeling hungry by now.\"<br>\r\nHer hand lowered to the tabletop, placing Frisk back down on the varnished wood surface. She produced a small towel from somewhere Frisk couldn't see and held it between her hands for a moment. A pale red light began to glow from her closed palms. Fire magic, Frisk could immediately recognize.<br>\r\nWhen Toriel set the hand towel down for him to use, Frisk found it to be warm, as if it had been lying in the sun for hours. It was the first real comfort he'd felt in quite some time.<br>\r\nToriel, meanwhile, turned back to return to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk dried himself off, feeling a looming dread in his soul. Toriel wasn't seeming much like the mother he knew anymore. What had Undyne done to her?<br>\r\nHe felt drained as well, in the aftermath of what could only be described as his recent sexual overload.<br>\r\nHe approached his pile of clothes, but hesitated a step before them. His pants -- and <b><i>boxers</i></b> -- were still totally soiled. What was he going to wear?<br>\r\nHe looked over at Toriel. She was still facing away. Frisk shuddered as his eyes were inevitably drawn to her disproportionately-sized rear.<br>\r\nHe didn't really want to draw her back over on account of what she'd just done, but he wanted even less to just stay naked.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom...?\"<br>\r\nToriel's ears twitched. She turned to look over her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Yes...? Oh.\"<br>\r\nShe appeared to have noticed his issue. \"I suppose you need something to wear?\"<br>\r\nHer pulled her phone from her pocket and dialed a number quickly. \"... Yes, hello, Undyne. This is Toriel again... Yes, Frisk is handling things just fine. He needs some fresh clothes.\"<br>\r\nFrisk wondered how Undyne could possibly help with this.<br>\r\n\"... Yes, thank you, that would be fantastic. Alright, see you, Undyne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stowed her phone away.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, child. Undyne will bring something over for you. For now, dinner is ready.\"<br>\r\nFrisk just waited as she brought over another large bowl. \"I've tried to keep the temperature down to make it safe for you. Be careful when you bite into it, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a single spoon on the tabletop. It contained what looked to be a pie of some sort. Was it snails...? He hadn't expected to, but Frisk had become quite a fan of Toriel's snail pies over the years.<br>\r\nHe felt uncomfortable eating while nude, but he didn't have any other good options. He tentatively started on his meal. Fortunately, this being monster food, it was easy enough to eat even at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short while before Undyne's familiarly aggressive knock sounded at the door. Toriel walked off to answer. Frisk heard their voices, but couldn't see them from here.<br>\r\nSoon, footsteps were returning. Toriel entered the room and stepped over to Frisk. She opened her closed hand to reveal something. The human's heart sank instantly.<br>\r\nThis must've been something of Undyne's. A set of clothes that looked like they'd be tough to fit on, all branded with the same logo.<br>\r\nThe pale blue of the various articles of clothing might've looked nice, were it not ruined by the garish colours of the Mew Mew Kissy Cutie logo.<br>\r\n\"Here you are,\" Toriel said, \"You may as well get dressed. I have a few more sets for you for later on.\"<br>\r\nShe dropped him the change of clothes. Frisk groaned and slipped into them. Indeed, they were a loose fit. Undyne must've used the size ray to shrink them down for him. Even then, her lanky frame was a bit different from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel began to clear away the dishes on the table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was still holding out a small shred of hope that Undyne would sort out this misunderstanding and explain he was no pervert to his mom. He knew that was very unlikely considering how the fish monster loved to mess with him and was so ruthless in treating him like a sex toy, but he still had to hope her better nature would shine through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly that she believed that you didn\u2019t need any clothing. She told me that she thought having you run around naked would be quite funny and easier to clean when you get dirty.\u201d Frisk grunted in annoyance, he knew exactly what Undyne meant about getting him dirty; it involved stuffing him into places no young man should be stuffed into. Grumbling about mean monsters, Frisk never saw his mother pluck him up from the table until he was dangling from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you <i>warn</i> me before you pick me up?\u201d Frisk cried out as he found himself hanging high above the ground. Toriel just smiled at him, not responding to his request with words. Dropping him on her palm, she walked into the living room and sat down in her favourite chair. Tilting her palm, she let Frisk slide off her hand. The boy scrambled to avoid falling, but ultimately tumbled off the edge of her palm and landed on Toriel\u2019s lap. Standing on her thigh, he blushed at being so close again to his mom and then looked up, immediately regretting that decision. Her massive chest hung over him, straining her shirt out as it tried to contain the enlarged endowments. He could barely see Toriel\u2019s face with her breasts blocking his sight. He stepped further back and was able to see Toriel\u2019s face. She met his eyes having noticed where he was staring the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like my chest, Frisk?\u201d Toriel asked not exactly angry, just warily as she studied the shrunken boy on her lap. Frisk shook his head as fast as he could, all he wanted was to see his mom\u2019s face, not her huge chest. As the two stared at each other, the silence was broken by a small chuckle from Toriel. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you may look at my body however you like. I know I\u2019m not your blood mother and you are a young man. You may gaze at me as much as you wish, but if you want to touch me you must ask.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to touch you,\u201d Frisk defiantly blurted out. Sure, there was no doubt that his mom\u2019s giant chest and butt looked sexy, but he still saw her as the sweet mother he grew up with and even thinking about her sexually felt wrong. Not to mention, she was even more terrifying than sexy at his current size. She could easily crush him under those huge udders hanging over him. He was utterly helpless, Toriel could do anything to him. It all made him kind of scared of his goat mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy child,\u201d Toriel sighed sadly. She reached for Frisk, lifting him up from her lap and carrying him up. Only she didn\u2019t bring him to her face, she levelled her hand just before her bosom. \u201cWhy must you lie to me? Every time I hear you deny your feelings I grow upset and saddened that you don\u2019t trust me enough to tell me the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it's<i> true</i>!\u201d Frish practically screamed. He had to convince his mother before she got handsy with him again -- or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Toriel rarely raised her voice, but when she did, Frisk listened. Quivering slightly as she looked crossly at him, a few seconds passed before Toriel\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cIf you are going to keep up this lie then perhaps I must do something. Maybe once you have fully experienced what your lust causes you will learn to behave and not lie to your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk didn\u2019t like the sound of that, it sounded like Toriel was going to punish him for what she perceived was lying. Unable to even imagine what the goat monster would do, Frisk spoke up.</span></div></div>",

What would that do to convince her any more than his last try?<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry, Mom.\" he said, hoping it sounded sincere. He was in no mood to risk becoming the object of Toriel's sudden onset of lust again, and trying to get through to her with the truth just felt like an effective way to jump right back onto that path. \"Really, I am. I...\"<br>\r\nHe paused to think this through. If he played this right, he could probably save himself a lot of discomfort later on. Toriel wasn't acting much like the mother he knew, but could he still appeal to that part of her, if he really tried?<br>\r\n\"Thing is, I...

That seemed like the best step for his act.<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Toriel continued. Frisk flinched. \"This doesn't explain your behaviour around me since I picked you up at the lab.\"<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Frisk muttered under his breath, still not looking up.<br>\r\n\"Is this...\" Toriel sounded thoughtful. \"Trying to stay so close to me, or to Undyne... Are you... just seeking comfort?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes-!!\" Frisk stammered. He didn't want to miss this out.<br>\r\nHe heard Toriel give a little exhale.<br>\r\n\"... Perhaps I was hasty, young one.\" she said slowly. Frisk looked up again. \"I suppose I can see why Undyne would suspect that you were doing this entirely out of an inability to control your own hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk waited for her to continue. Toriel was quiet for a moment, but suddenly, he felt her hand move beneath him. He stumbled back, landing against her palm as she moved him in toward her body. The motion was probably intended to be a hug, but given Frisk's diminished size, it felt more like Toriel was just trying to squeeze him into her chest.<br>\r\nHe clung nervously to her fur as he hung over her exposed cleavage. He wasn't up for falling back into that canyon.</span></div></div>",

He landed in the middle of her cleavage, the jiggly mass wobbling upon his landing. Gripping the top of her massive breast, he tried to pull himself up before he fell into her cleavage. Sadly, Toriel had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry child, you\u2019ll be safe and warm in my bosom,\u201d Toriel said lovingly as she brought one finger down and pressed on the top of Frisk\u2019s head. There was no contest as she shoved the boy between her breasts where she believed he would feel the most comfortable. Her child was seeking comfort, so she would give it to him and more. She was determined to give him as much love and attention as possible. Where could he find more love then right beside her heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Frisk groaned as he felt the walls of furry, soft flesh squeeze around him. It was so dark and hot, he could feel himself starting to sweat. All around him, Toriel\u2019s breasts crushed his puny body, the smell of her own sweat and body wash filling his nostrils. At least she wasn\u2019t using him to get off as before, but it was still stifling and uncomfortable. He wondered how long he was going to be trapped here, and as the minutes ticked by, he realized that this wasn\u2019t going to end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel placed her hand on her chest and closed her eyes, feeling the tiny bulge trapped between her breasts. It felt right having Frisk there, so close hat no one could see much less hurt him. Her cheeks went red as other places her tiny child could be raced through her mind. To distract herself from those ideas, she picked up a book and started reading. Her mind was never far from Frisk even as she read; her young man was co cute and relied so much on her. She would be a good mother to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by as she read and thought about the future with her child. She made plans to care for him and make sure he was always happy. She would feel him moving between her breasts, his tiny form unable to push the massive udders aside so he could do much more than wiggle. It felt nice and she wondered if he was enjoying himself in her cleavage. She finally gave up on reading as thoughts about what he might feel like in the front of her panties or even the back invaded her head and wouldn't stop. Feeling warm, she rose from her chair and headed towards her room. It was getting late; it was time for shrunken boys to be getting to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk thought he might pass out. It had grown hotter inside Toriel's cleavage; all that fur really turned the tiny crevice into an oven. He tried to worm his way out, but he couldn\u2019t move. He tried to scream for help, but his voice never left his cramped prison. After a while, he just accepted that he was stuck here until Toriel was done \"comforting\" him. He snorted in disdain as he remembered his lie; he should have just stuck to the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everything started shaking with Toriel\u2019s steps, Frisk felt a burst of hope. She was probably heading to bed; no way was she going to leave him in her cleavage all night. As Toriel stopped and he was pulled out, he had no idea what awaited him next at his mom\u2019s caring hands and other bits. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frisk could hear his mother moaning in pleasure from his hands pushing and rubbing all over her left foot. \"Mmm, next one, my child.\" Toriel said, her voice almost seductive. Frisk's hands were already covered in dirt and sweat from Toriel's foot. He sighed as he moved on to the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process went on for about five minutes before Toriel spoke at last for the tired child.<br>\r\n\"Now, lick them, won't you?\" <br>\r\nFrisk now wanted to beg, but again, he hoped to avoid whatever punishment Toriel might have for disobedience. Shuddering, he placed his tongue onto the sole of his mother's right foot, gathering its salty sweat instantly. \"Now the toes, my child.\" Frisk grudgingly put his tongue in between her toes, the grime only increasing as he moved on. He did this for a few minutes until he heard his mother finally fall asleep.<br>\r\nExhausted as well as disgusted, Frisk then decided to...</span></div></div>",

It appears it is the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her question was not answered, Frisk nodded their head towards Toriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is wonderful, my child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheerful attitude was getting a bit strange for Frisk, it mostly was due to the fact that Frisk was still wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you seem confused, my child. Allow me to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to kneel close to Frisk, her breath reaching up to Frisk's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when I told you I would help you mature?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk nodded, while starting to shake a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've decided we would do multiple procedures to help progress that. Do you follow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk was again confused, but chose to still nod their head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! We will do them at different times of the day, starting right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk looked around in fear, while Toriel chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my child! How silly you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped looming over the young boy while placing her hands on her hips, gently grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to strip of all clothing, my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk still tried to process what was going on, now more scared due to her request, or demand mainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My child, I said strip of your clothing, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice sounded gentle, but turning more strict. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk slowly obliged, taking all of his clothing off, much to Toriel's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good child. Now, lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk, with a chill down their spine, laid carefully onto the tabletop, while being aware that Toriel is holding an object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? This will simply help in our time together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk noticed it was tape. He then, afraid, questioned his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my sweet child! Remember our bath together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to wiggle her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tape, bath, finger, no clothes, it was all coming along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk wanted to scream, beg, and even run away from his own mother, but what was escape worth now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel sang these words while taping Frisk's arms and legs to the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My child, I have never told you before, but it looks so adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger directed at Frisk's manhood, while grinning sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer right hand, with it's furry index finger, went towards Frisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger gently laid on top of Frisk's penis, while the young child started to moan, while his motherly figure started to hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked it with such a gentle touch, causing Frisk to breathe harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger then made it move with her, it was now becoming rock hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, dear, child. Such a wonder you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger moved it quicker, but swift and soft, Frisk was now on the edge of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel laughed those words as the sticky substance poured onto the fur of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such beauty humans have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she took off the tape holding Frisk's arms and legs, the same finger then patted and ruffled Frisk's head.

Carefully managing every crook and space on her foot, even between her toes. This continued off up to the next foot, receiving the same treatment, while Toriel sounded more and more relaxed.

She was hurting her own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk, my child! I...I didn't know I was doing too much to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel started to shed tears herself as she placed her hands onto her burning eyes. Frisk stopped weeping and found his mother, who used him for her own temptations. Instead of hate and anger, he felt sad for seeing her this way. So he walked up close to her left foot, and gave it a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel gasped as she picked up the young boy in between her two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk nodded their head and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mom, I'll love you always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly pulled into a hug, as Toriel dropped tears of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much, my child!

He was actually pretty sure what Toriel had just said, and even if he didn't understand, he was positive he didn't approve. No matter what it was. However, he did want to know what exactly it was she had said. He was interested in<i> how</i> she had said it, was all. He wanted to know what he was in for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, would you stay in bed with me?\" Toriel repeated, with somewhat less tact than before. She fidgeted awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk tried to stand up on the mattress, but failed, falling backwards due to the dip Toriel was making with her weight. Escape was improbable. <br>\r\n\"Do I get a choice?\" Frisk asked tentatively, testing the waters. The waters, however, pulled him under anyway. <br>\r\n\"Well, not really, I suppose.\" Toriel rolled over, stomach barely missing his body as the slope which prevented Frisk's rise got steeper, and he started slowly to slide toward the fuzzy abdomen. <br>\r\nHe gave a meek attempt at \"scrambling\", faintly detecting at this point that he knew how these things would go. His little body rolled under, lodging right beneath Toriel at the waist line. She was quite limber, so as she lay as straight as she did, Frisk could feel a little bit of her pelvis pressing down on him. It felt incredibly strange and violating to have such a small detail be so completely heavy and weighing down on him. He wouldn't call Toriel \"fat\" by any stretch of the imagination, he just always thought she was chubbier than this. He tried to squirm out from the painful and most certainly unyielding force of the bone. Naturally, he didn't succeed, so instead he just pounded against it to get Toriel's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis success was a pyrrhic one, however, as Toriel's mitt came down as though from on high to push him further under her. The friction started to agitate him as the finger he was being pushed by, the smooth mattress, and Toriel's furry weight all rubbed past. It was so awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the fingers stopped, and slipped out from below. Frisk tried to get his bearings while pressed down by all of this goat. He barely managed to push himself up using just his arms before being forced back down. So, wherever he was was squishy, he thought. He could smell the unfortunately familiar scent of femininity nearby, but he was starkly dry. From all this, he surmised, he must be right above her crotch, somewhere just past the mound of Venus. He couldn't say he really liked that, but it seemed to be accurate. He heard Toriel's voice. <br>\r\n\"Good night, my child...\" she murmured gently. \"Try not to move too much and wake me down there.\" With that, her breathing slowed. Frisk grunted again, trying to force off all of this mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that wasn't happening. He could barely breathe under all of this. He was out of here. Where does he try to escape to?</span></div></div>",

Toriel did not look pleased as she held him in front of her face. She wasn\u2019t seething mad, but she was looking at him with a lot of disappointment and annoyance. She believed that he was still lying to her and that hurt the monster more than Frisk could even be aware of. Her expression softened slightly, but she retained a look of resolve that scared the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more lying, Frisk. I was hoping we could do this as adults, that you would let me help you, but it\u2019s obvious that I cannot be soft about this issue. Whatever happens next, remember I gave you every opportunity to tell me the truth.\u201d Her grip loosened, but Frisk didn\u2019t say anything; he just took a second to breathe again. He looked pleadingly into Toriel\u2019s eyes, trying to convince her to calm down, but she was having none of that. Without giving him a second glance, she wrapped her other hand around him and got up. Surrounded by her furry fingers, Frisk felt the vibrations of her footsteps as she stomped her way out of the living room. Frisk doubted she was going back to the kitchen to start on dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid trapped in her fist, Frisk wondered what he was going to say to fix this. He had once convinced murderous monsters to be his friends, so it couldn\u2019t be that hard to convince his mom to lighten up. Then he remembered how angry she looked and he started having his doubts. Maybe he should have stayed with Undyne; at least she wasn\u2019t seriously pissed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dropped without any care and concern, falling fast on the soft, open bed of his mother. Getting to his knees, he stared up at the fuming goat monster as she gave him the stink eye. \u201cI was hoping things would go nicely. I\u2019d help you like I did during your bath and you might return the favor.\u201d Frisk\u2019s eyes widened at that, not interested at all in helping his mom in that way. It was bad enough that she molested him with her giant finger; if she expected that he would want to do the same to her, she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut now I\u2019m not going to be gentle with you, no more Mrs. Nice Mom, we are going to do this my way and if you have any complaints then you can keep them to yourself. Undyne was right, you need some hard lessons in being with a woman.\u201d With that, Toriel grabbed the bottom of her shirt and started lifting it off. She struggled to pull it over her enlarged chest, the breasts dragging up with her shirt until they popped free. As they bounced around, Frisk covered his eyes and begged for mercy under his breath. He wasn\u2019t going to say anything to Toriel, not now when she was steaming mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first lesson is that you need to put a woman\u2019s needs before your own.\u201d Toriel punctuated that statement by pulling her pants down, her naked body becoming completely exposed. Frisk pulled his hands away and stared at the towering, nude giantess with absolute terror. It seemed that honesty was not the best policy when it came to giant goat moms. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walls were covered in various posters -- most advertising at least one of Mettaton's shows from his ever-expanding arsenal -- and photos, nearly all of which were of Frisk and the countless monsters he'd befriended. \"I love the decor, Frisk.\" she said. With one hand, she extracted him from her cleavage. He took a very firm grip on one of her fingers, apparently glad to be free of the fleshy canyon.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... your bed looks <i>kinda</i> small-ish, but...\" Undyne tapped a thumb against her chin in thought for a moment. \"Ahh, what the hell -- it'll do.\"<br>\r\nSpinning on one foot and dropping backward, Undyne landed on Frisk's unmade bed.

She felt a twinge of disappointment, immediately missing the feeling of his little hands and feet on her tit.<br>\r\n\"Wait, that's it? I'm... I'm done?\" he asked her as he dangled from between her fingers. It almost felt plain cruel to disappoint the hopeful look on his face.<br>\r\n\"You're done with my <i>nipple</i>.\" she corrected him. Frisk's expression changed instantly. \"I'm just changing things up. Now, hold on...\" She shifted upright, feeling the room's cool air tickling her stiff nipples as she went. She sat and extended one leg. Her hand carrying Frisk hovered near to her ankle. \"Frisk, I've seen a lot of stuff on Alphys' computers. <i>Weird</i> stuff.

Soon she had him pinned between her soles, applying pressure here or there to manipulate his puny frame as she desired. \"Y'know,\" she added once Frisk was totally unable to fight back against her, \"Maybe 'friend' isn't the right word.

There was a fine layer of sweat and something else he couldn't identify all over Undyne's soles, and as a result, it was all over him as well. The monster went on squeezing at and toying with his body, dragging him all over her foot without giving him an inch of freedom. He actually missed the relative peace of teasing her nipple.<br>\r\nHe flinched when Undyne rocked her foot forward and he felt his back strike the blanket below, free of the other foot. He wound up with his head and arms poking out from between the second- and third-largest toes on Undyne's foot.<br>\r\nHer face loomed into view above.<br>\r\n\"I think you're getting it.\" she said. \"I just need you to do one thing, like a test. You pass if you get it just right.\"<br>\r\nFrisk coughed. \"... And what's the test...?\" he asked in a defeated tone.<br>\r\nUndyne grinned. \"Just give one of those toes the biggest damn hug you can. You're like the master of hugs, so give my toe a great big hug and tell me how much you <i>love</i> it.\"<br>\r\nFrisk groaned softly. Undyne was just humiliating him now. She was going to love hearing this. <br>\r\nLacking any other options, he raised his tired arms and took a solid grip on the heavy toe to his immediate right. Undyne's pale blue skin wasn't scaly down here, at least. The soft mound that was her toe was easy enough to hold onto.<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to speak, but his breath came out in a sigh. This was going to be the most humiliating thing he'd ever done.<br>\r\n\"... You've got... really great toes, Undyne. The best, maybe.\" he said, resignation on full display in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Undyne cooed, \"That's nice of you to say.\" She leaned in close. <i>\"Now say it louder.\"</i><br>\r\nIn that moment, her voice had taken on just a hint of a growl. Frisk knew not to mess with her. He took in a breath, the slightly stale odour of the area jabbing at his sinuses.<br>\r\nUndyne's smirk became a wide and satisfied grin when he shouted his praises for her toe once more.</span></div></div>",

Frisk groaned under his breath, dangling in the air once more. Undyne was sitting up, rolling her legs off the bed. \"I know Tori and I were pretty rough on ya to start, but you're doing great!\"<br>\r\nFrisk, despite how effortlessly Undyne could force him into demeaning situations like this, managed to glare tiredly at her.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Undyne mumbled, looking thoughtful as she dangled the diminished human before her face. \"Hey, you wanna go for a ride with me?\"<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Frisk inquired. \"What d'you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I figure you'll get bored here.\" Undyne replied. \"You're so tiny, there's not much you can do without someone like me around to keep things interesting. If ya come with me, we can have some more fun. I promise I'll bring ya back, so Tori doesn't get too worried.\"<br>\r\n\"If it's all the same to you, Undyne, no thanks.\" Frisk said. \"I've had enough of you for today.\"<br>\r\nUndyne struck a pout, making Frisk react in surprise. An actual <i>pout</i> was not a common expression for her.<br>\r\n\"Sorry you feel that way.\" she said. Her expression became a nasty grin uncomfortably quickly. \"Since we're gonna do it anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"H-hey, wait-!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne ignored his protest completely, leaning toward the floor. She grabbed one of her boots with her free hand.<br>\r\n\"U-Undyne-!!\" Frisk shouted, swinging in her grip as she moved, her motions way more violent for him than they were for her.<br>\r\n\"Here's your seat, Frisk.\" she said with a glance at him.<br>\r\nFrisk expected to be shoved into her cleavage again, but to his surprise, she moved him away from her chest. He dared to be hopeful for just a second, but Undyne destroyed his hopes in short order. She was lowering him toward the boot in her other hand.<br>\r\n\"No, <i>no no <b>no-!!\"</b></i> he shouted, but his protests had as little an effect as before. Undyne's fingertips simply brought him toward the dark interior of her boot, and then she dropped him. He screamed, tumbling straight down.<br>\r\n<i>\"Oof-!!\"</i><br>\r\nHe landed less painfully than expected, but it was still far from comfortable. It was pretty dark in here. The air was damp and made his skin feel clammy.<br>\r\nThen, of course, there was the <i>smell.</i> Frisk coughed upon taking in his first breath. Stale air with a distinct scent of sweat filled his lungs.<br>\r\nHe gagged, trying to shout further protests at the monster high above. Frisk rolled onto his back just in time for things to get worse.<br>\r\nUndyne was lowering her bare foot into the boot with him.<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking? He was as good as dead if she starting walking around with him trapped in her boot!<br>\r\nAt the last second, the gigantic foot descending into his prison froze.<br>\r\nHe heard a voice from above, partly muffled.<br>\r\n\"Oh, almost forgot! Just so you don't get bored in there, I want you to do me a favour. You probably won't be able to move around much, but try getting your tongue onto my foot, OK? Just, y'know... kinda try and clean some of the sweat off, if you can.\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-what-...!!?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I really want ya to do your best, OK? Treat it like a cooking lesson! If you start slacking, I'll notice, and trust me -- you're not gonna like what happens after that.\"<br>\r\n(But I <i>already</i> don't like anything about this...!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, Undyne brought her foot into her boot entirely. Frisk was sealed into complete darkness, a massive weight pressing down on his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Undyne said, tugging her boot on tight. She slipped the other on, as well. She could feel a puny little lump under her sole as soon as she planted her foot on the floor. Truth be told, she couldn't really tell if Frisk was doing what she wanted. Still, messing with his head was pretty fun.<br>\r\nShe got up, stretching her arms and legs a bit. Time for a walk.<br>\r\n... Or maybe a run.<br>\r\nShe headed back down the stairs. Toriel was still at the counter, washing dishes. <br>\r\n\"I'll see ya tomorrow, Tori!\" Undyne said as she passed through the room.<br>\r\n\"Oh-... Goodbye then, Undyne.\" Toriel said, smiling over her shoulder. \"Is Frisk still upstairs?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Undyne lied, twisting the foot the human was trapped under in its boot as she did so. \"He's pretty worn out, so I decided to let him sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Toriel replied. \"Come around again tomorrow, won't you? You've been a big help with controlling Frisk's... urges.\"<br>\r\n\"No prob!\" Undyne said as she reached the door. \"The little twerp needs a lot more work, so I'll see ya then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk idly wondered whether or not hell would actually be any worse than this.<br>\r\nUndyne's weight on his helpless body was immense For the first few steps, he'd felt certain that she'd crush him into a stain in her boot, but somehow,  his body was holding out.<br>\r\n... Not that that was much comfort. He'd tried to do what she ordered of him, but the stale flavour of her sweat against his tongue made him want to vomit, and he was in no mood to share the cramped space between her foot and boot with the contents of his stomach.<br>\r\nHopefully she wouldn't notice the difference.</span></div></div>",

Frisk barely had time to stand up before Undyne was bringing her hand down to brush a fingertip teasingly over his head. He grunted in discomfort as she managed to push down hard enough to buckle his knees and force his face directly into the gap between two of her toes. He was already feeling quite uncomfortably coated in a thin layer of her sweat, and this was no help. He gagged when he inadvertently managed to take in a mouthful of sweat, and he pushed back against her skin to back away, coughing and spitting to clear the awful taste from his tongue.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, sorry about that.\" Undyne said from above. She didn't really sound convincing.<br>\r\nFrisk stood back up, still shuddering. He couldn't completely dispel the stale flavour of her sweat, which seemed to stick all throughout his mouth.<br>\r\nSo, what were the chances she'd finally give him a break...?<br>\r\nTo his dismay, Undyne suddenly looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n\"Hey -- new idea, shrimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo fingertips grabbed a firm grip over his shoulders before he had any chance to move. Undyne just held him in the air, limbs dangling, as she repositioned herself. Sprawling across his bed, she stretched her arms, causing him no shortage of panic as he swung dangerously in the air in her grip.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she said once she'd settled down again, \"You can go back down here.\"<br>\r\nSetting Frisk on the blanket between her bare feet, she threw her arms back behind her head to rest on the pillow. \"So, you just gave me an idea.\"<br>\r\nFrisk raised an eyebrow. What could she be talking about? Nothing <i>good,</i> he imagined. He jumped back as Undyne's right foot suddenly rocked downward, coming to rest sideways in front of him.<br>\r\n\"I'll make this simple to understand.\" Undyne began, wriggling her foot just a bit. \"You get in there and start licking my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what-!?\" Frisk stammered, recoiling in place.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you heard me right.\" Undyne said, lifting her head to look down at him. \"It's gonna be a big job, so you'll wanna get to it ASAP.\"<br>\r\n\"But-...\" Frisk mumbled, his gaze flicking between Undyne's far-off face and her imposing foot resting before him. Her two largest toes wriggled impatiently.<br>\r\nThere was no way out of this, was there?<br>\r\nFrisk steeled himself. Undyne wasn't about to let him pass on this one, but how could she possibly expect something like this of him? Sure, Undyne was always rough around the edges, but she was just being plain cruel to him now.<br>\r\nHe shuddered, looking over the sole of the foot sitting before him on the bed. Stepping forward, he placed a palm flat to Undyne's rough skin. He could instantly feel the sweat worked into it on contact. Since she wasn't beginning to laugh and moving her foot away, he could only conclude that she really was going to sit here and watch him do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned. (OK, Frisk. You've literally died before. A lot of times. You can handle this, no matter how gross it is.)<br>\r\nHe regretted going along with Undyne's request the moment he pressed his tongue to her skin. Goosebumps developed all over his skin instantly as he shuddered in reaction to the stale flavour against his tongue. Unable to stand it, he pushed back. He felt like gagging again.<br>\r\nDying was actually starting to sound preferable again. Although, if he still couldn't get his SAVE to work for one reason or another...<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath and letting it back out in one drawn-out go, he leaned back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, there ya go...\" Undyne sighed, closing her eye and nestling comfortably into the soft pillow at her back. Frisk was hesitant as hell, but it felt like he was finally giving in. A tiny little tickle of warm could be felt against her sole, dragging from one place to another.<br>\r\n\"Now, really give it your all! Pour all your passion into it, like in our cooking lessons!\"<br>\r\nShe was going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next ten or so minutes, Undyne simply relaxed against Frisk's bed, moving only to shift her foot around so the diminished little human on the blanket could reach her entire sole. He was getting pretty good at this, too. She smiled.<br>\r\n\"OK, Frisk.\" she said after a while. \"Nice work down there.\"<br>\r\nShe pushed herself up on an elbow to reach down and pluck him back up from the mattress. Examining her foot, she grinned at him. \"Damn. Looks like you actually got the whole thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk shuddered, crumpling to his side in Undyne's open palm. He felt like vomiting. Actually, he was surprised that he hadn't already been sick at any point. He'd almost certainly consumed so much of Undyne's sweat that it easily rivalled the amount of water he would drink in an entire day normally.<br>\r\n\"So,\" the monster said, looking him over, \"I know you probably want a break, but I've got a better deal for ya. You're halfway done, so how 'bout you just pound out the other half of the work now, and then you can take a rest with me after?\"<br>\r\nFrisk blanched. Halfway done? What did she mean by that?<br>\r\n\"W-wait, no-...\"<br>\r\n\"Ya got this foot looking better than it has in a long time, but we can't forget about the other one.\" Undyne cut him off, confirming his sudden fear. She was going to make him repeat the last ten minutes of suffering with her other foot, too. He sunk into her palm, face-down.<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't feel so down.\" she said. \"You're doing a fantastic job. I'm really impressed!\"<br>\r\nFrisk barely made an effort to move when Undyne dropped him back on the bed, in front of her other foot now.<br>\r\n\"So, go to it!\" she encouraged him, gently tapping a fingertip against his back.</span></div></div>",

Say, Tori?\" she spoke up after a few seconds.<br>\r\nToriel turned her head back from the sink, where she'd been running water for dishes.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she inquired.<br>\r\nUndyne opened her mouth, but hesitated. How was she going to word this? Unless she remembered Alphys' explanation wrong, the residual effects of the machine she'd tested on Toriel would still be hanging around at least until some time the next day. So, by all rights, she could probably assume that the boss monster would be interested in her idea.<br>\r\nBefore answering, Undyne stepped over to where Toriel was standing. The older monster let out a squeak of surprise as Undyne's right hand found its way down to her backside.<br>\r\nUndyne shook her head backward to flip her red hair onto her shoulder, flashing a smile at Toriel, her one remaining eye lidded.<br>\r\n(Just like with Alphys.) she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk lurched forward awkwardly when Undyne leaned the same way. He wasn't going to fall out of her cleavage, but that didn't mean this was comfortable.<br>\r\nUndyne was saying something, but Frisk didn't really hear it as he pushed himself back into a better position, both palms flat to Undyne's skin.<br>\r\n\"O-oh... my, Undyne, this is rather sudden, isn't it?\"<br>\r\nFrisk froze. He slowly looked up. To his surprise, Toriel was much closer than he would've expected. It was probably just the angle, but it almost looked like-<br>\r\n\"Wh-<i>what...?\"</i><br>\r\nHis surprised reaction came at the sight of Undyne actually resting her chin on Toriel's shoulder.<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmm...\"</i><br>\r\nFrisk shuddered at the sound of Undyne uttering that soft noise. She sounded... <i>flirty.</i> It wasn't a good fit for her.<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever miss it...?\" Undyne went on. Frisk wasn't sure of what she was talking about, but he had a theory, and it wasn't one that made him any more comfortable.<br>\r\n\"I... I do...\" Toriel said, a slight edge of sadness in her voice. \"Go-...\" She paused, clearing her throat. \"Asgore was still the last.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Undyne cooed. \"That long, huh? I don't know how you stand it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk's mouth fell open. He was stuck, wedged between Undyne's scaled-up tits, and she was giving him a front-row seat to watch her <i>flirting</i> with Toriel.<br>\r\n(Stop <i>hitting on my mom-!!)</i> he wanted to shout at her, but somehow, he felt too stunned to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright.\" Toriel was saying shortly after. She had to admit, intimacy with another monster was something she missed terribly, and her trip over to the lab earlier had put her very much in the mood.<br>\r\nSoon, the dishes were left behind as Undyne led her into the hall and up the stairs. The small house's two bedrooms were on the second floor. Her face felt very warm.<br>\r\nUndyne headed up the stairs in front of her, and she followed closely. The pair entered Toriel's bedroom, which was decorated with a variety of blue-tinted furniture, much like her old room in the Ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk didn't know whether to try and escape from here, scream his lungs out, or vomit.<br>\r\n(Maybe all three...)<br>\r\nHe still couldn't move from the hold of Undyne's breasts, and he was stuck watching as his captor led his foster mother into her bedroom, their reason for visiting rather impossible to mistake.<br>\r\nUndyne was propositioning Toriel for sex.</span></div></div>",

It certainly wasn\u2019t helping Frisk feel any more comfortable. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my, it appears in my efforts to clean you I\u2019ve only made another mess.\u201d Toriel mused to no one in particular as she examined her finger for any traces of said mess.<br>\r\nFrisk looked down at himself, she wasn\u2019t wrong. There were some sticky patches of\u2026 Stuff covering his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can do better! You\u2019ve had a long day, and it was silly of me to think just water would be enough to clean you up after all that.\u201d Hopefully that meant Frisk would be allowed a nice bath of his own. Toriel wandered to the sink, where she picked up a bar of soap. She looked back and forth between the soap and the small human in her grip, before shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Toriel brought a finger to her chin as she pondered. At first Frisk had hoped she genuinely wanted to clean him but her mannerisms seemed exaggerated and almost playful. Like she already had a solution in mind. His thoughts were interrupted as his adoptive mother spoke softly down at him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea. Many creatures on the surface and even some species of monster clean their young this way. It is not common among humans however so I hope you are not uncomfortable. But I'm sure it will help you get nice and clean!\u201d Frisk wasn\u2019t sure what she meant, and while he doubted he was in any danger. He certainly wasn\u2019t comfortable. It didn\u2019t take long for things to become all too clear, as Toriel\u2019s face descended towards Frisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still my child.\u201d She almost whispered. Her eyes closed and slowly her mouth opened. Her maw was intimidating to say the least. A pink and red cavern lined with pearly teeth, interior glistening with a coat of saliva. Her tongue lolled delicately out of her mouth, curling ever so slightly as the caring caprine sighed her desires onto the vulnerable human. Her breath was exceedingly sweet, pleasant almost. Hot and humid, Frisk\u2019s skin moistened as the hot air washed over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk had just enough time to grip the fur on her palm and turn over. It was only a second later that he felt the muscle make contact with his feet. He shuddered at the sensation. The warm muscle was dragged slowly up his body, over his legs, past his rump, up his back until eventually the organ ruffled his hair. As it lifted off of Frisk\u2019s body, the sticky sensation of the thin yet thorough coat of saliva it had left in its wake became more apparent. The tongue came down again, pressing its entire surface into Frisk and forcing his face into the soft surface of Toriel\u2019s palm. It wriggled from side to side, working the spittle into his body and grinding him slightly against her hand. After what felt like an eternity, his goatmum\u2019s tongue lifted off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had a chance to lift himself up, his world went dark again. Something soft and warm was pressing into his back and rubbing him against his mother\u2019s coat. Toriel had brought her other hand over and was using it to wipe Frisk\u2019s back, sandwiching him in her grip. Frisk could hear Toriel humming as she gently rubbed her hands to and fro. The sensation was very pleasant, akin to a full body massage by warm and soft pillows. As Toriel inadvertently rubbed against some of his more sensitive areas, Frisk could feel his arousal growing again, much to his chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Frisk was flipped face up onto Toriel\u2019s other hand. As she released him from her grip. The human tried to shield his eyes from the sudden light, but it wasn\u2019t long before Toriel\u2019s fingers curled up and pinned his hands. He looked up at her in time to see her licking her lips. After all, she had only cleaned one side. His arms pinned, this time he was unable to turn over and had to face her motherly wrath head on. Her mouth opened once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaah.\u201d She sighed down playfully at him. This time her mouth was positively dripping, she apparently enjoyed her son\u2019s taste. Strings of saliva hung from her palette to her tongue, a drop of the sticky drool splashed onto Frisks chest as he gazed into her yawning throat. The slimy appendage made contact with his body and within an instant he was drenched. Frisk could only cough and sputter as his mother\u2019s saliva permeated his body, it had the same sweetness as her breath. But that didn\u2019t make it any less unpleasant. He could hear Toriel greedily slurping his flavour as the tongue ground him into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs humiliating as it was, Frisk couldn\u2019t help but enjoy himself. Yet again he was being played with, by his own parent of all people. The tongue rubbed against Frisk\u2019s nethers. It\u2019s warm, soft and slippery surface proved irresistible. Frisk found himself exploding onto his mother once more. Feeling thoroughly ashamed, all Frisk could do was hope it was too wet for her to notice, as his fluids became lost in the sea of hers. The tongue lifted off him, but returned swiftly to tickle his face with its tip. As it retreated into Toriel\u2019s maw, it left behind a string of saliva, linking him to her bottom lip. Toriel chuckled quietly as she broke it with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling positively violated, Frisk looked up longingly at his mother. How desperately he wanted things to go back to normal. The look she was giving him was unknowable. It was impossible to tell her motherly stare from one of lust and desire at this stage\u2026. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s hard to see when there\u2019s more saliva than you\u2019ll ever need coating your face. Frisk\u2019s cleaning was interrupted has he felt Toriel\u2019s hand grasp his lower body tightly within her fist. Wriggling slightly to get free, Frisk looked up at his mother. Who was busy licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why human flavour substitute is so often sold out\u2026\u201d Once again Frisk found himself being raised up looking into Toriel\u2019s hungry maw. Dank, pink and eagerly awaiting his arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, please!\u201d Was all Frisk had time to yelp in response before her soft lips clamped down over his waist. Sealing him inside a very wet and dark interior. Then Toriel started having her way with Frisk once again. Frisks upper body was assaulted by the Giantess\u2019 tongue. Frisk\u2019s legs on the outside kicked back and forth, while he was treated like a human lollipop. Toriel licked and slurped wetly at Frisk\u2019s vulnerable body. Her lips parted just enough to let a sigh escape from the back of her mouth. The vaguely sweet scented wind washed over him, carrying the overpowering smell of another creature\u2019s breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Frisk pondered whether his giant goatmom would go any further, his question was answered for worse. A furry hand came from behind her lips, tickling his feet slightly as it pushed the rest of his body inside his matron\u2019s mouth. His legs brushed against her incisors as he was forced in. The world around Frisk grew dark resonated with a resounding \u201cMmmmmmh.\u201d Toriel\u2019s lithe tongue curled around Frisk, eager for his flavour. The appendage rose up and pinned the boy beneath it, forcing him into a small puddle of drool. Coughing and sputtering, he managed to wriggle out from beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Toriel wasn\u2019t pleased with that. Her tongue manoeuvred to force Frisk into the fleshy pocket of her cheek. From the outside you might have seen a wriggling bulge in the side of her caprine face as she sucked gleefully on her tasty human. The flesh of her cheek was soft, warm and stifling. Her tongue and cheek sandwiched him tightly where he struggled to catch his breath. All around the chamber echoed with contented slurping noises and the occasional lip smack. Frisk swore he could feel a couple of fingers pushing against him from outside the confines of Toriel\u2019s cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue finally moved away, allowing him to catch his breath. But before Frisk could right himself, he found himself lying face up on Toriel\u2019s well-kept molars. Frisk yelped, closed his eyes and rolled to the side as he observed the top set coming down to meet him. It was a sight that scared Frisk. He found himself wondering if he\u2019d be able to load his save if this went too far. But Toriel wouldn\u2019t actually hurt him right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was no, of course she wouldn\u2019t. Frisk felt the second set playfully clamp down on him, not hard enough to cause any pain. Breathing a sigh of relief, he opened his eyes. He was shaken about a bit as he heard Toriel stifle a giggle. She gently and playfully chewed and ground him between her colossal teeth. As if trying to get more flavour out of a piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she released him from between her jaws, and he rolled lazily onto her tongue within the center of her mouth. By this time there was plently of time for saliva to build up in Toriel\u2019s mouth, he was half submerged in it as he lay exhausted on her tongue. Disoriented from being thrown around, sucked on and even chewed on. Frisk didn\u2019t even know which way he was facing in the lightless confines of his mom\u2019s maw. Until she parted her lips exhale one more contented sigh. Frisk was momentarily blinded by the outside light, but still managed to crawl half-heartedly toward it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he made any headway, Toriel pushed upwards and squeezed her surrogate son up against her hard palate. The wind was knocked out of him as Frisk was subjected to one more bout of intense sucking, eager to get every ounce of his flavour out. The mouth rang with the sound of Toriel gulping down the excess spit, as if trying to gulp down his flavour. Hearing the sound of liquid rushing past and being so close to another creature\u2019s throat was intimidating, to say the least.<br>\r\nAt last, the pressure on Frisk subsided and the tongue quivered beneath him. Battered, bruised and a little terrified, Frisk felt the tongue under him move. Pushing him towards\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, her girlfriend was showering at the moment. That meant she had a few minutes to sort away her things before meeting up with her, at least.<br>\r\nChanging direction, Alphys headed for the largest of the several desks she had positioned around the lab.

He swung in the air as Alphys moved the bag toward her desk chair, bringing him along for the ride.<br>\r\nHis plan went wrong once Alphys lowered the bag toward the chair.

He'd come down on Alphys' chair itself. So, what were his options...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, he had very few. To his considerable alarm, Alphys was apparently planning on sitting down right at this moment.

She took it off, folding it and setting it on the edge of her desk. This left her in plain-looking shorts and a baggy shirt. Frisk looked on in a panic as a colossal backside hovered in the air before him. Alphys was about to sit down right on top of him, and there wasn't any time to move.<br>\r\n\"A-Alphys-!!\" he shouted desperately, but it didn't save him.

But wait where was he? <br>\r\n\"Hello, dearie~\"<br>\r\nAs he looked up, Frisk saw the face of Muffet peering down at him and upon looking farther down her body he noticed she was no longer wearing clothes and her slim purple body was completely on display. He noticed her ass was enormous and her legs were gleaming with some kind of liquid, coming from her honey pot between her thighs. <br>\r\n\"Well it seems as though my pets venom worked! You shrank to exactly 6 inches!\"<br>\r\nBefore Frisk could even question this, Muffet grabbed him in one of her many hands.<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for us to play!

Honey production will start inside the pot!\" With this muffet spreads her lips once again and starts shoving you in feet first! \"Oh my! *moan\"As she shoves you into her folds your feet are squeezed tighter than anything you could have imagined, with the slowness of her shoving you in you get the chance to see her other hands at work, one fingering her asshole, two more playing with her tits, another nibbling her finger, and the final hand playing with her clit.

Alphys herself was positioned at a suitably short control panel several steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly ten years, and Alphys still didn't trust herself completely not to make something go wrong with her experiments.<br>\r\nFrisk wasn't about to say anything that might damage her monster friend's already minimal confidence. She knew better than nearly anyone how easily Alphys could lose the nerve to go through with her work.<br>\r\nJust a few months short of ten years ago, Frisk had finally achieved what she wanted. Even then, at just ten years old, her Determination kept her going through injury, death, and all manner of equally unpleasant experiences to finally free all her newfound monster friends from their former prison underground.<br>\r\nWhen she thought back now, the world had adjusted surprisingly fast, actually. Considering that the memory of the monsters had faded into the likes of legends, which many people considered nothing more than fiction, the truth about their existence and sudden re-introduction into surface society had gone almost unbelievably well.<br>\r\nMaybe it helped that they'd been led by a smiling young girl who refused to hear so much as a single word against them, no matter what the monsters looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to today, Frisk had arrived at Alphys' recently renovated lab for an experiment the two had discussed for quite some time in the past few days.<br>\r\nThe machine towering over her was familiar. She'd seen it, shrouded in strange mist, down in the sub-basement labs beneath Alphys' own back in the underground. It didn't look nearly so terrifying now.<br>\r\nPreviously, it had been a machine used to extract the substance Alphys called Determination from human SOULs, but by now she'd long since repurposed it.<br>\r\nFrisk reasoned that the memories of what the machine had done in the past were the primary reason for Alphys' current hesitance to use it again.<br>\r\nThe plan for this experiment was simple: Alphys would use the machine to identify and measure the precise quantity of the so-called \"Determination\" that Frisk's SOUL contained, and, with any luck, she would be able to use the data the analysis provided to develop a clearer understanding of the exact properties of Determination and how it might be utilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the day she fell into the Underground all those years ago, Frisk had gained the ability to SAVE and to LOAD. She'd never gone out of her way to talk about this with many of her friends. The monsters she considered family -- Toriel, Asgore, Sans, Papyrus, Undyne, and Alphys herself had been the first to know.<br>\r\nFrisk had seen the end of her adventure in the Underground more times than she could remember. She was never quite satisfied with the bittersweet result she'd achieved until she at last discovered what she was seeking. It nearly cost her her own SOUL, but she managed at last to save not only all the monsters living down below, but also two people she had become nearly obsessed with helping in any way she could: the monster she by now considered her brother, and another human whose SOUL was thought to be long-since lost.<br>\r\nAsriel and Chara Dreemurr were now as close to her as anyone else from the Underground. Naturally, both were also privy to the secret of her Determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished reminiscing, Frisk sighed.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, fire it up, Alphys! Don't keep me waiting!\"<br>\r\nAlphys muttered uncertainly off on her own, but she started up the machine all the same. Frisk shuddered, hearing the strange, almost ghostly noise the machine emitted.<br>\r\nA rattling wind of exhaust blew forth, ruffling her clothes and hair. Frisk had spent much of her teenage years growing out her brown hair, which she now wore in a messy ponytail.<br>\r\nShe faced the machine, ready for anything. Even if something did somehow go wrong, -- though she doubted anything would -- she could easily just LOAD back to whenever she'd last made a SAVE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activating... now!\"<br>\r\nAlphys' voice was drowned out by a sound of great energy being expelled. The machine emitted a colourful glow, enveloping Frisk entirely and forcing her eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the waves receded, Frisk stood upright, opening her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Long before Frisk's countless RESETs and do-overs had at last allowed her to save the long-lost child, she recalled Asriel's description of his dead adoptive sibling. Outwardly, Chara was all smiles and almost too-friendly words. Inside, Frisk suspected she was something different. Still, she cared as much about the other human as any of the monsters, and after she'd freed her friends from their prison, Chara had become something skin to her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara had moved out to live on her own about as early as she could convince Toriel to allow. She had a small house with pleasant furnishings reminiscent of the Underground. They looked a bit less welcoming to Frisk now that they were all the size of buildings, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diminished human paced anxiously about on the wide-open floor.

Really, she was surprised that she'd been spotted at all.<br>\r\nThe ground shook more powerfully as Chara approached her, her massive footfalls coming down like collapsing mountains.

Frisk waited for her to elaborate, but instead, she just felt the towering girl pinch her body between her finger and thumb, listing her straight off the floor. She wriggled uncomfortably until the dizzying motions stopped. Chara was upright, holding her up to her face. She had a familiar smile, which made Frisk a bit nervous.</span></div></div>",

Chara had moved her grip to her ankles, leaving the rest of her body to dangle in the air. She frantically waved her arms for something to hold onto, but there was nothing in reach. Her hair swayed in the open air, her ponytail getting even messier than usual.<br>\r\n\"Ch-Chara, knock it off-!!\" she shouted, trying not to panic.<br>\r\nIn response, Chara just wriggled her hand to and fro, causing Frisk to awkwardly swing about in her grip. To her dismay, her shirt ruffled out of place and dropped down to land around her shoulders, covering her face. She could suddenly feel the cool air on the bared skin of her midsection. She heard Chara giggle again. She let out a squeak of discomfort as a large fingertip prodded at her front. Chara's index finger was large enough to jab at her stomach and brush over the underside of her breasts at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Frisk still didn't really understand what was going on, and Chara seemed to be in no mood to explain.<br>\r\nShe thought to just LOAD back to her most recent SAVE and get herself out of this mess, but at the moment, she was a little too preoccupied to focus and manage it.<br>\r\n\"Gosh, Frisk, you're even smaller than I thought, now that I look...\" Chara teased her, putting on her most irritating voice. \"You're so tiny that I might not even notice if something happened to you.\"<br>\r\nFrisk, still trying to use her arms to do anything that might help herself, hesitated. She didn't like the sound of those words.<br>\r\n\"You could just disappear into anything, and I'd probably miss it!\" Chara went on. Frisk felt her body being moved again. She tried to crane her neck and look at whatever she was dangling over. Her eyes were still obstructed by her shirt, and she was starting to feel lightheaded from dangling upside-down.<br>\r\nShe managed to clamp a hand onto her displaced shirt and tug it away from her face just long enough to spot the thing directly below her. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\nChara's overlarge face was pointed up at her, her arm holding her right over her head.<br>\r\nAlmost as if she'd read Frisk's frightened mind, Chara opened her mouth, revealing a menacing cavern of darkness directly underneath Frisk's position. Was Chara about to <i>eat</i> her...!?</span></div></div>",

Frisk tried to scream, but her breath just same out in a gasp.<br>\r\nShe tumbled straight down the length of Chara's outstretched arm, and within a second, she fell straight into her adoptive sister's cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n\"Oof-!\"<br>\r\nShe struck down on a damp and rough surface that felt like a bad excuse for a water bed. The air was humid, and the light above Frisk's head vanished as Chara closed her mouth.<br>\r\nFrisk tumbled about awkwardly on the huge tongue she'd dropped onto, which wriggled and teased at her tiny body without mercy. She coughed, the air in here unfit for breathing.<br>\r\nChara's tongue was entirely too strong for her. She struggled, but any movement she made was easily undone as she wrestled pointlessly with the enormous muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara was going to <i>eat her?</i> Just like that...?<br>\r\nAn echoing giggle gave Frisk her answer. She felt Chara's tongue prodding at her body in the dark for a few seconds more, and then, in a horrible shifting motion, she was tossed helplessly toward the deepest depths of the sweltering cavern.<br>\r\nScrambling desperately at the slick ground, she felt herself sliding ever backward.<br>\r\nHer efforts couldn't stop the oncoming pull of the muscles working all around her as they claimed her body for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horribly uncomfortable journey downward ended when she was deposited into a thick puddle of a rather unpleasantly warm liquid. It didn't take much imagination to guess at where she was.<br>\r\nShe struggled out of the sickly mire and found a relatively dry space in the darkness. Curling herself into a ball, she closed her eyes and tried with all her might to concentrate. She needed that SAVE more than ever.</span></div></div>",

The scenery didn't make it hard to guess where she was. The<i> why</i> of it was still a total mystery, though.<br>\r\nMuffet was... a friend, Frisk supposed. The spider-girl wasn't really brilliant with social interactions, even years later. She ran a top of the line bakery, but she wasn't particularly popular as a person. It felt a bit mean to say so, but Frisk could only blame that on Muffet's questionable behaviour around others. It seemed like she couldn't hold a conversation without making disconcerting comments about \"baking ingredients\", which never failed to make people uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive room sprawling in all directions was rather sparsely decorated in the way of actual furniture. It might have gone unnoticed to some, on account of the utterly vast quantity of spider webs scattered all around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what to do...? Frisk paced around a bit, taking things in. She was on top of a table, by the look of it. Muffet wasn't around, and Frisk was suddenly glad not to see any spiders in the room, either. Muffet's common accompaniment was a bit unpleasant to be around at a normal size. She hated to imagine how the spiders would look now.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to guess at how many people would likely fit at the table, but given her current size, getting an accurate idea of it was quite impossible.<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but notice certain traces on the table to indicate the presence of Muffet and her multitude of spiders. She shuddered again, doing her best not to imagine anything unpleasant.<br>\r\nThere was a slightly creased paper on the table with her, not too far away. Frisk headed toward it, more out of curiosity than anything else. On the way over, she tried to remember precisely when she'd last made a SAVE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper looked to be a recipe of some kind. Probably some new baked good that Muffet was experimenting with.<br>\r\n\"At least her experiments don't <i>shrink</i> people...\"<br>\r\nFrisk was about to continue past the paper when something on it caught her eye. She shuffled over to get a better look at the line of text in question.<br>\r\nSomeone had scribbled out a few words and jotted down a note next to them. She felt rather put off by seeing her own name written there in Muffet's familiar scribble.<br>\r\n<i>\"Get Frisk!</i>\" she read aloud. \"... What does she mean by that...?\"<br>\r\nOn any other day, she could've just <i>asked </i>the spider girl, but today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden <i>click</i> off in the distance. Frisk turned just in time to see a door swing open.<br>\r\nMuffet entered the room, and Frisk felt a bit stunned. The monster was fairly short normally, but like this, she looked impossibly tall, even way off at the other end of the room.<br>\r\nMuffet set aside a jacket and approached the table. Frisk moved aside just in time for the recipe sheet to be picked up from the table. Muffet examined it for a moment. Frisk thought to try and get her attention, but just as she was considering how best to do so, she spotted the massive spider-girl's eyes swivelling to focus on her.<br>\r\nAn eerie smile appeared on Muffet's wide face.<br>\r\n\"You're just in time!\" she said cheerily. Frisk took a nervous step back, but a very large hand was already approaching her.</span></div></div>",

Muffet cheerfully hummed to herself as she carried the diminished human across the room. There was a thicket of webbing attached to the wall over top of a cleared countertop, and Frisk wriggled helplessly as she was raised toward it.<br>\r\nMuffet secured her in place, leaving her body hanging awkwardly in the web, and the spider monster smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"Now, you just wait right there, dearie. We'll be ready for your part soon.\"<br>\r\n\"My part...?\" Frisk asked, not feeling confident in this at all. She only became more concerned when Muffet didn't reply.<br>\r\nThe monster walked back across the room and retrieved several items from a cabinet, taking them up in her several available arms. Judging by the items in question, Frisk could only assume that Muffet was planning on baking something.<br>\r\nHer list of possibilities ran terrifyingly short.<br>\r\n\"OK, Frisk, don't lose it...\" she muttered to herself, forcing her eyes shut. She'd been in plenty of dangerous situations with monsters in her childhood, so why should this be different? So long as she still possessed her Determination, nothing could kill her for good. And of anyone, Frisk <i>knew</i> what dying was like. She'd been blown up, impaled by magical spears, burned, and met countless other equally unpleasant fates before she learned to survive the Underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched. She'd been trying, but she hadn't managed to LOAD back. She tried again, beginning to sweat. This had happened before, as well. If she couldn't focus, she couldn't LOAD without dying first. She might have been used to it, but she still didn't <i>enjoy</i> dying.<br>\r\n\"C'mon...!\"<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\nAll Frisk could hear over her own strained breath was Muffet's incessant humming off in the distance.<br>\r\nThis wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour passed before Muffet had finished her project. She opened the small oven at the end of the counter and retrieved a tray of her recognizable spider donuts. She waited for one to cool and picked it up, approaching Frisk's position.<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"This is where you come in, little Frisk.\" she said in her disconcertingly singsong voice. A hand rose up and tugged part of the web free of the wall. Frisk remained caught up in it, and Muffet brought her toward the freshly-baked donut. Stringing the web around it, Muffet arranged her little prisoner in place like something of a decoration on the pastry.<br>\r\nFrisk was shaking in fear as she was raised back up to Muffet's face, still immobilized. \"Now,\" began the monster.</span></div></div>",

How in the world was she supposed to respond to that?<br>\r\n... A few ideas came to mind, most of them involving the word 'no' at varying volumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diminished human tugged at her restraints, thrashing until her limbs were sore, but the webbing didn't yield. All the while, Muffet was just watching her with a little smile. The effect of that many eyes fixating on her all at once was incredibly unnerving, especially considering what the monster seemed to be planning to do.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you never <i>were</i> very good at wriggling free, were you...?\"<br>\r\nMuffet's silky voice only made things worse.<br>\r\nFrisk tried to ignore the dizzying motions she experienced as Muffet began to move again, focusing only on either escaping or successfully making it to her SAVE.<br>\r\nShe uttered a noise of strain and shouted. <i>\"Help me-!!\"</i><br>\r\nThe only voice to answer was Muffet's. The monster giggled infuriatingly. \"No, no, silly little Frisk. You're going to help<i> me.</i> I think you're just what this recipe needs.\"<br>\r\nThe motions finally settled as Muffet lowered herself into a chair. She brought the donut and its increasingly desperate passenger up to her mouth.<br>\r\n\"I don't think we need a taste test, so, here we go~!\"<br>\r\nFrisk screamed, her eyes screwed shut, and a wave of warmth issued over her body. She was inside Muffet's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teasing tongue poked at her restrained body, uncomfortably exploring around her. Frisk wanted nothing more than to move for herself and get to anywhere but here, but escape remained quite far out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffet didn't normally play with her food like this, but today's recipe was special. She leaned back in the chair, stifling another giggle at the continued helpless thrashing her tiny friend was carrying on with inside her mouth.<br>\r\nOnce she'd had her moment of amusement, she lightly traced a hand over her throat and swallowed, giving a dainty little sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk had been through some awful experiences in her less successful trips through the Underground. She was no stranger to pain, but what she was experiencing now was a fresh kind of it.<br>\r\nMonster food worked differently from human food. There was magic involved, of course.<br>\r\nFrisk was not monster food.<br>\r\nShe was in total darkness, sickening rumbling noises issuing from the environment around her. She was still restrained, so whatever came her way was going to have the free run of hurting her.<br>\r\nIt was all too soon that a burning feeling began to bubble up on her, starting at the legs. She didn't know much about monster biology, so exactly what was happening was a mystery to her. Considering how uncomfortable it was, though, the specifics seemed unimportant.<br>\r\nAs moments wore on, she hoped more and more that the webs restraining her might tear away, but long before anything of the sort happened, the burning feeling was creeping up her body. Soon, it seemed to be everywhere. The discomfort became so great that Frisk couldn't properly coordinate her movements to try and escape any more, leaving her to simply writhe in place.<br>\r\nShe expected her SOUL to split apart at any moment. Honestly, she <i>wanted it to,</i> at this point.<br>\r\nIn her mind, an image of Muffet giggling away outside of this hell flashed through the darkness.<br>\r\nIt almost seemed to freeze as a sudden rippling jolt split through Frisk's body. It was a feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time, yet it felt familiar as anything instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe faintly heard an unearthly noise that echoed all through her mind. This, too, was instantly recognizable, despite the years since she'd last heard it.<br>\r\nIn the darkness, a luminescent red heart split down the middle and shattered.</span></div></div>",

Less comfortably, everything around them was now huge. \"Am I tiny...? How did this happen? ... I'm gonna need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara heard some stirring noises behind her; she turned around to see Frisk also lying on the floor. They, however, were normally-sized making them a giantess to the tiny Chara. \"I need help, but not from <i>you,</i> partner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara and Frisk had a great relationship <i>now,</i> but it was rocky at the start. The human that woke her up from her slumber, and then after a failed pacifist run, took it out on everyone around her in a genocide run. Eventually after selling their soul to fix the world, they completed a true pacifist run and led everyone to the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Chara had been corrupted by Frisk's actions. On the surface, Chara took control of her partner's body, and made life hard for those around her. No one could understand why Frisk would hate other humans for what they did to monsters, until one day Chara slipped up and said something only Chara herself would know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara had become saddened inside; she wasn't angry at Frisk or the other humans anymore. She had her family right there in front of her, but to them she was Frisk, someone Chara watched kill them. She broke down one day and lashed out at everyone, about how she was replaced by a real monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was the first to recognize Chara's words coming from Frisk's mouth. So she hugged her long lost child, and soothed them. Toriel had hugged them before obviously, but it was Frisk getting the affection. That hug wasn't meant for Frisk, it was for her. She was no longer invisible in her mother's eye. She cried and let everything out that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk who had been silent for weeks, watching Chara use her body to bring pain to others, finally broke that silence with an apology. Frisk apologized for everything they did to Chara's family, her home, and monster kind. But also for what their actions had turned Chara into. She promised she would do better, and never hurt anyone else again. Chara broke that day, the love and attention from her mother, and Frisk's apology and admittance of guilt, caused her anger and hate towards others to waver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of Frisk's body that day. She instead chose to live in a trash bin in Frisk's room, because that's what she felt like. Not that anyone other than Frisk could see her sitting in there all day. Frisk never gave up on Chara. She reset the timeline to a point before Chara had broke down in front of everyone, and called herself a demon in Frisk's body. Chara wasn't a demon, and no one needed to remember her as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk worked tirelessly with Alphys to find how one could restore a lost soul. After weeks studying what a soul was, how one could restore one, and what would happen if attempted. It ultimately came down to Frisk splitting their own soul to give half to Chara. After finally convincing Chara to give it a try, they used their now-shared determination to load a save point, and both of them had appeared at the save point that day, in their respective bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were still a little rocky even after that. Chara mostly hung out alone away from others, even her parents at times, too ashamed of what they had done. It also didn't help that Sans could remember the timeline where Chara was controlling Frisk and causing trouble for everyone. Even though Frisk numerous times said it was their own fault, and that Chara wasn't to blame for the things that happened. Sans and others that had somehow picked up on Sans' distrust of Chara, were never that open to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damage was done. The true monster had set themselves up as the savior, while the victim was demonized. Very few could see the real truth, and this only haunted Chara more. This eventually all went away though. Time heals all wounds and now they were all living together happily. Even Sans saw the error of his ways and tried his best to try to make things up to Chara. After years of research Alphys even found a way to restore Flowey back into Asriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Chara, Frisk, and Asriel lived together after becoming to old too live with their mom. Things were great. \"So why is all this coming back to me now?\" Chara said to herself, crying with all these sad memories racing in her head.</span></div></div>",

Same goes for Asriel since he's supposed to be around the same age as Chara anyway. Now to continue.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara ran across the floor to her sleeping partner. This took a while as the living room was now huge, and running on carpet at her size was not the easiest task. She finally reached Frisk and let herself fall into their body. It was warm and the sweater Frisk wore made it cozy. Chara was feeling better already. She stepped back a minute to see what she had ran face first into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap... this is embarrassing.\" Chara said out loud as she realized she had hugged Frisk's boob. \"They can<i>not</i> find out about this.\" she said quietly to herself. \"Now how to get their attention?\" Chara pondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm going to have to climb it, aren't I?\" Chara said to herself looking at Frisk's chest. The goal of course was to get to Frisk's ear to gently wake them up, as banging on their face seemed like a bad way to wake up a giant. With Frisk lying on the side of their face, one ear was clearly unavailable while the other would only be reachable if she climbed on top of her partner. And Frisk's chest was the only safely climbable surface she could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara sighed. \"It's just a pair of breasts. All girls have them; Frisk, mom, myself. Just another part of the female body.\" Chara said to herself, trying to keep from thinking that the surface she was scaling was her partner's boobs. She finally reached the top of Frisk's breast, and spent a moment catching her breath. \"Alright... let's start moving towards your head, partner.\" Chara said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few steps, however, everything started to shake. \"No, no, no -- don't you <i>dare</i> turn over <i>right now.\"</i> Chara yelled. Frisk did turn over, however. Luckily for Chara it was onto her back, and she had managed hold on to Frisk's sweater. \"Thank goodness.\" Chara said and breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too early to celebrate, however, Chara realized, as Frisk was turning over yet again. This time though, Chara had fallen to the floor and only had time to look up at Frisk's chest about to crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-smash- </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara opened her eyes, and soon realized she was stuck. Frisk's giant boob and all its weight was on top of her. \"Dammit, Frisk...! Your stupid <i>boobs</i> are smothering me! Wake up already!\" All this yelling was to no avail however, as her voice wasn't loud enough to wake her sleeping partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara stewed for a minute, but then just sighed. \"It's not the <i>worst</i> predicament, I guess. At this size there's plenty of worse situations I could be in right now. I'll just wait for Frisk to get up, then get her help fixing whatever happened to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara felt herself relaxing. It was actually somewhat comfortable under Frisk's breasts; like being buried under giant pillows. And Frisk's gentle and steady breathing was enough to fall asleep to. With a final yawn, Chara had fallen asleep, trapped under her partner's breasts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she opened her eyes, she looked to where Chara had been resting with her hours earlier. To her surprise, Chara wasn't there. Frisk sat up and rubbed her eyes, trying to see where Chara might have wandered off to. <i>Maybe she just went to the bathroom, or went to go get...</i> Frisk thought, before false realization hit her. She quickly got up and ran towards the kitchen, yelling \"Chara, you better not be eating the chocolate in the fridge again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frisk entered the kitchen, she saw Chara wasn't there. She checked the fridge, and sure enough none of the chocolate was missing. Frisk looked around, as if some sign was going to point to where Chara was. Sure enough, one did when a quiet snore rang from the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk followed the sound and looked all around, expecting to find a full sized Chara curled up in a corner. Instead, the source of the sound was a miniature version of her partner, curled up and snoring where Frisk was just laying. She knelt down and inspected the tiny woman. <i>This is unreal. How...how could she shrink like this, and...WHAT WAS SHE DOING THERE OF ALL PLACES?!?</i> she thought, freaking out at both realizations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she couldn't just leave Chara laying there, so she carefully cupped Chara in her hands and carried her to their bedroom. While Asriel had his own room, Chara and Frisk shared a room, a bed on either side for the two of them. As Frisk headed towards Chara's bed, she started to slowly wake up, Frisk's movements feeling like earthquakes to the tiny girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara opened her eyes and looked around frantically as the ground beneath her continued to shake. She tried to stand up, causing Frisk to jerk in surprise. From the sudden stop, Chara fell out of Frisk's hands and flew across the room, luckily landing safely on her bed. As she righted herself, she shot her head up to Frisk, glaring in frustration. \"Ugh, first you lay on top of me and then you toss me onto my bed?! I thought you would help me!\" she yelled, tears beginning to roll down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk bent down and looked concerningly at Chara, tears starting to swell in her eyes as well. \"Chara, I-I... I'm sorry. I only found you after waking up and looking for you, and you did scare me just now.\" She took a deep breath, trying to process all of this. \"Let's get some things straight first. How did you shrink down?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara looked back to Frisk, tears still steaming down her eyes. \"I don't know! I woke up like this and tried to get your attention, but instead you rolled over me and smooshed me under your-\" she screamed, stopping suddenly. They looked at each other, both blushing in embarrassment. Chara turned away and continued. \"Like I said, I don't know how I ended up like this. As much as I hate to admit it, I...I...I need your help partner!\" Chara turned away and fell into her bed, her emotions taking full control of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk sat for a moment, watching as her friend broke down in front of her. Gently, she rubbed Chara's back with a single finger, humming quietly. The tiny woman looked up at Frisk, sobbing quietly. Chara pushed Frisk's finger and giggled a bit. \"For a person who's had their soul possessed by the very person in front of them, you sure do care about me, don't you? Now, what to do about...this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk looked up a bit, pondering Chara's question. \"Well...we could go try going to Alphys. She is the one who restored your body after all.\" Chara frowned, shaking her head. \"Frisk, you do remember Alphys and Undyne went on that trip to...what did they call it? Comic con or whatever it's called? Either way, they won't be back for at least a few days.\" Frisk sighed. \"Well...let's at least try calling her. That wouldn't hurt, would it?\" Chara huffed to herself. \"I...guess not. Just...figure this out, so I can be myself again. You don't know how...\" she said, her words trailing off with a sigh. Frisk sighed as well, guessing what Chara was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her phone and dialed Alphys' number. One ring. Two rings. Three rings. \"H-Hi, this is Alphys, royal scientist of A-Asgore Dreemurr. Please leave a message and I-I'll to get back to you.\" Frisk left a message explaining what had happened and shut her phone off. She looked back to Chara, who was thoroughly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she's not answering! She's probably at that Mew Mew Kissy thing! Now what do I do?! I can't stay like this!\" Chara paced the bed, pulling at her hair in frustration. As Frisk tried to console her again, Chara lashed back, slapping her hand away. \"You don't understand what this is like Frisk! I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk interrupted. \"You feel vulnerable and scared, right?\" Chara looked up to Frisk, shocked. \"H-How...\" she stammered. \"Well, you <i>did</i> just shrink for no reason and are powerless to do anything about it. Plus, after you got stuck under my....you know, I'm sure you're worried something like that might happen again.\" She paused, looking Chara right in the eyes. \"Chara, I know you're scared, but there's nothing we can do about it right now. For now, can you trust me? Me and Asriel are here for you.\" Frisk held out both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara looked at her partner, her mind at a complete standstill. <i>Frisk... I want to trust you, but...</i> is what she wanted to say. She felt just like those monsters all those years ago, trapped underground. Their lives were at the mercy of a single child, that child standing right in front of her. Before, she would have easily trusted Frisk, but between the events that just occurred and her memories coming back to her, she felt very uneasy around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a single memory took her attention. It was the same memory from before: Frisk promising not to hurt anyone. Chara looked at her hands, as she did during that memory. She could see Frisk's hands, holding hers gently. Then another memory took her attention, the memory of both of them resetting, hands held much in the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Frisk's hands right now, in that very position once again. Chara looked at her own, much smaller than the ones in front of her. She sighed and approached Frisk's hands, sitting down on her knees and placing her hands on them. \"I'll try. Thank you...Frisk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up again and gently stepped onto Frisk's hands, motioning for her to bring her up. Frisk smiled and obliged, bringing Chara up to her face. Chara stepped forward and gave a small kiss and hug to the giant's cheek, much to Frisk's surprise. Her face went bright red as Chara looked back at her, a smirk on her face. \"Oh, is someone a bit shy to affection? I guess we'll have to fix <i>that</i> later. For now, how about we relax a little and make some food while we wait for Asriel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisked nodded in agreement, placing Chara on her shoulder and heading to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>So reader, it's time to decide. Would you like to see Chara and Frisk enjoying themselves a little before Asriel gets home or would you rather read someone's spin off of this, jumping to another timeline?</b></span></div></div>",

Soon enough, her pounding headache began to clear, allowing her to properly perceive what was around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human child's eyes widened nervously as she noticed what she was stood upon. It was a golden flower. Similar golden flowers extended out around her ages, and an enormous seat stood in the distance. Recollection flashed in Chara's eyes as she remembered what that was, it was dad's throne, the one her and Asriel would sit on together. The seat was always big, but this most definitely wasn't right. She was two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Chara shuffled forwards, freezing as the flower she was on tipped a little. The now tiny human leaped off of the flower, and onto another, this time a little closer to the ginormous throne. She continued to jump from flower to flower, travelling a reasonable distance towards the towering chair. The girl froze as she heard a faint rumble, her hands clasping together as her head flicked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide as she turned around, seeing the shape of someone, a giant someone, filling the door.

On the flowers!\" But alas, her voice came out too quiet, and he was just too far up. The king walked slowly through the room, continuing to call for her. Chara's eyes widened as a large white foot landed next to her, the girl squeaking as she scrambled back from it, onto the next flower along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed his cloak trailing on after him, and had an idea. She tracked it with her gaze,watching as it swept past the golden flowers nearby, their seeds sticking to it's bottom.

Asgore had felt something, a small something, tug against his cloak. Whilst it could just be a flower caught under it, it was always worth investigating, there were a few instances of tiny froggits getting lost, and what kind of king would he be to not help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head, gazing down at the purple cloak, a fond smile spread across his face at the yellow seeds on the bottom of the cloak. His eyes searched for any hint of white that would indicate a miniature froggit, but instead, another hue met his eyes, green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he strolled over to his throne, clutching the side of the cloak in hand. He definitely didn't know of any green monsters of that scale, and his curiosity had been piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara watched helplessly as he looked down at his cloak, then turned away, beginning to walk again. Her hands tightened around the cloak, she'd just need to stay determined, hopefully her dad would find her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly lifting the cloak up, he sat upon the throne, resting it on his lap as he observed the small thing closely. His eyes widened as he saw the pale limbs, the stripes on the green shirt, the neat-ish mop of brown hair. Chara. How had she gotten like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chara,\" He spoke, more quietly, he knew that the tiny froggits would ask for him to quieten down, as he was too loud for them, and figured that the same would hold true for his daughter, \"Are you alright dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly, he pinched the back of her shirt between two of his fluffy white fingers, lifting the human child into his palm. The tiny human let out a small yelp as she was lifted up, her limbs flailing a little as she was quickly lowered onto a soft, soft surface.<br>\r\n\"D-Dad,\" She spoke quietly, her previous confidence having vanished. She gazed into his eyes, watching as they softened sympathetically, \"W-What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure dear, but we'll get to the bottom of it,\" He spoke, his voice as soft as his fur was. Chara felt something run down her back, her muscles tensing, \"Oh, sorry Chara, you just have some seeds on your back,\" He smiled awkwardly, the few seeds getting stuck to his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Tori has pie, would you like to go and eat?\" He asked, looking down at her with soft, sympathetic eyes.

Am I...Alive?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara opened her red eyes in utter surprise. She couldn't believe it; she'd opened her eyes in the first time in years. She saw a glowing white plan out before her as she sat on a cold floor. The light almost blinded her and she actually squinted from the pain in her eyes. She couldn't believe it. She could <i>feel</i> that.<br>\r\nMustering her strength she was able to move her arms and slowly sat up; she had control over her body again. She <i>had</i> her body again! She sat up and looked around as she adjusted to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is this place?</i> she thought to herself. <i>Is this the Core? Is this...no...I wouldn't be alive if it was. But then why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara then began to notice the circular shape of the chamber she was in. The walls were made of glass and she began to notice the odd landscape beyond it. Things were starting to come together in a rather bizarre fashion. But soon as Chara turned around in her tiny chamber she soon came across a rather large tan-colored wall beyond the glass and two squinting eyes staring at her. Chara sighed and rolled her eyes seeing it; more annoyed than scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said sounding rather bored. \"It's gonna be one of...<i>those</i> kind of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk was staring into the glass bottle that was sitting on Alphys' work station; the white lights made it seem like the glass was glowing. She watched as the tiny creature inside the body slowly began to stir; the others were busy talking about what they were going to do when she woke up, but Frisk never took her eyes off of Chara; the first fallen child, and the original Human of the Dreemurr family. Frisk always felt that Chara was her last bit of unfinished business...the last person to save...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing my child?\" Toriel asked as she approached her. Frisk turned around but before she could say anything, Toriel noticed that Chara had begun to move. \"Oh my; everyone come quick, she's awake at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara threw her hands over her ears after the large Goat boss monster came up to Frisk and noticed her moving. Her voice was so loud and it was grating. She slowly glared up at the giant Toriel and soon other figures began to join her and Frisk, surrounding the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" Chara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now-now Chara; stay calm,\" Asgore said looking down at his shrunken adoptive daughter. \"Frisk here told us everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how even in death, you were so angry that you were willing to kill everyone of us and you tried to make Frisk help you do it,\" Toriel said. \"I'm rather disappointed in you, Chara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not all to blame,\" Chara said grinning wickedly and shrugging her shoulders. \"After all,\" she then turned her narrow red eyes toward Frisk. \"I needed a good partner to get the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk frowned and cringed remembering all of the things they did together. Suddenly Chara found her world rocking back and forth when Sans reached over and flicked the bottle she was being kept in.<br>\r\n\"Oops, how clumsy of me,\" Sans said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Chara had got settled again she glared back at Sans. \"You better watch-it, Trashbag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's fair,\" Sans said shrugging. \"After all, I am a Bag of Bones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord Sans, Stop it!\" Papyrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing that Frisk has the power to reset the timeline,\" Chara heard a voice say. She turned and saw Asriel standing above her. She couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azzy?\" she asked in disbelief. \"How are you not a flower?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I can explain that,\" Alphys said coming up. \"When Frisk told us the truth about Flowey, I ran some experiments using Determination. I found a way to restore him back to his original form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's when Frisk told us about you, Chara,\" Toriel said. \"Asriel confirmed her story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So using the same research I did to bring back Asriel, I was able to bring you back to life and gave you a body of your own again,\" Alphys continued. \"But uh...as you can see...when it came to regenerating your form, your parents had an interesting idea to keep you from...well being so homicidal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why I'm shrunken, eh?\" Chara asked, becoming angrier. \"You think you can control me by keeping me small?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Chara, don't take that tone with us,\" Toriel said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Frisk told you about everything we did huh? You seem to have forgiven her; but what about me huh? What did you bring me back for; a scapegoat so that Frisk can be blameless? To get your revenge on me? You're all cowards you know that? Shrinking me down so that you don't have to fight me on fair terms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Chara; no one here is going to fight you, or is after revenge,\" Asgore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, Asgore,\" Undyne said. \"I hear that this little Punk has a lot to answer for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undyne, please,\" Toriel began. \"Chara, this isn't about punishing you for your past sins; although we are holding you accountable for them. This is more about...rehabilitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What does that mean?\" Chara asked, now glaring daggers at Toriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I want my sister back,\" Asriel said. \"I want things to go back to the way they were, Chara; before you died...I want us to be friends again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Friends?\" Chara asked now smiling wickedly. \"I thought I was the enemy here...Isn't that right...Undyne?\" The fish-woman glared at Chara as she pried at her. \"Human beings are the Enemy aren't they?\" Chara continued. \"Or how about you, 'Dad'? Isn't every single human who falls down here put to death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite enough of that, Chara,\" Asgore said, trying to hold his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to hold me accountable for <i>my</i> crimes; what about theirs? Between the two of them, how many humans did they kill? I think there was six.\" Chara was trying to start discourse among them. She slowly turned around to look at Sans. \"Or how about you, Comedian? How many humans did you kill before you made that little promise? And do I need to bring up -\" Chara began to turn around and look at Frisk. \"How many times you killed us in retaliation for your brother? I think even you lost count...And of course, lets not forget Saint Frisk, the Pacifist Human who freed the Underground, and my Partner in Genocide, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Chara!\" Frisk said. \"I've put that behind me...And right now, I do think you're right; you do need to be punished for everything that you've done. But everything that you are...I think that's punishment enough. This isn't about that...I told them to bring you back because I want to save you, Chara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me...how cute,\" Chara said. \"And yet, you felt the need to handicap me; make me into some kind of toy or pet; make me powerless, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we say, Kid? You can kill Boss-Monsters in a single blow; we're not taking any chances,\" Sans said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be so hostile, my child,\" Toriel said. \"Everything that we're doing here, is for your own good. So during the course of your rehabilitation, each one of us will be responsible for you throughout the day. And hopefully during these extended interactions with everyone in our...<i>family</i>, you'll get to know everyone a bit more; see their redeeming qualities. And maybe you'll learn to stop being so angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did bring me back to be the family pet,\" Chara said. \"Well forget it; I'm not going to roll-over and fetch for you people; no matter how long you make me spend time with these lowlifes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should mind your attitude, Missy,\" Toriel said. \"Because until you learn to behave yourself, you can expect to be at that size for the foreseeable future. So you might as well do your part in this rehabilitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd also like to point out that, this is your last chance, kid,\" Sans said. \"Because without Frisk's determination, you can't come back if you get hurt. So if I were you, I wouldn't be such a wise-ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that, Trashbag,\" Chara grinned at Sans rather menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah; I can already tell this is going to be loads of fun,\" Undyne said as she face-palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I for one am excited about this,\" Papyrus said. \"If Frisk could become best-buddies with the Coolest Guy around - that's me - I'm certain that the...uh...Smaller Human could do it. We can go jogging! Undyne and I can teach her how to cook! And I can show her all my cool puzzles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First chance I get, I am jumping off a high counter,\" Chara said leaning on one arm. \"Really starting to miss my knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk saw Chara's less than enthusiastic attitude and winced. \"Chara, please...I know this is going to work; if you're any kind of good like I hope you are, then you'll see everything that I see. Just give us a chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, Frisk,\" Asgore said. \"Now that introductions are over, who wants to take the first shift with our little Hell-Raiser here?\"</span></div></div>",

At first Chara was amused by the bickering loving to watch the three fight, but after a while it was getting annoying so she let her mind drift elsewhere and thought out of the three idiots would be the least aggravating to be stuck with at her minuscule height,,trapped in a freaking bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst on her list was her Partner well EX-Partner Frisk.Frisk seemed to be the easiest to deal with out of the three  She was fa to nice and naive for her own good ant that was perfect for Chara She believed she could find a way to trick frisk in to thinking she was nicer and that that would probably at least free her from the stupid bottle she was trapped in. But then there was  Frisk's playful side  to deal with, Chara knew Frisk well and knew she would probably enjoy teasing her at least a bit to get back at her for the whole genocide thing &lt;some people just cant let stuff go&gt; Chara thought to herself .She would have to put up with some humiliation to find a means of escape from this stupid punishment and felt Frisk would be her best option at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Papyrus. The unbelievably simpleminded and trusting Papyrus Chara felt she might be able to trick Papyrus easy enough but  she also knew Sans would no doubt be watching her every move and keep Papyrus form falling for her tricks which sucked. Then there was his spaghetti.... Chara could'nt lie to herself. she could still taste  his \"gourmet\"Spaghetti when Frisk had tried it and it was indescribably disgusting. just hearing him mention it make there stomach almost do a flip and at her current size eating a single noodle could kill her for all she knew. Chara felt it might be too risky to try her plans with Papyrus and would rather just wait it out and try to weasel out of eating the pasta.She could deal with this outcome<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last and definitely the supremely least on her list was Sans. Chara despised Sans and the feeling was mutual, and although she did like to taunt him in a crowd if left alone.. Chara could feel shivers go down her spine..she would never admit it but Sans horrified her and there was no telling what he would do to her at this size. she knew he probably would not kill her,,but he may get dangerously  close to. making sure to repay her for every exp she had endeared. Chara really REALLY hoped she wouldn't get stuck with Sans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Is Enough!\" A loud voice ripped Chara from her Internal debate and Saw it was her mother Toriel who was the culprit. \"Please decide civilly who will be the first to watch over my daughter,\"<br>\r\nAt this the three spent a little more time debating and came to the conclusion that the first shift would go to... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was funny to think about how different that sentence's meaning was now. Just a few years ago, <i>monsters</i> definitely wouldn't have been called \"normal\". <br>\r\nThey were now, though. The world was coming up on seven years since the population of bizarre and eccentric creatures from deep underground -- that only the most paranoid conspiracy theorists of the world had actually believed to exist -- had emerged from their long imprisonment, led by a single human kid in a striped shirt.<br>\r\nThat was quite the day.<br>\r\nYou'd met some monsters over time. There were certainly a lot of them, and it was hard to believe that anyone could possibly get to know every last one of them. Aside from the kid who freed them, at least. They seemed to be a friend to the entire monster population.<br>\r\nSo, the human race shared their world with monsters again. Some history books needed to be scrapped and rewritten, but seven years gave the world enough time to adjust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, you were enjoying a walk near the outskirts of your home city. There was a festival going on in the downtown area, celebrating the day that the monsters first left the Underground. You'd been through the crowded streets, having a good time and enjoying the odd bit of monster food here and there, -- that stuff was <i>incredible,</i> actually --  and felt like slipping away for a break. You could still hear the music and a rumble of voices from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by a small park, something caught your eye. A few people were grouped up in the park's footpath. Some monsters you didn't recognize, and a couple of humans.<br>\r\nThey were showing off some magic, by the look of it. One of the humans dodged a colourful blast launched by one of their monster friends, laughing as they went. They darted around behind the other monsters, and you spotted a glow of energy swelling up from beyond their position.<br>\r\nYou reacted a split-second too late, unfortunately. The human dodged again, and the next blast fired straight past them, screaming through the air toward you, instead.<br>\r\nIt struck you squarely in the stomach, and you flinched, but after a second or two, you still couldn't feel any pain or anything else. You looked yourself over. Everything seemed fine, actually. You weren't sure if the group even noticed.<br>\r\nSo, the magic wasn't dangerous, then. That was good. You brushed yourself off, just in case, and turned to keep going. Maybe you'd head back to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only got about three steps before something went wrong. A bright glow, like the one the monster who fired the blast had generated, suddenly appeared right at the spot where the blast had passed through you. You jerked in place, looking around in alarm.<br>\r\nThe light expanded until you were blinded, and when your vision cleared up...<br>\r\nIt seemed like that shot of magic wasn't quite as harmless as you thought.<br>\r\nYou recognized that you were still standing on the same stretch of footpath, but the area looked... bigger. Like, a <i>lot</i> bigger.<br>\r\nYou'd shrunk. You remembered seeing a monster perform tricks involving shrinking magic before. You'd even thought briefly about what it would be like to have it used on you, but...<br>\r\nWell, the reality was at least as scary as you'd imagined. You staggered back, slipping on the gap between two of the footpath's flat stones and falling over.<br>\r\nStill on the ground, you heard a rumble. Someone was approaching.</span></div></div>",

The left one pounded down not far from your position, and the towering girl halted. Breathless, you watched as she glanced downward.<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are.\" she said. You didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\nThe girl, as tall as a city building, stooped down toward you. You nervously got to your feet. She was very pretty, looking like she was somewhere from the very end of her teens to her early twenties. Her brown hair looked soft, and it framed a face with very distinctively attention-grabbing eyes. Still, you somehow felt a bit alarmed by her presence. Mostly the comment she'd made. She looked right at you, her lips splitting into a little smile.<br>\r\n\"Greetings.\" she said softly. Her voice was a gentle kind of trill. \"I saw what happened to you back there. I don't think those guys even noticed, so you're lucky I was passing by.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" you tried to reply. Your throat felt dry. \"Y-Yeah.\" you managed.<br>\r\n\"My name's Chara.\" she said, tilting her head aside a bit. \"Why don't you come up here with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you said, glad for the chance to be off the ground. \"And my name's-\"<br>\r\nYour voice was cut off as the girl -- Chara, apparently -- brought in a soft hand to pinch you off the path.

You still weren't certain why this girl made you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara stood upright, setting you in her open palm. You were so small that it would take several steps just to get from her wrist to the tips of her fingers. You shuddered.<br>\r\n\"See, it's not so scary once you're off the ground.\" Chara said. At least you could agree with that. \"Now sit tight.\"<br>\r\nYou were again stopped from replying, this time as she closed her hand over you, leaving you in darkness.<br>\r\nIt felt like no time at all before the thick fingers above opened up again. You blinked in surprise. You were in a building of some kind. How had she brought you here so fast...?<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Chara...?\" you said to her, putting the thought aside.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she replied, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Do you... know any way to get me back to normal? Those monsters back in the park, maybe?\"<br>\r\nChara giggled, and the sound sent an unexpected chill down your diminished spine. \"Of course! I can just go tell them, and I'm sure they can undo it.\"<br>\r\nYou were surprised. \"Oh-... G-Great! Let's do that now!\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Chara tilted her head to and fro before looking at you again. \"No.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"... What...?\" you responded, taken aback a bit. \"No?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I said.\" she confirmed. \"I found you, so I think I'll hold on to you for a little while.\"<br>\r\nYou blanched. \"B-But-... I need to get back to-\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, whatever you need, you'll get there.\" she said soothingly, patting a fingertip on your head. You didn't feel assured.</span></div></div>",

She lowered herself to the floor, keeping you steady.<br>\r\nYou yelped in panic when she flipped her hand, letting you drop to the carpeted floor. You were directly between her feet now.<br>\r\nHer legs spread around like a high wall, and her feet were at least as tall as the average one-floor building. Instantly the smell of her worn socks hit you, and you recoiled.<br>\r\nChara giggled and brought her feet together, nearly crushing you between them. She stopped just short, leaving you in a thin gap between her two soles. The smell became overwhelming; you coughed, staggering, and bumped against her right foot. Immediately, she brought its twin in against you, squashing your helpless body between the two.<br>\r\nYou could still hear her giggling as she kneaded at your pitiful frame with her feet, working you up to her toes. Once there, the digits assaulted your body, pummeling you all over. Sweat stuck to your body, accumulating quickly.<br>\r\nEventually, she forced your upper body into the gap between two toes, letting you break for air. You gagged, leaning out of the gap. Chara's face loomed before you. She still had that same damn smile.<br>\r\n\"You're doing great!\" she said with mock encouragement. \"Keep that up, and you might graduate to the inside of my sock!\"<br>\r\nYou would've shouted a reply if the scent of her toes weren't still clogging your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world flipped upside down, and Chara slammed your body to the carpet, pinning you under a single foot. Your arms and up were still free, but it wasn't much help.<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she cooed, gazing down at you with delight. \"Care to give me a kiss, right down there?\"<br>\r\nYou gagged and managed to shout at her, but it wasn't distinct. She just set a hand against her cheek, watching. You weren't getting out of this.<br>\r\n\"Just <i>one</i> kiss...\" she encouraged you.<br>\r\nThe scent was so bad that you hated the idea of opening your mouth for any reason, but Chara had you hooped.<br>\r\nDragging yourself forward, you forced your mouth against the fabric of her sock, directly between her two largest toes. The sweat was awful and stale on your tongue.<br>\r\nChara giggled once more at the sight.</span></div></div>",

There was a dull pounding in the back of your head as the vast young woman pinning you down gave another self-satisfied giggle. The sound was infuriating.<br>\r\n\"So sweet of you...\" she cooed in that same awful voice. To your surprise, Chara's foot lifted away from you. You groaned, trying to sit upright. Your body was horribly sore.<br>\r\nIt took you a moment to realize that Chara was up to something. She'd rolled backward a bit and was tugging her sock off of her left foot. You worried that she might be about to introduce you to her bare foot instead. Whatever she was planning, you were in no position to stop her.<br>\r\nHer smile only widened once she'd slipped her foot free and she returned her gaze to you.<br>\r\n\"C'mon up to me.\" she said cheerfully, closing her thin fingers over your body. You struggled to push the digits away, but it was a losing game.<br>\r\nThe girl angled you downward in her grip to see what was about to happen. She was spreading the opening of her sock wide with her other hand, directly beneath you.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll be able to hear you in there,\" she said, \"So, anything you want to say before that?\"<br>\r\nYou could barely work up the energy to shout at her, between your soreness and your new terror.<br>\r\n\"Ch-Chara, <i>please-!!\"</i> was all you could manage.<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she mumbled, twisting your body around for a moment. \"I'll think about it...\" she said. Without anything further, her fingertips released you.<br>\r\nYou gave a strangled yell, tumbling straight into the opening of the long sock. The colourful fabric billowed around you. With a light impact, gravity brought you to your destination.<br>\r\n\"Oof-!\"<br>\r\nThe interior of the sock felt like a strange sort of hammock. Considering the stale odour and the confinement, though, it was much more frightening than relaxing.<br>\r\nYour hands clutched pointlessly at the fabric, as if it could provide some sort of aid. There were no holes in the sock that you might have been able to wriggle through to escape.<br>\r\n\"I hope you can make some space in there.\" Chara's cheery voice cooed, \"Your roommate is coming back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light filtering in from high above at the sock's opening was blocked out. A very large bare foot was pushing its way back inside. Toes larger than your whole body rushed toward your position, and in entirely too little time, they struck your body once more.<br>\r\nChara pinched you securely between her two largest digits, and you could instantly feel the difference that being inside her sock made. Her skin was soft, but the sweat layering its surface made your own feel clammy with its touch.<br>\r\nThe scent returned in full force, and between the fumes permeating your limited air and the feeling of Chara's toes assaulting your body and demanding your total submission, you couldn't make out the words she was saying from beyond your prison.<br>\r\nThe torture went on, Chara treating your frail little body as nothing more than a bit of lint to squeeze and toy with. Your senses were beginning to abandon you as the seconds dragged on.<br>\r\nSlow thoughts drifted across your mind. Was this how your life was going to end? Were you about to die between the toes of a cold-hearted young woman like your life meant nothing?</span></div></div>",

Just earlier this evening, you'd almost been crushed by a book tipping over, but Frisk suddenly caught it just before it could flatten you, even though you thought she'd been out of the room already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was keeping an eye on you right now, in any case. It was a warm evening, and Frisk was wearing her pajamas and socks already, watching TV with you seated on her footrest. She was considerate enough to keep her feet clear of your position, as she doubted they smelled very good after what she'd been doing today.<br>\r\nShe was just giggling at something Mettaton had just said on the TV when your attention was drawn to the pair of feet to your right, crossed over one another. Her toes wriggled, their shapes poking through her socks.<br>\r\nYou felt awkward, just watching her feet like this, but they were... Well, there was <i>something</i> you found appealing. It was hard to explain.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hey, Frisk?\" you found yourself asking before you could stop yourself.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's up?\" she asked, lowering the TV's volume to hear you.<br>\r\n\"I-...Uhh, sorry, it's just...\"<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to ask this discreetly. Maybe just be direct...? Frisk had never gotten mad at you before. She was probably the most patient person you'd ever met.<br>\r\n\"I... OK.\" you tried again. \"Could I... massage your feet?\"<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nThe TV seemed silent in the pause that followed your request.<br>\r\nFrisk looked straight at you, and you felt like curling up into a silent ball and never speaking again.<br>\r\n\"... OK, sure?\" she said uncertainly. She set her feet separately on the footrest, and you approached, almost too eagerly. You slowed down, reminding yourself that you <i>didn't</i> want to weird her out.<br>\r\nYou took a position before Frisk's left foot. It was a fair bit taller than you, upright like this. Her toes just wriggled idly.<br>\r\nPlacing your palms against her sock's soft fabric, you gently began to work at her skin. It was warm, and the smell wasn't half as bad as it could have been.<br>\r\nYou kept going for a few seconds before leaning around her sole to look up at her face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, just checking -- can you feel this?\" you asked. You wondered if her sock might be too thick for your very small hands to have any effect.<br>\r\nFrisk hesitated. \"... No, actually.\" she said. \"Here...\"<br>\r\nShe reached down, grabbing at the end of her sock and tugging it off.<br>\r\nYou took a step back, looking over her bared sole. You weren't about to hell her out loud, but she had some very, <i>very</i> nice feet.<br>\r\nReturning to her sole, you got back to work.<br>\r\nFrisk giggled in the distance. Was she ticklish...?<br>\r\nYou had a sudden idea. You pressed yourself right up against her sole, putting your whole body into the effort. Your arms traveled to and fro, massaging all they could reach. You set your face against her smooth skin, loving the feeling of her contact.<br>\r\nOn and on you went, until you heard Frisk's voice through her laughter.<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, don't get too ahead of yourself-!\"<br>\r\nYou paused, realizing what you'd been doing. A patch of dampness marked the place where you'd just been placing your tongue. Your face melted into a luminescent blush. You hadn't realized just how into it you'd been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk loomed over you.</span></div></div>",

He didn't have anywhere he needed to be anytime soon, and, even if he did, Papyrus wasn't about to make him go. He lazed about on the couch, drank nearly five bottles of ketchup, and just enjoyed himself. He briefly considered going to Grillby's, but taking his brother, even if he was the only one who would know Papyrus was there, to a place Papyrus didn't like going, felt like an overstep in boundaries. He may love picking on his little brother, but he wasn't about to push him too far. When he finally got bored, he spent some time exchanging knock knock jokes with his friend behind the door, keeping them just a little quieter so not to wake Papyrus. A few hours in, he felt movement in his pocket. He said a quick goodbye, one hand holding Papyrus still so not to risk him fumbling his way out of the pocket, throwing an excuse over his shoulder as he headed to his post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapyrus woke to quiet voices and a stuffy, albeit soft, space. He shifted, trying to get out, only to suddenly be pinned down. \"Sans!\" he shouted, hoping he would be heard, as he tried harder to get free. \"Sans!?\" he shouted again, concerned by the lack of response. He kept shouting and struggling, but fell silent when something grabbed his legs. He gave a brief cry of panic as he was dragged out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSans blinked at Papyrus, hanging upside down from his fist, breathing hard. \"Uhhh\u2026 whoops.\" he said awkwardly, setting Papyrus carefully on the counter of his station. \"Didn't mean to spook ya, bro.\" Papyrus glared up at Sans, unhappy. \"You okay, paps? i didn't hurt ya, did i?\" he asked softly, looking closer to check for any possible damage he may have caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never do that again.\" Papyrus said sternly. \"I had no idea where I was or what was going on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSans flinched slightly. \"Sorry. Didn't think of that\u2026 just thought you'd be more comfortable in there\u2026\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, Sans, just don't do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" He sighed, straightening up a little. \"But I gotta go to my other sentry post.\"</span></div></div>",

He was usually good with lab safety, but this had gone from a good day to shit in less time than it took to even think the word 'shit'. He had planned to make a chemical to make the human tiny, that way maybe he would be able to stop them for good. Instead, the concoction had become gaseous and he had been forced to teleport into the main house before he got too small. Now, he was stuck on the table with his pet rock hoping Papyrus would get home soon. After about ten minutes of sitting there, beside the rock, with no other plan, he had fallen asleep. Today had been busy, after all, even for a lazy bones like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapyrus came inside. Sans was missing, and, like the incredible brother that he was, he was /terrified/. He had searched everywhere but his own home. The entire underground. Including Asgore's home. Though, now that he considered it, he hadn't checked the Ruins. That door was always sealed, after all. If he didn't find Sans here, he would just have to find some way into the Ruins. He started his search upstairs, nearly breaking down the door to Sans's room before remembering he had a key. Sans wasn't in there. He checked his own room, desperation more at fault for that hope than any real thought process. No Sans in there either. He slunk back down to the living room, about to head into the kitchen, when he heard soft snoring. He froze, focusing on the sound, and then began searching out its source. A very tiny doll of his brother sat beside the rock. Was their pet actually snoring now? He hadn't known their rock would take after Sans's sleeping habits. \"Sans\u2026\" he sighed worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026?\" Sans hummed sleepily, eyes opening at the presence of a loud voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapyrus froze, tensing, and focused on the doll. Its eyes were open. He screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHH!\" Sans screamed back, hands covering where his ears would be, if he had ears. At least Papyrus was finally home. </span></div></div>",

He hadn't thought this through. He should have at least stood on something higher up so Papyrus didn't look quite so much like a tower. He realized Papyrus was waiting for him to say something. \"Sup, P-Paps.\" he greeted. Papyrus's hands began approaching and he tried to get out of the way, but there wasn't anywhere he could escape to. He was swept into the massive palms and lifted up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapyrus stared in awed horror at his big brother. \"S-Sans\u2026 wh-what happened to you?\" he asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSans relaxed quickly. Papyrus wouldn't hurt him. Not ever. And he knew that well. Being this size was still making everything look like a threat, but he knew he knew better than to be afraid of Papyrus. \"Lab accident.

Statistically, the chances of failure were practically non-existent, but the past five attempts had all failed in one way or another, so Alphys was still unsure about this new run of her experiment.<br>\r\nThe lizard monster shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Confidence, Alphys.\" she muttered. She'd been working on her self-esteem ever since leaving the Underground, but even with the help of her many great friends, she wasn't quite over her past insecurities just yet.<br>\r\nShe turned a few dials on the large machine before her. If all went well, the old instant noodle cup resting on the footstool before the machine would become very hard to see in a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for the machine to warm up, Alphys looked toward the other end of her lab. Her girlfriend, the fish-looking monster Undyne, was enjoying a power-nap on the worn couch opposite the work area.<br>\r\nUndyne was the gym teacher at Toriel's human-monster school, and as school had just let out an hour ago, Undyne was happy to drop by her girlfriend's lab, though not so eager as to skip out on the chance for a nap while Alphys finished her day's work.<br>\r\nAlphys blushed, remembering the nearly aggressive kiss Undyne had pulled her in for upon her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine let off a soft beep to indicate readiness. Alphys carefully aimed a funnel-shaped component at the old noodle cup and pressed one last button. The machine whirred to life and let off a jet of light from the funnel.<br>\r\nIt struck the noodle cup instantly.<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, garbage.\" Alphys said, watching eagerly.<br>\r\nJust as she hoped, the noodle cup began to visibly distort for a moment before starting to diminish in size. Alphys hit the button again to stop the process.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes yes <i><b>yes!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\nShe practically jumped off the floor in excitement at the success of her experiment. Approaching the stool, she looked over its surface.<br>\r\nShe spotted the noodle cup. It was barely the size of a bit of dust.<br>\r\nAlphys couldn't contain her joy; this experiment had taken weeks, but now it was a success.<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell someone, even if Undyne was the only one around. She headed for the couch, where Undyne was still sprawled lazily, snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys was right next to the couch when she froze, hearing a loud hum from across the room.<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" she mumbled, turning on the spot. <br>\r\nThe machine was active again.<br>\r\n\"No no <b><i>no!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\nThere was a flash of blinding light, and Alphys felt a strange sensation all over her body.<br>\r\nAnd then she was falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the ground, scrambling quickly back up.<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\nShe could still see the machine, but it was so <i>far away...</i><br>\r\nThe beam had somehow been briefly activated again, and she'd been caught in it.<br>\r\nA roaring sound broke into the air, causing her to jump with a startled yell. She spun around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the couch, apparently. Looming high over her was the barely-moving and truly gigantic form of Undyne.<br>\r\nHer girlfriend was lying on her side, one of her muscled arms resting over her chest. At this scale, Alphys could make out the patterns of scales lining Undyne's skin with ease.<br>\r\nAnother terrifying roar echoed from Undyne's mouth as she continued to snore.<br>\r\nAlphys didn't know what to do.</span></div></div>",

The towering fish monster loved her more than anything -- a fact that never failed to make Alphys blush furiously -- and was her best bet in finding safety at her diminished size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to wake her up.<br>\r\nUndyne let off another very loud snore. She wouldn't be waking up easily without some help of her own.<br>\r\nAlphys hesitantly approached her girlfriend's upturned arm. Her bicep alone was taller than Alphys was. She took a shaky hold on one of the scaly sections of Undyne's arm and tried to lift herself up.<br>\r\nAnother loud snore, and Alphys suddenly felt very intimidated by the sight of Undyne's teeth. They were very large and very sharp -- two qualities that were only accentuated by Alphys' own presently unimpressive size. Sure, they looked wonderful in Undyne's big smile, but right now?<br>\r\nShe tried to ignore the sight as she scrambled onto Undyne's upper arm. Her girlfriend's dark red hair was draped over her arm just a bit here. She planted her feet and addressed Undyne's sideways face.

The conveyor belt he was standing on led him to a long and dark room encased in spiderwebs. He heard a soft feminine giggle echo through the room, but Frisk stayed determined and continued walking down the long hallway.<br>\r\n\"They said that a human wearing a striped shirt will come over here.\" the feminine voice said \"I hear they hated spiders\" she continued. \"Not me\" Frisk said to himself, he loved everything.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I heard they like to stomp on them\" said the voice. \"Not usually...\" Frisk thought to himself. Frisk's pace started to slow down, as he was having trouble walking due to all of the cobwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard they like to tear their legs off\" the voice spoke again. Whoever this woman was she obviously never met Frisk, he was the most lovable thing in the world! Most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard...\" the voice said. Frisk then stopped, the spiderwebs had completely enveloped him up to his shoulders. \"That they are really stingy with their money\" the voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room then lit up and the source of the voices was revealed. It was a spider girl with 7 eyes, that was wearing a short red dress. \"You think your taste is too refined for our pastries, don't you deary ?\" she said. \" Ahuhuhu... I disagree with that notion. I think your taste... Is exactly what this next batch needs!\" she continued. The room then started to flash white, which usually indicates that a fight is going to happen. But for some reason it didn't? When Frisk opened his eyes again he was back at the same room again. The only difference was that the spider girl was now gone.\"This isn't right, she couldn't have just disappeared. She must be somewhere in this room\" Frisk thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started to struggle hoping to remove the webs that were restricting his movement. After a few minutes he was free once again so he started investigating. He went to the spot where the spider girl used to be. He then heard a faint voice:\"Hey human!\". Frisk then turned around only to find that no one was behind him.\"Down here, human!\" the faint voice spoke again. Frisk the followed the instructions and looked down. Standing in between his shoes was the spider girl, only much, much smaller. \"Great now we can...\" the spider woman said only to be interrupted by Frisk quickly grabbing her. Frisk then moved her in front of his face to get a better look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?</span></div></div>",

He put his gloves back on as the door hissed open, releasing pressure locks and groaned as it slid across the floor. Normally the sirens above the door would go off to let others know it was being opened but, Mettaton shut them off. After a minute has passed, the door fully opens and stops. Lights high above in the large 1000ft room dimly light the thing inside. Mettaton was in awe in what he saw. Ahead was a robot body exactly like his own form, except it was 500ft tall.

At the base was a terminal and a strange device. Looking at the terminal, Mettaton saw text files about this project as well as a video file. The video file was an anime about a giant robot fighting a monster, which Mettaton rolled his eyes at. However, the text files were Alphys' journal entries on why this thing was made and how it worked. Not to Mettaton's surprise, Alphys got the idea from watching an anime with giant robots. The plan was when the time was right, Mettaton would transfer his soul to this body and use it as a weapon of war against the humans.

To no avail though as his throat muscles pull you in to your fate with a loud <b>*gulp*</b>. The muscles continue pulling you down inside until you fall into a chamber full of some type of clear liqiud. The walls are still the same gray squishy muscle, but the liquid seems to be non-reactive. But you spoke too soon, as the liquid starts disolving your clothes and eventually your flesh.
