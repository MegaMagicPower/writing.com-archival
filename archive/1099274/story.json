Roll cocked her head to the side a bit, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayl? What's the matter? You looked a little... Spooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl brushed her hair back, and began to explain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just on the TV... There's some wacko virus going around, and it's only infecting female NetNavis... And, somehow, it seems to be able to cross into the physical world. It makes them bloat up like whales...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out another sigh, one of exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to turn you off until this blows over, Roll. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as she was about to deactivate her PET...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayl, wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand was stayed, for the moment, and Roll began to speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try and handle this. Go and tell the boys, and see if they can jack in. If it won't affect male NetNavis, maybe it won't affect men, either... And, in the meantime, maybe you can go somewhere else. Leave the PET in here, and... I don't know... Get a bite to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl considered it. With this bizarre virus going around, she might end up being the thinnest girl in town, if she was careful... No reason not to indulge in a meal. And Roll knew how to handle herself... And she wouldn't be alone, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Alright. I'll go call them up, and see if they can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo phone calls and fifteen minutes later, GutsMan, MegaMan, and Roll were jacked in, and standing in the middle of the NetSquare. However, they were not there long before a scream rang out, and a comely female Navi came running from a horde of grinning, spherical viruses, clad in traditional white chef's hats and brandishing covered entree dishes springing after her. She almost looked like she would have gotten away, when a gigantic, fridge-like virus dropped in front of her from the air, blocking her path. In an instant the door whipped open, and a white light cast its frosted glare over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Noo-oooh... Oh. That... That looks <i>good.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought down to her knees, and slowly shuffled over to the fridge. From where they stood, MegaMan.EXE and his friends could hear the sounds of slovenly, unrestrained gorging. The impish little chefs cast a death glare at the fridge, clucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk! No <i>fun.</i> Stupid Fridge! No fun for <i>us...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, one of them drew their gaze past the Fridge.EXE and its slowly burgeoning victim, to the feminine form of Roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! <b>Ah! Look!</b> Another one! <i>GET HER! <b>JAM HER FULL!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as the word was out, they all leaped forth into action, intent on stuffing her to the gills...</span></div></div>",

Desperately, MegaMan looked around for an escape route, and his eyes were drawn to a path to the side that would lead them away... But it would be impossible for them to get to it in time. But just then, GutsMan stepped out to meet the feeding frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave this to me! I'll stomp those runts flat! You two go on ahead... And don't let anything happen to Roll, or I'll <i>knock you into next week...!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, GutsMan. Come on Roll... We have to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a further word, they sprinted down the path. GutsMan occupied the feed-happy horde, glowering as they pulled out all assortment of cooking utensils... Knives, forks, ladles, whisks and spatulas and egg beaters, cleavers and potato peelers... He regarded them all with a huff, and began to charge, rearing his fist back, windmilling it a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to take me on? I don't think... THAT YOU HAVE THE <b>GUTS! <i>YEEEEEE-HAAAAAW!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fight began with a devastating haymaker, sending a group of viruses flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff... I, I think we lost them... I hope GutsMan is alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan put his hand on Roll's shoulder as a comforting gesture. \"He'll be alright. He's not going to be beaten by a bunch of small fries like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, reassured. \"You're right. We'll meet up with him later... But, for now... Where are we...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around... They'd ran so fast and far, it almost seemed like a blur. This place was unfamiliar... The floor tiles were decorated in intricate patterns, in pastel colors... After a few seconds, MegaMan recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yumland? We couldn't have gone that far... But then, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked ahead to a security cube, blocking off further access to the area, when suddenly, they heard voices from behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So glad the boss showed up... That bruiser will get it now, for sure! I still can't believe he deleted so many of us... Nasty, <i>nasty</i> man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of the manic little cook viruses plodded along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But at least he gave us the code to get back in... Guess it's time for the big guns...?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups took a good, long look at each other, before the viruses pulled out some non-stick frying pans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S THEM! <b>GET 'EM!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan smirked. \"We can handle you three!\" He let loose a volley of virus busting code, taking down one who did not bring his pan to guard quick enough. The other two attacked quickly, one diverting MegaMan's attention while the other appeared in front of Roll, cackling a bit as it brought forth an entree dish and lifted the lid, revealing a sumptuous looking plate of cinnamon rolls, glazed with a thick layer of icing... They glistened on the plate, a delicious smell of cinnamon wafting over, filling her nostrils. A sensory overload of sight and scent overcame her, and she felt compelled to devour the entirety of the plate...</span></div></div>",

Yet the cook virus continued to advance on her, Roll knowing calling out for Mega Man's help would result in an instant force feeding. She merely stared him down as he grinned manically, still tempting her with his alluring entree dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I have <i>other</i> ways of making you comply with this new diet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll's eyes widened, but she kept her stern posture. \"I bet you don-Mmmpttth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she opened her mouth, she was assaulted by an entire volley of cinnamon rolls, sent directly into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually you were right, though lucky for me, you're still an idiot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll's eyes rolled slightly up from the rich taste which met her mouth. After a few large chews, she managed to stomach the entirety of the cinnamon rolls, licking her lips. Besides the stuffed belly, it was Roll's face which proved she was under the virus' spell. Recomposing herself, she walked towards the cook virus with a dopey smile, patting her globular, yoga-ball belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, pleeeeeaaaase tell me you have more where that came from...\" She pratically moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the boss is going to just <i>love</i> you.\" Beckoning the stuffed Navi to follow him, the virus waddled over to the security cube and after inserting a card, the two left Mega Man to fight off the oncoming horde, unaware he'd already failed Roll succumbing to this bizarre virus outbreak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roll followed the small virus in a daze which was only kept up on the virus' behalf by constantly re-feeding small samples of her beloved cinnamon rolls, they stopped at a clearing. \"Eh? He oughta be here. Man, why we've gotta be outranked by this clown's a mystery to me, but whatever. Chubby chops, just wait here, allright?\" Before Roll could even answer, he'd already left, stranding her in the middle of apparently nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man, this is bad. At least that cravings subdued now... I've gotta catch up with the others!</i> Claiming back her self-control due to the lack of sugary temptations, Roll started to look for an exit. She wasn't hit that badly: just a bit of extra softness on her thighs and stomach, nothing a bit of exercise could work off. The pure euphoria she experienced while eating concerned her however: she'd have to avoid even smelling any food if she wanted to get out of this slim and taut. Yet just as she had found what she thought to be the path back to where Mega Man was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire floor started to quake, enough to send Roll flying backwards onto her butt. Retreating slightly, she jumped back to meet this aggressor from a safe distance. Earlier, she had just established that naturally tasting, but even smelling any food was probably enough to send her flying off into a half-conscious eating frenzy. Sight couldn't possibly be that much of a factor of what could make her subside to the forces of gluttony, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stood in-front of her was a slightly-built boy, with a tall and confident posture, jet black hair and a warm, friendly expression. The only thing which would've suggested what stood a few metres from Roll wasn't a Navi was the slightly <i>too</i> inviting smile, or his yellow eyes which constantly darted around Roll and her surroundings, as if he was quickly measuring her and her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the massive arm cannon, still dripping with a slight amount of something creamy looking he had in place of an arm and how his body was richly decorated in icing with embedded candy drops, which glimmered like alluring jewels on an extravagant royal robe. Yeah, that was probably a bigger giveaway than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, aren't you just the cutest little Navi!\" He said, as Roll tried to plan how she would size-up the situation. He looked appetizing in more ways than one to be sure, but there was no doubt he'd be trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, don't be shy! I'm Candy Man. What's yours?\" He reached out a hand as Roll hesitated for a moment, looking at the outstretched hand as if it was about to detonate. \"... It won't bite. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided complying to whatever this 'Candy Man' for the first few moments would at least buy her some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Roll.\" she quietly muttered as she shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a sweet name for a sweet looking girl.\" He chuckled, though there was a hint of force behind it. \"So, I'm guessing you've heard about all these viruses recently breaking out, fattening the virtual and real world female population. Seen any of those cook viruses behind it yet?\" He simply seemed to be making light conversation to lead onto something bigger, but Roll didn't want to risk acting brash with this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah. One managed to get me but he ran off a few moments ago... I'm alright.\" She nervously said, not wanting to elaborate too much on the addictive food to encourage this guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, I hope you weren't too beaten up. Those viruses are so rough, aren't they?\" He started to walk closer, and now outstretched his icing-filled arm cannon, as his tone started to drop to a more cynical, sarcastic tone. \"I mean, who decided to put them in charge? Somebody had to know how to properly treat ladies like yourself with respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll turned to run, yet a quick blast from Candy Man's cannon stuck both her feet in place, the icing drying up like colorful cement. \"And such a smart lady too, from the looks of it. Tut tut, but such a <i>skinny</i> figure too, shame you're body doesn't seem as bouncy and cheerful as your face.\" As he smirked, Roll started to whimper. His cannon was dangerously close to her mouth now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't really want to go through with this, do you?\" Roll nervously asked, beads of digital sweat dropping down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy Man paused. \"Actually, I think I want to do this more than anything else in the world, especially on such a cute Navi like yourself. I'm gonna make the whole world taste good! Though first...\" He collected a small dab of icing with his other finger, and jabbed it into Roll's mouth. She stopped protesting and with a cute yet only slightly-aware grin, opening her mouth. Her watering eyes were the only visible proof of non-compliance on her face. \"I love it when they realize how much they want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click, the cannon started to whir into gear, aimed directly at Roll's anticipating mouth. \"<b>FILL 'ER UP!!!</b>\"</span></div></div>",

Roll herself would've expected her to have a similarly unpleasant experience yet... As the icing flowed well into her body, Roll managing to feel the digital substance move all around her body as if it were washing over her, she was... feeling pretty bouncy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly in a state of bliss or euphoria, but contrary to her protest mere seconds earlier, she was rather enjoying Candy Man's forced feeding, moving her arms away from the vibrating cannon and moving them on her slowly ballooning body. As she poked and prodded her softening belly, she felt Candy Man slowly pick her up and start to walk off, holding her like a huge baby with a bizarre bottle. She giggled at this mental image, again slowly forgetting this virus was fully intent on pulling her into immobility and... Well, <i>nobody</i> was really sure what the reasoning behind the fattening virus outbreak had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Roll had well entered the 300's, her belly now touting her namesake. She could also feel her butt growing softer, slightly oozing over Candy Man's palm. Still sucking away with a look of pure-complacency, Candy Man suddenly removed the pump. Roll quickly turned to him, yet accidentally letting out a satisfied burp in his face. \"Whoops... Eh, sorry Candy Man. What's with taking away the pump?\" She saw his smile take a turn for the devious. \"Plotting something else for me?\" Roll said, with only polite-curiosity in her voice despite her context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't you worry you cute little button, the Candy man here's gonna make sure you have more than your fair share. But now that you're all warmed up to the idea of being... Well, I guess the sky's the limit in this case!\" Roll giggled a bit. \"Heh, there's no sky in the Net!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, that's even less to worry about hitting while blimping you up! But what I was really going to say was, don't you think your Navi operator ought to have just as much fun as you?\" Roll snorted in laughter. \"Pffft, I doubt Mayl would find this fun! Though all of this weight does get instantly added to her once we talk to each other, right?\" \"Right.\" \"And... Will she gain as much as I gain afterward?\" \"If the plan's all it's cracked up to be, then yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll call her up now. Heh, funny thing about all this Candy Man- I wasn't meant to talk to her AT ALL if something like this happened! But... Eh, she'll like this, won't she?\" Roll asked, moving her hands around her flabby frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll come to appreciate it the same way you have. Though I doubt she'll be nearly as adorable a beached whale as you'll be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll blushed at the rather bizarre compliment, yet before contacting Mayl, paused. \"Well, if I help you with your plan... Can you tell me what you're doing with us? Both in the Net and in Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy Man paused for a moment, then sighed, obviously frustrated at how long this process was taking. \"Very well, Roll. Our boss, in the real world, wants... Well, you know how some people like collecting things?\" Roll nodded. \"Well, this particular person likes to collect Navi's. But more importantly, their operators. And even more specifically, <i>girls</i>. But of course, that's frowned in society...\" Roll's face was blank. \"That's... That's kind of <i>weird</i> I guess.\" \"Very. But don't tell anybody I said that, the boss can get very... 'Passionate' about this life work of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why all the fattening then?\" Roll asked, starting to eye the cannon which was half-carrying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"'The more the merrier'. I honestly wish I could tell you more about why somebody in the real world would want so many girls the size of warehouses, but at least me and the others get our fair share of these stupid 'real' girl's Navi's! We've been programmed to want you as such.\" He ended, prodding Roll's pink belly before starting up his cannon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's give 'Mayl' a quick little call before we start up again, alright Roll?\"</span></div></div>",

The location on the screen didn't seem to be Mayl's house, either... Rather, it was some sort of bakery. Roll broke away from her suckling of the cannon, causing a stray pump of icing to drizzle down her front. \"...Mayl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was answered by a voice that came from off-screen. \"Roll? Is that you? Are you alright? Lan and Dex called and told me you got separated from the others! Did you find anything out?\" Slowly, the source of the voice came onscreen, and it took Roll a moment to recognize it as her operator. She was clad thickly, in umpire's gear, shades, and oven mitts, and held a pair of tongs and a pen in her hand, apparently the methods by which she hoped to prevent transference of the virus, if Roll had caught it... Which indeed she had. The pretty pink netnavi didn't fail to notice the box of doughnuts that sat on the bed beside her. Mayl sighed. \"I knew I said I'd leave the PET at home, but when I heard that you'd been separated from everyone... I just got so worried... And... Um.\" With a jangle of clasps, the operator cocked her head to the side quizzically. \"Roll, did you...? Oh no! You've got the virus!\" Mayl looked down to her figure, to see if it had been bloating up without her realizing.</span></div></div>",

She looked to find her savior, and witnessed the strangest Navi she'd ever seen. Standing only 4'6\" in normal measurements, it, no, SHE, was powerfully built, with long arms coated in armor, two strange weapons(they looked like machine guns) hanging from her hands. She was angular and smooth, possibly alluding to exceptional agility. A red visor covered her eyes, a square, cyclopian bar acting as an eye. Short, cropped black hair was flowing out from an angled helm from which the visor hung, swaying a little as the recoil settled. But what caught Roll's attention was the thing that had CAUSED the recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive cannon was attached to its back, smoking slightly from a slender barrel. Whirring sounds could be heard as the barrel flipped over where it connected to the main gun, folding up for storage. The strange Navi had had to brace itself just to use the thing! However, Roll wasn't worried about the newcomer just now. Candy Man had recovered from the blast, and now had a wicked, sadistic grin on his face. His teeth were sharper than before, and his yellow eyes were gleaming evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty naughty, little girl. You shouldn't be messing with the big boys, hmm?\" He brought up his icing cannon, charged it up, and unleashed an enormous hailstorm of sugary sweetness, the sinuous, thick rope of icing headed straight for the other Navi. Roll gasped and yelled out a warning as the stream flowed out towards its target. \"NO! LOOK OUT!\" She was too late. The thick stream collided with the other one, seemingly deleting it in one shot. With that one out of the way, Roll was now the prime target again. \"Oh no, not again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy Man was looking royally pissed. His mouth was set in a vicious smile, his eyes glazed over with a maniacal look. \"Now, my dear, back to our little matter...\" Taking another swig of icing from his cannon, he thrust his fingers into Roll's mouth, and her eyes glazed over yet again. A small roll of pudge formed from this piece, and he laughed evilly. \"This kind of icing is ten times more fattening than any known substance on earth. And now, you'll be my first victim... ha ha ha.... Now... [b]FILL 'ER UP![b/]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick liquid streamed into Roll's stomach, and soon, she became fit for her name. Ten seconds into the liquid stuffing, her features were softening immediately, a small double chin forming. Her belly began to flow out, pooling out into her lap, and her thighs and hips thickened, filling up with calories as the stuff kept pumping. Thirty seconds into it, she looked to be two hundred pounds. As he continued to stuff her, another huge laser blast erupted into his vision, and he was blown clear across the stage and off the edge. Roll simply cried out for more of the hyper-fattening treat, crawling toward the drop off in hopes of reaching that sweet ambrosia. But a strong metal hand gripped her arm and dragged her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-! What're you doing? I have to get moooorrrrrreeee!!!!!\" she whined. \"Besides, I can't go with strange Navis I don't know!\" Roll looked up to see the mysterious one she saw earlier, coated in a sugary film that dripped off the edges of her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! We have to get going before that freak comes back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't even know your name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small Navi looked back to her. Retracting the red visor, Roll looked into her smooth grey eyes, and calmed down immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want a name, call me Mesa. Mesa Chateau.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you need images of what Mesa looks like, here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thewiredblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/ac4figure.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thewiredblog.com/wp-content/u...</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sungsfamily.net/bbs/files/attach/images/983/1856/100_1140.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sungsfamily.net/bbs/files/att...</a>)</span></div></div>",

Find cover somewhere while I take down this wave of goons... Maybe the last room we were in... Just hurry!\" Mesa commanded a slightly dazed Roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll nodded in acknowledgment, dashing (or moving as quickly as she could in her now corpulent frame) to the nearest exist from where they'd come. Unfortunately, she'd neglected the possibility that a certain 'sweet' guy wasn't as deleted as she'd hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited in the next room with her slightly drooping tummy in one hand, she heard a familiar voice over her shoulder. \"You sure are a tough one to keep down... Roll, was it? Now, where were we?\" Jumping back, Roll turns around and keeps her ground, despite her somewhat pudgier frame. \"I don't know how you're still here... But I'm not falling for your 'charm' again!\" Candy Man merely laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a shame to hear that I can't smooth talk you again, sweetie. But-\" Uplifting his icing cannon, he started to eye her closely, as if expecting a certain reaction. \"... I'm fairly sure you're eager to help me out regardless. You have to 'get moooorrrrrreeee', don't you Roll?\" He said in a comical exageration of what she'd cried out at the end of their previous meeting. As he smirked, Candy Man's cannon started to drip ever-so-slowly, to further bait the vulnerable Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I mean, YES!\" Roll suddenly realized what she was saying. \"No! I meant to say no, you creep! You heard me, I said <i>'Yes</i>... Wait-\" She realized that even in the presence of the viruses' addictive substance her mind started to cloud up. She started to swagger a bit, losing her footing and falling flat on her stomach, without moving for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Hello?\" Candy Man said, begining to nervously ponder if his pump was just as apt at killing Navi's. He quickly walked up to her and lifting up her head, saw Roll slowly open her eyes with a warm smile. \"I still think you're a creep, but I've made my decision-\" With a short pause, she bellowed in mimicking the Candy Man earlier \"<b>FILL ME UP!</b>\" Pulling the icing cannon with one of her chubby arms and wedging it in her mouth, she beckoned him to do his deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the liquid started to slowly flow back into the Navi's gullet, with Roll purring happily, Candy Man let out a sigh of relief. \"THAT was a close one. The boss would throw a fit if we screwed up fattening these girls... And I bet he'll like you just fine once I'm done with you... Heh heh heh.\"</span></div></div>",

He trudged steadily along the horrid path, trying to keep away from the destruction. A hand shot out of a pile of rubble, grabbing Megaman's leg. He felt like he jumped a mile out of his cyber skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They came from the blackness...creatures from the abyss, with utensils from kitchens...so many...not enough firepower to stop all of the enemy...Find the Savior, he's the only one who can stop...the...mena...ce...\" an odd-looking Navi rasped, his face covered by an odd respirator. The armor he donned was an odd gray, camo-ed in a unique pattern. An oddly shaped eight point star, red, white and blue, stood in the middle of a white field. Megaman found it odd a person would customize their Navi like that. But a rare chip suddenly appeared on screen, stopping Megaman from his ponderings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GA/U-8 Supra-Cannon...\" it said, Megaman reading it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...wonder what it does...\" Lan said over the connection.

He was flying his F-22 Raptor through the canyons in this \"Net\" as those he met called it. His AI was worried about him, running thorough system checks every few minutes. The missile impacted instantly, vaporizing the cheflike virus. He strafed a gang that was trying to attack a female \"Navi,\" a manifestation of a AI used to destroy viruses and perform usual tasks. He landed near her, the jets of the Raptor screaming loudly as it descended. As soon as it touched, he leapt out, rushing over to the Navi's side. She appeared to be uninjured, except her massive stomach and large thighs, giant breasts, and pudgy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...thank you,\" she sighed, almost in a dreamy way. She rubbed her massive gut, happily almost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. By the way, what's your name?\" he asked. His blond hair flopped back onto his head, his blue eyes shining through his Naruto-like hair. THe goggles on his forehead slipped over his forehead and onto his eyes. His original clothing had been replaced when he and Prier had entered this dimension and looked like most armor that Navis had. Except his helmet, which was shaped like a flight helmet and had a respirator shaped like a flight mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Rayde,\" she replied, sinking into her soft hips. She stood up and gave him a small peck on the cheek as a thank you gift, eliciting a blush from the 18-year old young man. \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cirrus Ragnair. Sorry, but I'm technically not a Navi,\" he laughed. He then caught sight of the massive Ribbita on a screen, looking at her with an expression of shock. She had to be at least a ton by now, if not more. Judging by how her jacket hung on the outside of her massive girth, and how her shirt rode up on her large breasts, she weighed at LEAST a ton. At least a thousand ice cream buckets were stacked behind her, adding to her gluttonous image. She was trying to prevent her skirt from snapping on live television as she expanded even further. She was almost in tears from how embarrassing her situation was. He activated seven gold, strangely runed rings on his left hand, and reached into the screen. </span></div></div>",

She began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhh....It's all right...\" he whispered to Ribbita as she bawled. Her tears were those of sorrow, and Cirrus couldn't stand that.

But now I'm ugly!\" she cried, shaking her fat, and looking thoroughly disgusted by it. \"My butt is the size of a park bench, my belly a full-grown grizzly, my breasts oversized beachballs, and my thighs tree trunks! And I've got two chins!\" she continued, sniffling. But what she didn't expect was Cirrus to hug her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now...don't be that way. I like you, I'll admit that,\" he said with a wink as he rested his head on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I'm a BLIMP! I'll never get another decent job...\" she whimpered, but then she sighed a little as Cirrus began rubbing her belly. \"Keep going...\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I need to call in something to get us out of here,\" he said, stopping for a few seconds to pull out a com link. Ribbita looked at him curiously, wondering what he could be up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting us a ride, if you want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay,\" she said, falling flat on her butt again. She sank into her expansive hips, thinking that it wasn't that bad, even as Cirrus continued to try and contact help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Lan, help me up,\" Mayl pleaded as she continued to grow, reaching 1,000 pounds within only minutes of hearing of the virus. Her leggings were tearing, as was her shirt. She had a double chin, basketball breasts, and a gut that looked like she swallowed fifteen pillows, and almost as soft. Her thighs were thicker than a support beam, causing her steps to thud every time she walked, if she could. Her cheeks were puffy, giving her a cute appearance with their pinkness. Lan rushed down the stairs to his huge girlfriend, Helping her sit up. She was stuck in the house, no doubt about that. Having tried to heed Ribbita's warning(who was probably the size of a house already, she hadn't seen her on the news), she now gave up her resolve to get out and figure a way to stop growing. Pound after pound had piled on her form, and it continued to do so even now. Staying was the only option as she started outgrowing her leggings, her thighs thickening even more. It wouldn't have mattered; she would've still grown to the size of a house anyway, just somewhere else where her house would still be standing. But now, she was going to demolish her own house in a matter of hours because of her extreme gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayl, I know this looks bad, but come on, Megaman will find Roll and it'll be all right,\" Lan said, trying to comfort her. He tried holding her, but she batted him away, looking entirely forlorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't all that bad...at least you're not as large as Ribbita is now,\" he said, trying to put on a cool facade. Maylu then gripped the collar of his shirt, and glared at him with such intensity his blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right NOW I'm not. But what happens if I do become as big, or bigger than her? Will you leave me? WILL YOU? This virus is causing me to gain weight so rapidly that I'm literally bursting out my clothes. I won't be able to fit anything soon. I won't even be able to get up either. I may even become so fat that I'll destroy my house. How is that not bad?\" she asked viciously, tightening the grip n his collar. All he did was sweat a little. Mayl released him and started crying, her blubbery body shaking from her emotions. Lan sat next to her, putting his arm around her and pecking her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayl, I promise I will see this through with you to the end. I loved you and still will. Even if you do outgrow your home,\" he said, hugging her tightly. Mayl smiled at this, and rested her head on his shoulder. Her body, now past 1,200 pounds, felt so warm to Lan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of her own bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was huge; her body had spilled all over the floor at this point, her dress was nearly ripped at her massive thighs and barely hid her huge white undies, while her top strained to keep in her rapidly developing breasts. Her stomach had pillowed out several metres in front of her, rippling with the slightest provocation. Lan couldn't help but smile a bit. \"Lan! It's NOT FUNNY!\" Mayl screamed through her ballooning cheeks, looking like a fat but cute chipmunk. \"I can hardly even move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he simply grinned some more. \"Well, with a tone like that, I'm not exactly sure I'm inclined to help you.\" \"WHAT? Lan, how could you!\" He started to giggle, but quickly waved his hands in the air. \"What, do you <i>really</i> want to stop?\" She shouted again. \"Of course I do! I don't see why you're milling about so much seeing as you're the boyfriend- ... Oh. <i>Ohhhhhh</i>.\" Her face cleared up a bit as her stomach started to ooze out further. \"Do I spy a certain somebody with a certain taste for fat girls?\" Lan's face dropped. \"No Mayl, I was joking, I was-\" \"Lan, you've never been subtle! I can even read it on your face now! If you wanted me chunkier all along, you could've said something! I HATED dieting!\" \"... Alright, I admit it! Though what'd we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl pondered for a moment, lifting a sagging arm to a cheek. \"Hmm... Well, you can wait until I reach a certain size I guess, and then somehow stop it. I NEVER expected you to be into this Lan!\" She giggled, while Lan simply blushed.</span></div></div>",

Mayl could barely restrain her laughter, her multiple chins slightly jigglying. \"God Lan, why didn't you just date a giant beanbag? It'd pretty much be the same experience!\" Lan merely snickered and lay down on her round, soft and exposed stomach, slightly sinking into his girlfriend's mass like a human chair. Mayl was thrilled to find that her boyfriend was ecstatic over her predicament, let alone understanding, but... This was <i>boring</i>. She didn't exactly feel like sitting near the front door as Lan rolled all over her like a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long until you reckon your clothes burst forever?\" Lan eventually piped up ten minutes later, slightly lower to the ground as Mayl continued to expand, even though at a significantly lower rate. \"I still want SOME kind of decency Lan! And this isn't permanent; the moment I'm another 1000, we try to stop this thing. Then we wait for the cure, which I'm TAKING, Lan. I'm only remaining optimistic for your benefit.\" Lan's face drooped a bit. \"Aww, fine then. Though I'll help get you some larger clothes, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl calmed a bit. \"That'd be nice... Just grab something from my bedroom!\" Lan nodded and got up, lightly slapping her jiggly ass as he rushed off towards her bedroom. \"... Why do I have a bad feeling I've just somehow encouraged him even further?\" A few longer-than-they-should've-been moments later, it clicked. \"Laaaan, it doesn't take that long to find some clothes! You better not be raiding what I think you're raiding!\" She heard him call out through the hallway \"And what if I aaaaam? What're you gonna do, sit on me?\" \"LAAAAAAANNN!!!\" Lan returned almost instantly. \"Fine fine, don't need to try and throw a fit. I found something that'll fit you better then you're ripped dress anyway.\" Mayl turned to look at what he was holding, which was easier said then done with her pratically non-existent neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge two piece bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could curse him, she realized that whether she liked it or not, the materials it was made of probably did mean it would fit her better than her barely holding bra which was pratically bursting from her corpulent boobs. Yet she also realized this meant something else, which Lan, seemingly knowing long before-hand, pointed out. \"Eh... I'm gonna have to dress you Mayl. I don't think you can... Um... Not in your state.\" He awkwardly said, knowing this could be ranging anywhere between awkward to all out humiliating for his partner. Mayl sat there silent a bit. \"... Fine, whatever. But you better promise not to laugh, or I WILL sit on you!\" Lan simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tore away the few remaining bits of Mayl's dress and bra, her huge breasts pratically flowed outwards like a breaking dam, one hitting him squarely in the face. Quickly wiping his nose clean for blood, he started to cover them with a bright orange coloured bikini top, which while holding up her slightly sagging breasts a little, left even less to the imagination. \"Umm, Mayl? How'd you want me to put this on?\" Lan pointed to the bikini bottom. Mayl's face froze. \"I don't. Lan, I'm not an idiot; besides you probably suffocating down there, I'm not exactly sure I trust you squirming around my fat to undress and redress me.\" Lan chuckled. \"Pppffth, I don't know what kinda guy you take me for Mayl, but what'd you think I'd be able to pull off under 2000 pounds of pure teenaged girl?\" As he started to unwind again, he lay down between her massive chest, now nearly entirely submerged in a white smooth blanket of fat. \"Besides, I could think of <i>several</i> things we could both pull of here.\" Taking a blush from Mayl as a visual cue, he starts to make his way to Mayl's face and, hugging her neck, closes in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them kiss, Yai unexpectedly walks in through the still busted front door...</span></div></div>",

She seemed to have become just as wide as she was tall, which made her look like a large fleshy ball, albeit with various rolls and a pudgy face breaking to keep her from being completely round.

I have a lotta love to give.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYai suddenly registered what they were talking about and turned around, double-checking to see if she'd suddenly shed her elephantine size for Lan to suddenly have a crush on her. \"Eh... What?\" Was the most Yai could muster, a bit taken aback  that it was less out of dedication to Mayl and more out of a previously unseen, bizarre and seemingly uncontrollable lust for 'the fat' that Lan was sticking by his girlfriend's side during this crisis. More importantly though, she noted, this was the first time anybody had ever been enamored with her, even weirder considered she was a bloated body of blubber and it was <i>Lan</i> of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this being said, Yai was bored, and more than curious to see how such a bizarre relationship would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mayl seemed close to screaming at a Lan who was ogling the two of them at the same time, Yai intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't he have both of us? I mean, circumstances <i>have</i> changed Mayl...\" Waddling up to a slowly grinning Lan, back turned to Mayl, she give him a sly wink. \"I don't think he'll love you any less... As he said, with our combined sizes, he has even more love to give!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl paused mid-way through her rant to contemplate Yai's suggestion. \"That... That actually makes sense. I mean, it means Lan is little more than a complete and utter sleazeball and pervert...\" She shot Lan a glare which was completely undermined by her bloated face. \"... But then he'll still be <i>our</i> complete and utter sleazeball and pervert! I guess it'll be like how we share and borrow everything else!\" Mayl giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not just some object you can pass to each other when you're 'done' with me!\" Lan protested, though Yai this time cut him off. \"Lan, if you're going to treat us like objects, or worse, now that we're towering bodies of fat, then it's only fair we'll treat you like an object, or worse again, because you're the only guy who'll make out with us and mean it.\" Lan sighed and slumped his body, but with a nod, agreed to the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that's that! Yai, go with Lan to get something for us to eat, and Lan... Eh... Don't do anything to 'hurt' Yai!\" Mayl said, returning to a more optimistic outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYai, waddling through the busted front door took Lan's hand and led him to the front yard. \"There should be some special food I ordered back home once the report hit the news... Actually, I put on most of this weight while I was walking to check up on Mayl, heh.\" Yai said, coming across more conversational than the genius girl normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan merely giggled with Yai, his armed still clasped tight over her pudgy hand. \"Say Yai, why's it so deserted all of a sudden out here? There were still people out earlier...\" As they reached Yai's front door, she looked around too, her entire body jiggling like gelatin. \"That's strange... It was still sort of busy out here when I came to check up on Mayl... Let's go inside!\" Yai said, seeming to develop more anxiety with every step the two took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lan and Yai walked through, Lan started to look around. \"Now Yai, where's this 'special' grub you were talk- OOF!\" Lan was answered with Yai throwing herself and all her mass ontop of Lan, the two hitting the floor with a heavy thud as the stubby girl wrapped her pillow arms around him in one of the comfiest hugs Lan had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh Lan, I can't <i>believe</i> Mayl said yes! You have no idea just how HAPPY I feel now!\" Yai squeed, pouring out some of the most ditsy language Lan had never expected Yai to ever come up with. \"I mean, I always though you and Mayl were the cutest couple, but like, only because YOU were a part of that equation!\" She started to plant large kisses on Lan's cheek, who was too winded to even decided whether to enjoy the spectacle or be concerned for Yai's sanity. \"And now that we're together, ooooooh... I don't even have to work out! Or worry about my appearance! Just stay like a cute little... I mean, BIG piggy and you'll love me forever and ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By now, Lan had regained his breath and... Well, obviously a lot of what Yai was blurting out at a hundred miles a minute was pretty pent up, emotional and meaningful... To Yai at least, but Lan wasn't one to back down from another make out session. And Mayl <i>did</i> say not to 'hurt' Yai's feelings, so bringing a finger to her lips, the two started to kiss and embrace each other madly. It wasn't as if Lan was able to back out anyway, considering how Yai had pinned him down with her massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only half an hour later, when Yai woke up to a grinning Lan underneath her girth that she realized she had trapped him under over 400 pounds of herself. \"Oh dear...\" Heaving herself up, Yai brushed herself off and picked up Lan. \"Well, you're not flattened... Um... Sorry about that.\" She started to recollect what else had happened as if she were recovering from amnesia. And almost on cue, she blushed a very bright raspberry-red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Never tell Mayl, or anybody for that matter, what I did 30 minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mayl's already expecting us to make out now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, never, ever, <i>ever</i>, tell ANYBODY I acted like that.

Before them stood a grocery store's worth of food that was organized as such. While Lan stared in shock at the massive pile of food, Yai headed toward a control console near the door. Once she reached it, she tapped a few buttons and an industrial scale hovercart cane out of an alcove near Lan and floated next to him. Yai then walked over to the candy area, and started happily munching away at sugary treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now Yai?\" Lan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You load up the cart with as much food as it can carry,\" Yai said, \"There are some service arms that will help you out a little, but you'll need to put a good deal of effort in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that could take hours,\" Lan whined, \"Why not automate the whole thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you need to get used to the work,\" Yai responded, \"Having just one fat girlfriend comes with a deal of upkeep. Now imagine two girls at me and Mayl's sizes. Your going to have to work pretty damn hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful,\" Lan said with as much sarcasm as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan spent his next 40 minutes pushing the hovercart around and loading it with food. He was sweating profusely by the time he was done. He pushed the hovercart to the front of the \"pantry\" where Yai was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you got done,\" Yai said to him, \"I'm starving, and I'm sure Mayl is even worse off. Lets get this stuff over to her house so we can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYai help Lan get the cart out of the pantry doors, and pushed it down the front hall with him. They left Yai's mansion and went across town to Mayl's house. They then navigated the hovercart inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mayl!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lan and Yai entered the house, they found Mayl right where they left her. The redhead had gained a few more pounds from the virus, but nothing truly noticeable. With a great deal of effort on Lan's part, the pair managed to get all of the snacks they had picked out into the building. All the tables and counters were piled high with treats for Yai, while Mayl's vast belly and breasts were covered with a luxurious spread of calorie rich junk food, all within a fat arm's reach. Both girls began to work on their huge piles of snacks, but only Yai seemed to be enjoying herself. Mayl seemed to not be happy at all with her current size, or the prospect of adding to it, yet something compelled her to gorge herself anyway. Lan simply lay on an overturned couch, watching his friends slowly grow fatter from their meals. After a good hour of snacking, the monotony was broken by Yai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Mayl,\" Yai spoke up, \"When was the last time you checked on Roll during this whole outbreak thing? You had said she had looked a little plump before you even started fattening up, and look how big you are now. I wonder if Roll has gotten anywhere near as large as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl gasped in response to Yai's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I completely forgot about Roll,\" Mayl admitted to her friends, \"I hope she's ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl stretched a flabby arm as far as she could and just managed to grab her PET, which was dangling from a necklace between her massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope nothing too bad has happened to her,\" Mayl said as she turned the device on and brought the screen to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at the screen, Mayl blushed bright red and let out a strangled gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how big is she?\" Yai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, she's fairly large,\" Mayl stuttered, \"I can't exactly guess her weight since she's made of data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for heaven's sake,\" Yai said after face palming, \"Gimme that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYai scaled Mayl's belly and breasts with an agility that seemed unnatural given her own significant size. She deftly snatched the PET from Mayl, sat on her left breast, and triggered the projector on the device. When the image of Mayl's Net Navi appeared, Mayl blushed even harder while Lan and Yai's mouths hung open in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll was absolutely gargantuan, at least twice or possibly triple Mayl's own excessive size. Her frame was dominated by her belly, which had become a massive bulb of doughy fat that was larger than a tank. The cream colored mountain of flesh was so large that the viruses in Mayl's PC space were using it as a trampoline, bouncing around with happy expressions on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawling nearly as far in the other direction, Roll's butt had ballooned into twin spheres of blubber that were each bigger than a car. A vast canyon of cleavage formed between the spheres, deep enough  to trap at least thirty regular Navis between them. Roll's legs had swollen to more than double the size of oil pipelines to complement her enormous ass. The crease between her thighs and calves made her legs look like gigantic sausages so overstuffed with meat that they looked like they would burst at any second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Roll ass had a matching competitor in the form of her behemoth breasts. Each of her car sized tits were supported by her gut, taking up a vast majority of its available space. A torrent of milk spilled from the soda bottle sized nipple of her left breast, drenching her belly in a waterfall of milk, and occasionally washing away an unlucky virus. Unlike the left one, Roll's right breast was in use. Roll had wrapped her pillowy arms around the massive mammary and lifted it into her face so that she could greedily suck milk from her nipple. Every other second, Roll would squeeze her arms deep into her breast, pumping milk out of it in even greater volume than her unused breast. With every gluttonous gulp of milk, Roll's body surged outwards with several dozen more pounds of fat. Loud sensual moans could be heard as the female Navi forcibly bloated herself fatter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll's size wasn't the only reason everyone was shocked when the image had appeared. Roll was also clearly engaged in amorous activities. In between each surge of weight gain caused by her milk, Roll was heaving herself upwards with what muscle strength she still possessed, and subsequently letting herself slump to the ground, sinking deeply into her oversized ass each time. Each repetition of the act drew a louder and lustier moan that her drinking did, and a pool of translucent fluid beneath her blubbery bulk spread farther outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Mayl's horror, Roll's lewd behavior extended beyond mere self-pleasure. A video feed from a camera program had popped up at the same time as the main image. The video feed clearly displayed a naked Megaman grinding his entire body against a pussy so bloated with blubber that it was larger than his entire body. Torrents of Roll's feminine nectar washed over the blue bomber as he pleasured his friend. Megaman was able to focus entirely on Roll, as her overstuffed thighs were doing just fine at drawing out his essence in thick, white gouts. While Mayl turned away from the screen in embarrassment and Lan kept watching Megaman to learn how he could pleasure Mayl once he talked her into sex, Yai made her presence known to the lust leviathan Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Roll!\" Yai shouted enthusiastically, \"Blimp those tits into barrage balloons. Smother Mayl's PC under your belly and ass, and drain Megaman's cock to the very last drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll certainly needed no such encouragement, and continued her erotic display without acknowledging the presence of the three humans. For another two minutes, the two perverts of the group watched as Roll fattened and pleasured herself. At the peak of one of Roll's skyward thrusts, a great shudder ran through her body as she finally orgasmed. The massive milk tank that she had been binge drinking from slipped from her grasp fell back to the side of its twin, spraying milk in a wide arc, a good deal of which splashed onto her softball sized cheeks and multiple swollen chins. At the same time, a virtual tidal wave of Roll's juices surged forth from beneath her belly, carrying Megaman with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Megaman recovered his footing, he quickly clambered up Roll's belly and lay down on top of her right tit as she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was spectacular Roll,\" Megaman said while softly groping the breast he was laying one, \"I've never experienced anything like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me we got the whole thing on video,\" the massive navi gasped between labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every second from every angle,\" Megaman assured her after checking the camera program, \"So do you want to keep this for ourselves, or post it and make a fortune off it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Post it of course!\" Roll nearly shouted, \"I want everyone who is willing to pay to be able to see the new me, and for them to be entranced by the best sex the world has seen to date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously the better choice,\" Megaman replied, \"The only question is how someone should pay to see how amazing you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking two thousand zennys for our first video,\" Roll said after a moment of thought, \"Enough for a decent battlechip, so that we know each viewer really wants it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman nodded and began fiddling with the camera program. After a few minutes, he held it in front of Roll's face while he kissed her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, already on every site you charge for a video, and cash is already flowing in,\" Megaman said, \"Do you think it's the thumbnail or the title?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's definitely the thumbnail of me guzzling my rich, heavenly milk. No words can do it justice, not even the title you thought up,\" Roll teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right,\" Megaman relented, \"But maybe some input from our audience could be valuable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll nodded, and both Navis turned towards the humans listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think guys? Did you enjoy the show?\" Roll asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were epic, Roll,\" Yai fangirled, \"Especially during that final orgasm. You looked like you could have exploded at any second. It was the hottest thing I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you and Megaman actually just post a porn video of yourselves?\" Lan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah we did!\" Roll replied after glancing at the camera program, \"It's already a hit too. At least fifty people have started watching already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome,\" Lan said, \"You and Megaman were certainly going at it like pros.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two whole hours of recorded fun. How's that for an amateur video?\" Megaman boasted. \"Obviously, you guys all get a free copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan immediately busied himself by bringing up the file on his own PET, and lay back into Mayl's belly to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so lucky Megaman,\" Yai continued, \"I wish I was that big, or at least as big as Mayl, but I'm stuck as the smallest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Yai,\" Roll assured the rich girl, \"You are doing very well for not having a female Navi to give you the full virus. It's Mayl that I'm disappointed in. I thought she'd be the same size as me, or even bigger since humans have so much food. You and Lan should ramp up your efforts to fatten her up. At least make her burst that bikini top she's using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortified by her Navi's words and actions, Mayl couldn't stay silent any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How can you possibly say becoming an even huger blob is good for me?\u201d Mayl almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m kind of living it in front of you,\u201d Roll said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome being this massive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoll, you can\u2019t even get off the ground. We are both literally too fat to move, and you are telling me that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Mayl admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo fat to move? What are you talking about?\u201d Roll said with a confused look on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just watched you trying to heave yourself upright during your little exhibition,\u201d Mayl pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for fun Mayl, I can move just fine,\u201d Roll responded, \u201cHeads up little buddies, I\u2019m moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the humans gasped in shock at Roll\u2019s statement, the massive Navi rocked back and forth a single time before lurching to her feet, her ocean of fat wobbling wildly as she did so, bouncing away a few unlucky viruses. Then she began to slowly waddle around Mayl\u2019s PC space, moaning obscenely with every step as her body jiggled and gyrated. Milk, sweat and love juices dripped onto the floor as Roll continued to make another spectacle out of showing off her mobility. As she completed her circle around the relatively small area, another orgasm shook Roll\u2019s enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there you have it Mayl, I\u2019m fully mobile,\u201d Roll said smugly, \u201cNow you try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigning herself to humoring her lifelong friend a little more, Mayl strained her muscles in an attempt to stand up. To her surprise, her body lurched forward, nearly getting her upright on the first try. Now that it looked like she could actually succeed, Mayl made an honest attempt at standing up. Slowly rocking back and forth on her huge butt to gain momentum, Mayl heaved herself upwards, and found herself on her feet. She didn\u2019t even have to correct her balance due to how low her center of gravity was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard now, was it?\u201d Roll asked with a grin, before she turned to Yai and Lan, \u201cWhy is there so much food on the counter still? Mayl\u2019s got some catching up to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan and Yai were more than eager to obey Roll\u2019s implied command, and quickly climbed Mayl\u2019s belly with as much food as they could carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a second,\u201d Mayl shouted as she flailed her arms to keep her friends from forcing treats down her throat, \u201cJust because I can move now doesn\u2019t mean I will be able to if you make me even fatter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll slapped a chubby hand to her face in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mayl, I\u2019ve been trying to be nice about this, but I suppose it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d Roll said in a scolding tone she rarely used with Mayl, \u201cI\u2019ve never asked for much from you, and I\u2019ve never been lazy before, but if you don\u2019t do this for me, I can start being lazy. I\u2019ll only do the minimum requirements of being a Net Navi. I won\u2019t help with homework, I won\u2019t use my new buddies to find cool stuff, and I certainly won\u2019t Net Battle unless it\u2019s for a class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you even Net Battle like this Roll?\u201d Mayl asked, a bit of sarcasm seeping into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question caused Roll to burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I Net Battle? Can I Net Battle?\u201d Roll repeated between breaths,\u201d Oh you just watch this. Hey Mega, set up one of those ghost Navis you were talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny preference on who you want to fight?\u201d Megaman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a speedy guy. Someone that would have deleted the old me in seconds,\u201d Roll demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman activated a NaviChip in response, and pushed a few buttons on a panel that popped up on his arm. Directly in front of Roll, a figure more beast-like than humanoid coalesced from the surge of data the chip\u2019s activation had produced. This was Beastman.exe, a tall, hulking Navi with razor sharp claw, fangs, and a flowing orange mane. He was easily one of the fastest opponents Megaman had ever faced, and was a serious threat to any Navi. The ghost Navi let loose a feral howl, knocking Megaman back a step with his sheer volume. In response, Roll just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBattle positions little guys,\u201d Roll commanded the viruses playing on her body, \u201cIt\u2019s fighting time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon receiving this command, the Cannondumbs on Roll\u2019s body formed several dozen wedge shaped batteries, their cursors flickering across the ground. The hard hat wearing Mettaurs formed a line across the widest point of her belly, pickaxes at the ready. With another button press on Megaman\u2019s panel, Beastman roared and began his attack. The Mettaurs swung their tools into the paneled ground below them, causing miniature shockwaves to move towards the enemy Navi. Beastman easily leapt over the slow moving attack, but he landed directly in one of the Cannondumb\u2019s cursors. The virus fired immediately, catching Beastman in the leg. The ghost Navi flinched from the hit, but continued his attack, reaching the ling of Mettaurs and clawing through a few before receiving a pickax to the face for his efforts, then being blown back by a direct hit from another of the cannon viruses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regaining his footing, Beastman howled in rage and dove straight at Roll. This time he dashed avoided both the targeting cursors and shockwaves and was just about to slash deep into Roll\u2019s gut when Roll\u2019s blubbery legs tensed before propelling her about three inches off the ground. Despite the pitiful height, the impact from Roll\u2019s vast body hitting the ground produced an enormous wave of force that raced across the ground, cracking every panel they touched, and flinging Beastman to the edge of the PC space. Then Roll reached forwards and gave her gargantuan breasts a powerful squeeze. A huge beam of energy the same color as her milk and nearly as wide as her own thighs, burst forth from each nipple and engulfed Beastman completely. When the ray died out after several seconds, all that was left was a pile of ashes. All three humans\u2019 mouths were hanging open in shock at the powerful attack, while Megaman smiled proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that Mayl, I deleted the guy without a single battlechip,\u201d Roll bragged, \u201cAnd that was just with regular viruses helping too. Imagine if I can get some really strong guys, like the ones those Virus Controllers from the Undernet have. I\u2019m a badass blubbery battlecruiser, and I can only get bigger and stronger from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, you can Net Battle, but humans can\u2019t, so I don\u2019t know why you think that would make me want to gain more weight than the ton I already have,\u201d Mayl rebuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit Mayl, I\u2019m trying to show you that this isn\u2019t even a virus, it\u2019s a patch,\u201d Roll said angrily, \u201cIt is a patch for all women to make them stronger and more beautiful than what could ever be possible before. I feel like a sex goddess and I\u2019m more than willing to spread my blessing around. Hell, Lan can\u2019t keep his eyes off me, and I\u2019m not even in the human world. So if for no other reason, start plumping up to keep your boyfriend\u2019s interest, because I\u2019ll be happy to send him all the videos he wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl\u2019s blush renewed itself at the thought of Lan watching videos of her Navi all day rather than spending time with her. Roll did seem to be enjoying herself, and rather passionate about weight gain from her multiple tirades. Yai also sounded like she would kill to be as big as she was, but it was just such a huge change, no matter how beneficial her friends thought it would be.</span></div></div>",
