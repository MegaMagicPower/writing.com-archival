She got out of bed and went to the window. It was just possible that her friend Will might be throwing stones at her window. He had periodic emergencies when family fights broke out and he'd often ended a bad night crashing on her family sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nobody in the broad street below her window. Her bedroom overlooked the high street of Rawley, from above the gas station her father ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have had a nightmare, she decided. Funny, she couldn't remember what she had been dreaming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day she was at Rawley to see Will. <br>\r\n\"-I don't know, it was a really disturbing feeling\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a bad dream\" said Will, in a reassuring voice. He wanted to talk about something he had found in the library next to the boys' common room. He couldn't understand why such a large collection of occult texts were lying around where impressionable teenagers might find them. Rawley was an expensive school, and the faculty worried a lot about upsetting parents. He looked at Scout, thinking that they didn't come much more impressionable than his room mate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout, designer-clad, beautiful, and very very dim, was more sympathetic. \"Are you all right?\" he gasped. He quite fancied Bella, but he was playing it cool, he thought proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is\" said Will. \"She's my oldest friend, I'd know if she wasn't. Look, Bella, can we talk about this later? There's a new English teacher just in, and I need to find out whether I can change my essay topic. His name's Finn. Do you think he's Irish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would Bella know if he was?\" Scout queried, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There might be gossip in town.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd expect more gossip here. This affects you more than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Hamilton might know something\" Will conceded. \"But, you know, he's a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bella grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout didn't think that kind of security was in place. The staff would have a much clearer idea of what was going on if there were cameras. And so far, the faculty struck him as pretty clueless. Nevertheless, he swung himself over the sill in Bella's wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was empty of people. He thought so, anyway, but the light level was much lower, coming in from the bright sunlight. The walls were dark, and the furniture ran to big squashy leather sofas and wing chairs. They were comfortable. Scout liked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella thought it was an insistently male decor. \"Smells of money\" she said, looking around. \"Where are these books? Will anyone notice if we take them to show Will?\" She strode off to the stacks in the corner - not a true library, just a part of the room arrannged so that it had become like an extensive maze of shelves. Musty and clearly untouched volumes in leather binding loomed high over Bella's head. The titles she saw amazed her so much, she was drawn farther and farther into the stacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout hesitated. He thought he'd heard a noise, a yip of nerves from someone. \"Who's th-\" It was Harry Johnson. \"Oh. Hey, whats up, man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was in a darkened corner of the room. Alone. Pretending to revise. Scout felt sorry for him. Harry was so shy it almost counted as a disability. Scout had never been mean to him, so why Harry should have no problem talking to him.. \"Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry\" Harry chanted. It was the sort of thing Harry would say, so Scout paid it no mind, until he felt the sharp pain in the crook of his neck. \"Harry, man, what the hell-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

This whole school, she thought distastefully, was just a pit of creepy, superstitious - without reflection, Bella had grabbed an oar from where it leaned against a wall, and tucked it under her armpit like a lance. \"Let's see if this staking gig works\" she muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid-lunge, startled, she realised what she was doing. It was like an instinct. And it was too late to pull out of the fight. Personal pull with the local cops wasn't going to help if this guy wasn't undead, and as a sensible modern girl, Bella had problems with this Hammer Horror shit ..oh. Dusted. Inside, part of her was screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he <i>was</i> a vampire\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrgh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scout? Hold this hanky over the cut and press hard.

He'd have to add some inducements. \"Moonlight, jujubees, cheesy dialogue?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed. Scout was cute, after all. \"OK. Is the cheesy dialogue going to be you or the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout decided honesty might be the best policy. \"Both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella frowned at the little pile of dust that had been Harry Johnson. \"Did you know he was a vampire?\" Anything seemed possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Scout looked indignant. Then he said in self defence \"he can't have been one for long. He was trying out for crew, this afternoon in the sunshine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of hours ago.\" Scout worked out what Bella was getting at. \"Then he went to his dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Scout looked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shared a dorm with Ryder.

While Scout had nothing against him as a person, his pride revolted at the thought of taking any crap from a social leper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to take orders from Ryder\" Harry pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't <i>have</i> to\" Scout mumbled. \"It's just he makes you look stupid if you don't do what he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith care - he was still a little dizzy - Scout focussed his attention on Harry. \"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder made me a vampire, so he's my Si - uh, boss. And now I made you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout had an uneasy memory of the longago time he'd kept a stray puppy in the utility room for weeks because his mom had allergies and wouldn't let him have a pet. The puppy's owners had been so mad at him.. The memory passed. He felt a wave of hunger. His gut cramped, and he felt his face scrunch up somehow. \"Need-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked worried. \"Oh, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice called from the stacks. \"Scout? Where are you? I thought you were right here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned round hastily, tripping over an oar. \"I forgot about the girl.\" He wasn't hungry anymore, so he didn't need her. But now he ought to think of what his Childe needed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Bella.\" Scout wondered why his voice sounded different. \"She's pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was awkward. \"Do you <b>like</b> her?\" Maybe she wasn't Scout's ideal breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

If Harry had to be a vampire, (and it looked like he didn't have a choice,) he was going to be a vampire with <i>soul</i>. Like that mopey one in the Anne Rice books. Yeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Scout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Harry reflected. Vamping really didn't alter people's essential personalities. \"You're hungry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout nodded vigorously, still crunkle-faced. Rawley students weren't too observant, but Harry picked up the pace anyway. <i>Some</i>one might notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to Harry's dorm. Scout looked around. He saw no food. Harry was fumbling with a big leather bound book. They'd just left a whole roomful of books like that behind. What was Harry playing at? Absently, Scout scooped Harry's illicit guinea pig out of its cage and raised it to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Bad!\" Harry rushed over and saved Muggles. \"Look, it's alright.

Never mind, Scout was too hungry to stress about details. He stepped up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? What the hell do you think you're doing?\" It had a very biting tone of voice. It sounded authoritative, like the coxswain. Scout was stopped in his tracks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Scout hadn't bargained for it having a voice at all. He felt vaguely wrong about eating something he'd held a conversation with. He came to a lightening conclusion. He was going to have to eat faster, so's not to connect with it emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the jake hit him. Scout felt majorly aggrieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't do that\" Harry protested on his behalf. Harry was acting like they were buddies all of a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are <i>you</i>?\" The jake looked them both up and down scornfully. Apparantly Scout was going to have to engage with it socially after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked kind of like a girl. That was one difference between it and the coxswain. Scout sighed. He realised the jake had become an acquaintence. He could never eat it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly think you're bad enough to take <i>me</i> on you stupid fledglings\" the jake sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, he couldn't eat it, but he thought he could probably manage to dislike it. Scout didn't know what fledglings meant, but the demon was saying it like it was an insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, Harry glared resentfully. Scout made a note to ask him about the fledglings thing, later. \"We summoned you to Eat\" said Harry. \"We are - aarrgh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout stared, freaked out, at the pile of dust that had been Harry Johnson. The demon left him, and the dimension, in contempt. It took the spell book with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry-\" Scout pinched himself. No, not a dream. He didn't even believe in spells and crap like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to ask roomie for advice. Will was into this kind of nonsense, and he was a friend. Suddenly remembering the danger of Ryder reappearing - this was his dorm, after all - Scout hurried out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still hungry, anyway. He decided to call by the canteen. Rare bloody steak would be nice. He took Muggles with him. Warm. Strokable. Not enough there to spoil his appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rays of light slanting into the panelled hallway just gave him a very bad feeling. There was nothing worse than dust motes suspended in them, but still the glowing light intimidated him. He slowed as he moved closer, which was as well - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ow!</b>\" That <i>burned</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout fell back, and studied the smoke rising from his forearm. Muggles took the opportunity to spring out of his hold. Scout didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must've been hurt more than he'd assumed, during that weird session in the library. He didn't know what Johnson had done to him there, and now that Johnson had been turned to dust - and things like that weren't supposed to <i>happen</i> in real life, but it definitely had happened.. Scout sighed, confused. He was gonna have to talk seriously to Will. Will did spells, and he was really smart. Will could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, Scout had to have something to eat. He was so hungry. A thick broth would be nice. Solids just didn't appeal.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible pattern was forming, here, but Scout firmly refused to acknowledge the implications. He just didn't want to know this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr.\" Something was behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the Fleming family dogs. They had free run of the school. Without thinking, Scout pounced on it. He was more of an animal than stupid WeegeeEvans would ever be, ha! It was like he was in some altered mental state. He was <i>so</i> fast, <i>so</i> strong, <i>so</i> unstoppable, it was like descriptions of being on drugs, or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, he felt sick in the head. (But undeniably healthier and much less hungry.) He had liked that dog, up till then. (But, better to do that to a dog than a person, he told himself.)  It looked like Johnson had made him a vampire, he couldn't deny it. (Lousy Johnson.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a good guy, though. He was (averting his gaze from the carcasse) not a killer, or something nasty. Will was gonna help him, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if Will didn't, maybe he should make a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout slipped back to his room by a shady route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Two tiny punctures, set close together. She picked up the maligned oar. Not a drop of red was on it.

Then she saw, in a dim mirror - absence of Harry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout would have to maintain the handkerchief compress himself.

He knew the layout of the college, and she didn't. If it weren't for that knowledge, his future would be garlic and stake. Harry leaned back against a wall and sucked air into his lungs. Ryder said he didn't need oxygen but his body had certain habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Harry was more the blendy type than Ryder was. So, breathing. He didn't want people to stare at him. Now, Ryder kind of enjoyed notereity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlive or dead, it was a self evident truth that they were different people. And why - Harry frowned - was he thinking about that? The presence of the Slayer was more urgent than his issues with his Sire. He shoved away from the wall, groaned, and trudged off to his dorm. He might detest Ryder, but he knew when he was out of his depth. He'd better tell the Brit what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder would know what to do.

He could deal with this himself. His first move should be to research Slayers, and fortunately he didn't even have to risk a tan. The soothing, darkened library was waiting directly below. All he had to do was wait till it was deserted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to recall what the few things Ryder had told him about Slayers. They were ridiculously strong, but Ryder said they weren't too bright. He wondered whether to trust that judgement. After all, this one hadn't realised he was a vampire. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It took all the nerve Harry had to walk in there. \"Look.\" He held out a first aid kit. He was so scared, his heart ought to be pounding in his chest. It wasn't. Could she tell? Gulping, he pulled bandages out of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed them over at arm's length. It occurred to him, just slightly too late, that he was in danger of having his face turn vamp at the smell of blood. That metallic catch of the iron taste tickling at the back of his throat was teasing him already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he turned vamp, there was no way a slayer would let him out of here alive. Harry was having major second thoughts about his master plan. \"I found bandages\" he squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Bella beckoned. \"Bring them over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no. Closer to <i>that</i> smell? \"I should-\" damn, what should he say? \"I should phone 911.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you done that?\" He'd been away long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I panicked.\" Harry reminded himself that he wasn't in the business of impressing chicks right now. If I make her think I'm dumb, he thought with a faint surge of optimism, the slayer will <b>underestimate</b> me. That's strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry eyed Scout. Calhoun was in a position to embarrass him fatally. Luckily, Calhoun lay there with his eyes shut, milking the wounded hero thing for all it was worth. Harry decided to tell him it had all been a fraternity initiation. Scout might well buy it. Now all he had to do was come up with some spurious Greek letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella maintained a steady pressure on the gash in Scout's neck. Harry eyed her too. Untrained, a slayer was pretty vulnerable, but the way his luck ran, there was no chance that this one was untrained. He sidled a step closer. If he could take her out, imagine the kudos! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampires all over the world would look up to him. Harry tried to imagine it, and failed. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It involved irresponsibility, being dumb, other things in life besides boys, yeah, yeah. She did hear Scout though, just as the door slammed behind her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. So. You were looking for Mr Right, and you settled for Scooby Doo?\" Scout looked mildly pleased with himself for coming up with a good line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill swatted him. He hoped it hurt. \"Grace\" Will said. \"This is, kind of, weird. Can it be undone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears brimmed in Grace's eyes. \"You're always on Bella's side\" she accused. \"And now you're just buying into her take on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Will asked carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella thinks this wolf thing is something I pretend to be. It's what I am, at least for part of the month. And I think it might be part of me the whole time. But she's all, modern 21st century gal-\" Grace was having difficulty expressing how she felt on this. Generally, all of this was an internal monologue, and she didn't have to worry about being coherent. Will was paying attention though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't believe in ghoulies and ghosties and things that go bump, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do.\" Grace blinked at him. Her lashes were all stuck together with tears. Ansel came over and leaned against her lovingly. He managed to shed some hairs on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill eyed Ansel uncertainly, and said \"Are <i>you</i> okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, it <b>did</b> sound like Scooby. \"Do you <i>mind</i> being this shape?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnsel gathered his thoughts slowly. \"Grace says\" he checked her reaction before continuing \"it's not for always. I can be me some of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dog shape.\" Scout couldn't see the appeal of that. \"Being human's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill and Grace gave him identical looks. \"Yeah, like you'd know\" Grace muttered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Do you want to go back?\" Will persisted. He wasn't sure, but he thought he could try and undo this. Even if Ansel was not as bright as a person, he deserved to have a say in what happened to him, Will thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good. I'm a good boy.\" Ansel kept checking Grace's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill wasn't happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

He was supposed to be spending the morning with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the Dean's house through the trees, and saw him walking up and down, up and down along the fence of the back yard. He looked confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does Ansel keep getting <i>out</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged. It was a stretch caring much about most two legged non-demons. Asking her to emote about four legged ones as well was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's, like, some kind of dog Houdini. I swear everything was locked.\" His dad thought Hamilton had messed up shutting the house last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll come back\" Jake said nonchalantly. Ansel had disappeared before. The animal always came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he's got to go to the vet today. We have to go and find him before the appointment. Hey-\" Hamilton remembered the sniffing incident. \"You have a great sense of smell, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know how to show a girl a good time, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamilton stared at her pleadingly. His big blue eyes swam with hurt anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right. You owe me, Fleming.\" Jake reluctantly picked up a chew toy. \"No, this one belongs to Weegee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!\" Hamilton complimented her. \"You worked that out right away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" With an ill grace, Jake picked through the dogs' stuff till she had Ansel's scent. She followed it to the garden gate. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a yes. That's, that's bad.\" Hamilton looked around. Had the werewolf hurt his dog? \"I don't see any blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't need to be angry, all it needed was to be hungry. \"Poor Ansel..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dog's scent changes here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have got frightened.\" Hamilton struggled not to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a fear scent. Jake wondered whether to tell Hamilton that his dog had turned into something different, but that she didn't know what it had become.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

All those teeth - eww.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she didn't fancy Ham's chances if he went up against a werewolf. OK. That settled it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some librarian guy in the school who was all <i>let me be the hero, go on, let me</i>. Leave it to Finn. Everyone knew librarians were intimidating, death-dealing guys, Jake thought. She'd had bad, bad experiences with overdue fines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Will sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>knew</i> spells didn't work. If they did, a lot of things in Will's life would be different.. He glanced sadly at the small shrine with candles.

He couldn't work out how she sneaked in without them noticing. She looked sharply round the room, assessing the situation, and challenged Bella's presence first. Maybe she was some kind of unearthly hellspawn thing, Will thought. \"What are you doing in a boy's dorm?\" Jake demanded. \"It's not like girls are allowed to go to this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four were surprised. People just didn't stop Bella going where she wanted to go. It was a waste of effort. \"What are <i>you</i> doing here then?\" said Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I'm a demon. I'm bad to the bone.

Perhaps demons were less substantial than people. She didn't think she'd exerted that much force.

The dorms seemed <br>\r\nlike a likely place to find something relating to the Nether Depths. She <br>\r\nhad learned about adolescent homemaking skills. They were beyond <br>\r\ngruesome, in her opinion. It was a good guess. Minutes later, she was <br>\r\ncradling a folio in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, all right\" Hamilton confirmed. He recognised the embossed <br>\r\nimage of a wyvern on the cover. Jake was engrossed in reading the <br>\r\ncontents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't do it.\" Her voice was flat with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't bespell me to love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have done that?

They left the room together, going down <br>\r\nto the lakeside. One of the dogs ran up to them. \"What are you going to <br>\r\ndo with that book?\" Did she still need it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my way home.\" She had felt so trapped without any way to get to <br>\r\nher home dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww, cute. He looked so panicked. \"Not right now.\" Jake smiled. It was <br>\r\ngood to have her options open to her, and a ticket home in her <br>\r\npocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had a way out, Rawley looked more like a place for <br>\r\npotential fun. Her spirits lifting, Jake wondered about ways to amuse herself <br>\r\namong weak and gullible humans. Oooh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone been <i>really</i> pissing you off lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamilton considered his options.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Jake got that look in her eye, he was sure she was getting all sorts of good ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make our team win at the regatta?\" he asked. Nobody could object to that.

So, why were they doing all this practicing, again? Jake wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course we have a chance, no, a certainty-\" Finn kept an eye on Jake as he spoke. He had done so ever since the unforgettable lesson when he tried introducing an actual Immortal to \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" It hadn't been pretty. Jake shrugged off the things she'd done to \"an <i>authentically</i> Puckish sense of humour\" and it had taken all Hamilton's best efforts to stop open war breaking out.

There was a moment when the giant sea serpent reared out of the lake, it's whiskers reeking of ultra mature fish, and it's eyes bugged like a Chinese dragon. It started to pursue the St Josephs boat off the designated course. In that moment, he knew this was no ordinary regatta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rawley team won by a comfortable margin. They got out of the boat very fast, Sean noted. They seemed to be trying to escape the cox. Finn swept up, raging. \"<b>Jake</b>\" he roared. Sean made a note of the name. He might not have bothered to bring a camera - \"-we'll use last year's photograph. Who'll notice\" - but that was no reason to completely abdicate his journalistic responsibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was nowhere to be found. Sean looked around for Will. He wanted the inside story. He edged up near the group of angry men who surrounded Finn. The Dean had just said \"Finn, <i>those</i> skills of yours aren't to be used as party tricks. I know you want the rowing to go well, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it\" Finn protested, torn between rage at Jake and resentment at the suggestion.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Finn stormed at the Dean, Jake was being speedboated across the lake to eat lunch with the Rawley girls. Ham had told her that Finn would over react. The meal would be nicer, too, which tipped Jake's decision, though Ham pointed out that the portions were far too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensions were running high when the time for the Rawley team's second race approached. It was the final part of the tournament, and the Senator had made a banal speech, and everything. He had been in baby kissing mode all day. Election year was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Will.\" Bella had just arrived, out of breath. \"Whats up?\" Will and Sean looked so serious. If it had just been Will, she would have assumed he was worried about the race. She knew Sean didn't care a hoot about rich boys' games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean told her about the race \"-and look!\" Both boats were at the starting point. Again, the huge scaly monster, like a giant greenishwhite worm, rose in coils from the surface of the lake. They could smell it's fishy breath from here. The guest team, who had set out unhappy, could be heard screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella stared, forgetting the people around her. This was like one of those dreams she'd been having, a horrible monster and nobody <i>doing</i> anything to deal with it. She started forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sean could stop her, she was in the lake swimming to the thing. She had got to the regatta late because of a stint at the petrol station, and to get the stench of oil off her hands, she had something in her pocket. The creature bent it's swanlike neck to look at her, astonished, and she squirted the bottle of industrial strength detergent full in it's eyes. It worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on shore, Bella was shyly receiving a blanket and grateful thanks from the Dean's wife when Finn came up to her. \"You have accepted your destiny\" was his unconventional greeting. His team had still won, so this was a good day for Finn all round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella glared at him. He kept coming up to her in Friendly's saying things like \"You Are the Slayer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you feel a <i>lot</i> better now that you've fulfilled your vocation? Don't you want to feel that way again?\" No one in the Council had told him he'd have to coax a Slayer into action. His training had left out a lot of important things. He was going to have to telephone Giles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What vocation?\" The Senator wasn't used to being on the edge of a scene, and he didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn explained fulsomly about Bella being the Chosen One, the only one of her generation, the-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Superhero?\" The Senator was, after all, Scout's father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way\" Finn said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Senator addressed Bella. \"Shouldn't you be in some sort of costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella lived in jeans and a Tshirt. She was about to explain this, but the Senator was beckoning a photographer over. The photgrapher was having difficulty escaping the clutches of Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Slayer cannot endorse any political party\" Finn said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but, Truth. Justice. Apple pie and Mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella flinched angrily. Not the <b>M</b> word. She allowed Finn to shepherd her away without demur.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A lot of magic users couldn't pick a modem out of a police line up. Will sniggered. He had this picture in his head: big thuggish guy, big thuggish guy, little thuggish guy, modem, big thuggish guy. And blessed-be Rory shaking his head over them in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the thuggish guys in Will's head had his father's face, but hey, he wasn't denying he had issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" Bella asked when Jake and Ham left, \"is she really a demon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Life is turning out weird. Do you <i>want</i> to check out if Rawley is supernatural?\" Because, frankly, Will would just as soon wander down to Friendlys.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella reached determinedly for an outsize sweatshirt. \" I want to check this place out.

Baseball cap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, girls have different shape faces?\" Bella put it on. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys looked dubious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be all right as long as we stay indoors\" said Will. \"It's very dimly lit inside, here. I think they're encouraging us subliminally to be out in the healthy sunshine, or something.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nScout said, unnerved \"You read the school prospectus?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her little sister Grace was here all the time, hunting up boyfriend material. Bella would ask her how to get past this idiot, and then she'd come back after dark. Sean could drive her up, and be all worried, parked there while she disappeared for hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" The groundsman had just noticed what Will had in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soot.\" Will tried to look nonchalant. He thought it would make a good ingredient in a potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soot?\" The man looked as if he thought they were mad. \"What do you want that for? Where'd you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soot isn't stealing\" Will protested. \"It kind of fell out of the chimney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Felicity fan stared at them. \"Just go\" he said disgustedly. He definitely thought they were mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left, Bella said to the boys \"Tonight. Full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, tomorrow night is the full moon\" Will corrected. He was not happy. Now that Bella was taking an active interest in things supernatural, she was showing every sign of taking over from him. Also, she was being so methodical about it. \"What are you planning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella wasn't sure. She just had this itch to check out Rawley. She'd felt so strange all day today, as if there was something she ought to be doing, but she couldn't work out what it was. She frowned. The Scooby gang had never been her Saturday morning cartoon of choice. Daria, maybe. Now, Scout, he was certainly an Animaniac. Will -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Bella?\" Will stared at his friend. Lost in thought, she was absently sharpening pencil after pencil, and tucking them in her jeans pocket like a quiver of arrows. \"Bell, are you okay?\" Will was getting worried about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I feel different today\" she told him honestly. Coming so close to asking for help wasn't normal for Bella, and now that she realised how she felt, she <i>did</i> want to ask for help. It made her uncomfortable. \"I'll be fine tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Will said uncertainly. \"I'll see you tomorrow, 'k?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>both</i> will\" Scout insisted. Here he was in a new place, and the one person who had social contacts in place, was trying to leave him out of the picture. God, Scout thought, Will's a bit selfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, Will was bright, but being hero worshipped wouldn't be good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you do all those magic rituals\" Scout continued. He did share a room with Krudsky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd notice\" Will said, crestfallen. He'd been so proud of the cover story for the ingredients. He'd cribbed it from an Elizabeth Gaskell novella, but he'd been confident that Scout wouldn't ever find that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, I wasn't supposed to notice the mummified <i>rodent</i> inside my Nike sneakers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nike</i>!\" Hamilton looked shocked. \"Do you know their record of unethical business-\" His voice died.

She ought to be keener even than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was very keen indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd spent years training for this. It was a very competitive job, what with there only being one vacancy as Watcher at a time, aside from that awkward business with whatshername. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, there was a high turnover. That was the nature of the thing. He had confidently expected an astonishingly long, productive, and fully pensioned retirement with his true love, Shakespearian criticism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that cheerful acceptance of his slayer's death pre-dated <i>meeting</i> Bella. It seemed a grotesque attitude now. If Bella died of sheer ignorance, it would be on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn looked at the phone in his hand. He'd met this man once, at a party in the Cotswolds. Giles had been a bit of a black sheep to the Council, and Finn had not liked to associate too openly with him. One thing Finn did remember about what Giles had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles had talked about his early experiences with that valley girl slayer. He had found her completely alien and impossible to deal with. Giles might be able to give Finn some useful advice now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't expected to need to go running for help so soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just dialled the number and was listening to it ringing when he heard a sound behind him. \"Who's there?\" There was an unWatcherlike quaver in his voice.

Unless I seriously lose it with Grace, there isn't going to be anything like your vision.\" That proved it, as far as Bella was concerned.

Not that she had ever supposed otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was still upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Willie. He honestly believed in this.

Scout pitied Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was unlikely to be grateful for pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn paced energetically up and down the common room. \"Watchers aren't about this\" he pointed to his eyes \"or about this\" he thumped his chest \"they're about this!\" With a flourish, he smacked his own temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad hair?\" Scout essayed a guess. Finn was annoying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his next turn toward them Finn saw them all looking bewildered. \"A Watcher is the brains, the strategy, the knowhow that channels a Slayer to her best effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..Slayer. About that..?\" He's crazy, thought Bella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScout made sure Finn didn't get between them and the exit. He was a crazy guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn leaned on the counter, over the huge tome about Vampyrs, and said intensely \"Into each generation is born the one. She is the Slayer..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep by step, they backed away. Will was gazing at the English teacher with deep regret. He foresaw studying his entire English course by net, unless Finn had flashes of sanity around Shakespeare, poetry scansion and novel analysis. He no longer had any desire to probe Finn about the mysterious Council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look\" Finn interrupted himself. \"Haven't you had the deep seated urge to behead any of the students here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a townie\" Bella explained patiently. \"That's <i>normal</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn looked crestfallen. \"Haven't you had ..<i>odd</i> dreams, lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella hesitated.

Finn had been starting to get to her, but mysticism was more Will's thing than her's, and if Will was skeptical about this, then that was her cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill made a resolution to burn his magic texts.

Her boyfriend - hmm, should Scout maybe recognise him? - toasting marshmallows and hot dogs in the occult heat. Some people's appetites couldn't be put off by <i>anything</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver there, was that annoying blond Brit. He was stalking around being mean to everyone he met. You'd think a teenage guy in a ridiculous leather duster coat would be worried about ridicule himself, Scout thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most unwelcome person present was Finn.
