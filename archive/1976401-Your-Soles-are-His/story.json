            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For nearly all of your 20-some years of life, you've had a secret obsession that you've kept as private as possible - an obsession with a simple body part. Your own feet. It started out innocently enough...maybe as a kid you noticed your feet were your most ticklish spot, or you loved the feeling of going barefoot on your front lawn....something like that. You've had this obsession so long you can barely remember. And quite frankly, you don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the years since then, as you've grown up, this little interest of yours has grown with you. You've put in constant effort to keep your feet absolutely immaculate - you treat them to the best creams and lotions you can afford, you give yourself pedicures on a near-daily basis. You want them to be perfect, and they practically are. You can't help but smile when you think about just how soft, smooth, and sensitive they are. Some would call it arrogance, but to you it's just a way of life.  You've secretly craved attention to your feet - even a gentle touch would make you happy. But you want so much more. You've dreamed about having them savored - each toe sucked for hours, every inch of your bare soles licked and worshipped. You've fantasized about having them tickled, each sensitive inch explored with every imaginable implement until you're an insane wreck. Your mind wanders to thoughts of having them rubbed and admired for hours, gently and sensually, maybe while someone teases you about the beauty of your feet. Lately you even think about more intimate scenarios - you wonder what it would be like to give somebody a footjob, to use your soles and toes to give somebody true pleasure. All these thoughts fill your head every day - your secret desires of having your feet ravished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep these fantasies all to yourself, though. Even though you know there are like-minded people across the world and online, you keep it to yourself - you don't know what you'd do if a single soul found out. You can't even bring yourself to go barefoot around friends, fearing that you'll raise questions about why your feet are so attractive and pampered. Only when you're home alone do you go barefoot, freeing them and letting your imagination run wild. But someone out there knows who you are. Maybe he doesn't know all your secrets, but he knows a few things about you. He's got many of the same desires as you, only he's the one with the lust for feet. He's been seeking the perfect pair to make his own - to hold hostage, to tickle, to worship, to pleasure himself, to play with to his heart's desire. And he thinks that you have that perfect pair. And unknown to you, he's lurking outside.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nighttime, and you're preparing for bed. You've taken care of everything for the night, except for your favorite ritual. Sitting on the edge of your bed, you pop open a bottle of your favorite lotion. You lift your foot up, preparing to moisturize, but you can't resist stroking your silky sole a few times first, closing your eyes and imagining it's someone else. Eventually you snap out of it, and squirt a healthy amount of lotion into your hand before rubbing it all over your bare foot. You lose yourself for a bit, continuing even after the lotion's already absorbed, slowly coming to a stop and repeating with your other foot. You close the bottle of lotion, satisfied with the job you've done moisturizing your already unbelievably soft feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuck yourself in, and slowly drift off to sleep. In your final few moments of consciousness, you hear a noise, but you're too close to sleep to fight it, drifting off shortly after. Unfortunately (or maybe not so unfortunate) for you, that sound happens to be an invader, your secret foot admirer.....</span></div></div>",

Your sheets have been wrapped around your body, tighter than you'd have ever thought possible. You can't move your arms, pressed against your torso. Legs held together tightly, every inch of you enveloped and held fast, except your head and feet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet. Your mind, as it often does, quickly turns to your feet, as you feel a slight chill. You quickly notice your feet are bare - not only did someone bind you, but they've gone to the effort of removing your socks, leaving your feet exposed, your soles right on the edge of the bed. Even in this predicament you can't help but enjoy the feeling, wiggling your toes in the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another factor comes to your attention. Your big toes, bound together. Tightly enough to prevent your other toes from moving much, but not so much as to cause discomfort. Whoever did this knows what they're doing. You feel a tinge of fear, but your curiosity gets the best of you - how often have you imagined something like this? You try to suppress any fear, even as your inner foot-tease subconsciously comes out, your toes still trying to wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what's that? You hear a slight shuffling somewhere near the foot of your bed and momentarily freeze up.....</span></div></div>",

Before you can react, the unthinkable happens. You suddenly feel someone's mouth grasped onto your toes, making a sucking like sound in the quiet night. You feel a slight ease, as this new sensation pleases you with this stnrager's mouth around your toes. You can feel the warmth of the person's tongue lick at your sensitive toes, making you slightly giggle. Just when you though it was over, you feel your big toe now being grasped in the person's mouth. By now you're relaxed, enjoying every moment of this as this stranger worships your feet. Then you feel a new sensation; But this one is different than the rest. Less enjoyable. You couldn't help but let out a giggle as you feel a slimy wet tongue crawl up the sole of your feet. From your arch, to the misstep and all the way up to your toes. The stranger continued this up and down motion for a couple of minutes as you went relishing this sensation to flat out laughing your head off. You couldn't help but scream,\"Please Stop! Whoever you are, just stop!\" You continue laughing as the stranger kept this up for a couple more minutes. Then you heard a voice, a deep rough voice coming from the foot of your bed, \"Why should I? Your feet are gorgeous! I have so many plans for them!\" The man continued his pursuit on your feet  while you laughed your head off. You tried moving your arms, but the man wrapped you up really good and you couldn't move. Desperately, you make your last move,\" Please! I'll do anything! Just stop!\" The man seemed to be thinking about this offer because he suddenly stopped licking your feet. \"Alright, it's a deal\" he responded. Even in the dark, you could've sworn he had this big old smile on his face. \"Man, your feet are treat....</span></div></div>",

You see that there is a phone on the dresser a few feet away. You try and roll off the bed and see if you can get to it. but when you roll over the first time, you feel someone sit on your legs when you roll on your stomach. \"I'm sorry, missy, but I'm afraid I cannot allow you to escape. you see, your soles are so delicious, I need something to help their flavor.\" You see he has a jar of special honey your dad bought at the farmer's market. Your eyes widen in fear. the only time someone did something this bad was your dog. You wanted to experiment how it felt when you saw a video of it, so you laid on the couch, spread a little honey or your soles, laid on your stomach, called your dog, told him to sit on your legs so his mouth was near your feet, and told your dog to lick them. you remember crying like crazy from how much it tickled, and you couldn't tell him to get off from how much you were laughing. You never wanted to relive it again, but here you were. You shivered when you felt the cold honey being spread on your feet. you felt the cold and sticky liquid on your soles, your arches, your heels, and under your toes. You felt hands wrap around your ankles, and they were lifted up in an arching position. You heard the man lick his lips seductivly. You were so afraid, you tried to wiggle out of it, but the man was heavier than you, and you barely budged. You then felt the tongue lick up your left sole, feeling the honey coming off. \"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Please, no! stop! it's too much!\" your words fell on deaf ears as he continued licking up your feet. you felt his tongue on your soles, your arches, your heels, and when it went under your toes, you went ballistic. Eventually, after half an hour, the honey was gone, your feet were slick with his saliva, and you were crying, panting heavily from the ticking. The man was still sitting on your legs, wiping his mouth. he was about to say something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says \"wow.....that was so delicious......\"</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly, just as quickly as it had all began, nothing. Silence. As you lay there and beg for him to stop, you feel his fingers crawl up from your heels, all the way up your soles, to the undersides of your toes. You scream with beautiful ticklish laughter, begging louder and louder for this stranger to stop tickling your amazing feet. To no avail, for your begs fall upon deaf ears. He digs his fingers under your toes, letting your little piggies wiggle all over his fingers. \"You sure are a fun one!\" He says, finally wiggling his fingers between your sensitive toes. You fight back a moan as you lay helpless. Truly a 'hot mess.' Your hair is a mess, you are already sweating, and this strange man is wiggling his fingers all over your feet. He's enjoying every second of it too, but he doesn't know you are enjoying it like he is. He just keeps on scratching your feet. Your heels, your arches, your toes, your bridges... Everything gets a good tickling. This goes on for several minutes before he stops to let you catch your breath. \"P-please stop! Please! I'll do anything! Anything!\" you beg. \"Anything?\" he chuckles. You realize you made a mistake as you hear footsteps walking away from your naked feet...</span></div></div>",

Trying your best not to melt mentally in front of a stranger, you shake your head side to side but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it feels incredible, his hands moving skillfully from your heels to your toes, paying special attention to the arches and balls of your feet. Your head leans back as you enjoy every second of it. You can barely contain your voice. It feels so good, you almost feel ashamed of showing this side of yourself, it makes you forget how vulnerable you are, how insanely ticklish your feet are, to be so defenseless, how wet and slick... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. Wet and slick? Only now it clicks: \"Nmmmph! MMM! MMNPH!\" You let out, struggling even harder. Your tensing up makes your jailer licks his lips. This wasn't a simple foot massage, your ticklish soles now drenched in baby oil, you feel as ticklish as you'll ever be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still haven't fully recovered from this godly foot massage, it dawns on you like an electric shock. You had only seen it in videos on the internet but you never could have thought the hairbrush was so terrible. A simple wooden spiky hairbrush, gliding up and down, from side to side of each of your oiled, taut, helpless and hyper-ticklish feet. The toeties had a very peculiar way of pulling your toes further, leaving the balls of your feet fully stretched out, your most ticklish spot left defenseless. \"Tickle tickle tickle tickle! Coochie coochie coo! My god you're so screwed!\" The longer it goes on, the fewer words you can understand. It eventually sounds like a mash of the same thing, tickling! Tickling! Tickling! It's the only thing you can think of as your feet are being violated the same exact way you dreamt of. Becoming someone's tickle toy, loosing all options of control, being loved only for your feet. These were the feelings you hid deep, deep inside and there was no way you would ever admit these. Or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor so many times, you hoped for this predicament but today, you were not ready at all. The vivid scrubbing hadn't stopped for a good five minutes. Already you felt disgusting, a complete mess. Your ballgag covered in slimy drool, your face all red and teary from exhaustion, your body steaming of sweat. All this, simply from your feet and the fun part, it had only been fifteen minutes in total. In the meantime, your taunter had gone through every tease and taunt he knew, going from mocking your silky-soft soles to calling you a tickle-freak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so past your breaking point, you felt your mind snapping. You had been kicking, struggling, pulling and yet your feet stayed perfectly immobile on the other side of the wooden stocks. After what seemed an eternity, the man stops abruptly but the sensation doesn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're almost fainting, surprisingly not from fatigue but from pleasure! Your soles are throbbing like you didn't know it was possible. At this point, you're actually scared of what could happen. The man lets out a nice, cool blow of air on your toes, it sends a jolt to your brain, making you moan right through the gag. Your captor seems very pleased. He explains \"I'm having the best time of my life but I think you're actually having an even better time. I can see how excited you are... I'm not a monster you know?\" He laughs and goes \"You know what? I feel like giving you a chance of stopping all this.\" Still panting, you were half listening. You understand the bare minimum of his offer and accept without letting him finish. He grins \"Good, good! I'm glad you're so quick on my offer. It's real simple...\" Your torturer finally pulls the slimy ballgag out of your mouth, you left bite marks on it. He continues \"call me Master\" You blush in a deep red, even redder than before. You manage to let out in a shaky voice \"M-Master\" Your new Master then smiles and orders you: \"Now beg me to keep scrubbing your ticklish feet, put some effort too!\" Your eyes widden. This is over the limit. Saying this out loud, you can't. It feels like your heart is gonna burst out of your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like it's not really a choice...</span></div></div>",

The shop owner is so sympathetic, he offers you to come back to repay later. You feel like it's almost too nice from him, you could never come back and save yourself a couple weeks worth of food, but this idea churns your stomach. He grazed the idea of some task you could help him with, said it would repay for the vase and more but he needed someone with the rest of the day free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping the owner means you get out of this, clean, but it will keep you from looking for whoever wanted to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulls you back further in the shop, around a dark corner and points to a big puffy lazy boy, telling you to sit. You obey. still unsure about what's next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The owner goes around the back of the chair, you get up to follow but he asks you to sit comfortably and wait on the chair, he mentions taking measurements. You don't ask further questions and do as told. He tells you to let your arms hang out, you do so, thinking of how nice the old man is, one hand at a time your wrists are tightened but nothing suspicious comes through your mind. Gazing at everything and nothing in the shop, this scene feels too surreal for you to think properly. Without giving too much attention, you didn't see what was happening around. Your legs, which were planted at each leg of the lazy boy, are now joined together as one. As you try to turn around, your whole body gets pulled to the chair, your wrists are pulled far behind you, your legs feel stuck to the footrest. You don't have the time to grasp what happened before you are gagged with a rag. Worried you have been tricked and something terrible is about to happen, you struggle the hardest you can but notice how helpless you are. In a flash you were completely overrun with ropes and tied firmly, you were at an old pervert's mercy unable to negotiate or even beg. As scared as you were, it all vanished when you looked at the old man's face, he was smiling nonchalantly. In panic, everything seems to go so fast, the footrest going up, your shoes being pulled off, your sweaty socks ripped off. In a matter of minutes, it went from you being in control, to you tied up in someone's back shop. The longer it went, the more you were loosing control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As your mind catches up, you realize how deep you are in the hole. Matter of fact, as you try again to move, you feel like you have been encased in mummy wraps but in reality, your limbs have been tied so well, even your fingers are tied to the bars of the chair. The real fear starts when you go to move your prized feet. The footrest up, the soft bottoms of your feet totally vulnerable to anything that may come their way. Your toes, the last defense to protect your furiously ticklish soles, were no match against the shop owner's master rope techniques. Pulled back to the maximum, each toe is secured back to another noose at your ankles, keeping your soft, meaty soles all taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, panicked. The old man explains to you no harm will be done to you, but the task he needs help with is tricky. Already in a bind, you listen. He starts by venting the good effects of traditional healing and how it saved some family member of his, you don't listen to this part much. He then goes into how these treatments are made, all while he grabs specific bottles off the shelves. Even though you are in no posture of being cocky, you pay no attention to half of what he says as you try to look around for a way to get out, and you don't notice him sitting near your immobilized feet. You hear the old owner tampering with something, it makes you twitch your taut soles relentlessly. You walked a while before getting in this mess, the cream you used on your feet this morning had time to moisten your already crazy ticklish feet. The fact you prayed for this exact scenario every night made this even more embarrassing, it feels like you bit way more than you could chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grew more nervous, it hit you like a bee sting. It went so fast you didn't have time to react. You felt something being slobbered on your feet, like a lick of a paintbrush, one per foot. That's it, the old man got up smiled again and pointed at an old clock on the wall, he tells you to make it to 5pm and you're free. That's three hours, strange but easy. Too easy in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The old man goes out of the shop and leaves you alone. At this exact moment, you feel a sharp sting on the middle of your left foot, right over your arch. It sends out a jolt to your leg that makes it pulls back heavily but without any success. Seconds go by, you feel a new sting appear every five to ten seconds, it feels maddening. Before you can pull yourself together, your feet are attacked by the feeling of tens, no, hundreds of little stings all over your soles. An intense sensation of tingling that doesn't stop. Thousands of feather tips poking and poking all around every bits of ticklish flesh. In an instant, it almost makes you regret all these years of pampering your feet. Nothing you have ever seen on the internet can compare to this, from the scrubbers to freshly manicured nails. Every single inch of skin on your immobilized, taut soles feels like it's being tickled by someone new, making it hundreds of people tickling the feet you are so used to hide. The fact anyone could come in the shop and see or hear you going berserk, you can't even think straight at this point. Tears are flowing down your face, your whole body is trying to twist away from the bonds but it just tires you more and more and more, leaving you a sweaty, begging mess. Whatever is on your feet does more than tickling, it digs straight at your nerves, leaving you helpless as you can't do anything but beg for your captor to scrub your oversensitive, now reddened soles with padded brushes to get rid of the itches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a glimpse at the clock, it's been ten minutes. You'll die if you have to complete the three hours, you think. Maybe try cutting a deal when the old man comes back... If he comes back.</span></div></div>",

With an insane coordination, a rag is tied around your head, leaving you blind and unable to spit out whatever is keeping you from screaming. You can barely hear your aggressor give out a signal before you're pushed down. After hitting the ground, without any delay, you start rolling, somebody is pushing you, making you roll on your side. The more you roll, the tighter your arms get around your body, your legs trapped together. It feels like one of the fishing nets you found.  The whole thing happened in such speed and precision, so much it leaves you unable to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's recapitulate, you can't see anything or make any sound, you are pretty much stuck in a cocoon, inside an abandonned shack, on a deserted beach, isolated by forest. This might be one of the most helpless situation possible and the irony is that you deserve the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling like a worm, you hear laughter from two persons around you, which makes you even more worried. Too tired to wriggle anymore, you are then picked up and brought outside, you feel the sun then the cold from the shadows. Having no idea where you are now, you rely on your hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 1: \"Do you think we're good here? Sure this part of the beach is empty but what if someone hears us?\"<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Stop worrying we talked about this! We're far enough so nobody will disturb us.

Your fantasies mixed in with the total helplessness, you feel your face melting in a deep beet red, good thing they can't see you. Finally, whoever was carrying you slowly puts you down but something doesn't feel right. You feel cold ground instead of hot sand and some kind of sand walls around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart skips a beat when you realise they are seriously going to bury you.

You have no idea what they put over you to keep you in place, but it's really effective. The fact you were already wrapped under the sand, made very few movements possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard some finicking around before both men went further away to talk: <br>\r\n Person 1: \"Rolling when you're ready\"<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Same here, I found what we needed so let's get this done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nervous as you could be, you wriggle your feet side to side, hoping to somehow free yourself. Saddly, your luck had run out. One of your captor sat near you while the other one stood further. The closest started talking louder and not in my direction, not even to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Hi Sir! As you requested, we found someone who fits your demands but he is not so cooperative. So today, we will begin with a lesson and end with the negotiations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man made his speech, you feel your shoes being untied and slowly pulled off. Revealing your sweaty moist socks, your heart was racing so fast you thought it might blow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Oh my! These socks look so dirty but, funny enough, they smell like lavender. Let's peel them off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling your toes as tight as you can, you do you best to keep the last protection you have left but, at last, both socks slide off your slender feet. Ashamed as ever, you can't keep yourself from wiggling your toes at they touch the cool breeze, curling and spreading them wide. You hear gasps as you stretch out your feet like a butterfly stretches its wings. Thinking back about wanting to make the best out of this, you decide to go all out in teasing. Every wrinkle, every sensitive bit of your feet, from your toes to your heels, you knew exactly how to show them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After what seemed a couple of minutes, spent showing your feet in every way to strangers, you finally hear the furthest of you babbles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 1: \"A-alright let's move on\"<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Right, after such a great show let's ask our guest, politely, to relax his feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you obey this simple request?</span></div></div>",

Your guard down, it finally happens. You immediately feel fingertips grabbing and pulling at the base of your toes, you cringe the second it happens but you're not quick enough. Both of your soles are forcefully taut as your toes are pulled back. You were somewhat comfortable up until this point, now you knew it wasn't a simple prank. The one holding your feet let out a reassured gasp and said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 2: \"Finally! Took some time but you fell for my trap. Now it's play time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard these words, you clenched but everything stood still. 10 seconds, 15 seconds went by, you don't even have the time to question anything that it falls on you like thunder. Your head jolts back, your feet are tensing up but all you could do is keep shamefully begging and screaming in your gag.  Both men got closer to your feet while you weren't aware and as the first one held your toes back, the second one grabbed a pair of hand-scrubbers and went to town on your defenseless soles. Swinging your head side to side in a motion of disaproval, trying your harder to free your toes at least, nothing was of use against such an intense sensation. Who knew walking to the beach would prove to be your demise. The mix of sweat and lotion covering your tired feet made the perfect replacement for babyoil as it makes your feet extremely slick, while keeping the benefits of moisturizing your ever so soft ticklish feet. You feel every single silicone bristle gliding over and across your soapy arches increasingly faster as your eyes starts to water and you drool all over yourself. The synthetic hands brushing away at every of your greatest weak spots. These guys were no noobies to tickling, taking their time to single out and find which spots gives out the best reactions to abuse of it. Soft scrubs on your arches and repetitive stroking for the balls of your feet. Your heels were pretty ticklish too, but your executioners took too much pleasure in the most tender parts. No words were spoken, not even taunts, both guys were in awe of your perfect feet. Once they figured out which parts of your feet were of interest, all that was left to do was to tickle every inch of skin and map it, so to speak. If they got around to this step, it would mean a whole lot of trouble for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around 15 minutes of this treatment for them to stop but it felt like centuries. You're already a complete mess, drenched in sweat and drool all over, panting heavily. You couldn't closely imagine it would be this intense. As you're trying to control yourself and breathe, the one holding your toes mentions how his friend focuses too much on the soles, he needs to give your toes some love. As soon as you hear about your toes, you can't contain how nervous you are, you start wriggling more and more, which both of the guys notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Person 2: \"You see what I see? He seems pretty responsive about his toes. Why not give it a try?\"<br>\r\n Person 1: \"If talking about his toes makes him nervous, we'd be stupid not to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a 30 seconds break and some fidgeting, you brace yourself for more torture. Your toes are left alone this time, both men holding firmly one foot. They start a countdown of 5, you hear clicks and some muffled sound in the back then they hit right between your toes. Electric toothbrushes going precisely in every crevices of your sensitive toes. Under, over and between, no spots left unclean. All your twenty toes were being ravaged at the same time using different techniques. No one ever had the opportunity to go this close to your toes, you couldn't even wash between them without squirming. At this very moment, this very spot was being violated in every way, making you do noise you didn't know existed. You were practically howling with laughter and your captors knew it was only a matter of time before you snapped. Like the predicament of your soles, your toes endured around 15 minutes of ticklish mapping, leaving you in total mush. At the end of all this, you couldn't even remember where you were. As you calmed down, the guys packed up, played a bit more with your feet, wrote stuff up on one of your sole and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived in the morning, got your feet tickled senseless and were now stuck buried feet up on the beach. Lucky for you, fishermen arrived eventually soon after as if it was all according to plan. You got helped out of your hole and ran away home in shame of being caught like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally home, you sit down and look at your redened feet, still sensitive from the torture. Your left foot in covered in ink, going from taunts to random drawings. Near your heel is written what could be a phone number. Completely exhausted, you take note of it before jumping in the shower to wash it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, with the phone number still in mind, you wonder if it would be safe to call. You could also take the day free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No chance since you won't be going to the beach anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your cellphone and dial the number, it rings, an automated voice message starts.

You get inside the vehicle and pray to whatever god there is for good luck. The ride takes a while, you really made a good decision with this taxi. Arriving at destination, you confirm what you said, that it is a shady club in downtown. You pay the driver a hefty amount of money, fair for the distance,  then walk through the club's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you're surprised. The interior is astonishing, giving it the look of a chic restaurant. You walk up to what seems to be a register held by a small, feminine woman with glasses. She greets you with a smile and hands you some kind of menu. In total confusion, you grab the thing and keep staring at her, which confuses her. She asks you: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: \"Um, Hi! Can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou babble quickly that it's your first visit here and you're not too sure about how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: \"Ah, of course! This here, sir, is what we call the menu. You pick any option you desire and we serve it to you in one of our many private rooms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing but with better understanding. You go sit in one of the many empty chairs while making your pick. Evidently, you skip everything until you reach the feet section. You didn't bring your wallet, so you only have the money in your pockets. After meticulous verifications, you can't match any price. On the corner of her eyes, the cashier sees you pouting and waves you to come close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: \"You look troubled, is there anything I can help you with the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to her, you didn't think the prices would be this high and you spent a bit too much on travelling expenses. Leaving you with no options but to go back. The cashier looked almost relief as you said you didn't have enough money. She goes through her documents, flipping pages after pages. She stops at one specific page and looks at you over her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: \"We do have options for people with lesser means, they're almost exactly the same as our regular contracts but with \"constraints\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask precisions of these constraints but she swiftly dodges the subject, saying how these options are practically free and exactly the same as the paying ones. You can hardly believe it but what other choice do you have?

She hands you some kind of contract that you sign on the fly, you hand her back the piece of paper and most of the money you had left before leading you further in a corridor. You see rooms left and right with scriptures on the walls naming the type of services handled in every room. She leaves you in front of a red door at the end of the corridor and tells you to knock when you are ready. You hesitate, you didn't even know what was on the other side. It could very well be something you have no interests in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough questioning, you knock and immediately regret it, probably the adrenaline. The door opens up inviting you in, so you oblige. Inside you see a big lazyboy and stocks. You go livid thinking about being restrained again but as you turn back, the door closes and you're locked in. A big sheet of cloth hides a corner of the room, <br>\r\nso with nothing better to do, you decide to investigate. You go near it, grab the cloth and pull, revealing four clowns on each others. The minute you uncover them, the clown tower falls on you, pinning you down. You are quickly under control and dragged to the lazyboy, one of the clown is holding the stocks open as the others are forcing your ankles into its grip. With four against one, you are once again rendered helpless. This time, your arms are free to move, but being strapped to the chair doesn't leave you much choice. Your feet on the contrary, might be in an even worse position than yesterday, if possible. Now firmly locked inside a set of padded stocks, your ankles were now part with the ground, your feet only moving from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour clowns with stupid smiles in front of your own deliriously ticklish feet. For a second time in two days, you had your shoes and socks seductively removed in order to tickle you silly. Can you call this bad luck or, in your case, jackpot? You don't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your delicate feet at the mercy of these prankster, you didn't know how to react. They were clowns so if you laughed, would they go slow? Maybe if you played tough they would eventually get bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say? Play tough or play the game?</span></div></div>",

Either they'll get bored or you'll just anger them, anyway you're already strapped in with your most ticklish spot fully exposed. You wait as they get tools. Your soft soles still moist from the lotion this morning, no need for any oil. They take positions and suddenly start all at once at different spots of your feet. Some pinches your toes, others scratches your arches, you feel nibbling on the ball of your left foot. This time though, you don't break into a laughing mess. You clench your jaw and push through the tingling feels all over your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns looked at you surprised, yet doubled in strenght. Slow and soft scratches from forty fingers all at once on your prized feet. Yet it didn't break you nearly as much as the guys from yesterday. Maybe you grew stronger by enduring so much. Seconds turn to minutes as you keep resisting the barrage of tickles coming at you. The clowns are clearly annoyed as you haven't break in almost ten minutes. It then went to a full stop. the clowns turned around and made a little meeting. All while you are trying to control the sensations still on your feet, a diabolical plan is hatching right next to you. Before you have time to react, two clowns force your feet against the stocks while another starts setting up ropes at the top of the stocks. You wonder what these are for. You are being so defensive you keep your toes curled. The shortest of the gang approaches the stocks and with one specific caress along the ridge of your feet, forces your toes to spread the widest you ever could. You try so hard to keep yourself together but constant caresses along this magical weak spot seem to leave your toes exactly where they needed not to be. These shameful touches finally stop, leaving you stunned at how dangerously sensitive your feet can be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou won't fall for it twice, you try and curl you toes, only to meet new obstacles. This clown special massage had more than one goal. It broke your nerves by showing you how weak you really are. Ever more importantly, the others had time to firmly tie back every single of your toes, tauting them, keeping them spread as wings, unbelievably ticklish wings. You try to pull your feet free but quickly discover you are now way too deep in this you'd like to admit. Your nervousness starts taking over you as one by one, every clown leaves until one stays. You are left at the mercy of the shortest clown of the gang. For some reason, nothing happens, yet. You try asking him or her to free you but you are reminded about the contract you signed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe or she then walked up to the stocks with a metal box that was set up in front of your defenseless soles. The clown says it shouldn't take longer than five minutes but you still don't understand, until the heat comes on. Directed at your feet, the heater start to make you sweat profusely, the bottoms of your feet glistening with sweat and the residues of lotion. Your skin becoming a tender red. After the five minutes, the short clown came back in. You couldn't take it anymore, your soles felt stinging red yet were so sensitive, the simple wind of the door made you crack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot sweat opened up all your pores and the lotion entered deep inside. The heater now off, dust could've tickled you crazy. After being tickled at the beach, you thought nothing could compare but you didn't know anything. Your soles have now attained peak sensitivity, you feel all your nerves pulsating vividly. As you are still trying to assimilate such a situation. A single breeze of air makes you hurl insults through screams of laughter. This was only a soft breath along your heel. You now understand how screwed you are. You try to beg your captors but you are cut off by your own socks rammed in your open mouth, tape surrounds your head forcing you to keep tasting your socks. Your eyes widdens as the clowns get closer and closer to your now alarmingly helpless feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's recapitulate again, can't talk? Check. Can't move? Check. Your biggest weakness is totally obvious and used against you? Check. Can you end up worse? Of course. When you thought hell was about to unleash. The gang backs off of your trapped feet. They do a meeting quickly and look back at you. Three of them leaves again and it could not make you more scared. Once again left with Shorty. You are left to your own imagination while something is plotting. You finally get some attention. The last clown kneels near your defenseless feet. You try to curl your toes but the cords are holding them spread out and ready. You feel something pointy pressing against both your moisturized, heated, already ticklish arches. You fling your arms trying to reach your feet but your just too far. The clown finally adresses to you: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShorty: \"Listen, we're just doing our jobs and you playing tough is really irritating. You're supposed to laugh, like it or not. Since we don't feel like playing with you anymore, you'll sit here in silence while these rotative brushes keep your cute arches some company. I'll come back later to ask you if you enjoyed our services and you better say so. By the way, the room is filmed since you couldn't fully pay. See you later sissy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clown left, the lights went off. You heard two clicks and felt those said brushes slowly gain speed, tickling away all hopes of getting out soon. Not only are your feet secured firmly, keeping you from kicking the devices away. When setting these up, Shorty over adjusted them so they would continuously scrub your arches for an infinite amount of time. You better be confortable, you're not getting of this ride that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  You pull your feet away from the torturous tickles. Feeling defeated you open your eyes to meet your tickler. He was a tall guy, with blond hair, currently shirtless. He wore swim shorts, and had a mixed emotional face. He was happy he won, but sad at the same time. His bare feet were dripping with water. By the looks of it, he just took a swim. He sat down beside you. Your flip flops managed to stay on. <br>\r\n  \"Why were you tickling me.\" You ask.<br>\r\n  His response was just a finger pointing under the bench. There laid shoes, socks, a shirt, and a bag. These must have been his belongings and his bench. You apologize for taking his spot. You get up and move to another bench. You look back at the mysterious tickler. He laid down on the bench you just left. His are feet were beautiful. High arches, not too wide, not too high, colored in the middle, size 8 by the look of it. Then you realize this is your dream. By now the real tickler had left and probably left a note. So you can do what you want now with a the dream tickler.</span></div></div>",
