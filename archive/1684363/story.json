The staff and faculty generally only eat girls as disciplinary action, but the students are another story.  They are in fierce competition to protect the girls from their own house as they try to kidnap girls from other houses, either to eat, or feed to monsters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery girl who is captured and devoured legitimately counts for a point for the capturing student's house and against the kidnapped girls house. She also provide much entertainment to that house as they are she in a feast or fed to someone's pet, sometimes after being ravaged by the student that captured her.  However, this is not a complete free-for-all.  There are a number of rules and restrictions in place to prevent complete chaos - for girls to count towards the point total, they must be captured legally.  Moreover, violating these rules also brings strict punishments, as described below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules of this new policy, as well as other aspects of this world, are as follows:  (Don't be daunted by the amount of detail - I'm just trying to give you a sense of what kind of world this is.  I'm more interested in the spirit of the rule - if you need to have an exception made, just come up with a decent sounding reason).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOPULATION:  <br>\r\nAt any given time, the population of the school is roughly 50/50 male/female.  Since there are so many surplus girls in the general population, new girls get transferred in as others are eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENU:<br>\r\nOnly girls are on the menu. This rule is absolute and enforced by binding magic, and applies even outside of Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAFETY:  Girls do have some limited protections: the following rules are not enforced by magic, but rather by the faculty, staff, and prefects:  <br>\r\na)  Students MAY NOT enter other houses unless invited by a student from that house.<br>\r\nb)  Girls may not be eaten in their own houses (ie, Gryffindor tower, Ravenclaw Tower, Slytherin Dungeon, Hufflepuff Basement), unless their prefects allow it (usually theu won't, because of the house cup, as well as house loyalty). <br>\r\nc)  Girls may not be captured or eaten in the Main halls (which provide access to the classrooms).  They also may not be captured or eaten in class, unless their teacher AND the head of their own house (i.e. McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, or Flitwick) sign off on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDUELING:  Anywhere else in the castle, the rule is that you may capture a girl, but only if you challenge her to a duel first (which she HAS to accept).  Any companion of hers within a 15 foot radius may fight in her place to protect her, however. If the challenger is male, he may not make the challenge without a WILLING stand-in offering to be \"collateral\".<br>\r\nThe winner gets the loser (or the girl they were protecting or using for collateral, if they are male), so one way or another, a girl will be captured by someone.  At that point ,a binding spell is placed on that girl, and she may be taken away by the victor of the fight, usually to the victor's House where she can be chained up.  If someone wants to rescue her (or poach her), and they are still in the castle, then they have to make ANOTHER challenge (and so if they are a guy, they must provide ANOTHER girl, who also must be willing, as collateral.  As you can imagine, its hard to convince a second girl to be your collateral when the first one just got taken away to someone/something's dinner).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO MAN'S LAND:  Outside the castle it's a free-for-all, so anyone can try to kidnap girls EXCEPT during organized events, like herbology class, quidditch, etc...  Of course, these events have their own dangers...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRULE VIOLATIONS:<br>\r\nIf students fail to follow the rules, or start failing classes, or does any other serious offense, and are caught, then the punishment varies depending on their gender:  <br>\r\nA girl found in violation is generally sentenced to be eaten in some way - either fed to monsters for entertainment (and to keep them from going hungry), served at a feast, given to the house of the girl she illegally attacked, etcetera.  <br>\r\nIf a guy breaks the rule, he can be expelled, or possibly have a restraining spell put on him to keep him from eating ANY girls for some amount of time.  It may even be decided that a girl from his house, or even a sister or cousin, has to pay the price.  <br>\r\nHOWEVER, in all cases, the offending student (male or female) is innocent until proven guilty - so if a 5th year student snatches a little first year girl from the main hallways when no one's looking, or grabs someone elsewhere without making a formal challenge, and doesn't get cuaght, he's fine.  As long as no one can prove conclusively that he took a girl illegally, he's fine (remember, he can always say he caught her outside, unless she can prove otherwise.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAPTIVE GIRLS:<br>\r\nAs long as the above rules are followed, students may do what they want with their captives, which often means rape, followed by (or even simultaneously with) a feast or feeding her to a monster for fun. However, girls can also be used in a prisoner exchange, or held as a slave for a little while.  If they aren't eaten before the end of the year, they will go free and not count towards the house cup, so although some girls are kept as slaves for awhile, they are almost always eaten within a few weeks - since they will be eaten anyway, its better to avoid the risk of them escaping (plus each house has only limited space for holding captives)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSEX:<br>\r\nSex between students is allowed, (after all, life is short).  An unbreakable birth control/protection spell has been placed on all the girls, so there is no risk of pregnancy or STDS.  Captured girls may be raped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQUIDDITCH: <br>\r\nThe Quidditch teams are required to have at least 3 girls on the team at all times.  The winner of each match gets to take their pick of the losing team's girls as a victory feast.  There are also sometimes hazards during the game itself - the game can be played over a pit of monsters, or with dragons flying around the air.  And of course, the penalty box almost always has a fun surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPREFECTS:<br>\r\nHouse prefects have considerable authority.  Often, they get to decide which girls are sacrificed when their house is punished.  Technically they have discretion over the use of all captured girls (with any disputes among prefects resolved by the, though in practice, a girl is usually given to the one who captured her to do as he or she pleases, unless there is a pressing need for her (e.g. in a prisoner exchange), since the prefects like to keep morale up.  As mentioned above, they can also put girls in their own houses on the menu as a way to punish them, or their friends, for disloyalty.  Students can appeal to the head of the house if this is abused, though such abuse is rare, on account of the prefects' interest in keeping morale up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE HOUSE CUP: <br>\r\nThe house cup is given to the house that has the highest score, evaluated by taking the number of girls they have eaten from other houses, and subtracting the girls that have been eaten from their own house.  This gives them incentive to protect their own girls.  The winning house is given a feast, consisting of a number of the losing houses' girls, generally selected from that house, with one exception: the winning prefects each get the privilege of selecting any girl he or she wants from the entire female population of the lowest scoring house.  This is often the only practical way to get their hands on a rival prefect (or rival prefect's girlfriend, if the rival is male), and so the prefects tend to be especially fanatical about winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOMARADERIE:<br>\r\nIn each house, there is also in each house a sense of camaraderie, and the male students tend to feel particularly protective of the girls in their house.  While this isn't universal - there are always somewhat disloyal exceptions, the general attitude is that they are all in this together against the other houses, and particularly their rivals.  (That DOESN'T mean I want to discourage you from having Harry or Ron eat Hermione, or something like that.  Just make sure that you come up with a plausible explanation, e.g., they have a falling out, or whatever - and other people in the same house wouldn't shrug it off - there might be consequences).  If you really want, I guess you can put a character in a different house if that makes it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's about it.  Like I said, don't feel too confined by the rules - they are guidelines to give you some place to start, so if you feel like you need to deviate from them, just make up a reason.  For example, you may have faculty women get eaten also, but just give it a good explanation, like she committed a firing offense, or a monster got loose, or something like that.  After all, accidents happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to start, what year, i.e., which book does the story take place in?  Make sure that the ages of characters correspond to their ages in that book.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne idea which you don't have to do, but will make things interesting, is to take plot ideas from the actual books and give them a vore/cannibal twist - Maybe the Chamber of secrets is opened, just like in the books, but rather than turning people to stone, well, let's just say you can probably imagine what the Basilisk is doing in this Interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may also set the book at the time James, Lilly, Snape, et al are in school.  You can even put it in the time when Voldemort was a student if you want.</span></div></div>",

Rather abruptly, the cat transformed into a rather stern looking witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headmaster,\" she replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, I'm afraid I have some terrible news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, the Potters.  Oh, poor James and Lilly, if we ever find who betrayed them, I swear I'll-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, that is not why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Oh dear, do you mean to tell me that You-Know-Who is still at large?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly wizard sighed, his tired eyes making him appear older than he was - a rather impressive feat for a man who just recently celebrated his centennial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid it's even worse than that.  You recall how Voldemort fancied himself to be the heir of Slytherin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's absurd for anyone to think they could trace that back 1000 years.  Clearly he was delusional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, my sources as the Ministry tell me that he was in fact correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they know this, how, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that there were, hidden away in the Department of Mysteries, a number of documents indicating that Slytherin placed a rather unusual curse on the Wizarding world before he died.  If an heir were ever to take up his noble work, then ancient magics would become active, severely altering the ratio between male and female births, in favor of females.  We know neither why nor how he did this, though we speculate that it had something to do with a plan to breed a new, purer race of wizards.  But whatever the cause, it appears that Voldemort was that heir, and the curse was activated a few years ago, though only now has it reached what we think to be it's peak, where it will likely remain.  The effects are going to be devastating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall chuckled.  \"Now Dumbledore, I realize you don't swing that way, but surely this is not quite the catastrophe you're making it out to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore chuckled gently, but his face remained somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid it is.  The ministry has already determined that to maintain the balance, and prevent a complete demographic explosion, some girls will have to be eliminated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Albus, you can't mean Euthanasia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have favored such a solution, actually, rather than what the ministry is contemplating.  As of right now, they don't have the political will, but soon, mark my words, they'll have legalized the most terrible things - cannibalism, feeding young girls to monsters, you name it.  And we'll have to go along with it.  All of us.  Including them.  Including him,\" Dumbledore concluded, as a large man on a motorcycle carrying an infant in his arms.  \"To think, after surviving such horror, he and his friends will have to see their friends, girlfriends, even sisters devoured alive in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough of that.  Let us tend to young Harry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly ten years later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What would you like?\"<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know,\" he said, having never been asked his opinion of food before.<br>\r\n\"I Know, I\u2019ll buy you a girl to eat,\" he said steering him to a small parlour opposite Olivanders.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"Oh, a law passed three years ago means that any young girls you come across are allowed to be eaten,\" Hagrid said. \"That includes the girls you're goin to school with, though there are rules bout that. Ones bought here in the alley you can eat here.\"<br>\r\nHarry's head was reeling from the information and he sat down without comment.<br>\r\n\"Ere we are!\" Hagrid said as the waiter brought over a menu.<br>\r\nLooking down the list there were pictures of girls that he could eat and he chose one at random. A few minutes later two bound and gagged young girls around his own age with long black hair and blue eyes was brought to the table.<br>\r\nHagrid immediately grabbed one and lifted her up over his head before lowering her feet into his mouth. He swallowed and brought the girls knees into his mouth in spite of the young female\u2019s struggles and muffled screams. He gulped at her again, bringing her hips into his mouth and a noticeable bulge in his neck showing where the child\u2019s feet and legs were. Another swallow and she was up to her chest and her arms were inside, tucked to her sides as she looked pleadingly at harry. Another swallow and her head disappeared in Hagrid's mouth and it closed before a final swallow.<br>\r\n\"Um I\u2019ve never done this,\" Harry said embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d he replied. \u201cJust open your mouth wide and take her head in, then swallow until she\u2019s all the way down in your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\nHarry looked at the girl who was quivering and thought \u2018what the heck\u2019. He moved forward and opened his mouth wide, taking the girls head into his mouth. She tasted GREAT! He rolled her head around his mouth as he tasted her, before gulping at her, taking up to her shoulders into his mouth and bringing her head into his throat. The next few minutes were spent licking and swallowing the girl until he got to her waist. Then he threw his head back and used gravity to assist as he swallowed again and again until finally her feet slipped into his mouth and with a final swallow she was curled up in his belly.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was great!\u201d he gasped feeling incredibly full and aroused. <br>\r\n\u201cEating girls is a wonderful feeling,\u201d Hagrid chuckled. \u201cCome on now, we\u2019ll just disguise that bulge and let her digest. You\u2019ll enjoy your first, everyone does.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Usually it didn't bother him, but today, for some reason, it was out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the people in the next compartment.  What could they possibly be making so much noise over?  And what was that smell?  Whatever it was, it smelled good.  Harry was about to get up and look, when he noticed someone at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seat taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked up.  A tall, red-haired boy, covered in freckles,  was standing before him, gesturing toward the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, have a seat,\" he replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm Ron, by the way.  Ronald Weasley,\" the freckled boy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled at the boy.  He seemed friendly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, how did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scar's kind of a dead giveaway.  So you must have all kinds of stories to tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really - I grew up not even knowing I was a wizard.  I don't know much about this world at all.  And what <i>is</i> that smell. It smells delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who knows, maybe they're cannibals,\" laughed Harry, until he saw that Ron's face was dead serious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, you are kidding, right?  Wizards don't really eat people, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really don't know anything,\" Ron blurted out, then quickly realized his error as Harry began to looked a bit abashed.  \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make a big deal about it.  It's just, there's been a lot of major changes happening in the wizarding world, and I can't believe no one told you about them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they probably did, but my uncle shredded most of their letters, and I guess Hagrid might have forgotten to tell me some things - he seemed like he might be a bit forgetful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, yeah, I guess it's easy to forget these little details like the fact that <i><b>girls are allowed to be eaten!</b></i>\", Ron exclamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't know what to think or feel.  He was quickly overcome, first with shock, and a bit of fear, but then it was mostly just confusion, curiousity, and the tiniest bit of titillation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have a lot to talk about\".  And so Ron patiently explained all of the things that you, dear reader, already read about in the first chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Harry about an hour and a half later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it's sort of new for all of us.  And while eating some girls might be fun, I wouldn't want it happening to my little sister.\"  Ron shuddered at the very thought.  \"Still, it is what it is.  Now let's go see what other people are up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the raucous sounds from the neighboring car had become almost deafening, and were accompanied by a high pitched scream.   Ron sighed \"Don't people know you aren't allowed to eat girls on the train?  Everyone deserves a chance to at least get sorted first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we go see what's going on in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Harry, maybe it's best to mind our own business.  And anyway, I'm curious about that smell.  I could swear it's human meat, but a student would be mad to try to cook a girl here.  You'd be expelled before you even got to the castle!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps more frightening than the creature itself was the pair of young female legs dangling from its mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing, you know the rules!\"  shouted Ron as he stumbled in behind his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great, another one,\" the pale boy sneered as he looked at Ron, turning his gaze momentarily from the snake.  At this point, the creature's teeth were a bit bloody,  having sunk deep into soft butt of the little girl in its maw. \"Just how many of you are there, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon seemed to bristle at that, though Harry wasn't sure what it meant.  Meanwhile, Draco turned dismissively away from Ron to address Harry.  \"Is there something unclear about the words `Go Away?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon, undeterred, quipped \"No, it's about as clear as `No eating girls on the train.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, meanwhile, gazed in morbid fascination as the snake slurped the poor girl in further, so that only her young calves were visible.   He could hear muffled screaming and sobbing coming from inside, and found himself at once both revolted and aroused.  He could definitely see himself getting used to this.  But he had come in here to help these girls, and besides, this boy and his friends really rubbed him the wrong way.  He made up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, run get a teacher,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon did as he was told.  Harry, wand still out, turned to Draco, who by this time had also drawn his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the girl go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a prissy.  What are you going to do, cast a spell?  Put the wand down, do you even know how to use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had a point.  Harry really didn't have any idea what he was doing.  It looked like it was already too late for the first girl - her feet were about all that was left of her, other than a struggling bulge in the serpent's belly.  But the Indian girl still needed help, and despite his bravado, Draco seemed nervous.  He appeared to be about Harry's own age.  Maybe he didn't know what he was doing either?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm Harry Potter</i>, thought Harry, <i>I supposedly defeated Voldemort singlehandedly as an infant.  I shouldn't have to worry about these losers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to do something incredibly brave and/or stupid.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a result, he decides to patrol his territory, just in case something interesting found its way into one of his webs, or was nearby. Aragog is currently leaving the main part of his colony, followed by none of his many children, and stealth-fully climbs up a huge tree, then moves through the foliage without making a sound. Then with his ultra sensitive hearing, he suddenly stops, while he detects the sounds of the most delicious of meals, human females in distress nearby. He then slowly, yet carefully lowers himself to the ground, and cautiously moves toward the girl\u2019s voices with deliberate predatory intent. Oh, he hoped they would be tender and young he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The last time he had a human was many years ago, and he remembered that incident with joy to this day. It was a night much like this, and as he patrolled his territory, he caught a young female human in his web that foolishly walked into the woods by herself, dressed in a brown uniform. He remembered the joy he felt at capturing her and the fear on her face as he questioned her. Her name was Tina, and she was just fourteen-years-old. He then remembered the shock on her cute little face as he slowly undressed her, and then examined her. He thought about how good her body felt, as he raped her several times, before he devoured her alive. Oh how versatile those lovely human meals are, food a monster could play with. A spider can satisfy both his lust and his hunger at the same time. Perhaps he should have brought a few of his sons with him, just to teach them the joys of a human female. As Aragog moves through the plants on the forest floor, still hidden by them, he sees with his many eyes\u2026</span></div></div>",

At the same time, he begins to grin evilly, as his fangs start to drool, and his old, ten-inch spider cock is beginning to harden very quickly. Oh, he cannot believe his luck, he thinks to himself. What could send an old giant spider into tears, and make him both hungry and horny at the same time. Well, it was not his wife. Below him was three extremely attractive, young female humans swimming nude in the water. As these slender young girls skinny-dipped, the old spider lustfully watched their tender nude bodies in the light of the full moon, splashing each other playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the old spider stood there, hidden behind some large shrubs, watching the naked girls intensely, he thought to himself that these girls must be young for human. He thought this because he could not see any pubic hair in-between their slender young legs. In addition, he could clearly see that these girls were starting to develop small, perky young breasts. He could also see their tender young ass cheeks bobbing in and out of the water as they splashed each other. He simply could not keep his many eyes away from those lovely, firm, bare ass cheeks of theirs. He then notices that two of the girls have white skin, one has golden blond hair, and the other has red hair, while the third girl has lit bronze skin, and dark hair. Damn them for being so gorgeous, he thinks to himself. The old spider then quickly, yet silently steals all of the girls clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As nine-year-old Emily (the red head), ten-year-old Katy (the girl with the golden blond hair), and eleven-year-old Sasha (the Hispanic girl) play in the water, these young, nude, unarmed witches are unaware that their lives are in mortal jeopardy.

Not wanting to wait any longer, Aragog was determined to act, before it was too late. After he stole all of the girl\u2019s clothes, he used a bit of magic, and trickery that he had learned a long time ago from his former master, Hagrid. He used some ventriloquist techniques to make some noises from the other side of the lake, and he used his magic to make those noises sound like the instructors from Hogwarts were coming to find them. Not wanting to be discovered outside of Hogwarts and risk expulsion, or worse, the three nude young ladies ran out of the water, while at the same time attempting to cover their budding young breasts, and their hairless crotches with the only thing they had with them, their bare hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the three wet young ladies ran out of water and onto the beach, they looked around frantically for their clothes, and found nothing. The thought of someone actually stealing their clothes never crossed the young minds. These delicious, naive young girls simply assumed that either the wind blew them away, or some animal from the forest took them away to make their nest, which actually does happen a bit. <br>\r\nWhile looking around fruitlessly for her clothes, the girls hear the voices of their instructors calling angrily to them from the other side of the lake. Out of a sense of dread, Katy suggested, \u201cMaybe we should just give ourselves up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNO!\u201d Sasha told them, \u201cDo you want to anger the instructors, and risk being eaten alive, or being fed to something? Do you want Snip or Draco to munch on you after he is done raping you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat does rape mean?\u201d Emily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll find out if we are caught,\u201d Sasha replied! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI knew I should never have let you talk me into this! What do we do?\u201d Katy asked, glaring angrily at Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHold on, first you wanted to come, I never forced you into this situation. Second, we must go into the forest and hide behind some trees. Wait for them to leave, then try to make it back to school,\u201d Sasha told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLIKE THIS, WE ARE ALL NAKED AS THE DAY WE WERE BORN, AND I DON\u2019T WANT ANYBODY SEEING ME NAKED,\u201d Emily told the group with a raised voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Too late for that, Aragog thought to himself with a grin, still hidden by the lush foliage, and just a foot away from the soaking wet asses of Emily, and Katy. Now incredibly horny, the big old spider decided to do something risky. With his long tong, he reached out quickly licked Emily\u2019s bare buns, naturally causing a reaction. While the girls talked amongst each other, Emily jumped up in the air, and looked behind her, while at the same time rubbing her butt. \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d Sasha asked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI do not know? I think something touched, or brushed against my butt,\u201d Emily said with a surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEmily, it was probably the leaves of the trees brushing against your bottom,\u201d Katy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then all three of the girls heard the voices coming from the other side of the lake again. Immediately, the three girls ran into the forest and as they walked naked through the trees, the girls were separated, and they went their own ways, desperately trying to get back to school, and find something to wear. While the three nude girls tried to make it back to school, Emily found herself trapped in one of Aragog nearby webs. Only her hand was trapped, the rest of her was free. Sasha was nearby, and lost too. Katy on the other hand was wondering towards another humanoid monster that was both hungry, and horny. This new monster was a giant humanoid male, and he was late for giant school? Sasha could ether find herself in ether story line, with Emily or Katy. Sasha could be the old spider\u2019s pet and lunch, or the Giants pet or lunch?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Ten-year-old Katy is currently walking through the forest scared. She is wet, nude, and alone. Out of a sense of modesty, she has one hand over her budding young breasts and the other over her hairless crotch, as she looks around the woods in dread, because every shadow she sees now seems like a menacing beast, intent on harming her. As the young girl with blond hair looks around with fear in her eyes, she hears something moving through the forest towards her. In fear for her life, she hides behind a tree and peeks around the side, hoping that whatever it was would ether leave her alone, or help her. As she looks on, she is relieved to see that this intruder coming into view is Sasha. As Katy looks on, she sees Sasha carefully walking past some trees, and Sasha too is attempting to hide her exposed private areas from view with her bare hands. As the eleven-year-old Hispanic girl looks around in fear, Katy emerges from the safety of the tree, greets her, and they run over to each other, and embrace. As the gorgeous young blond haired girl, and attractive young the Hispanic girl talk to each other, several topics come up. The questions they raise are, \u201cWhere\u2019s Emily? What are we going to do? What are we going to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they talk to each other, they hear something moving around in the foliage before them. They are about to run and hide when they see that this new intruder is their size, it has red hair, and lightly tan colored skin. As it emerges from the woods, they recognize the intruder as their nine-year-old friend Emily. (What, I like red heads OK, and I believe she would be useful to both story-lines.) Emily then tells them, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what happened to me. I was stuck in a spider\u2019s web not too far from here, or my hand was, but sense I was wet, the spiders web did not hold me for long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSpiders web, something had to make it? Where\u2019s the spider?\u201d Sasha asked fearfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Emily could respond, the three wet naked girls hear something monstrous crashing through the woods. Paralyzed with fear, they look up in dismay to see a giant humanoid looking creature, dressed in a white toga walking past them. This giant looks like an adult male, and he was caring a huge cloth bag with him. This giant has long pointy ears, one big brown eye, and he has a thick beard. The more three girls look this giant Cyclopes over, the more they seem to think that he is a teacher of some kind, a Cyclopes teacher. They then watch as the giant turns around, looks down at them with a look of joy in his eyes, and smiles wickedly, while lustfully licking his lips. The three girls just stand there, immobilized by fear, as the giant adult male Cyclopes reaches down for them with his big hand. A few seconds later, the three girls find themselves trapped in the hand of the giant, who lifts them all up to his hand, and joyfully looks at them. The Cyclopes then says in a thunderous voice, \u201cGREAT, TODAY I HAVE TWO MORE LIVING SPECIMENS FOR MY CLASS TO STUDY?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a mouse like voice, Emily says, \u201cBut there are three of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYOU\u2019RE RIGHT MY PRETTY LITTLE PET, AND I DON\u2019T LIKE TO BE WRONG!\u201d the Cyclopes told her while laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few seconds later, the Cyclopes who we will call Mr. Grog reaches over with his free hand, and lifts poor Sasha by her arms up, and away from the other two girls. Sasha is then lifted up high into the air, towards his wide-open mouth. As she dangles over his mouth and her doom, the naked young girl could feel his warm, stinky breath blowing over her body. While she cries, desperately kicking at his mouth, and begging for him not to eat her, he just laughs. He then drops her into his mouth, and then closes it, trapping Sasha inside. As the tiny nude girl fights to stay alive, the giant simply swallows her down with one mighty gulp, and then lets out a huge belch. \u201cDAMN I LIKE SWALLOWING HUMANS ALIVE. THEIR SO TASTY, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG FEMALES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The giant then gently drops the two remaining naked human girls, Emily and Katy into his huge bag for safekeeping, and goes to giant school where he teaches. Inside this dark cloth bag, the two distressed nude girls discover\u2026</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the latest perverted twist on J. K. Rowling's beloved universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a vore/cannibalism interactive, with a good amount of other grossly offensive stuff, so if you're the type to be eaily offended or upset, are underage, or are otherwise forbidden by laws in your area to view this content, now's the time to bail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, keep in mind that this is a FANTASY.  While a lot of this stuff would be physically impossible in the real world, to the extent that it would be, it would be illegal, but much more importantly, grossly immoral.   Real death, rape, and other violence just leaves an empty hole in someone's life, and emptiness isn't much of a turn on.  If you actually find yourself wanting to do any of this stuff for real, then you need to get out of my interactive and seek serious help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill here? Excellent.  (I think)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic premise of this interactive is, that through a 1000 year old curse of Salazar Slytherin (who else?), the female population in the wizarding world has exploded - the ratio of girls to boys born is something ridiculous like 6 to 1 (or whatever ratio is consistent with the amount of girls getting eaten).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Slytherin put the curse into effect?  Who knows?  Maybe he was mad at the world and wanted to cause some chaos.  Maybe it had something to do with a plan to breed a master race of uberwizards.  Or maybe he was just into cannibalism and vore, and anticipate the response of the Ministry of Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was this response?  Quite simply, to place females on the menu.  The school rules and general description are laid out in the first chapter, and you should read those carefully to get a feel for what kind of setting this is, but the content restrictions are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALLOWED:  oral vore (soft AND hard), cannibalism, sex (straight or lesbian, all ages), incest, rape, nudity, shrinking (girls only, and only to a size at or above 3 inches tall - what good is a shrunken girl if she's so tiny you can't even taste her?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFORBIDDEN:  regeneration (i.e., coming back from the dead), scat, gay sex, non-oral vore (e.g. unbirth, cock vore, anal vore), anything to do with pregnancy, including milk, size change of any kind (other than described above), including weight gain or breast enlargement.  Also, shrunken girls are for eating, not crawling into other orifices. Yeah, I know, I'm no fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing against people who are into any of those things on the forbidden list - they just happen to be turn-offs for me, and I don't want to be turned off by my own interactive.  I'm just weird that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are a few other rules.  Please follow them, to make sure the story doesn't suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  ADDING CHARACTERS/ AVOIDING ONE-LINE CHAPTERS:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't like one-line chapters much.  At the very beginning you need a few, some of which I've put in place already, but even then I'd rather keep it to a minimum.  So here's the rule:  EVERY time you create an option to choose a character, you MUST write the first chapter of that characters' story, with at least 8 sentences for the first chapter of that character's story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want, you can also make a short initial chapter for the character with two choices (e.g., Start in the common room or Start on the Quidditch field, or something of that sort), and follow up one of the choices IMMEDIATELY with a real 8-sentence chapter. But if you do that, post the longer chapter within 24 hours, so I know not to delete the shorter one.  And once the story has started, every chapter should have at least 8 sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, when adding a new initial character, you MUST make the second option \"someone else?\", to allow others to join in.  (NOTE: this only applies to adding characters.  During the story itself, you get to decide both of the choices at the very end of your chapter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, I'm just trying to make sure people are actually participating in the story, and not cluttering it up with endless lists of characters, or strings of 2 sentence-long chapters,  that make reading it a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Someone ELSE has taken the character you really really wanted to write about, however, don't despair: First, you can certainly join in the current story tree for that character.  But also, there will be seven different years to pick at the very beginning, so if you want to start fresh, the best thing to do is just write about the character in a different year.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  DON'T END THE STORY:  Please do not end the story, though you yourself don't have to continue with that storyline - just write some options for someone else to pick it up in case they want to.  If the main character just died, give options to pick up the same story from another character's point of view.  That way, if someone else really likes that storyline, they can keep it going.  But you MUST be consistent with what's happened before, so if someone got eaten in chapter 5, I better not see them frolicking around in chapter 10  (Remember, NO REGENERATION!  Dead is Dead!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  DON'T KILL GIRLS UNLESS THEY ARE BEING EATEN:  Otherwise it's just wasting food.  I mean come on, people are starving in the third world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  CONSISTENCY:  Please be consistent regarding the events that have happened in your storyline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about it.  Try to be as good as you can about spelling and grammar - I'm not going to beat people up over it, but if I see \"HeMine get ate by ron LOLZ\" then I might just have to delete your chapter, block you from my profile, and put a Jihad on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, enough talk, let's eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
