I could only see darkness form 8 bodies, even I couldn't get a good grip as what or who they are, I saw them all go limp, as they died 1-by-1 all besides 1 which stood on the pile of them. I tried my best to free myself of my chains made out of fire that held me where to a pole. Tears slowly made it down my face as I saw that one happened to be my mom, and others who I never knew. As the dark figure walked closer and closer, I found myself wake from a dream, full of sweat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I looked at my body for damage, not finding any, I thought that same thought which haunted me to find out, <i>\"Why...? Why must I see this? What does it mean, why my mom?\"</i> It hurt me to see this, but I felt as if it was nothing but a warning and I should just cry out my pain for now but act as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Katsu!! Breakfast, pup!\" My brother yelled as nearly broke down my door, only to see a tear go down my face. My brother was 21, he had black fur opposite of mine, spiky cyan blue hair most say when were together he's a bigger, stronger black furred version of me. In fact, the thing we have most in common is our forest green eyes, which as many describe it as they could see our soul in them. He sat down on my bed right next to me, putting his arm around me he said, \"Little brother...what's wrong? Why you upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oniisan...The dream....I saw mom.\" I told him as my voice cracked, I couldn't avoid telling him as he already knew what I experienced, in fact I could hold nothing from my brother, he is the only one who could read me like a book anyway. Sion just patted me and I told him what I thought I required now, \"I need your help. I want to learn how to defend my self and others, I wish to learn how to fight and use magic, like you, dad, and mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Heh. This is gonna be hard few days for you you do know this?\" I just nodded toward my brother and the smirk on his face said everything, intense training. Picking me up he ran downstairs where my mother and former leader father is, since big brother took his place. My dad was a HUGE wolf, there was no other way to describe it since he had to eat on his four paws, otherwise he'd break through into the attic or the roof of mom's house. We would've lived where dad is, but now it's me and my brother and sister's house since we needed to know how living without mom and dad is like. Today was a special day, so dad and mom came here for my older sister, Eiko and my birthday. Dad was much like my brother, only difference eyes, different color hair, and size control, my dad had blood red eyes, that held nothing but love and white hair that calmly came down his face. My mother had fur much like mine but her's isn't extremely bright snow white fur, she has blue eyes, C cups, sky blue hair that came to her shoulder blade and an aura that made you think her as a mom. They stood in the kitchen, mom with her normal clothes, a yakata with pink and flower design, dad on the other hand had his special red trench coat with open sleeves that opened up near his funny bone, for rare occasions or just for fun, a black vest underneath, baggy brown pants, black fingerless gloves, and black boots. \"Hey dad! Hey mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hi honey. Your breakfast is on the table.\" Mom said smiling at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You seem like you wish to ask something...\" Dad said not even looking up from his breakfast, still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Daddy, can you mom and some of the clan teach me how to fight?\" I said gaining my parents, uncle Nero, who just came in, and my sister's, who was just getting down the stairs, attention. Dad and Nero looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dante...\" Uncle Nero and Eiko said looking to dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"After breakfast...if that's OK with you, hon.\" Dad looked to mom who just shrugged. She was actually against the whole thing but she promised me anything for my birthday, she could get. It was then she realized how serious I was, and although she swore to herself she'd do ANYTHING to get me from war and death, this was a exception. Her pup wanted her help and others for his birthday 'present'. I was truly serious about the whole thing, but to say I wasn't afraid or scared of my dream and it happening and my brother's training was a major understanding, but I will do my best!</span></div></div>",

Taking this moment I landed as best as I could, only to feel my butt land in the ground, before lifting me off the ground backwards. Using my claws to dig a place into the soft yet rocky earth, I felt a paw behind me, knowing it was my brother trying to keep me steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks on<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">ii-san</span>\" I said to my brother behind me before, the darkness of the night and our shadows from our feet started to become more...alive. It quickly formed to exact replicas of us, each now looking like a much darker fur and everything, red eyed replica with dark smoke-like stuff coming out of them. They eyed us, smiling but not attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello us. We are your...personas...we are you but we are not. The two of us are the demons or masks as a certain someone calls us...of you. As it stands, the obsticale that awaits you is also a persona user, and a much stronger enemy. You, who have yet to seen your \"truth\" and your \"fate\", are to be tested by us to see if we can release your latent power, even just a bit. Our objective given to us by Igor, whom we sure you've met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWILL BE FINISHED SOON!!</span></div></div>",
