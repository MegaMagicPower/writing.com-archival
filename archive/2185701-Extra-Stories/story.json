A boy named Hanson Hannah discovers that he can switch genders and become Hannah Hanson at will but finds it is not as fun as he expects it to be as he can not change back into a boy when wearing anything feminine like perfume. Worse, a girl learns his secret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A girl discovers that she can swoon any boy or man with her voice, make him do whatever she wants. The only draw back is she can only control one boy or man at a time and her brother is immune...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A boy discovers that he can literally make his dreams and fantasies come true.

Pictures of you growing up appear in the family's home and they treat you as if you were always a member of their family.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>June 1st... It was just before the start of summer vacation. I had just resolved a rather nasty issue with the Bane family. Someone was stealing money from their home and they had begun to blame each other. I discovered it was actually Sarah Bane's crooked boyfriend who was the culprit. He was just using her to get a piece of the family fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to see all of the money returned to the family and that lying, cheating thief put behind bars but I had a feeling that I would become his brother to solve his issues sooner than I wanted to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a young girl screaming in protest. I turned only to feel dizzy for a moment. As my head cleared a second later, I knew I had switched families. The little girl was named Ina Barns, my baby sister. She was around seven years old with golden blond hair in pigtails and blue eyes. She was wearing the standard schoolgirl uniform with the pleated dark blue skirt, light blue blouse and dark blue vest. Surrounding her were two of the school's most notorious bullies. Greg Rivers and Karl Dune. They were pulling on her pigtails, flipping up her skirt and snapping her training bra among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here we go again...\"</i> Frowning, I thought. <i>\"When am I going to be one of their brothers so I can take them down a notch?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI marched up to the three before pulling Ina out of their reach. \"You three should know better than to pick on my sister.\" Through gritted teeth, I hissed. \"Take a hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shot me a death glare, or at least tried to. He was not tall or muscular as far as bullies go. No, he was barely my height with short brown hair and brown eyes. He just had a rich father who always managed to clean up after him so he thought he could get away with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl just scoffed at me. He was not the tallest or strongest among his peers either. He was about an inch taller than me with longish bond hair and green eyes. He bullied others just to stay buddies with Greg. I found it ironic that without Greg, Karl would likely end up being the one bullied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just messing with her, Jon.\" Lightly, Karl said. \"Don't be so over dramatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had learned a lot while switching from one family to the other over the last two years. I learned martial arts from the Wayne family, deductive reasoning from the Holmes family, the list goes on and on. I was actually surprised by how quickly I learned such things but then again, I 'grew up' in these families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you always have to ruin our fun?\" Walking away, Karl demanded. \"It's not like we were hurting anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave her alone.\" Calmly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had left, Ina turned to me with a grateful smile. \"Thanks, big brother.\" Softly, she said. \"Only they really saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made me concerned. \"What do you mean they saved you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna fell silent, tears forming and I knelt down to her level. \"Ina, you need to talk to me.\" firmly but kindly, I said. \"Who did they save you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna bit her lip as if to keep it from trembling as she whispered...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
