So long in fact, that nobody was even sure exactly what made it cursed in the first place anymore. But since the beginning of human civilization, almost nobody ever set foot in the woods at the base of the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sat atop a chestnut mare, as it trotted through the wood at a moderate pace. In her arms she held a small bundle wrapped in cloth, its contents sound asleep. She desperately wished she didn't have to do this, but she and her husband barely had enough food to feed themselves, let alone a hungry child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe urged the horse to halt when she felt they had gone deep enough into the forest, and dismounted with the sleeping babe in her arms. She could not bare to look at the child one last time, lest she change her mind and face her husband's fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the baby at the base of a large oak tree, and said a quick prayer, begging the gods to forgive her for this desperate and terrible deed before remounting her horse and galloping back the way she came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby slept soundly for a few more hours before it finally awoke, and upon seeing it's parents nowhere in sight, began to cry. Before long, the infant's wailing caught the attention of a female monster that had been searching the woods for her next meal. Following the sound, she came across the babe and stared at it as it ceased its crying and just stared back in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster sniffed the child and it giggled at the touch of the beast's nose. At first she thought she should just eat the thing, she was still hungry after all. But then, something deep within her began to stir. A sort of motherly instinct that said she couldn't leave this helpless child here alone, or it would surely perish. \"Don't worry, little one.\" She said as she picked up the bundle and headed back home. \"I'll take care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of monster will be our protagonists' new mother?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In this world, there are two classifications of intelligent beings, Humans and Monsters. From the very beginning, both of them have been at constant war. Monsters, being generally larger, stronger, and in some cases possessing magical abilities, have always sought to enslave or devour whatever humans they find, whereas the humans simply struggle to survive and continue the existence of their race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn present times, the two are largely divided by an immense mountain range that stretches from one end of the continent to the other, separating humanity from most of the monster races. But occasionally, monsters are still sighted on the western side of the mountains where the humans reside, having found a way around the treacherous range by one means or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, a human of the west, just so happen to run into one such monster. What happens next, is up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Nothing gory or disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Feel free to include any sort of mythical creature, but nothing from movies like xenomorphs or stuff like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. As far as sexual content goes, just don't make it the whole story. Throw some plot in here and there. Unless minors are involved, in which case, no sexual content period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all for now. Hope you enjoy! </td>",
