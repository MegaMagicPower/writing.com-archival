A cursory glance to the clock on your nightstand revealed that it was half past noon in glowing neon green digits, lovely. With a yawn, you sat up and blinked blearily, staring off into space while your sleep addled brain kicked itself awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit,\" you mumbled tiredly, \"that's the last time I start a game of Civilization at midnight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, starting a game of the famed Empire Builder at such a late hour was a horrible idea, especially given that an average game tended to last hours on end. That being said, you were almost certain to do it again at some point. Rinse and repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" the loud female voice shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up! I'm up!\" you called back, not willing to risk the earful you'd inevitably receive if you stayed in bed any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, your mom, though fairly tolerant of your chronic oversleeping during Summer Vacation, wasn't about to let you sleep until 2 o'clock like you wanted to after long nights of gaming or reading your favorite books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long-suffering sigh, you got out of your nice, warm bed and stumbled across your room, pausing for a moment to look at your unkempt  reflection in the mirror hanging on the back of your bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact that you looked like a zombie freshly risen from the grave, you cut a fairly good-looking figure, in a sort of average kind of way. Your mop of messy dark brown hair sat over perpetually sleepy-looking dark brown eyes, thick brows, a slim, slightly roman nose, thinly pursed lips, and a strong, angular jawline. Pale skin and a slight dusting of stubble on the lower half of your face gave you a scruffy look that you tended to prefer as opposed to clean cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fairly handsome face, if your mother was to be believed. Though, given that said compliment came from your MOTHER of all people, gave you cause for slight doubt. As your mom, she probably felt the need to flatter you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly weren't going to win any awards for bodybuilding but you liked to think you had a sort of slim and sinewy kind of figure. Fit, without being built, but definitely not out of shape either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, considering your somewhat hermit-like lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't about to complain, given the alternative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling under your breath, you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stepping into the dining room she continued speaking without so much as a head turn, focused on moving some clean and dry plates to the cupboards above the sink. \"Food's on the table.\" You were ready to dig into the usual bowl of cereal that she poured out for you, but instead what you saw most certainly did not belong anywhere near that food group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...mom? What's this?\" you asked, pointing at the chunks of meat currently resting on your plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, suddenly tired of salmon now?\" your mom chuckled. \"I don't remember you being so picky about what you ate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...I guess not?\" Seafood wasn't something you ate on a regular basis- let alone for lunch. But for all you knew, it was some new Mediterranean diet she was hooked on, and you knew better than to complain about being dragged into it with her. Might as well just put up with it for a week or two, before she gave up on it. Besides, there could be plenty of worse things showing up on your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what went through your mind right up until the first bite of salmon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the-?!</i> you think while immediately opening your mouth to spit the food back onto the plate. \"Mom, is this <i>raw</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs in response. \"If you want it cooked, you know where the microwave is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in disbelief for a moment before getting up, sighing while putting the fish (pre-chewed part included) under 2 minutes of heat. <i>Is this like, a passive-aggressive way to get me to make my own lunch from now on?</i> It wouldn't be like her to do such a thing, but then again, she <i>has</i> been pouring your cereal and making your meals for a long time now. <i>Could've just been straightforward about it, though...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the rest of your meal goes relatively smoothly; the fish brings a surprisingly positive reaction to your taste buds despite being unseasoned. \"Any chance for seconds, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just ate, Alex,\" she chastises. \"No more food until dinner. Well, maybe a treat later, but that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh, is she going out for ice cream? I hope so.</i> You make sure to wash your plate to keep your mother placated, before deciding what to do with the rest of your day...</span></div></div>",

There was a cardboard box waiting for you at the front door, right at the bottom of your stairs. That wasn't so atypical, your mom would often mail a variety of packages as a part of her business. Only this one wasn't outgoing, it was incoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was addressed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" you whispered to yourself as you paused to get a better look at the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in a standard cardboard box, big enough that just about anything could be in it and you had to use both arms just to reach around. Surprisingly, it wasn't too heavy to lift. Or maybe it was and you were just that strong? It was hard to say without opening it up. And you were left wondering who would send you such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a glance at the label only revealed your name and address. The return address was simply \"A friend\" and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew for a fact that your mom would be against you opening such a sketchy looking package. She probably intended to hide it away from you but had left it out not thinking you would find it. Unlucky for her you were a bit more perceptive than that. You hoisted the box up and scurried to your bedroom real quick before doubling back to grab your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned with your \"breakfast\" peanut butter sandwich in your mouth, you immediately loomed over the package waiting on your bed and prepared to tear into it like a savage animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, what was waiting for you at the bottom of the box was...</span></div></div>",

You're pretty sure onesies don't have a computer microchip in the back; not to mention the smell of the thing. It smells heavy of incense, just like in Ms. Simone's drama class. On the bottom of the box lies an instruction manual, if you could read it somehow. The different languages are unknown to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what else do you have a computer for? You quickly fire it up and while eating your sandwich you slowly translate some parts of the instruction manual. It describes the onesie as a suit and when you put it on you can \"take over\" someone. Licking your fingers you think about it; is this real or some kind of prank someone is pulling on you? Are there somehow cameras hanging in your room. Looking around everything looks the same, but then again they don't have to be big to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your chin you think it over. You can always try it, right? And what if it is a prank, at least it isn't humiliating. Pulling off your clothes you then grab hold of the suit. The suit is a tight fit; you can barely breath in this thing. You are happy that it's still morning as it isn't warm yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what now?\" You ask yourself out loud, but as soon as you say it you notice a soft ringing that gets louder. As you want to put the suit off you feel a blast coming from your back, knocking you to the ground unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you have the mother of all headaches. Everything is blurry and you feel awful; like something sucked the life out of you. \"That's it, off with you.\" You mumble as you try to pull the suit off, but you can't. The suit is stuck to your body. When you try to pull it off your head, it feels like you try to pull your head off as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" You begin to panic. What if you were permanently stuck inside this suit? You can already hear everyone at school laughing at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it's best you get some help. But who to go to help for?</span></div></div>",

That is to say, calling a it gun might not be totally correct, it looked like a prop from some steampunk film or cosplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was heavy looking thing, about the size of the airsoft sub machine gun you had in your closet,, primarily made out of a tarnished, coppery metal and bolted together with gold bolts and banding. The main body of the \u201cgun\u201d was occupied by several long glass tubes and the \u201cbarrel\u201d was a long, thin needle-like protrusion. Various dials and gauges were scattered here and there across the device\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, a very strange looking thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost looks like a syringe and a rifle had sex at a steampunk conversation...\u201d You mused as you picked up the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lighter than it looked, but still had a good amount of heft to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it over in your hands.m, you spotted an ornate looking plaque riveted to the side of the gun\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwapper V1.0\u201d you read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that didn\u2019t exactly help you in figuring out just what this thing was and why someone would send it to you. Steampunk stuff was cool and all but you didn\u2019t like it enough to warrant someone gifting such a well made prop to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the \u201cSwapper\u201d down on its side, you returned your attention to the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something else in here... Aha!\u201d You crowed in triumph, retrieving a small pamphlet printed on old, yellowed paper from under the packing peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfolding it revealed a cheerfully drawn old school cartoon like the ones you would see in one of your post apocalyptic video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIntroducing the amazing Swapper!\u201d</i> You read quietly, <i>\u201cthe only device that lets you take a walk in someone else\u2019s shoes!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cinstructions\u201d were a comic strip, oddly enough. Ten panels seemed to illustrate how to use the Swapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first panel of the comic strip had a widely smiling caricature of a dapper looking blond haired man in a suit holding the Swapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to him was an oblivious looking caricature of a young brunette woman dressed in a bright red 1950\u2019s style swing dress and matching heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second panel showed the little man aiming the needle like barrel of the Swapper at the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third had a thin beam of green energy shooting from the Swapper and hitting the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth panel showed the woman seemingly disintegrating into motes of pink light, which entered the Swapper. A close up panel had the tubes filling with a soupy pink liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... huh,\u201d was your eloquent response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fourth panel, things got weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth panel had the man positioning the Swapper over the junction of his inner elbow and pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sixth panel had the Swapper extend three stabilization legs, before plunging the needle like barrel into the mans arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh looked like the man\u2019s arm was bubbling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay this is just getting weirder...\u201d you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eighth panel showed the man entire body bubbling and seemingly shrinking. But oddly enough, the little mans hair looked like it was getting longer and turning brown while his clothing was turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninth had the grinning man\u2019s suit visibly unfurling into a perfect clone of the woman\u2019s red swing dress while his body shrank and became curvier looking, becoming more feminine looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally on the tenth, a perfect clone of the woman who had been shot and absorbed by the Swapper stood alone with a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly put the pamphlet down, unsure what to make of it. A part of you wondered if this was all just a joke and someone was having a good laugh at your expense, but another part was more curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone went to great trouble to make this,\u201d you reasoned, \u201cthis seems too elaborate to be a prank...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left you with the decision of whether or not to humor this \u201cSwapper\u201d malarkey and try it out, or put it back in the box and ignore it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm tired of having you laze about the house all summer, you have to earn your keep, mister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck your tongue out in disgust. This might be the last summer you would get to truly enjoy with college just around the corner. You weren't about to spend it wasting time doing trivial tasks around the house when your sisters all did nothing and never got flack for it. Your mom always did play favorites with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought alone made you grip handle of the Swapper tight and hoist it over your shoulder, like a rifleman ready to go into battle. There was no one to boss you around if there was no mom. In the moment, you weren't quite thinking clearly of the consequences of your decision but you had made up your mind. Your mother was going to be the first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer her cries for your attention. But you shuffled around your room to get into a good position.

Ready...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be playing games again Alex,\" your mom said as you heard her begin to ascend the stairs. \"I mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door knob jiggled, you put a finger to the trigger. Aim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" said your mom as she opened the door. \"What are you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last you saw of your mom was her eyes wide with surprise as a bolt of blue lightning arced from the Swapper's muzzle. It struck her right in the chest and she was left with no time to even process what was happening to her as her body began to disintegrate. It was over so quick that it wasn't even painful as you watched the shocked expression of your mom dissolve away, much like your favorite characters in Infinity War. The only difference though was that her empty clothes were left behind as they collapsed in a heap on the floor. Heidi Tucker had vanished off the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood blinking at the smoking sundress, bra, and panties on your bedroom as the Swapper hummed to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been no kickback when you fired it, but now it was rumbling fiercely as the gears whirled and pumps spewed steam. A hot red liquid began to form in the primarily tube of the gun, as well as the strangest scent of cinnamon and spices in the air. Something clicked as the movement ceased and a green light lit up above a single knob. The words \"Inject\" were inscribed at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" you said, falling on the bed with your prize in tow. \"It worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quite how it had been depicted in the comic. The comic showed even the victim's clothes were absorbed in the process, when that wasn't the case here with the evidence still on your bedroom floor. But, as far as you could tell, you had collected your mother's very essence in a glass tube! There was just a matter of the second half of the instruction comic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all well and good to zap away your mom, but to actually become here? The thought gave you pause. Now that the rush was wearing off, you had to ask yourself if that was really what you wanted. Did you really want to spend a day in her tiny women size five shoes? How would you even change back? Or was that a thought for later?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you shouldn't be in a hurry to inject yourself with a potentially poisonous liquid. Maybe you could find another dummy to do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, what would happen if you fired the gun twice? What? Would your mom's essence mix with another victims? Or would it just enhance your mom's traits that already existed? So many decisions, so little time. You had to act fast before someone realized your mom was missing.</span></div></div>",

That, and there wasn't anyone you'd actually consider trusting with the info of a gun that could literally atomize people and create serums from their raw essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that sounded like a conspiracy that wasn't worth attracting any outside attention. Something told you that lots of undesirables would kill to get their mitts on this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you supposed, it'd better be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you murmured, picking up the instruction manual, \"how do I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instruction manual, more of a comic actually, wasn't much help. Where there should've been a detailed write up with numbered steps, all you had was some vague illustrations that didn't even seem to be totally relevant, given that your Mother's plus sized sundress and undergarments were laying in a steaming pile on your floor instead of being outright absorbed like the comic suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, such vague \"instructions\" would've been a red flag, but you were too drunk on giddiness or adrenaline to actually consider your actions carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hefted the gun into position, mimicking the comic as best you could, with the needle like barrel pointing at the large vein in the hollow of your elbow. It was kind of an awkward position, given the size and weight of the Swapper, but you eventually thumbed the \"Inject\" knob and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you said, steeling yourself, \"here... we... go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the knob a twist and the Swapper came to life. The gun made a low whirring sound as long, spindly legs extended from the front of the Swapper's barrel, gripping your arm and holding itself steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the gun backed off, before ramming forward and piercing your arm with the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hissed in mild pain. It didn't hurt that much but it felt a lot like the unpleasant shots you had to get when you went to the doctor's office for your annual checkups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip as the pain slowly numbed and the red liquid in the main tube, your mother's concentrated essence, was pushed into your bloodstream. It felt like you were pumping cement through your veins, the liquid essence of your mother was so thick and soupy. The overbearing stink of cinnamon and spice filled the air as the last of the liquid vanished into your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun released your arm and you set it down... and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, you looked down at the injection point, wondering if you had done anything wrong. The vague instructions would be no help here, if they ever were in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now? Did you simply sit here and wait? Did it even work?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could even think, there was a knock on your bedroom door which made you thankful that you had thought to close and lock it during your experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" cried your little sister, Susanna. \"Are you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the debris of your attack on your mother. With the literal smoking gun with the clothes on the floor and the Swapper laid strewn across your bed, it was clear enough what happen that even a ten year old girl like little Susie could figure it out. You muttered a curse and tossed the Swapper under your bed. Then you gathered up mom's clothes and hid them behind your back as your little sister continued pounding at your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Alex! Why do you always lock it! That's mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" you answered it. \"For crying out loud. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find mommy,\" Susie gave you a pout. \"And I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...Said she was going out,\" you said while thinking a quick lie. \"She didn't say when she was getting back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm hungry! I haven't eaten since breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make yourself a sandwich or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how. Can you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, playing with the idea that you could just zap your sister too. Then maybe you might have some peace and quiet around here for a change. But you fought against the idea. You had no idea how you were even going to get your mom back at this rate, that thought troubled you in the back of your mind as you shooed Susie downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll make you a peanut butter sandwich. Does that sound okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you have to cut it in triangles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid your sigh. Both of your sisters were major prima donnas when it came to having things just so. Your mother had spoiled them rotten. Part of you wished that the injection really did work, then you could set them both straight and there would be nothing they could do about it. Instead, all the injection had seemed to do was give you a sore arm. Though, strangely enough, there wasn't even a mark anymore on where it had stung you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way to the kitchen, Susie waited for you in the living room, going off to play with her dolls while you served her. You dropped your mother's discarded clothing on the counter and pulled out the necessary ingredients for Susie's sandwich. Best to get this over with quick before you decided your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slathered peanut butter over the rye bread, you felt a weird itch at the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absentmindedly scratched away at it as you continued your work. You did pay it more attention, however, when your hair started to get in your eyes. That was impossible, considering you had just gotten your haircut last week and left it really short to combat the summer heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping what you were doing, you made your way to the chrome fridge to get a glance at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" you said. \"Its...Working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you sat still, you could still feel the thick liquid from the Swapper coursing through your veins. Working through the blood must have meant a delay in the actual process as it flooded every corner of your body. Though you could feel it rushing to your head, feeding into your hair follicles and commanding them to grow. Every inch of your was being rewritten on a genetic level to match your mother's appearance. And such a process took a long time, starting with your hair first as the most commonly lost and replaced part of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as you stared watching your widened reflection, you could see your hair growing out. It was at least two inches longer than it had been before the injection. And if you squinted just enough, it seemed to be taking on a shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might have been more fascinated to watch the transformation were it not for the annoyed call of your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex? What's taking so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, Susie could ruin everything with her big mouth, something she had definitely inherited from mom. You would fix her straight when this was all said and down. You just had to finish making the sandwich and hope she wouldn't notice your changing hairstyle. Or maybe you could just run away and she'd never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, entertaining the idea of zapping her too might give you a quiet house to work with while your body assimilated your mother's essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to..</span></div></div>",

Your hair was only slightly longer and the reddish tinge it was slowly developing was subtle enough to blame it on the lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the sandwiches, cut into neat triangles as Susie insisted, onto a plate, you made your way to the table where the little redhead waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, brat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie stared at the plate of sandwiches you held out to her critically, like she didn\u2019t trust them because it was YOU, and not your mom, who made them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you said, getting impatient, \u201cyou gonna take em or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked up at you and squinted in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart thudded in your ears as she stared up at you. Had you hair grown more? Had it gotten even redder in the short time since you last checked?  You didn\u2019t feel like it had, you would\u2019ve felt the sensation of it growing immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a what seemed like forever, she just stared at you before she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look weird.\u201d She stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie didn\u2019t look convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah huh, your hair looks red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you just wanted to bolt back to the safety of your room to let the transformation run its course in private but Susie had you pinned in place with her suspicious stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did NOT need this right now. So, you activated your patented bullshitting skills and lied through your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my hair kind of has a red tint during the summer because of all the sun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please</i>, you begged mentally,<i> buy it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie blinked a few times before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d she said and took the sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in time, too, as a horrible feeling that felt like your flesh was liquefying surged from the injection site on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your arm back and held it behind you back as the feeling grew even worse. It felt like your arm was boiling and bubbling like a thick soup under your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked alarmed for a moment at the abrupt movement, almost dropping her sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d She exclaimed, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began sweating. The feeling wasn\u2019t exactly painful but it was probably the most uncomfortable thing you\u2019d ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d you said quickly, \u201cjust an arm cramp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted at you again; she didn\u2019t look like she believed you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not need this right now. Not only was your mother\u2019s clothing hidden in a ball under your comforter instead of being absorbed alongside their wearer, but the changes, which the \u201cinstructions\u201d had shown to happen all at once was dragging on, leaving you at great risk of Susie seeing you transforming into your mother..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you thought fast, you had to ditch her and quick before you started REALLY changing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, uh, why don\u2019t you go watch some TV?\u201d You tried, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her blue-green eyes got huge and she gave you a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I eat in the living room then?! Mommy never lets me do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d She cheered and zipped through the doorway  like a little red rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d you hissed, bringing your hidden arm back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost wished you hadn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arm looked like thousands of tiny bubbles were forming under the skin as it seemed to start bloating up, the muscles dissolving into a thick paste under your skin, which was losing its usual peach complexion and paling to a creamier shade of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour long, bony fingers swelled up like over cooked sausages while your palms shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinching sensation from your upper arm alerted you to the fact that your t-shirt was starting to bite into your the softening flesh of your bicep, which had almost doubled in circumference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d you cursed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering quickly around the corner, you spied Susie in the living room, eyes glued to the tv and a sandwich stuffed in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, with all the grace of a tiptoeing elephant, you crept upstairs to you room and closed the door, quickly tearing off your t shirt before the sleeve began to cut off circulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbles soon subsided and you stared at your arm in stunned fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as though someone had grafted the soft, pudgy white arm of your mother to your body. The ruddy peach shade of your normal, lanky torso now transitioned to the soft, pale limb of your mother, with all the extra flesh that entailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your right hand was a perfect clone of your mother's and you had to confirm it several times by flexing your stubby fingers. Despite the flabby weight to it, your new hand was so much smaller in comparison to your old one. And your reach was several inches shorter too, making you look rather mismatched when you left both of them dangling at your side with one more compact than the other. You almost looked like a mutant, though you had to admire how soft your skin now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at your bedroom mirror, you could see that Susie had been correct. You were sporting a very distinct head of red hair, which could no longer be mistaken for brunette. Thankfully, it had only grown out over your ears, making you look like you had just evaded a haircut for several months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you looked thoroughly strange but it was nothing that wearing a hoodie couldn't cover up for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the biggest one you had in your room, which would allow enough room for you to grow into mom without cutting off your circulation like your T-shirt had. And pulling up the hood did a decent enough job of disguising your expanding hairline. You swore it had grown another centimeter while you had been getting a look at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why it happened so fast before,\" you wondered aloud. \"Makes sense I guess if it's working through my bloodstream, the faster my heart pumps the quicker and bigger the changes. Maybe I should avoid stressful situations until this is all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by your revelation, there was a booming knock at your bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Get out here you little shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore under your breath and collected yourself to slow your beating heart. You had to calm down or you would transform in front of Victoria and give the game away! She knew you were in your room, unfortunately, and was liable to take the hinges off the door by the sounds of things. You just had to see what she wanted and maybe she would go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed in and out until your heart rate returned to normal before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Hey, sis. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you<i> what's up</i> me! Stand aside, I know you fucking stole it, you pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stole what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well what! My Victoria Secrets limited edition panties, you creep! I left them out on the drier for mom and now they're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe Susie stole them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was already ignoring you as she pushed you aside to enter your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you said as she began ransacking the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before she discovered the Swapper or your mom's discarded clothes at this rate! And all this excitement was not making things easier on your heart. You swore you could feel another bubbling sensation coming on. Changing in front of your bitch of an older sister was not an ideal situation either. The only question was what was going to happen first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria...</span></div></div>",

You could feel a change coming on at any minute now and Victoria was doing nothing to help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, it's a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks too expensive to be a stupid toy. And what's that smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched as she started to aim it your way with her hand on the trigger. \"It's nothing. Look, just give it back and I'll help you look for your stupid panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those panties are worth $100, thank you very much! Maybe I'll just hold onto this stupid toy of yours until you find out where they are, if you claim you haven't taken them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky, come on! I haven't seen them, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing looks electric,\" Victoria said, aiming the Swapper at you again. \"Think maybe if I zap you with it, it will get you to do what I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't about to let yourself be blasted into oblivion like your mother. You leapt into action, grabbing the gun with your strong and trying to wrestle it from your sister. Unfortunately, given your weakness with mom's shorter arm, you were at a disadvantage as Victoria tried to tug it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go, you stupid brat! Just tell me where you put my underwear and I'll be out of your hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't take them!\" you said for the final time, though your sister's outburst gave you an idea. \"And as for hair, have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your hoodie down with your swollen arm, exposing the long head of red hair you had been hiding. Victoria's jaw dropped and it was enough of a surprise that you were able to yank the Swapper away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to your hair, you weirdo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about to find out,\" you said, pointing the gun at her. \"The hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria gave a shriek which was cut off the moment you pulled the trigger. The blue bolt of lightning shot out and struck her right in the mouth as she instantly evaporated into a million particles, just like your mom. Her clothes fell into a heap on the floor, smoking with an eerie green dust as the Swapper churned and processed the new material you had given it to work with. The vials filled with a green liquid this time, only with a sharper scent that you couldn't quite place. It was almost like rotten apples and sour limes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Swapper did its business, you breathed a sigh of relief though your moment of victory was not for long. The bubbling was starting up in your skin again. All the excitement had triggered another violent transformation. You gasped as it seemed to resonate in your...</span></div></div>",

You gasped as it prickled from your shoulder to your finger tips as you felt the bones in your arm shorten as fat bubbled up under your skin.  Your heart pounded and you breathed excitedly as you watched your bicep swell under the sleeve of your sweater.  You were frozen in anticipation watching it swell then it stopped and you looked back and forth at the abnormally swollen bulges in your upper arms.  You lifted up your hands and giggled at your smaller fatter fingers with painted nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled the sweater over your head to get a better look.  Your upper arms jiggled with every motion.  You were startled to see that your nipples looked larger than normal.  Bare chested you put your new fat arms down at your sides.  You could feel your extra mass and soft fat smush against your sides.  It was a different feeling you never experienced before.  You reached up and grabbed and pinched at your new found fat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLifting your arms up you let them sway and laughed at how they sagged ever so slightly down and wobbled with your movements.  You squash them back down at your sides.  They were pretty heavy and it was tiring to hold them extended like that.  This was kind of nice but your heart still fluttered knowing that you would continue to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the sweater again and started to lift it over your head.  Victoria was zapped away into the vial of the gun, but just in case Susanna walked in you should be careful. </span></div></div>",

This was going to take some getting used to, especially with your reach stunted as it was. You were beginning to feel soft and squishie all over and you knew that this was only going to get stranger as time went on. Thankfully, you had calmed your heartbeat enough that you didn't feel another change coming on for awhile. But that meant you had a mess to clean up in the form of Victoria's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Vicky,\" you mumbled to yourself. \"If you hadn't been such a bitch, I wouldn't have had to vaporize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled with the Swapper as you held it in your stubby hands, it felt even bulkier and larger which made it more inconvenient to handle. But such a thing was too dangerous to leave lying around, especially if Victoria had found it so easily. For now, it was safer on your person until you could find something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped it up with Vicky's discarded clothes, still warm from her body fading body heat. At least that kept it somewhat disguised as you began to sneak out of your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Susie was nowhere in sight and you began to creep down the stairs slowly though not slowly enough. One wrong step caused the floorboard to creak and you winced. Your sister had undoubtedly heard that and sure enough, you heard her running towards you with all the energy of a typical ten year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy? Is that you? I'm still hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanna was something special in that she was the most hyperactive kid you ever met, especially after eating a meal. She reached you in a matter of seconds as she looked at the pile of clothes in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex? Why are you doing laundry? That's mommy's job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed at the thought of how spoiled your sister was sounding in favor of conjuring up a good excuse that she could buy. \"Well, mom asked me to and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help!\" Susie said, grabbing hold of the pile of clothes and the Swapper hiding beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you found your grip loosening instantly because of your shrunken arms. \"Don't pull on--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, without being used to your hands, the Swapper slipped right out of your grasp. Unfortunately, Susie hadn't expected you to just let go like that and the Swapper's injection jabbed her right in the shoulder. As she fell backwards on the floor, the gun whirled to life. All the jostling must have triggered the injection sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanna screamed as all of Victoria's essence came rushing into her. Then she started crying like she had been stung by a bee. It all happened so fast as she tore off in the other direction, sobbing all the way to the bathroom as the Swapper slammed hard against the floor to the point where you were afraid it might have broken somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you said feeling your heartrate increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was now in your same boat only she would be slowly transforming into your older sister. Your instincts told you to go check on her and calm her down, you could hear her crying all the way from the stairs. The more worked up she got, the quicker she would start transforming. But then you looked over at the Swapper, dented from the tumble. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

You had to take it slow or your heart rate would spike up again though you supposed the cat was out of the bag if Susie had gotten herself injected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you called out. \"You need to calm down or you're going to make it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally caught up to her sobbing in her bedroom. She was clutching her arm, which was red but otherwise no visible injuries from where the Swapper had stung her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's mom?\" she cried as you approached her to take a look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...Gone right now,\" you tried to explain to her. \"I have to take care of you now instead. Now, does it still hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not really,\" Susanna admitted, rubbing her shoulder slightly. \"I just feel funny in my chest now. Like my heart is going bump bump...Bump bump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susanna repeated the sound effect she made a reason bizarre expression, like she had felt something on her body she was used to feeling before. Sure enough, all that running around had spiked her heart rate and now she was experiencing the first part of her transformation much in the way you had. Only rather than something benign like hair, the morphing seemed to go straight to Susie's pituitary gland and jumpstarted her puberty by a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you stood stunned as what looked like a pair of balloons slowly inflated underneath Susie's flower dress, stretching the collar of it out with their growth. Such a small dress wasn't designed to contain more adult curves and it wasn't long before your ten year old sister had developed obvious adult breasts. And, given that Vicky was a D cup, they were quite large on Susanna's tiny body at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's happening to me?\" Susanna asked, grabbing hold of her new bust. \"I'm getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that you were the one who was getting fat. She was well on her way to developing Vicky's hot body. Worse, she was starting to panic some more even as her new breasts jiggled around as she walked around the room braless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you tried to grab her with your stubby arms. \"You need to listen to me.

From your days of doing laundry, you knew that your mom was an E cup with a band of 44 inches which made her the biggest in the house much to Victoria's annoyance. She would often try to borrow bras from mom and fill them with tissue paper just to satisfy some twisted desire of hers to stand out the most. But yours were becoming the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your nipples brush against your hoodie as the space inside quickly began to fill up. Before long, your chest was looking significantly puffier than usual and you found yourself being pulled forward by your budding boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanna had finally stopped her fussing to stare at you, awestruck as the same fate she had been inflicted with befell you as well. Only on a larger scale. They were so heavy and they kept getting heavier with each passing second. No wonder mom complained about having them constantly. As they settled into their final size, it was like having two coconuts stuffed under your shirt. They stretched out your jacket so much that you could actually see the cleavage as you looked down. These were your breasts, and they were big, round, and weighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" Susie managed to stammer. \"You're getting fat like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting fat, you dingus,\" you said, removing the hood from your head and exposing your long red hair. \"We just grew breasts. I'm turning into mom, just like you're turning into Victoria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on her bra, if you want proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, you still had Vicky's clothes under your arm. You hated seeing your sister flop around everywhere, and she needed a hand with the bra as you helped her from behind so that you wouldn't get a look at her. When that was done, you fit the dress over her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits!\" Susie said, slowly coming to terms with what was happening to her. \"I have boobies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, they're Vicky's boobs,\" you explained as you shifted your own breasts up. It was quite painful to leave them free like this. \"Just like these are mom's. I don't know why this is happening, but it's just something we're going to have to deal with until I can fix it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to not reveal exactly why this was happening. Better Susanna know as little as possible about the Swapper, which you had to go find and make sure it still worked now that she had calmed down. Thankfully, Susie seemed far too interested in her new breasts as she constantly jiggled them around in various ways without even looking up at you with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I need you to sit tight and keep calm while it finishes, alright? I need to check on something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and prepared to leave your sister to her room...</span></div></div>",

She looked ridiculous, with her little body sporting a very adult looking pair of breasts that your friends often ogled when Victoria sunbathed on your house's deck during the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitch or not, Victoria had been nine kinds of hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just turned to leave Susie to her own devices when you felt a trembling building deep within your body. You stumbled midstep and had to use the doorframe to brace yourself as the trembling became a full-on shaking like there was an earthquake shaking your very bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what t-th-the H-HELL?!\" you found that even speaking was an effort with your innards shaking themselves to mush, and your breasts and arms jiggling like jello beneath your jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked up from her, <i>Victoria's</i>, breasts, her head tilted quizzically, \"What's that sound?

Your world abruptly dragged itself towards the ground as your spine began to ratchet downwards, the vertebrae grinding themselves smaller and more compact. Your rib cage squeezed like a vice, crushing your lungs and organs into far smaller, less conditioned forms. Judging by how out of breath you suddenly felt, you doubted you could even run a mile anymore without breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" your heart hammered loudly in your ears, sounding as if it was straining to pump the thick, soupy concentrate of your mother around you body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour torso quickly lost a large amount of its usual height, shaving a good deal of inches off your respectable 5'11 height. The result? Your newly compact and shortened torso sitting almost comically atop your disproportional long and sinewy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look funny!\" Susie giggled, looking very amused by your malformed figure, which must've looked quite a sight with the shaggy mop of lengthening red hair, thick and meaty arms, and large, heavy breasts all stuffed onto your far too short and squat torso.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was as bad as Susie had made it out to be, with your shortened spine making it look like someone had taken a hammer and smashed you atop the head. Your normal height had been 5'11 while your mom was at 5'2. The change had left you at a stunted 5'7. Everything around you was looking so much bigger. And it was only going to get worse as time went on. Your insides felt all cramped and mashed together as they continued to shrink down to match your mom's organ size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were only getting more and more uncomfortable for you. You had a sudden twinge of fear at the thought of being stuck like this forever. You had to get to the Swapper and make sure it was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you said after studying your reflection for a moment. \"Just wait here, okay? I need to check on something. This is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized a rather uneasy look as Susie's knees began to wobble to and fro, like her legs were a newborn deer's. You managed to catch her by the arm before she could fall over. Then you braced yourself for what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be getting heavier in your hands as you found you weren't looking quite so far down at her as you usually did, even in your shrunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My legs feel like taffy,\" Susie complained as she tugged at the bottom of her dress, which had ridden up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback at the sudden spurt as Susie shot up an inch. And then another. Like with your torso, it happened in spurts. Susie's eyes lit up as she also realized what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she was when it came to her legs. Her own torso remained entirely the same, save for her massive breasts of course. Below her dress, her legs were shooting out like weeds as she continued to grow like a tree. You heard Susie's hips crack as her bones adjusted and lengthened everywhere from the waist below. She didn't have the curves of your older sister yet, but she was quickly gaining her height. Victoria stood quite tall at 5'8. You suddenly realized that by the end of this, Susie would be bigger than you. You shuddered to think what a brat like her might do if you weren't looking down at her to boss her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inched higher and higher, growing over a foot in height to a much more intimidating 4'11. Like you, she looked clownish with her childlike upper body contrasting her long and now sexy legs. Her dress had turned into a mini skirt in the process and she was wobbling around like she was balancing on stilts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" she said as she got used to the new additions. You gulped when you realized she now came up to your neck instead of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you said as she hobbled around the room, striding with her long legs. \"You need to calm down or this is going to get worse for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were delaying too much now. The more you waited, the bigger the gap between you and Susie would get. You didn't want to see what would happen when she was finally taller than you. Thankfully, for now, she seemed more interested in her changes than anything you had to say. You excused yourself from her bedroom and shuffled down the stairs, your boobs flopping around with each step. You wished you had grabbed a bra now as you continued to the living room where you had left the Swapper. Maybe it had some sort of undo mechanism to cancel this, maybe with the instructions it came with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived to find...</span></div></div>",

She must have been shouting about the fact that her hips were now the size of Victoria's, thick and wide. She looked quite pleased with her new body until she turned the corner and stood face to face with the Swapper in your hands. The last time she had seen that thing, it had stabbed her in the shoulder so seeing it must have triggered her to freeze up entirely even as it continued to grind as if it were charging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie!\" you cried, realizing what was going to happen. \"Run away! Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to aim it away from her, but it was no use. The gun fired away and struck Susie instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she didn't vaporize like your mother and sister before. Instead she winced and started growing. Or, rather, transforming. Her childish features faded away in an instant, giving way to the more mature form of Victoria. There wasn't much to change, all things considering with her bust and butt in place. Her arms stretched out to their proper size as she came to Victoria's full height while her torso lengthened. Her hair didn't need to change much, though you did notice it becoming more polished like she had been using fine shampoo for a while. And finally, her face bubbled into that of a true resting bitch face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye , Susie disappeared and a perfect clone of Victoria stood in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Susie, taking in her adult body. The sudden growth had torn her dress and it was just barely covering her now. \"I feel...Big! And I sound like Vicky! I should try on her dresses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to skip around the house in a girlish way, looking completely out of character in a teenage body all the while singing with her new voice. You might have tried to stop her were it not for the fact that the Swapper was now doing weird things. It churned as a new liquid filled the vials on the side. This time, however, it was black and thick, definitely not something that looked natural like it was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said. \"That's not good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what had happened, exactly. You guessed that the Swapper had sucked out what remained of Susie's essence, which made some sense. Since there was two sets of DNA in her body, it probably just drained the one that was least dominate which triggered her immediate transformation into Victoria. However, the mixture that had formed was clearly the result of the Swapper being damaged. You didn't want to know what might happen if someone was injected with it. Or if you could even go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought left you worried as you left out a slight bletch. Your stomach expanded slightly and didn't go back down. The transformation was still effecting you too and now you weren't sure if you could even change back or not.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You paced up and down the room, occasionally flipping your long red hair out of your face.  Susie's essence turning into this black liquid was not a good sign.  You felt something building in your stomach and let out a hiccup and felt your belly plump out a bit more.  \"I should do something before I change completely\"  You decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into the kitchen and reached up into the upper cabinet to get a glass.  It seemed higher up than usual with your new shorter form.  You place the glass on the counter and try and pull the glass tube containing Susie's essence from the gun.  It popped out easier than  you thought it would.  There was a burnt smell in the air.  Careful not to spill any you slowly turn the tube into the cup you set out and filled it with the black liquid.  You might need that later if it was possible to get her essence back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return the tube to the gun.  You decide you should try and zap yourself to save your dna just in case it was all lost from the transformation.  You look at your small chubby hands and your protruding breasts.  Maybe you should zap an unaffected area.  You kick off your socks.  Your feet looked smaller than you remembered.  There was also a black smudge on top of your right foot.  You use your other foot to try and wipe it off before you realize it must be Mom's tattoo starting to appear on your skin.  You gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your sweater over your head and your tits bounce free.  You put your hands on your softer chubby tummy.  There was probably no unaffected parts left.  All of you has changed slightly.  You begin to panic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought occurred to you.  What if you zapped Susie in a place that still had her features?  Perhaps if you would have zapped a part that had already completely changed it would only take out Mom's essence.  It was very risky and you had no idea how this was supposed to work but you were desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the gun on the counter and aim it at your chest.  You bend your knees and lower yourself so that its aimed directly at your large boobs.  You turn the gun on.  It began to grind and vibrate again.  You had to hold it steady so it wouldn't vibrate off the counter and onto the floor. You pull the trigger and a beam of light hits you directly in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh shit <b>that</b> <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><i>hurrrt</i></b></font>.\"  You say outloud but your voice cracked and became more higher pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body felt hot and feverish.  You felt numbing sensation and over all discomfort all over.  You felt yourself begin to shrink even shorter and you felt incredible pressure in your pants as your lower body expanded.  The button on your pants burst off and flew across the kitchen as your belly swelled with fat and hung over your waistband.  The inner thigh of your jeans tore and your fat thighs oozed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour insides felt like they were squirming as your organs changed and your mouth ached as your teeth changed.  You lifted your shaking hands to your face and felt that it felt completely different and foreign to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed more black liquid in the glass tube of the swapper.  The same thing that happened to Susie happened to you.  You sucked out the rest of your essence and accelerated the changes.  \"This does not look good.\"  You say in your mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pants were cutting off your blood flow they were so tight around your waist.  You never really truely appreciated how fat your mother really was until you could see yourself in this body without a shirt.  Your belly was enormous and gelatinous that quivered with every movement.  Your massive breasts sat softly against your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better cover up before Susie sees me like this.\"  You say.  You painfully waddle in your too tight pants to where you threw down your sweater.  The tears on your thighs ripped further as you moved.  You bent over and felt your ass tear the back of your pants.  You sigh with relieve however that helped reduce the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push your fat arms into the sweater and pull it over your breasts but it didn't go much further than that.  There was no hope covering this belly in your old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear loud skipping in the hall and in blundered Susie in Victoria's sexy body.  She was wearing short shorts that showed off her figure nicely and oddly enough just a bikini top.  Her perky D cup breasts bounced majestically.  Much more majestically than your flabby E cups would have.  It looks like she got into Victoria's makeup as well because she was wearing lipstick but she put it on a bit sloppy and some parts went onto the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look soo hot!\"  She said enthusiastically which sounded hilarious in Victoria's voice.  When she saw you her eyes grew wide and she giggled.  She narrowed her eyes and whispered:  \"uhh, Alex?\"  She had to make sure you were actually you and not your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes its me.\"  You sigh and blushed.  You look down past your exposed belly and saw your foot tattoo clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha you got fat.\"  She giggled.  Her body was the total opposite.  Very fit and in shape.  \"Yeah yeah I know.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked nervous for a moment.  \"What are mom and Victoria going to say when they see us like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they um will be gone for a while so we have to pretend to be them for a while.\"  You say since you had no idea how to return things to normal.  You might be permanently stuck like this and have to be the new mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked so excited.  \"Does that mean I get to sleep in Victoria's room??\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course thats your room now.  But put on a shirt!\"  You said indicating her bikini top.  She gave you a funny look.  \"You need a shirt too.\"  She pointed at your fat belly.  You face turned redder as she hurried back to her new room to explore.   What next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That meant shuffling into your mother room and digging around through her outfits to find something that was tolerable enough for you to wear. Putting on the bra for yourself was an interesting experience and you had to go looking for panties to wear too. But eventually, you settled on something you had seen her wear around the house from time to time. Jeans with a tan shirt that showed off a little too much shoulder for your liking, but it was better than nothing.

The black goop that came out of the gun you weren't going to touch and you had no way of knowing who sent you it in the mail. That meant your only hope was to look at the box again and try and find something that could give you clues on how to reverse the process after all that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there were no labels everywhere to be found even as you emptied out the packing peanuts and scoured through them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" you said, cursing in your mother's voice. \"Who could have sent this to me? Why would they do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to give up hope until you looked at the box again. With the packaging cleared out, you could now clearly see the bottom and were surprised to find a message tapped to it on a piece of printer paper.

The ink on the printer that made this must have been low because it was very faded.  Something else you realized was that it wasn't in english.  \"What is this?\"  You flipped your red hair over your shoulder so that it wasn't in the way and smoothed the crinkled paper on your desk.  You felt your ass spilling over the sides of your wooden chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't typical letters it was symbols.  Maybe it was an Asian language?  But there were some symbols that looked like it might be Russian?  You didn't speak Russian but it didn't really look like all of this was that either.  Maybe it was Arabic.  At the bottom right corner there was a website and the date this page was printed.  The website you could read.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your laptop and type in the web address.  The website looked really janky and slapped together by someone who wasn't very good at designing websites.  The same lettering was scattered all over the site with the occasional random English word like \"swapper\"  and \"transform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click on link after link before you find a page listing a few different products you could order!  The problem was you didn't know what these did and it didn't have the same illustrations on yellowing paper that you found in the box.  You would have to order something before figuring out what it did.  You tried copying some of the text and entering it in a translation website.  The website couldn't automaticly detect what it was and you tried cycling through the languages but couldn't not decipher any of it.  There was a shopping cart icon you could probably pay for it easy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie walked in through your open door.  She was wearing one of Victoria's dresses now.  \"Hey Alex I'm hungry when are we going to eat?\"  She asked.  <i>I guess I'm the Mom now its up to me to feed her.</i>  You though weirdly to yourself.  \"I guess I'll order pizza.\" You say pulling out your phone from Mom's tight jean pocket.  How did she ever fit anything in these pockets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mo- I mean Alex.\"  Susie said looking down and distracted by her new body before leaving the room.  You order two pizzas for delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the site there were three things that caught your eye: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was another gun but it was different than the one you broke.  This one had brass pipes running in different ways and what appeared to be a dial but it was hard to see with this too small picture.  You were not even sure if this one had a glass tube to collect a person's essence you had no idea what its purpose was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext there was what looked to be a chemistry set.  There were beakers and vials.  It looked like it came with some bottles of unknown liquid and there were even tubes that looked similar to the one on the Swapper you had now as if you could fill it with something you created.  The Swapper was not very good at zapping people now but it could probably still do injections.  Maybe you could do something with the contaminated essences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also what looked to be two metal smart watches.  You didn't know what they did as it was just a blank screen on the watch in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.  You go to answer it and pick up Mom's purse along the way.  You pay the deliver guy and give him a tip.  \"Thanks mam\"  He said as you closed the door.  You blush furiously at being called that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set it on the table and bring out your laptop and continue exploring the website and trying to decide which item to order.  There was a <b>1-Day </b>symbol next to the shopping cart so you assumed whatever you ordered would get here tomorrow.  Susie took two slices and took them back to Victoria's room and you just idly took slice after slice and ate them as you pondered.  You were stressed and starving.  Stress eating was always a bad habit of Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou add an item to your shopping cart and take out Mom's credit card and enter the information and address information.  You didn't know what you were ordering but at least that part was in english.  You reach into the pizza box and your fingers brush the cardboard.  You open the lid and to your surprise you had finished the rest of the pizza all by yourself and you still felt like you could eat more!  Your eyes widened.  No wonder she had such a hard time keeping off the weight in this body.  There was still another pizza left but you felt like you shouldn't go near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complete the order.  It should be here first thing tomorrow morning based on the tracking information you got emailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you order?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleeping was something of an adventure. You were so big that everything about you felt heavy as you lay on the bed, unable to roll on your chest like you normally did due to your massive breasts in the way. So it was hard to get comfortable even with the rest of you being soft and sinking into the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning rolled around, you hopped into the shower which was another interesting experience. It was a slow adjustment to get used to the fact that this body was yours now and came with its own needs to maintain. You had to use your mom's shampoo and conditioner to make your hair feel clean and there was a lot more areas to scrub. The slippery soap certainly did make your boobs a little more fun to play as you tired to find some lightheartedness in your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time breakfast rolled around, you had cooked up some frozen waffles to appease Susie, who was also adjusting to her new body. The simple meal was interrupted by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, by the time you had arrived, the package was already inside and there wasn't a soul in sight. You checked the door to confirm that it was indeed locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just keeps getting weirder and weirder,\" you muttered as you grabbed at the tiny box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had placed the order, you had spent some time thinking about the best way to approach matters. Having another gun might only make matters worse for yourself, considering it evaporated people entirely, and you weren't a chemist so you'd have no idea what you would be doing with a set like that. That left only the watches as the first choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, there was no markers or words left on the box save for your own address and mom's name. You took your order to the kitchen to grab a knife to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing?\" Susie asked, leering over you as you worked. It was a little nerve wracking to have to look up at her, there was no telling when she might just try to bully you due to mom's short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to fix this,\" you replied. \"I put another order from the place that got the Swapper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo. Pretty watches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't waste any time reaching down and grabbing one of the watches right from under your nose. She then slipped it on her wrist and began to play with it. You sighed and grabbed the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to turn on at all, not until you did the same and wore it. Then the screen lit up to an array of buttons. As with the website and the ad, none of it was in English or any language that you seemed to understand. Susie wore her own face of confusion as she began pressing the buttons at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid...,\" she said before trying to remove the band. \"I can't take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there appeared to be small pictures next to each button and word on the screen. You squinted to see what they would do before pressing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watches would...</span></div></div>",

Although you couldn't understand some of the menu options, when you chose the models of your body and the body Susie was in, it gave you new buttons and some sliders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie seemed to figure out the functions faster than you.  \"I can see what your boobs look like without clothes.\"  She giggled as she played with her watch.  \"What does this do?\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your chest start to deflate in front of your eyes.  \"What the hell?\"  You looked over at Susie and she was mouth open and looking amazed as her own breasts were swelling in front of her eyes.  Her finger was on the watch slowly swiping to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie how are you doing that? \"  You grab your breasts and feel them shrink in your hands.  Your bra became loosed and fell down your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was wearing a crop top today and her enlarging breasts were filling out her shirt revealing more of her tummy.  \"Hey stop it!\"  You said feeling violated.  You reach out and grab her wrist and pull away the hand that was controlling the smart watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie couldn't keep her eyes off of her chest and to be honest neither could you.  Her breasts were humongous.  She placed her hands under her breasts and lifted them up.  \"They are so heavy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your smaller chest.  Your shirt looked loose and baggy over your chest area.  Oddly you felt a little self conscious about it.  Which was strange because this wasn't your body and you didn't want to be stuck like this for the rest of your life, but you still felt self conscious about having a smaller chest.  You didn't realize it before but those large breasts completed the body in your eyes.  Now they were what you estimated to be C cups.  You stretched the neck of your shirt and peeked down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your eyes were back to Susie as she pulled her shirt up over to expose them for a better look.  Your jaw dropped.  The sight in front of you was breath taking.  There were absolutely enormous on her slim body.  She lifted them up tenderly so you both could examine them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie can I have those back please?\"  You said feeling flustered.  Although they did look extraordinary on her, you didn't like the idea of her messing with your body like that.  You felt violated.  \"I don't know how to take it off.\"  She said letting her big tits drop and bounce a little as she tried to pry the watch off of her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are not taking that off until I get my boobs back.\"  You said looking down at your smart watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie's mouth slowly curled into a grin.  \"Oh yeah.  What do you want boobs for anyways you are a boy?\"  She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and say stubbornly \"well those are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the part that let you exchange attributes with each other and easily could transfer sizes or swap parts from here.  You start transferring the cup sizes back to your own chest.  You stop and put your hands under your shirt and fumble with your boobs once they were big enough to push back into the bra and then restored them to their original size.  You secretly even give your self a little more ever so slightly.  You slowly plump them up until your bra felt a little uncomfortable.  That probably wasn't enough for Susie to notice but this weird self consciousness you were feeling made you want to be absolutely sure you got at least everything you lost back plus a little boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You guys find the option in the menu that lets you unclasp the watch.  Meaning you or Susie could go out and use the watch on someone else.  Adding more chaos to be added to your life that would be hard to undo.  If someone came home with extra proportions and didn't want them anymore their only option would to try and give them to each other.  Your bodies may end up with much different proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  You use the watches to transfer some of your extra weight to Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You still cant figure out how to remove the watches then you discover your body start changing again while Susie is in the other room.</span></div></div>",

You were so focused on trying to get the watch off your wrist. This wasn't what you wanted at all, you wanted to get your old body back not enhance your mom's in different ways. And yet, why did the idea of having larger breasts excite you in some fashion? It was the same feeling you had when this all began and you injected yourself with your mom's essence. Deep down, you wondered if you secretly liked being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't left thinking for long as you felt another loose feeling in your bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie,\" you growled as you looked down, only to see that your boobs were remaining the same size. As least relatively to the rest of your body. That's when you realized that all of your clothes were starting to feel a little loose on you. And your field of vision was steadily dropping. It hit you like a weight on your shoulders. You were shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the same feeling like with the Swapper, where it was turning your insides into soup so that it could mold you into your mom's height. This was more like a firm push on your shoulders causing you to sink down into the floor. You stood dumbfounded until your pants fell to the floor before you realized you had to get moving and stop Susie before she shrank you away to nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, the watch was the only thing that seemed to remain firmly attached to your body as you began to swim through the rest of your clothes. You had lost about a foot in height as you made into the living room looking like a pint sized version of your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susanna!\" you squeaked before you gawked at your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were breast level with her as she began to stretch up with her arms while her clothes creaked and groaned. Her cleavage was starting to spill out of her shirt as you saw less and less of her face from your perspective. Her feet exploded out from the shoes she was wearing before her growth spurt slowed to a stop. She had gained a foot in height while you had lost one, bringing you both to 6'8 and 4'2 respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" she said with a booming voice. \"Now you can never call me a little brat again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?\" you called up to her. \"We're so short and tall now that no one is ever going to see us as normal.

In the top right corner there was a box that had a red circle with a line through it.  It suddenly changed to a green circle with a check mark in it.  You look up at Susie's wrist and see that her watch now had the red circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\"  You began thinking thoughtfully.  \"That the way these watches are set up is that we have to take turns with the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats not fair!\"  Susie stomped her large bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is fair that way one of us can't just go overboard with the changes.\"  You disagreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do something so I can have my turn back.\"  She crossed her arms and gave you a very snooty pouty look that you saw often on Victoria's face before Susie took her body.  Her pants were not big enough to be pulled up to her waist so it was down revealing her groin area.  You both were so used to your bodies extreme changes that being exposed like this was no longer a big deal to either of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this opportunity as a chance to examine your watch without worrying about Susie interfering.  \"Come one hurry up.\"  Susie said looking at the red circle on her watch then looking down to try and see what you were doing.  She tried grabbing you but you duck down and dodge her.  She was kind clumsy at this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the bottom of the menu and find an image of a cartoon watch with an open clasp.  You press it and to your delight the arm band popped open.  You held it up for your sister to see.  \"I found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down quickly and swiped it from your hands.  \"Hey give that back!\"  You cry out.  She smirks as she holds it just out of your reach.  You try jumping up in down in your jiggling fat body but you quickly got out of breath and put your hands on your knees breathing heavily.  Even though you were almost 4 feet tall you kept your exact same proportions.  You felt the same you were just too small to fit into mom's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good that means I can put this watch on.\"  She shuffled her feet and started down the hallway to her mother's room.  Since she was too big for her pants they were down to her thighs and you could see her bare ass and exposed back.  Her crop top now was more like a sports bra in this new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey were do you think you are going?\"  You hurried after her.  Even though she was shuffling you still had to chase after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ducked under the door frame to Mom's room and closed the door behind her.  The lock clicked just as you attempted to open it.  \"Hey let me in!\"  You pound on the door.  The door knob came up to your chest in this short body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened it, Susie was wearing a pair of Mom's sweat pants and one of her shirts.  They were still kind of baggy but Victoria's body pulled the look off.  The sweat pants revealed her calves and the shirt was covering her good enough since it was so large but still was a bit billowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand was wearing only one of moms shirts at the moment which was so big it hung over your waist like a night gown.  Everything else fell off of you when you shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie slapped a watch on her wrist.  To your horror the watch she was now wearing had the green check mark signaling she had the next turn at the transformations.  Your plan completely backfired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked extremely pleased with herself.  \"Now what should we do next?\"  She twirled the other watch around her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a hunger in your sister's eyes that you hadn't seen before and she felt more like a tiger that was ready to pounce than a caring sibling. You wondered where you could even run to at this size as you tripped over your own shirt and fell backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo save you, there suddenly came a knock at the door. That gave your sister pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Susie's face lit up. \"A new toy to play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feared for whoever unwittingly answered the door only to be greeted by the giantess Susie. But you were powerless to stop her as she stomped away down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" you called out, still tangling in your oversized shirt. \"Susie, we can't be seen like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't hearing you as you got to the stairs which she had already cleared with one massive jump that rocked the entire house. You were helpless to just sit and watch as Susie opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the frame was your neighbor, Sophia Talbot. She was always rather a short thing, being 5'1 and chubby but that was kind of a moot detailed given the state of your body now. She was also somewhat of a crush of yours, probably because of the massive rack she liked to show off. She looked like a child compared to your sister, she didn't even come up to boob level as she slowly looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, hi, uh, Vicky. You've, uh, grown...I was just coming by to, uh, borrow a cup of sugar and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia wasn't allowed to finish as Susie instantly grabbed her by the wrist and hoisted her completely off the ground. The added height came with added strength and Sophia could only kick and struggle as Susie pulled her inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop kicking,\" Susie muttered. \"And put this on. Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you called out, falling down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing as you crumpled onto the floor and Susie slapped the watch on Sophia's wrist and let her go. The tiny girl looked up scared at Susie as she blocked the front door and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Now what do I want from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided on...</span></div></div>",

She tapped on her smart watch and you saw her bust size start to expand.  Looking back at Sophia her breasts were starting to shrink smaller.  Sofia was still confused about what was going on.  Victoria was abnormally tall and Heidi (Your mother whose body you are now in) is now a foot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of Sophia's shirt was starting to droop.  Normally streched and filled to the brim with boobage her shirt was now starting to slip as they shrank smaller and smaller.  It wasn't until the front of her shirt drooped enough to expose her now  still shrinking C cup breasts.  She looked down and gave a squeal.  She grabbed her loose shirt and pulled them up over her chest.  She looked up at Susie's swelling breasts in shock.  \"What are you doing to me Victoria?!\"  She said sounding panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia's chest shrank to nothing and she was completely flat chested.  She peered down the baggy front of her shirt and gasped.  \"They are gone!  You took them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was over joyed.  She pulled the shirt  over her head and her enormous tits bounced free.  The sight was to be honest breath taking.  These abnormally large breasts on Victoria's perfect body.  It was also so strange that she was so tall nearing 7 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked down at Sophia omnipotently.  \"You know since you gave me these breasts I will do you a favor.\"  Susie took off her own wrist watch which now had the red symbol signaling it was not her turn to make a swap.  She clamped it on your hand.  \"Hey!\"  You cry out in protest.  Susie laughed and got down on her knees behind you grabbing your hand with the watch and holding it up over powering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use that watch to make yourself thin. Just give all of your unwanted weight to.. my mom here.  Shes already fat I'm sure she doesn't care.\"  Before you could respond Susie put her large hand over your mouth muffing your voice.  You struggled and she only held you tighter and closer.  You could feel her new oversize bare breasts press softly against the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia looked so confused  She looked down at the watch that was clamped to her wrist.</span></div></div>",

Least of all Susanna towering over her with a booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" your sister bellowed to the scared girl. \"Pick something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia squeaked and pushed a random button. You winced, bracing yourself for what might happen to you. Instead you were overcome with the oddest sense of vigor you had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like you didn't even know you were tired and had suddenly gotten a massive energy boost. You felt as if you could run a mile as you looked over your body. You gasped as the wrinkles on your hand began to disappear. Your long red hair took on an even more vibrant tone of color as you could feel your breasts rise up and be a little more perky and less droopy. That's when you realized what Sophia had swapped with you. Your ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from you, Sophia looked horrified as her normally cheery face folded and cracked into someone twenty years older than she was. Her black hair greyed slightly as wrinkles appeared on her forehead. She looked exactly around your mother's age at 39 while you had morphed down to a nineteen year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanna let out a hearty laughed at the two of you. \"Too funny...Now, give me the watch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive hand made a grab for you, but you were too quick for her this time with a new spring in your step. You had youth on your side, even if you were still overweight. Susie was large and clumsy with her new height as she fumbled around for you to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here, you shrimp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran for the kitchen as you struggled to sort through the watch's menu. The only thing you could think of to end this gross dictatorship of the watches was to overpower your sister, and to do that you had to steal Sophia's height from her. As she was 5'1 and you were 4'2, you could steal up to five feet from her, making you a literal giantess to wrestle with your sister even with her height boost of 6'8. The only question was if you were going to be able to do it as you mashed the buttons to set up the draining process before Susie could catch you. With your new youth, that was proving quite difficult, but it was only a matter of time in the cramped house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pushed the final button...</span></div></div>",

You sigh and give your protruding belly a pat.  You noticed your skin felt more firm and less squishy in this 19 year old version of your mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it was your mistake to become too distracted.  Susie tackled you into a cabinet and pulled the watch off you.  You rubbed your sore ass that bumped hard into the cabinet.  \"Damn it..\" You mutter.  \"I think I am back to Mom's height now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie grins and looks at the watch.  \"Says your 5 feet tall.\"  She left the kitchen ducking under the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you become so diabolical?\"  You asked.

She starts to approach you and you realize shes going to put the watch on you again.  Sophia must have lost all of her usefulness in Susie's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to grab you and after a struggle she slapped a watch on your arm.

Her hair was piled on top of her head in that ridiculous \u201cpoof\u201d she was known for and had red highlights scattered throughout. Her clothing was both flattering and stylish, a far more tame and possibly even fashionable look than what she usually wore on the show you didn\u2019t watch, even if the bedazzled, gothic-lettered \u201cSnooki\u201d logo on her skirt was a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clicked the picture and dragged it to the window.

You also noticed a something written on the back but didn\u2019t bother reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmells nice.\u201d You said to yourself as you started lather yourself up in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed another handful and started washing your hair with it and then another handful getting all the spots and places on your body as you began to rinse yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rinsed off you failed to notice your body hair was falling off. It slid off your skin like it was never meant to be there. Every hair not on your head was sliding off your body leaving your skin perfectly smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of your skin it was also getting lighter shaded by the second. It soon turned a milky white color as your hair was turning a deep shade of dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the shower you grabbed a towel and started drying yourself off when you suddenly spotted your reflection in the mirror and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow....how did this happen?\u201d You asked looking at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour porcelain skin was silky smooth as your deep red hair was...getting longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as you could actually see your hair was getting longer right before your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to the shampoo bottle as you grabbed it as you noticed the label on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarning! This Shampoo is for feminization only! Use one small dose for a 24 hour feminization. Use two doses for a week long feminization. DO NOT exceed two doses in a 24 hour period. Three or more doses at once will result in a permanent female transformation!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes began to go wide when you realized you used far more than three doses in your shower...You just liked the smell and had no idea this would happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair was still growing longer as it was now past your shoulders and still growing longer by the second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to figure out what you were going to do when suddenly there was a knock on the bathroom door! </span></div></div>",

And to think, just a few blessedly short minutes ago she had been yelling at you to get out of bed that morning. She was unwelcome now and she was then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, mom,\" you said as you grasped the sink while your hair settled into its new length. \"I just slipped on some <span class=\"cpink\">soap is all</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as you held your throat. The voice that had escaped your lips was not yours at all, it sounded too high and bubbly. Almost like...Almost like...You were turning into a woman! The label on the shampoo was telling the truth and not just giving you an insane hair job and crazily moisturized skin to match! It was actually transforming you into a redheaded girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went quiet on the other side of the door as your mom was no doubt processing what she had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" she started. \"Did you use my shampoo I left in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you lied as you clutched the bathroom sink tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting harder and harder to breathe, and you had to take deeper and deeper breaths. You felt a crack in your ribs as it seemed like your lungs were collapsing in on themselves, only that wasn't the case when you looked in the mirror. You watched in horror as your sides were concaving, giving your torso a distinctly female shape. You felt weaker as you looked down at your hands. They were shrinking, become more slender and daintier in size. That spread quickly to the rest of your arms as they lost their toned muscle and got skinnier and twig like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared. So many changes were happening to you so fast, and they should have felt painful. But something was numbing the gross decay of your muscle and bone structure as your entire upper body shrunk in size. You felt your spine drop a notch and then two, causing you to lose several inches in height. There was still your legs to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did the only thing you could think of in this situation and called out to your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" you asked, no longer caring that you sounded like a girl. \"Who am I turning into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother paused again for a long while before saying...</span></div></div>",

It was of decent size, with many of the same components any high school boy could have. You had your usual bed, which was a pretty good size and quite comfortable with your blanket and pillows. You had a desk with your computer on it nearby, and also a handstand for just about all the usual things. Your TV and gaming system were on the other side of the room, probably some of the more expensive stuff in the room in all honesty, but you liked them obviously enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a modest bookcase as well, which also happened to contain many different books. Some were fantasy-inspired, others were manga volumes, and perhaps a few others in there. To an extent actually, you had quite the interest in Japanese culture and naturally got quite in line with some anime and games of that nature. It wasn't exclusively just that though as you had other varieties around your room. No doubt though that if anyone else looked at your room though, they'd likely accuse you of being a Japanophile, which you figured was a harsh way of putting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admittedly did have some posters of that particular kind, though not an excessive amount. You tried to at least keep it a little subtle. There were some game posters too. Your closet was of decent size too to be the finishing touch on what your room featured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, a pretty ordinary room in your opinion. You liked it enough that it was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, you guessed you had to start getting ready for the day before anyone yelled at you again. You trudged along the ground, heading over to get something off your nightstand. However, since you were still kind of groggy, you didn't notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being that some of your blanket had fallen to the ground, and when you stepped in it, you ended up getting your leg tangled with it, suddenly making you lose balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried out as you fell to the ground with a thud, though you had braced yourself a bit to keep yourself from really getting hurt. It made your room rumble just a bit, but nothing too much was changed. You could only wonder if your family heard that though. You groaned as you slowly got up to a sitting position...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever....there was something....strange that you could see....</span></div></div>",

It slid free quite easily and you could only stare at it in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item that you had found was something you recognized. It looked, if you could remember correctly, like an Omamori. A charm or talisman sold by Shinto temples in Japan as a token of good luck or to represent a particular blessing from the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it over in your hand, you were struck by how beautiful a piece it was. The wooden talisman was sheathed in a vivid purple brocade bag covered in intricate silver and gold embroidery that resembled gusts of wind and the leaves they carried with them. A line of Japanese kanji that you couldn\u2019t read ran down the center, skillfully embroidered with the same shining golden thread. The bag was sealed with a white corded tassel tied in a particular double looped knot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.omamori.com/322-large_default/omamori-school-lucky-amulet-temple-todaiji-nara-japan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.omamori.com/322-large_defaul...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, indeed. The charm was a thing of beauty and you could tell just by looking at it that someone put a large amount of time and skill into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, where did it come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much respect and interest that you had for Japanese culture, you were sure you hadn\u2019t bought this. You would have definitely remembered receiving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were honest, it weirded you out a bit. It was a harmless trinket but having it suddenly appear under your mattress was odd to you. You were obviously going to keep it and treasure it but you definitely wanted to know where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person that might\u2019ve put it there would\u2019ve been your mom when she changed your sheets, but the only things she knew about Japan came from the stories your grandfather shared from his service in the pacific during world war 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then, how did it get here and who left it?

Heck, it had been a long time since they did in all honesty, and you would have noticed if one of them had done this for you beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, guess there was no harm in it otherwise. The item was a real piece of work. You could only imagine how much time and effort were needed to make this beauty, certain far more effort than anyone you knew could put in. You wished you could read the kanji on it, but you really didn't have that much familiarity with the characters. You could probably maybe notice a handful of characters from your viewings of anime and certain video games in the past. Nothing of that sort would really help you here though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was too bad. Given what omamoris were meant to be, you would like to know what this one was supposed to have. Just regular old good luck? Or perhaps it was a specific blessing? Would have been nice to know but you supposed it wasn't a deal breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess you could hold on to it until such a time when you learned where it came from. There surely had to be a logical explanation somewhere out there. It's just science after all, not that you were spectacular in this class but that was another matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can....Huh?\" you were speaking when something caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intricate designs of the omamori appeared to be glowing. The blue leaves and silver wind almost looked like they were swaying for real, or was that an optical illusion? The 4 Japanese kanji on it also appeared to be softly glowing golden, almost making the thing look like a living work of art. It...actually looked really cool, like one of those 3D toys you had as a little child. Looking up, you were near your bedroom window, so perhaps it was just the right lighting. Still, really cool effect though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, I'm definitely keeping you around,\" you smiled as you put the little thing on your nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in any case, you did have to get going on your day otherwise someone would chew you out. At least the omamori had brightened your mood a bit. That was a plus, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you usually showered once you got out of bed, though you could go down for breakfast first.

Perhaps with a little extra given how long you spent up last night just for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, you tried to think of what you could do today. More gaming was always an option, though you played it to death last night. Hopefully Victoria might go out somewhere which could leave you with some relative peace. Susie did like to spend time with her friends on weekends too and Mom often did errands. Hey, maybe you'd have the house to yourself! Yeah, not likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, you got to the part where you washed your hair. You got your usual hair shampoo and began to wash as you often did, though something felt a little off. Was it just you or was there a little more hair to clean? It felt like you almost grab bunches full of hair. Okay, that was an exaggeration but it certainly seemed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it has been over a month since my last haircut,\" you wondered, though you were sure it wasn't like this the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou combed your hands through your hair, getting the shampoo everywhere. However, something was seriously beginning to feel off, as something felt like it was tickling you. You tried getting rid of it, but when a longer stand of hair flew into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what is going on?!\" you asked no one in particular, and thus received no verbal answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your hair back out of your face, but you felt as if you were starting to feel something on your neck and shoulders, maybe even your back as well.  To say you were confused would be a total understatement, and you were getting a little frustrated too. Grunting a bit, you tried pulling on to your hair, grabbing a lot of it as you pulled it in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...this can't be right...\" you said, finding it hard to believe what this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt like your hair, but it was much longer, far more than you ever had it before even during your longest breaks between haircuts. Also, was it just you or did it look....darker? You had brown hair which was already pretty dark, but this...almost looked raven black. Was it just the water or lighting messing with you? That wouldn't explain the hair length, You had to be imaging all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...was it just you or did your hair spell like...something herbal or whatever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly smelled a heck of a lot different, though you wouldn't call it bad or anything. Still, where was that smell coming from. You looked back at your shampoo. You honestly were so used to your formula that you must not having noticed anything odd. However, upon looking at it, you definitely noticed something off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticularly that what you had picked up was some brandless bottle or something. What was inside <i>looked</i> like shampoo and smelled like your hair did now. Was this something Mom picked up? Or maybe Victoria? God could only know what stuff she was into of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she get the wrong one?\" you asked. \"But why would this not have any name on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was so weird. You could only guess there was a mix-up somehow. Still, you wondered if this was behind your hair troubles. Though that would be something if using something like this really caused hair growth.

Not so much in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was another thing you could do. There were a pair of scissors in this bathroom. They were kept here in case any of the girls needed a quick cut, but you had never done it yourself. Well, first time for everything you supposed. Finding the scissors was easy enough, and you got enough of the mirror wiped so you could get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I don't know what you are, but it's good bye,\" you said as you took a strand of hair in your hand and cut it with the scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sliced through them like a knife through hot butter as one would expect, creating an incredibly long batch of black hair in your hands. Gosh, holding it like this only showed you just how long it really was. Honestly, there was no way you could give yourself a real haircut, but if you could at least get it to your neck or so, you could head to your usual place to get it cleaned up. No problem.

Hopefully you could get it done before any of your sisters bugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were about to grab another batch of hair to cut, you suddenly got this really bad itching sensation.

It was like something was forcing itself out of your scalp, and you got your eyes in the mirror in just enough time to look at it clearly. To your shock, it was the same place where you had just cut, with raven hair flowing out to the same length as before. It looked completely normal, as if you had done nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat.....what was happening....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way....this isn't real...\" you said in shock. \"Hair....doesn't grow like that....certainly not after a cut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were convinced something was totally wrong. There was nothing natural about this. Even if you could believe some hair growth formula, hair reacting to being cut like that was completely out of the ordinary. It bordered on something supernatural, but that couldn't be. Magic was saved for fantasy and media and all sorts of things like that. It wasn't real....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept....this was real. You made sure you weren't dreaming, and now you had a really big problem to handle. Hiding this amount of hair in your shirt might be near impossible unless you also put on a sweater, and given it was summer break, no one would believe you were in your right state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know...it was pretty sad that this was the case given that the hair itself was actually kind of pretty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately, the thought of anyone thinking you had pretty hair was a bit demeaning. As a young man, you weren't supposed to be pretty in any capacity, handsome, cute even were acceptable, but pretty wasn't supposed to be applied to you. Maybe if you had been born with looks like a male model it might've been somewhat acceptable but your scruffy, angular features were average, nothing terribly special unlike your lovely sisters or mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact that your supernatural lengths of hair had grown from an unkempt mop less than a few inches to a flowing curtain that reached your hips, your hair was beautiful. The raven coloring was deep and glossy, a deeper shade of black than you had seen on anyone not of Asian descent. Though it was fairly style-less in terms of looks, your hair looked thick and well kept as well as being perfectly straight rather than the unruly texture of you old locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as pretty as your hair might've been, that still didn't explain the fact that your hair had grown back like a gecko's tail after it had been cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair didn't work that way, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you stared, mouth agape, at your long haired reflection, the pink flush of your post-shower skin began to return to its usual peachy shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, it was <i>supposed </i>to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" you squinted at your reflection, \"something's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale peach complexion you were used to wasn't returning. Instead, your skin seemed to bypass it completely, slowly bleaching itself of melanin until it settled on a healthy creme white, several skin tones paler than you had ever seen on your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the the hell?\" you hissed at your reflection, \"Why am I so pale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you ntoiced that your face was bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up and touched your cheek. The skin there was soft and silky, far softer than it had ever been. In fact, you thought grimly, it felt almost feminine, like the well treated skin of Victoria or your Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was also absent of the stubble you woke up with. In the previous excitment created by your newly grown hair, it seemed that your stubble and any other unwanted hair on your face had vanished, as if you had been given the closest shave of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... wait a minute, what the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had you lost your stubble, but the wisps of dark hair that covered you body had disappeared as well! You were as hairless as newborn baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave the massive amount of hair on your head and your eyebrows and eyelashes, you were totally bereft of body hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" was your eloquent response as you looked down at your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the snarl of wiry pubic hair that surrounded your genitalia, there was neatly trimmed patch of soft, pitch black hair, not unlike the raven tresses that spilled down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is all this?! This can't be possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that wet, luxurious raven hair, and your soft and hairless lily white skin, you looked almost doll like, despite your masculine figure and face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was all just flat out ridiculous. How in the world was this all happening to you? None of it made sense to you in the slightest and your brain was racing to try and rationalize it all somehow. However, there wasn't much to go on. These changes looked random at best, and likely supernatural. But how would you know something supernatural when that shouldn't exist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, it was making your brain hurt honestly, and quite frankly just made you feel weak. You had to think somehow and get to the bottom of this, not to mention figure out just what you were becoming, if anything for that matter. First things first though, probably a good idea to get out of this bathroom. Heaven knows your mom or sister would probably bang on the door sometime. Best to at least get in your room to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a haste, you put the clothes you brought with you on, pausing a little bit on how they felt on your skin. Not only was your skin smoother, but it seemed more sensitive too, and your clothes felt really strange. Your jeans especially felt the weirdest, almost making you want to take them off right there. However, you resisted that, and grabbed a towel to try and wrap up your hair. It didn't need to be perfect. It just needed to be good enough to make it to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, you almost never had to do this, but desperate times you supposed. You grabbed your towel, wrapping up your incredibly long hair as much as you could which was a challenge of its own. You used your towel to try and contain it, though it was pretty loose. However, after a couple minutes, you succeeded in at least getting it to stay on without falling. Should be good enough for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough,\" you grumbled, opening the door to finally leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to go down the hallway a little bit to get to your bedroom. Should be simple enough. You walked out of the bathroom and immediately turned to make your way towards your room.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to see little Susie standing right there, nearly giving you a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Oh, Susie...\" you said, breathing a little deeply. You were scared it would be Victoria or your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy says breakfast is done,\" Susie said in her usual little giddy tone.\"Better get it before she gets angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that...\" you said as you got by her. No way could you go down right now. \"Tell mom I need a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Mommy might get really angry,\" she giggled, and then giggled some more at your look. \"And why are you wearing that towel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's none of your business,\" you groaned. Seriously, you didn't need this. \"Just...I need to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not the best excuse, but what choice did you have right now. The last thing you would do was try to go down looking like this. You kind of wondered if Mom might think you were sick with this pale skin tone. Well, whatever the case was, you didn't want to know how she'd react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving Susie any other chance to interrupt, you went straight to your room, closing the door and locking it for good measure. At that, you finally ripped the towel off your head, feeling a little out of breath from the tension there. Seriously, this wasn't what your morning needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...wha-UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you spoke, your body was wrecked with sensations all around, affecting every bit of you but it felt like it was mostly coming from your torso and extremities. It was hard to tell for sure through all the pain, but....it was almost like you were being squished or something. Your spine in particular felt like something was pressing from the top and bottom, and the same could be felt from your arms and legs. You ended up on the ground, hair flying everywhere as a result. You were pretty much on all-fours now, writhing a bit as you felt something going seriously wrong with your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled a bit, wondering closer to your bed all the while. Your knees sometimes slipped out from underneath you, like your jeans were hanging a little loose. Actually, all of your clothes were feeling a little looser, not that you could tell with how much discomfort you were in. Still, you reached a hand up to try and climb into your bed to at least lay it off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept...you didn't have to reach up far. Slowly opening one eye, you wondered if your bed mattress was....a little closer to the ground? Your bed seemed more or less the same, but the amount of space between the mattress and the ground seemed significantly smaller. Or maybe you just couldn't tell the difference with how stressed you felt right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH! I.....I don't care....ugh....\" you groaned, pulling yourself on to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat...as if this morning couldn't get any worse....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You breathed heavily as you hauled your quivering body onto your bed. The softness of your mattress and comforter seemed to soothe your aching body and soon the pain abated, leaving you laying there, motionless atop the soft curtain of your hair. Had your eyes been fooling you? Had your bed been shorter than usual? You found you didn't care. What concerned you was what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what the hell...\" you whispered, almost afraid to move a muscle lest the pain return with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that? It felt like a full body cramp, but you hadn't ever had one so bad before. The last time you had experienced full body cramps was after you were forced into the weight room during gym class and the coach had you bust your ass. You were in pain for days afterwards, but not nearly as much as you just were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a sign that you were getting sick? Cancer? Some other horrible ailment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that wasn't the case; you were only 17 for god's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your recent additons, your hair and skin, suggested something far more sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly moved your limbs across the bed and eased yourself to the edge of your mattress. You swung your legs over the side and froze as your feet encounted the ground far quicker than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBushing a strand of your silken hair away from your eyes, you stared at your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jeans looked looser on you than they had been. They had never been those skinny jeans that the skater kids wore, but the comfortable slim fit style you preferred usually fit you fairly snugly. Now though, there looked to be a fair bit of bagginess that hadn't been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but they seemed too long, the legs almost swallowed your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you felt like you were gonna say that a lot more today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stood up, mindful of the tiny throbs of residual pain you still felt and immediately, your jeans threatened to almost slip away from your hips. Either your pants had somehow grown in size after your episode or, and you really hoped this wasn't the case, you had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jeans, and subsequently your boxers, were very loose on your hips and noticeably too long, and your t shirt wasn't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your t shirt was on the baggier side, now it was almost draped over you like it was a size XL when you were a size medium. Where the hem should've rested around your hips, it was sitting closer to the tops of your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pain...,\" you murmured, \"I'm shrinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible. Biology and anatomy didn't work that way, but if today's prior events had taught you anything, magic or whatever this was didn't follow the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic, or whatever this was, didn't care for physics, or biology, or anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all you knew, when magic was involved, two plus two equaled <i>fish</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen magic was involved, apparently your hair could change color and grow to ten times its own length in a few seconds, and your 5'11 lanky figure could lose several inches of height and mass equally fast. In your now oversized clothing, you looked so much smaller, almost waif-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you didn't know how tall or how light you had gotten, but you almost didn't want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp sting in your eyes interrupted your frenzied musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't nearly as painful as the agony of your body shrinking down had felt, more of a strong irritation if anything. It almsot felt as if someone had thrown sand in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically rubbed at them, trying to dislodge whatever had gotten in your eyes as tears slipped down your cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sting soon faded and you blinked the tears from your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirror... mirror!\" you hissed, still blinking the tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling towards the mirror over your dresser, almost tripping over your jeans in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed heavily. Your reflection looked almost alien to you. Surrounded by the inky curtian of hair, your face almost looked like a porcelain doll with its pale, creamy skin, but... there was something <i>new</i> to be noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes looked different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked visibly larger, more expressive, rimmed with full, dark lashes, almost girly looking despite their bloodshot sclera. Your irises looked subtly different too, the brown color seemed much less brown and tinges of dark blue could barely be made out swimming the darkness. And unless you were going crazy, they almost seemed more almond shaped, narrower with a slight tilt that hadn't been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's very wrong here... oh something's wrong...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stinging feeling wasn't helping either, and it wasn't long before you were bringing your hands to your eyes again and rubbing them, You pretty much had to use one hand on the dresser to keep yourself upright as you were doing so. Your still sore body made it feel like you could fall over at any moment, and if not that, then tripping over your clothes would be the next likely thing to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh......ugh....\" you groaned as you rubbed your eyes. It felt as bad as being out in the sun without sunglasses, and you knew that feeling well. It was horrible. Your eyes felt like they were beginning to tear up a little from the irritation. \"Stop it....just.....yamete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, huh? What was that again? You were trying to say \"stop it\" but that sounded different. Then again, with all the grunting you were doing, perhaps your words just got garbled up. You were willing to accept that. It sounded better than the alternative a bit. The stinging in your eyes appeared to be going down, only leaving a little soreness. You could only imagine how bloodshot you must have looked after that. Well, you frankly didn't want to look, but you felt like you didn't have much of a choice. Hesitantly, you looked at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt....was almost like looking at a doll. An admittedly pretty one if you wanted to put it that way. For one thing, it was stunning at the contrast between your porcelain skin and pitch-black hair, but that paled in comparison to your eyes. You couldn't feel much difference between now and then, but there was a definite tilt to your eyes, larger and expressive, yet almost-shaped thanks to the epicanthal folds on them. The brown color you used to possess now appeared like a sea of dark sapphire. To an extent, they looked almost black, but when you angled your face a bit into slightly better lighting, the dark blue shone radiantly. It was something you'd probably love if not for the fact that they were your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some tear streaks thanks to your little episode there. Honestly it kind of made you look pretty vulnerable, very much like a doll. All of this seemed pretty feminine in all honesty. Your face still looked masculine in spite of its softness, but your eyes looked like those of a serene woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay that really wasn't something you wanted to think on. At least they weren't stinging anymore. You kept your balance up as you moved away from the dresser, feeling no closer to discovering what's going on. Though, as you were looking out, now that you could actually think, something stood out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's the clothes I had right here? And my books?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you were a slob or anything, but you had left some things out over the past few days. You had lots of leftover clothes that needed to be washed, and some books you had yet to properly put away. Heck, some of your games had been thrown about when you were looking for something last month. Oh, and did I mention that you hadn't dusted in over a month?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, your floor looked spotless, probably why you hadn't tripped on anything yet. No smelly clothes on the ground. All books properly put away. Your games all stored underneath your TV stand. And there was no dust at all on the furniture anywhere. And...was it just you or did your place smell a little?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no, not the smell of BO. Rather it was...kind of flowery? Actually it partially reminded you of that shampoo smell, only a little more pleasant this time. You wondered if someone might have air freshened your room, but that didn't seem likely.</span></div></div>",

The reflection you had seen in the mirror haunted you even though you weren't looking at it anymore. Indeed, your face, though still unquestionably  <i>you </i>in its facial shape, jawline, nose, and everything, reminded you of a doll. The deep, glossy black of your hair contrasted sharply with your flawless, creamy white skin, but it was your eyes that truly struck you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color was incredibly beautiful, subdued and dark most of the time but vibrant like sapphires in the right lighting, but the <i>shape </i>was what got you. While noticeably larger looking than before, the shape was all wrong. Instead of your rounded, sleepy looking eyes, the pretty new peepers you now had were tilted gently with notable epicanthal folds at the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't your eyes in any capacity, they were distinctly Asiatic in appearance, and that made things very complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the majority of you facial features might've belonged to a young Caucasian man, the huge, beautiful eyes with their full dark lashes and the gentle tilt, and ink black hair suggested undeniable Asian roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, there was your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as though someone had gone through and cleaned it thoroughly, dusting every shelf and knick-knack you had, putting away any stray books or items, deodorized the place of your BO with some flowery, natural scent, did your laundry and made your...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what's that... my bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't gone crazy earlier during your painful episode where you lost so much height and mass, you bed had been getting shorter. Now, though, it had shortened so much that it sat completely on the floor and looked so different you couldn't exactly call it a <i>bed </i>as <i>you </i>knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mattress and box spring had seemingly smashed themselves together into a thin, but soft looking, pad that sat on the floor without any frame. A single white pillow sat near the top where you'd put your head and your plain blue comforter had been replaced with a thicker blanket covered in shades of soft lavender and purples and decorated with flowery designs in various shades of complimenting blues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is that a <i>futon</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just a futon, but the same sort of bed that you saw in many of the Japanese anime's you'd watched over the years. A thin, foam pad as a mattress, thick, warm comforters. Simple, but effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not what you wanted to see in your bedroom.</span></div></div>",

For something so thin, you wouldn't have expected that, and yet it actually felt nice, and the blanket was no exception either. Just feeling it was enough to show you of how warm it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that's...actually a little impressive,\" you spoke to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, on closer inspection, the design of the blanket was actually not all that different from that omamori you found. The imagery of leaves definitely reminded you of that. Your new eyes actually widened a bit at that, remembering the omamori. You turned to your nightstand, seeing the little trinket still there. You reached up and grabbed it, and it actually looked no different from before, emitting that really soft glow along the symbols and kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it related to these Asian traits you were beginning to see in your room and your person? Didn't seem like coincidence that all of this stuff would happen on the very day you discovered something like this in your room. So, was this little thing really behind it all? If so, maybe you should do something about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still....I really don't want to throw it away,\" you groaned. You couldn't help it. The little thing just looked so nice. Hard to think of it as some bringer of chaos to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were looking at the thing though, there was a little something that seemed off. Well, off just like everything else so far. Your hands holding the charm were aching just a little bit, making you cringe a bit as you brought your left hand to your face. You already knew you were significantly shorter now, both in height and pretty much in frame as well. However, your hands now looked like they were becoming exceptionally dainty, and your eyes widened a bit as you were seeing your nails grow slightly. You had just cut them a couple days ago, but now they were looking kind of like before. Not excessively long though. They were growing to a rather simple and modest cut, looking well maintained without the extravagance that Victoria did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, dainty was a word you'd use to describe much of you right now. Not just smooth and petite, but carrying a certain degree of elegance. To be frank, it kind of reminded you of Susie, that being like a girl before puberty. Actually, that had been something on your mind often now. All these changes had one thing in common: that being that they were quite feminine in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you turning into a girl? That...honestly seemed to be the case. But why? You know, an Asian girl would have been someone you'd have loved to see in person, but not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....Just what can I do?\" you hung your head, slumping a bit and making your long hair hide your face a little. \"It's all happening so fast....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as you said that, you heard a creaking, making you turn your head up.Was that coming from your room? Actually, it didn't take long for your question to be answered. The creaking noise lead you over to the single window your room had. The wood that comprised your window seemed to be changing color, looking much like dark wood. Actually, such a feature seemed to be taking over much of the window, replacing what was there before. The glass that allowed you to see outside actually looked like it was fogging up, the visage outside beginning to disappear as the material used transformed into something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that called again? You swore you had read this before....oh yeah, rice paper! You had saw that online at some point, but that was beside the point. Your window just changed! And its new design even made a different sound compared to your own one. Also, was it just you or did it look like it was designed sideways instead of up and down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that whatever was going on was extending to your room like this was frankly terrifying, though you could swear you were seeing a certain light from beyond your window. At that same time though, the clothes on your dainty body were still feeling weird, a sensation that seemed to be building.</span></div></div>",

Your world was being turned upside down, seemingly as a result of that Omamori charm you stubbornly refused to even consider throwing away or destroying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you privately hoped that destroying it or getting rid of it would bring this transformation to a halt, or better yet, reverse it entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...,\" you whispered softly, looking at the charm gently held in your delicate fingers, \"that's horrible, I couldn't do such a thing, not to something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of doing anything to harm it was, deep down, extremely offensive, even if the Omamori was the reason that you were seemingly turning into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shifting in your clothing tore your attention away from the charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jeans seemed breath in and out, almost to emit a quiet sigh. The fabric rustled though there was no wind to do so and shifted against your hairless legs, feeling strangely silky and airy against your skin. The denim looked odd to your watching eyes, lacking the usual lattice of blue threads. Instead, it all seemed far more uniform, for lack of a better term, the woven threads seemed much tighter, the color more consistent and looked like it had adopted a purplish tinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted slightly, lifting a leg to take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jeans now seemed to fit you much better, at least in terms of length, though they still remained quite baggy on you, but in a strangely different way that you couldn't quite put your finger on. Like, despite how baggy they appeared, they felt easier to move in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet rustle and the feeling of fabric gently brushing your arms directed your attention towards your black t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... my sleeves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, your sleeves had undergone a change while you were preoccupied with your pants, the looked noticeably longer than before. Whereas a t-shirt would normally had sleeves that ended near the middle of your bicep, your sleeves had somehow lengthened down passed that, very nearly in line with your elbows. They, like your pants, seemed baggier too, but in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed to fit your upper arms somewhat more snugly while they seemed to flare out slightly near your elbows. The coloring seemed to have skewed slightly, a noticeably lighter, grayer tinge instead of the deep black it had been when you put it on. The Chevrolet logo seemed fainter, and the threads and seams near the end of your sleeves and around your collar seemed to look brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd had your shirt always had a V-neck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUneasiness seemed to settle in your gut, as you stood in the middle of your changing room, in a changing body and changing clothing. You gripped your origami tightly, a prayer whispering past your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasukete... please...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Where....where did that come from? It sounded so strange, like an earnest prayer of sorts. And what was that word you used when you wanted to say \"help\"? Wait, connecting the dots from just about everything so far from the Asian eyes, and windows, and futon.....was that actual Japanese you were speaking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't know much outside of perhaps some common words you heard from anime. You could understand a little, though full sentences was not something you could do. Funny how actually being able to speak the language was something you often found cool. Just wish this instance didn't have the sick undertaste of your whole body and room being turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the clothes didn't help either. While you were coming to the realization that you were becoming more feminine, your clothes really didn't give any obvious indication of what they were becoming. The bagginess of them really didn't give you any clues. Guess you would just need to wait to figure those out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, perhaps the only saving grace right now was neither your mother or sisters shouting your name right now. You probably well missed breakfast by this point, though you weren't exactly concerned with something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of got bigger things to-UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own words were broken off by a sudden sensation on your face, making you grunt as you held your hands to it, dropping the omamori in the process. It felt almost exactly like the cramping you felt earlier, though perhaps even more sensitive given it was your face. It was like worms crawling underneath your skin, affecting the muscle structure of your face. However, what felt even worse was your skull. It..actually felt like your skull was cracking and reshaping, and it felt even worse than it did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh! Help!\" you cried out, hands on your face as you practically shrieked. \"Kami ga watashi o tasuketekudasai!\" <sup>(Please god help me!)</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what you were saying, and frankly didn't seem to care given the pain you were in. With all the nerves in your head, it was no wonder such a change was this extreme. You imagined probably the whole house could have heard you though with that shriek, though if that was Japanese you were speaking, maybe your family would just mistake it for one of your anime and just tell you to turn it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was beside the point, as the cracking and remodeling of your skull was taking priority. You staggered all the way towards the mirror again, half wanting to hide but the other half wanted to know what was happening. Against all the pain you were in, you slowly pulled your hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with your face contorted as it was, you could see the changes. Your entire head was looking more delicate and smaller in size, with your jawline being less pronounced than before. Your cheekbones had risen a bit, becoming more slender along with your nose becoming cute and button-like. Your lips were puffing up slightly, though merely just to fill out more. The remainder of your face morphed around your new ones, complimenting them as your face was becoming as a Japanese beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were practically out of breath once it finally decided to die down though, making you slide down a bit as your knees landed on the ground, one of your hands still holding the dresser. God this was painful. Not just emotionally but also physically. Guess this was just how different males and females were in this regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow....ow.....my head....\" you groaned. \"My-ACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething lumped in your throat, making you go into a bit of a coughing fit, making you bring your own hand down to cover your mouth as you almost felt like something was stuck. Almost felt like those times when water accidentally went down your lung pipe. Your hands covered your mouth, though one of them subtlety went down to your neck. However, rather than feeling a bump, there was nothing. Nothing but a smooth, slim neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My....M-My voice....\" you croaked out, no longer hearing the voice of a growing boy. That was drowned out by an incredibly high yet soft voice, youthful yet elegant. \"\u014cno. <sup>Oh no.</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis transformation was taking more from you with every minute.</span></div></div>",

You hand traced your throat again. There was nothing there, only the same silky smooth skin that covered your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Adam's apple, no nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this...\" you stifled your next words as the soft, high pitched voice you heard before drifted from your parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had heard before, your voice was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually very beautiful sounding, high and musical like the chiming of a silver bell. Every word you spoke somehow radiated a sense of innocence and purity. Whether those words would continue in English, though, remained to be seen. Every now and then, you noticed, what you assumed to be bits of garbled Japanese would come out instead of the intended English word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kami ga watashi o tasuketekudasa.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords like \"Kami\" and \"tasukete\" were somewhat familiar to you, but everything else may as well have been gibberish. And yet, somehow, those bits of Japanese that had spilled forth from your babbling sounded as though you had spoken the language your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had screamed that as your face underwent its horrible change and you didn't know what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing your fear, you slowly pulled yourself to your feet. You weren't going to lie to yourself; you were utterly terrified to see your face again. You had gotten a glimpse of it during your transformation but were too delirious from the pain to take proper note of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pulled yourself to you full, insubstantial height, you beheld your face once more and were subsequently struck dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl in the mirror was absolutely stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traced soft, pale pink lips with a trembling hand, feeling the tiny, slightly upturned nose, the high, elegant cheekbones and those haunting, teary dark pools of sapphire you called eyes. If you had looked a little like a doll before, there wasn't any doubt you completely resembled one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose pale features, big eyes, and gorgeous raven hair together formed a face that was almost ethereal looking. It was a face that didn't radiate the raw sensuous appeal of most American women of beauty, but a more serene, graceful, and innocent type of beauty that was a gift from <i>Kami </i>to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quailed at that thought, you had no right to have such a face, you were an American teen, an average young man with average features, not the vision of elegance and purity that stared back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a vulnerable, innocent young Japanese maiden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shuffle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Flutter</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes snapped away from your reflection towards your pants, which shifted and rustled around your legs. The bagginess of your jeans had only grown, in fact they had become so baggy around your legs that they nearly appeared to be a huge skirt, with denim having softened even more with the fabric almost seeming to be pleated slightly. The waistband had tightened around you midsection and your leather belt looked more like a cloth sash with a mangled steel buckle than anything else at this point. That purple tinge from before seemed to have deepened, so your \"jeans\" looked almost violet rather than faded blue they should've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tugged at them in apprehension, your sleeves brushing against your forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nani?\" you whispered, raising your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleeves slowly crept down your arms, remaining snug around your slender biceps before billowing out into large bell shapes, almost swallowing your hands into the process. They quickly grew until they hung from your arms, so long they almost touched your hips. Thin red strips of fabric emerged from the rims of your sleeves as the fabric of your once black shirt skewed further into a light gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost comically, you waved your arms like a bird, your long sleeves fluttering in the air like the wings of a bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you saw the last remnants of the Chevrolet logo vanish and the V-neck, also trimmed with red fabric, deepened. It almost looked like your shirt was splitting into two pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yamete... s-stop changing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as with before, you were ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time until you lost something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from its position on the floor near your dresser where you had dropped it, the Omamori continued to glow softly.</span></div></div>",

When you were agitated like this, it kind of reminded you of anime girls, which really wasn't a term you wanted to describe to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if your words were doing much of anything, but your clothes did seem to stop changing for the moment, giving you at least a little relief. Honestly though, you felt no closer to figuring out just what you were beginning to wear. Your pants looking so ruffled and long that they were almost like a skirt? Your top cutting down the middle like this and those long and wide sleeves? You couldn't quite figure out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, a kimono? Nah, didn't seem like that. You'd think the colors would be the same for the whole thing if that was the case. Plus, your clothes didn't seem to be coming together to form such a garment. Hmm, what else could it possibly be? Idol outfit? Well, that was always a possibility, but you weren't sure about that. What other sorts of Japanese girls could there be? You happened to glance over at the omamori, still glowing softly. You had little doubt now that it was causing this somehow, but looking at it did make you think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe....a miko? Shrine maidens could be associated with such a trinket, and your clothes could possibly be like that. Heck, it might even explain your little prayer earlier. Still, it was little more than a guess at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wha-AHHH!\" you cried out, suddenly having to wrap your arms around yourself, falling to your knees. \"Sore wa itai!\" <sup>It hurts!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of pain this transformation was causing you irritated you so much. Did it enjoy this? Making you suffer through all the differences that separated boys from girls? Was it a test from <i>Kami</i> itself? Oh geez, even your thoughts were beginning to think differently. The only saving grace was at least this didn't seem to be quite as bad as your face earlier. This was more akin to being punched in the gut and feeling like you're going to throw up, which was still an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your neck down, it was like you were being pressed together. Your shoulders, which were actually decently big for a guy, felt like they were being crunched in, slimming your frame even more. However, that was far from the worst. Your waist felt like it was being pulled inwards, almost constricting you as you were being forced to arch your back, getting to such a point where it became permanent. Any excess fat was vanishing, even the little gut you had from perhaps a little too much snacking at times. The area around your stomach was slimming down considerably, only furthering how sick you felt from the aching. A hand pressed to your stomach confirmed how much flatter it was feeling, and another hand to your waist confirmed how it was starting to resemble curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <i>Kami</i>, you could only imagine that some of the more distinctive changes of a girl were nearing. The chest and the groin: two very different areas. Half of you wished it would just get it over with, while the other half was too horrified to even think about it. You were still nearly out of breath from just having your torso twist itself into the beginning of womanly curves so experiencing some of \"women's bounty\" didn't sit well with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sensations were still going through your whole body, and it felt like there was some kind of pressure building that worried you a lot. Honestly, you felt like you could cry again. It was all so much, becoming basically an entirely different person, and it was difficult for your mind to really handle that pressure, as it probably would for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...some...one....would....\" you talked between breaths, barely able to get a word out. Your chest was starting to feel even more pressure, and that could mean.... oh no.....oh no.....\"Ah.....ah.....ah.....ahhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice cracked as you kept on breathing, hard to make a coherent word. Your chest felt like something was pushing down on it, or rather, being pushed on in two places. Whimpering, you looked down through your loose top. Your nipples were pointing up, looking distinctly darker and bigger than usual. You could see them actually grow in real time, growing larger every second. The very air around your room seemed to make them react, as your loose clothing kind of exposed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was merely the beginning. You grunted and took larger breaths as you ended up falling on your back, chest pointed upwards as you watched it begin to expand. Your eyes teared up as two distinct mounds began to push the flesh around your nipples, going up with each breath, and they became heavier all the same. You had no idea of female breast sizes, so you could only really guess, but that didn't really matter as you watched them grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mounds continued to grow, partially exposed to the air thanks to your loose top. They got bigger, and bigger, but just when you wondered if you would reach bombshell status, they began to stop, settling at what was probably a pretty decent size. Not super huge, but still kind of perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left you just laying on your back on the ground, looking upwards with your hair flown all over the floor behind you.</span></div></div>",

There were sparkles all over the place and gave the impression of a bright and cute world of music. It looked like something a crazy otaku would have, of which you wouldn't really consider yourself as. Yeah, you enjoyed Japanese stuff more or less, both in terms of culture and entertainment, but this was kind of out of the ordinary even for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt thankfully did have a group name: KSS48. Sounded very similar to some other idol groups you had heard of, probably most famously AKB48. The first three letters of groups like these usually meant something, though you weren't sure why. Saying \"KSS\" out loud though almost made you think of \"kiss\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that would be funny,\" you smirked at such an idea. Who knew if that was the idea but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, it seemed like a pretty normal disk. There were mentions of many different songs, ranking in the dozens actually which was impressive for a CD. There seemed to be some Japanese text though that indicated a tag line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Otagai o shinrai shi,-boshi ni tewonobasu</i></u> <sup>Trust in each other and reach for the stars</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally though, you couldn't really read any of this, not to mention that confusing it was for such a thing to even be here. You didn't buy anything of this sort. Maybe someone gave it to you as a prank? Certainly not your family, and you hadn't had any friends in here for quite some time. Your mom would have mentioned something given she often changed out sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as confusing as it was, you couldn't deny J-Pop as a guilty pleasure. If it was here, might as well use it. You didn't see any indication that it was a stolen piece or anything. If that was the case, then you guessed it was all fair game. The closest rationale you could think of was probably someone leaving it there and it just happened to be missed until you found it. Fair enough as far as you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as you did a lot of the time, you downloaded the songs to your iphone. Though, perhaps amusingly enough as it was happening, your screen actually showed an image resembling that of the cutesy CD. Huh, was that some kind of promotion for anyone with the CD? Sounded curious but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it wasn't too long until you saw it finish downloading, and you put the CD back in its case and left it in a spare container in your dresser. You actually had to get ready to meet a friend of yours. Jordan wanted to hang with you today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh, you made your way to your dresser and picked out a clean, plain black t-shirt, somewhat worn jeans, and some socks. You and Jordan had been good friends for a long time, sharing an interest in old hot rods and muscle cars as well as casual interest in anime and such. The two of you often hung out in each other's garages, usually working on some project or another or just bullshitting for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you changed into your fresh clothes, your phone buzzed on the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey! I'm downstairs! Hurry up, Victoria is really creeping me out!</i> was the message on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled slightly, your eldest sister Victoria, the queen bitch herself, apparently had a crush on Jordan and would often hover around making eyes at him and flirting. Jordan though, much like yourself, was the awkward sort of guy that had issues talking to anyone of the female gender and Victoria's reputation as a major bitch hadn't ingrained her to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor guy,\" you muttered with a grin, you pitied anyone Victoria had an interest in. Her beautiful, model-like looks didn't match the \"bitchy hot girl\" trope she personified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your phone, you made your way downstairs to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, no, I think I've got... uh... plans that day...\" you heard Jordan's nervous voice as your rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You don't think you can reschedule?\" came the sultry soprano of your elder sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan was sitting at the kitchen table, looking like he would rather be literally anywhere else. Victoria, dressed in a tight, low cut tank top that flaunted her cleavage and black short shorts that left her long shapely legs on display, was sitting next to him, having scooched her chair as closer as she could to him. She was leaned over so Jordan had a perfect view of her cleavage and was twirling a strand of long deep crimson hair, batting her big green eyes playfully at your sweating friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan was a tall, lanky young man a few years olden than you, being 19 to your 17. He had a shaggy mop of dark brown hair and narrow dark brown eyes that could be mistaken as black and rectangular framed glasses. He was wearing a dark blue t-shirt with a picture of a dragon on it, ripped jeans, and worn work boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\" you greeted as you walked into the room, \"Sorry about that, woke up late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria gave you a dirty look and stood up, but not before smiling seductively at your friend and giving a slow wink as she sauntered out of the room, purposely swaying her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Jordan rasped out, looking torn between being horrified and aroused, \"she's relentless... and hot, can't forget hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hear that a lot,\" you quipped with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan shuddered, \"Yeah, but I can barely handle eye contact with a girl, let alone actually date anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, \"That, and Grandpa always said, never stick your dick in crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you gave a loud guffaw and made your way to the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the garage, you flipped on the light, illuminating the low, sleek form of a black 1982 Camaro with its hood up. This was your pride and joy. It was in great shape and when the man down the street was selling it for cheap you couldn't resist, even if your mom had been less than thrilled. She calmed down though, happy you had found a hobby that got you out of your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Jordan said with a grin, \"Lets get going eh? That transmission leak won't fix itself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" you agreed, \"haven't had much luck though, still leaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what I'm here for, the Plymouth had the same issues. I like to think I got pretty good at fixing those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strode towards the car, dragging a floor jack behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put on some music!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plugged in your phone to the stereo on your workbench...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, you had been surprised at how much working on a car was a genuine delight. You had your reservations about actually working on a car, but it turned out for the best. Plus, As established, Jordan was actually fairly competent at these which helped to kind of show you the ropes a little bit. It was certainly rewarding, probably would really come in handy in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, as you had done many times before, you plugged your phone in to the stereo on the workbench, heading for your playlist as you often did. Though, for some strange reason, it was taking a little extra time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow phone?\" Jordan chuckled a bit as he was getting the floor jack set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" you groaned. You had your iphone for a couple years now but it had been working pretty well for the most part. You really weren't ready to get another phone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, thankfully, it all seemed to work out, with the stereo beginning to come to life and you hitting play on your phone. After that though, it was not what you were expecting as bright poppy music began to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mite, sora no kumo o mite.\" <sup>Look, see the clouds in the sky</sup><br>\r\n\"Issho ni toberu ka na?\" <sup>Might we be able to fly together?</sup><br>\r\n\"Tsubasa ni kaze o kanjitai\" <sup>I want to feel the wind in my wings</sup><br>\r\n\"Anatatowatashi wa t\u014dku made ikimasu!\" <sup>You and I will go far!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as J-Popy as such a thing would ever be. The voices of many young girls singing in unison to a graceful melody. Funny enough though, the song felt...strong in a sense. It was like every word was ringing clear in your brain, to the point where you could perhaps even imagine the girls dancing to the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little episode was broken by Jordan's laughing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah, man! What's with that?!\" he laughed as he left he fork behind. \"You've never played on of those outside of your room before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wasn't trying to!\" you blushed heavily and tried to stop it. \"It's probably from that new CD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What CD?\" Jordan asked, eyebrow-raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I found this CD in my room,\" you said as you tried to move the music to another song. \"It looked like a J-Pop CD, from KSS48 or something like that. I wasn't sure where it came from. Figured you or someone else left it there as a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Certainly not me if that's the case,\" Jordan said, a little perplexed as he turned back towards the car. \"KSS48 doesn't sound familiar either. Maybe a new group or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe....UGH!\" you groaned, getting a little fed up with this. \"The phone won't let me switch to another song. I didn't even put these songs on the playlist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you do need another phone,\" Jordan said without turning around as he began to get underneath the car. \"Ken's phone was kind of flipping out on him the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\" you groaned again, really not wanting to get a new phone. You knew your mom wouldn't like shelling out more money for a phone. Even the fact that the song was pretty nice didn't help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a nice song either way though,\" Jordan laughed from underneath the car. \"Really catchy. And maybe if Victoria hears it, she'll finally lose interest in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's a silver lining,\" you sighed as you put your phone down on the bench, smiling a little bit all the same. \"Guess there are worse things that can happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, you shouldn't have said that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a very nice song, actually ranking in your current favorites now that you actually took a moment to listen to it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually a pretty good song,\" Jordan's muffled voice came from under the car, \"a bit too poppy for my taste, but pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snorted, \"Well, it is called J-POP for a reason, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point,\" he agreed, \"at least its better than American pop, that's basically like shoving shit in your ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit harsh,\" you said with a grin, \"There's some songs that are pretty catchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" he quipped, grunting slightly as he wrestled with the transmission cooler lines, \"name one that doesnt give you a headache after listening to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I...\" you trailed off midsentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ima doko ni iru no ka wakaranai\"<sup> I don't where I'd be right now</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anata nashide watashi o michibiku\"<sup> Without you to guide me</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikudasu na, tsudzukete\" <sup>Don't look down, keep going</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mata aeru made!\" <sup>until i see you again!<br>\r\n</sup><br>\r\n</i>The words hammered into your head like jackhammers and your world seemed to blur and become insignificant. The rapid clicking of Jordan's ratchet and his grunts of exertion seemed to echo, rippling across your mind. You felt lightheaded, weak. The ratchet clattered on the aluminum of the intake manifold as it dropped from your nerveless fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swayed away from the car, leaning heavily on your toolbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shit!\" Jordan's voice seemed to boom in your ears, followed by the sound of flowing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan slid out from under the car, covered in red fluid and looking very irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really fucking hate trans fluid,\" he groused, \"I hate how it feels. I can deal with everything else, but trans fluid just sucks.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Yamenaide! Tachidomaru na! Watashi wa kono ai o tome sasemasen!\" <sup>Don't stop! Keep going! I will not let this love be stopped!</sup><br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Hey, can you get me rag to wipe this shit off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words seemed not to register to you, the echoes of the girl's voices still bouncing around in your skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" you slurred drunkenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Dude are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world came back into focus as you felt hands shaking your shoulders and you saw your friend's bearded face lined with concern. The sound of the J-pop song still played in the background but was winding down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, dude! Hey, you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to clear the lightheadedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you muttered, resting a hand on your forehead, \"I'm good, just felt a little lightheaded for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at you, brown eyes narrowed behind his glasses, not looking convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously,\" you assured him cinfidently, \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...\" he said flatly, before he blinked and squinted at you closely, his sharp eyes raking over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\"</span></div></div>",

Just what was that all about? Catchy songs, especially of the J-Pop kind were nothing new to you, yet that song in particular felt like it was invading your head. It felt like every word was in engraving itself, to the point where you could almost imagine the girls themselves singing and dancing together to this song. It was a unique feeling, one you didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jordan's words made you blink a bit, registering his words finally. Wait, did he say red? In your hair? Red was a common hair color in your family but you didn't have it, just having a rather normal brunette color. Hair color could change subtly over time, and you knew this, but that seemed a bit extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I shouldn't have any red,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you do right now,\" Jordan pointed up before turning around. \"Take a look if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hummed a bit, not quite sure what he was getting at. Still, guess it was worth a little look at. You walked over to the side of the car, looking into one of the side mirrors since it was the only real reflective surface around there. Initially, you didn't see anything new, but maybe that was because you were quick to try and prove Jordan wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look, there actually did seem to be some red, and not a red you were familiar with like your family. The red you were beginning to see through your brown locks looked very vibrant, almost kind of smooth once you touched it a little. Was it just a trick of the lighting? You weren't sure, especially since it looked like it was spreading. Perplexed, you put your hands to your hair to feel it out, feeling that same smoothness as before. Also...was it just you for was it bushier? It had been a while since your last haircut, but your hair shouldn't have been long enough to cover your ears. And....why were your bangs long enough to be pulled along to the side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" you raised your eyebrow, trying to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this still just you having your head in the wrong place from the headache you had earlier. Your hair shouldn't look like it was alive, curling around your face a bit as it was coming over your shoulders in cherry red locks. Okay, you were starting to feel a little wierded out by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still looking?\" Jordan asked as he was wiping the fluid off of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly jerked your hair up, allowing your red locks to fly into your face a bit. What was going on? You had to be imaging it. Perhaps Jordan was right about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh....I...uh....\" you fumbled for words as you looked at him, which suddenly made you pause. \"Uh, why does your hair look purple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? What are you talking about?\" Jordan asked. \"And I thought I was asking the questions here. What's with....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan's words were cut off by hair flying into his face as well, the surprise of it making him lose his balance slightly in surprise.</span></div></div>",

It was gorgeous and odd, much like your own bouncy shoulder length red tresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not only that, what should\u2019ve been shaggy and unkempt was straight and beautiful, with loose bangs swept to the side over his forehead and tucked beneath some longer bangs that gently framed his face. It was a very feminine style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude,\u201d he stared at you, his eyes flicking to your hair, \u201cwhat the <i>fuck</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a pair of ruffled pink scrunchies secured his hair into two low, loose pigtails just above his shoulders, just as his purpling tresses reached his hips and stopped, their rapid growth finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you now had heads of hair that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place on a dedicated cosplayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both of your new hairstyles looked wrong, the tresses looked too full, too glossy and well kept, every strand where it was supposed to be no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light surrounding your car slowly dying down stole back your attention from your unnaturally pretty hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light winked out abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Camaro was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude... what the FUCK?!

You were actually kind of on the verge of freaking out. First of all, how in the world did your car just transform like that?! Secondly, how did your hair also just become completely different? You were pretty sure you hadn't drank anything weird over the past few days so this couldn't be a fever dream or anything, and certainly not one you would ever have naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that being said, you slowly turned to Jordan, who was still stunned. Your face blanched as you did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude your eyes!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Jordan said back. \"What about them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, go look!\" you cried back, being louder than you had ever been in your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan ran over to one of the side mirrors similar to what you did, and you could hear his voice hitching in his throat right as he did. His eyes appeared to be...growing bigger? Maybe that wasn't the right word exactly, but they appeared to be becoming brighter and incredibly more expressive. However, what really stood out was how they were tilting, and even taking on an almond shape. But, perhaps most of it, his eyes were turning into those of brilliant green like those of fields. They looked...distinctly Asian for one thing, something that didn't take long for either of you to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They....look Asian....\" you gulped as you looked at Jordan, who turned back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is all this?! I...I must be dreaming!\" he cried out before his wide eyes went even wider. \"A-And it's happening to you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoiled a bit as you heard that, your hands going to your eyes. You rushed over to join Jordan, getting a good spot to look at yourself. Your eyes were becoming very much like Jordans, similar shape and tilt and everything. The only difference being that your own average orbs were starting to take on a purplish-color, as vibrant as anything else you've seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your hair and eyes looked so out of place, like too perfect to be real. They expressed a certain colorfullness that you'd expect more out of...well an anime for one thing. Cosplaying wasn't exactly something you and Jordan did, but this looked far deeper than any you had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think we need to...\" you gulped a bit, shaking a bit in uncertainty. \"We...really need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really try to figure out what's causing this,\" Jordan said back to finish your thought. \"I think we've established we're not dreaming....AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan's cry startled you, but you could see why. His hands were on his face, not looking in pain but certainly something was happening. You wanted to come over and help, but soon you began to feel the same thing on your own face, making you groan a bit. There was no pain, and barely any discomfort either. It was just weird above all else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you looked towards the mirror again the best you could. Both of your heads were appearing to be a slightly different shape, somehow making your new hair even more benefiting. Soft face adorned both of you, with pale pink lips that looked completely sweet. Your noses looked small and cute, with just the right cheekbones and eyebrows. Longer eyelashes complimented your new eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall blushes were even adorning both of your faces, and both looked very natural on smoother skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude....this is seriously messed up...\" spoke Jordan, fear evident.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stared at your face in the mirror, a soft pink blush coating your cheeks. The face that stared back at you was eerily beautiful, with a youthful and cute charm that seemed perfect. Too perfect in fact, so perfect it was unnatural. Your skin was too soft, the shade a perfect shade of pale peach, too smooth, without any blemish, not a freckle or zit. Your nose was so small and dainty, and your lips soft and pink, glimmering with faint gloss. Your hair was too vibrant of a red, so soft and full you couldn't resist touching the long strands that curved delicately around your face. And yet, regardless of your tugging and stroking, every strand returned to it's rightful place, always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, it was your eyes that truly left you breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were huge, almost too big and wide, bearing the typical slightly almond shape of an Asian. Full, dark lashes framed them while your irises gleamed like gemstones, a pure shade of amethyst that couldn't be natural for any human outside of genetic mutation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a girl's face, undeniably. A very very pretty one, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so messed up... so messed up... what the <i>hell </i>is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were basically ogling your face, Jordan was pacing back and forth muttering to himself, aggressively tugging on one of his lengthy purple pigtails while muttering to himself. But, like with your own hair, no matter how hard he tugged at them, they remained perfectly styled, not a hair out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" you said, staring at him worriedly, \"you're freaking yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved to be the wrong thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan's face whipped towards you, anger flashing in beautiful pools of verdant green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm freaking myself out?\" he growled low in his throat, a low and guttural sound that didn't fit his pretty face, \"have you looked at your face in the mirror? Because I have, and I don't recognize the face that stares back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled darkly, \"I look like an damn <i>anime girl</i>, Alex. And so do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right of course, Jordan had a face that was eerily pretty, much like your own. But, in a few key ways, it was subtly different. Whereas your own purple eyes had a slightly more upward tilt at the corners, giving you a sharper look, Jordan's eyes were the opposite. They had a more soft look to them, having a slight downward tilt, and had they not been flashing in anger and irritation, they might've looked somewhat sleepy, almost serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you said with a wince, \"I'm struggling too, but getting wound up and working yourself into a panic ain't helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared you down angrily for a moment before taking a deep, steadying breath, the tension leaving his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said with a sigh, raking his hand through those lovely purple tresses of his, \"I know, but I'm having <i>really </i>hard time processing this, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced, toying with a strand of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This goes against so many natural laws its not even funny. The fact that we have the faces of anime chicks is one thing but we just watched your car changing into something else right in front of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to the little white Toyota, and you grimaced. You were still feeling that sting, but right now there were bigger fish to fry than your lost car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit like that doesn't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kono hareta hi ni mewosamasu\" <sup>Waking up on this fine day</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you turned your eyes to the phone sitting on the workbench, forgotten in the shitstorm that had taken place, as a new song began to play. A cheerful, upbeat tune compared to the softer one that came before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I can't hear that right now,\" Jordan said, squeezing his eyes tightly shut, \"turn it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shatsu ga dokoni mo mitsukaranai\" <sup>Can't find my shirt anywhere</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement and moved to do just that. The song seemed to resonate with you in a strange way, threatening to overwhelm you again. But you shook your head clear of it and picked up your phone and tapped the pause icon on the screen.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Ima sugu gaishutsu suru hitsuy\u014d ga arimasu\" <sup>I need to go out now</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tapped on it again, but the phone refused to cooperate and the cheery, upbeat sound of the young girls singing continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" Jordan murmured, hands pressed over his ears as if he couldn't stand the sound, fingers gripping his hair tightly, \"for the love of god... TURN... IT... OFF...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sonohi wa watashi o matte imasen!\" <sup>The day isn't waiting for me!</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, just give me a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour finger jabbed at the screen. The phone ignited in your hands, a bright white flash nearly blinding you. The bulky, impact proof case slimmed down in your hands, the sturdy black rubber and plastic turning a feminine shade of violet, while a small charm in the shape of a flower attached to a thin cord dangled from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at it in shock.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see all of it, but your new face made your worry all the more expressive, just like something out of an anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jordan asked, turning his head and putting his hands down. The music still seemed to irritate him, but he couldn't keep his hands up forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you said in your shaky voice, holding up your transformed phone. \"I keep hitting pause and it won't do anything. And before you mention it again, it was never having this sort of problem before. It....It's like the thing's possessed or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....given what's going on, maybe that's the case,\" Jordan sighed, hands going to his hips rather femininely but he really didn't care right now. \"Sigh.....God I wish we could do something...but what exactly do we do against something that's supernatural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea...\" you sighed, hand shaking through your cherry red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upbeat song continued to play, a very curious sort of beat and instrumentation going on with it. Almost sounded like something out of a port town from an RPG or something. Honestly, your head wasn't hurting as much as before, but the song continued to enter your heads easily. You looked down at your phone again, noting how smooth your hands looked. You blinked a bit, turning your hand over as you felt it a bit. Whatever happened to your face seemed to be affecting the rest of you as well, erasing any sort of zits and blemishes you had had over the past few months. Through your pants, you couldn't see all of it, but you had to imagine whatever it was was spreading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan blinked at you observing your hands a bit, making him look at his own. Behold, it was happening to him as well, a change he and you were barely even feeling, like something just washing over you. a pale peach shade erasing any rough patches it came across. You kind of wondered what that was doing for other things like what hair you had, but if what you were seeing on your arms was any indication, that wasn't spared either. The sensation as you touched your arms a bit sent a little chill down your spine, a perfect shade that almost gleamed in the sunlight getting through into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever this was, it was spreading and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose breaking your phone is out of the question,\" Jordan suggested with another groan, wishing he could shut that thing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, given everything going on, I get the feeling nothing would happen,\" you suggested. \"Plus, Mom would probably kill....Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from what you were feeling on your skin, you were suddenly feeling a tingly sensation from your t-shirt. Its slight looseness appeared to be conforming slightly, just to be a little more snug as the color looked like it was bleaching, Eyes widening a bit, you inadvertently took a step back as you looked down at your changing shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.....now it's on my shirt...\" you said in a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too....\" Jordan said, a little louder in his like he was more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, both of your shirts seemed to be experiencing similar changes, with shirts becoming more fitting and bleaching colors. Furthermore, your sleeves seemed to be moving down your arms, going past your elbows. However, one distinct thing that happened was that both of your necklines were actually closing in around your necks, actually forming up against them as they folded over into some collars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Formal wear or something?\" Jordan asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell you,\" you replied back. \"I know as much as you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was going on, the tingling sensation was moving to both of your pants, making the material ruffle and flutter a bit on your skin. Looking down past your shirt, you could feel a small breeze on your ankles, showing that they were exposed to the air. Getting a closer look, you could see pale skin beginning to emerge from shortening pant legs. Another distinctive feature was that the color was starting to change, with certain shades coming in certain places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and to top it off, your socks looked a little longer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god....don't tell me this is going to be a skirt,\" Jordan whined, hands on his soft cheeks now. \"This is insane. Are we seriously becoming some kind of anime chicks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded so ridiculous, yet what could you say to prove him wrong. Your brain felt like mush trying to figure all of this out, and you kind of wondered why you weren't freaking out more. Perhaps it was just the idea that something inevitable was happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you wanted to rage against the inevitable, that wasn't going to help you with your predicament. The playlist on your phone continued to march on as one song ended and another soon began. You tugged uselessly at the audio cord, but it remained stubbornly plugged into the headphone jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ready?!\" </i>a chorus of young girls cheered, followed by a harmonic riff from electric guitars, giving it a more rock and roll theme compared to the more pop-sounding song previously playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan shared a look of dread. No, no you were assuredly <i>not </i>ready, but the girls that were singing their hearts out for this song probably didn't care what you or Jordan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mattenai yo...Love!!\" <sup>I won't wait for you...Love!!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the music began to pick up the pace, you felt the same tingling that had affected your clothing before return with vengeance. Your sleeves lengthened further to your wrists and conformed closer to your arms, removing any sort of bagginess and creating a far more form fitting look. Your \"t-shirt\" seemed to split and tear down the center, exposing a crisp white button down shirt that had definitely not been there moments earlier. A pair of shiny gold buttons quickly pulled both halves of your \"shirt\" back together  while another pair emerged from your stiffening shirt cuffs, from which a hint of your new white button down peeked out. New pockets seemed to open up, one along the right pectoral and two on either sides of your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep blue shade swiftly bled through and devoured any trace of the black there had been previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is this a <i>blazer</i>?\" Jordan asked with an uneasy look as he raised his own lengthening sleeves, also adorned with shiny gold <br>\r\nbuttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mitsuketa! Kimi wa sabishii hitomi datta\" <sup>I found you! Your eyes looked lonely!</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be left behind, your pants continued to shorten, more and more pale peach skin becoming visible with every inch. Like your face and hands, the skin on your legs was soft as silk and utterly hairless, devoid of any blemish or imperfection. It looked far too perfect, seeming to gleam with a healthy shine from the lights overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pant legs seemed to broaden, slowly merging together into a singular sleeve of softening fabric, which felt more like cotton than the previously more durable denim. The previously uniform shape folded into tidy pleats as the faded blue shade darkened, shot through with a grid like pattern of darker and lighter blues trimmed with red strips, resembling a plaid texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. oh <i>no</i>...\" you said, horrified realization dawning on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan didn't say a word, looking in horrified fascination as his own skirt, for it could be nothing else at this point, pulled itself up passed his pale, hairless knees with no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kodou ga natteru \"te ni irenasai\" to\" <sup>Your heartbeat's calling out, saying \"take me into your hands\"</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour black socks thinned, clinging more to your legs more closely before shooting up to rest in the middle of your calves, looking more like some stockings than \"socks\". Your boots followed suit, their bulky brown forms compacting down, the laces unwinding and vanishing, into a pair of simple black leather flats, which were then polished to a perfect shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, you knew <i>exactly </i>what this was. How could you not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Jordan and found him looking utterly horrified as he tugged at the sinfully short pleated, blue and red plaid miniskirt than sat around his upper thighs. His own boots had formed into the same shiny leather flats you now wore, but his socks had crawled up further than yours, looking like a pair of thigh high stockings than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Haigo ni ayumi yoru suriru ga tamaranai\" <sup>Stepping up in the background, the thrill is unbearable!</sup><br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Jordan,\" you spoke slowly, tugging on your own miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at you, green eyes wider than usual. A green ribbon striped with blue bloomed into existence around his collar, tying itself into a tidy bow. An identical bow soon graced your own neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a school uniform,\" you said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely stared at you in horror, still fruitlessly tugging on his miniskirt as if to coax some more length out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here you were, your pale, hairless bodies clad in the telltale blazer, blouse, and miniskirt worn by schoolgirls in nearly every anime you'd ever seen. But as much as your faces and skin radiated that perfect beauty that personified the archytpe of a young anime girl, the the identical schoolgirl outfits you'd been forced into were hardly flattering to your tall, lanky figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for how long might that be?<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Nerai sadametara nigasanai kara nigasanai kara My target!!\" <sup>Because once I've chosen my target, you can't run away. You can't run away, my target!!</sup></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to get help, somehow, before this got <i>much, much worse.</i></span></div></div>",

He truly looked like a worried anime girl, his new features almost adding a sort-of exaggerated feel to his movements. You couldn't help but wonder if you looked similar in some way. You couldn't blame him in any way of course. Honestly, you were surprised you could even form a cohesive thought right now. All that reminded you guys of your male selves were your height, chest, and groin. Oh, and voices too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who knows how long that would last. The songs were continuing to play without end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh.....\" Jordan whined a bit, shaking heavily. \"Why can't those.....darn songs just end already.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there were dozens of them,\" you said, making Jordan widen his eyes at you. \"Yeah, when I was downloading the CD, I caught at least a few dozen songs. It could probably just keep going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....this can't be....not...not a schoolgirl...\" Jordan looked like he could crumble at any second. \"I thought I was done with high school....I can't be one again.....Kore wa okori enai!\" {superThis can't be happening!}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your eyes and Jordan's eyes widened in horror, and Jordan's hands clasped over his mouth instantly, eyes as wide as could possibly be. That....That wasn't English. That was undoubtedly Japanese, and even more so, in that moment, both you and he could understand what the words meant as if they were in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, in that instant, he had the high-pitched voice of an anime girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please tell me you can still talk...\" you said, walking over slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....hello.....\" Jordan gingerly tested a couple words, speaking in English again and sounding closer to his usual self. \"Oh god....what if it's taking me over....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's probably only a matter of time before...it happens to me too...\" you got quieter near the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as questioning your manner of speech was troubling, you both had more to worry about once a certain pressure hit your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jordan cringed a little as you felt something strange. It was like....like something trying to push you, making you more compact in some way. Like everything else, it didn't hurt, but it felt strange for sure, and you found it hard to move with the sensation on you. In a way, it was kind of like some kind of gravity forcing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to keep your eyes open, but you did anyway, allowing you to see what was happening. That being....a lot of things getting taller, making you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think we're getting shorter....\" you trembled. \"Oh god....everything.....subete ga \u014dkiku natte imasu.\" <sup>everything is getting bigger</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped in a little squeak at the sudden inflection coming out of your mouth. Oh no, it was just like Jordan as you thought would happen. Was it really going to take you over or something? Was Japanese all you were going to be able to speak?! How would you even be able to communicate in this country?! No doubt Jordan was thinking similarly among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pressure finally left, leaving you both a little short of breath from feeling like being packed into a can of sardines. The loss of height was apparent though, with much of your lankiness being taken away. It was hard to tell for sure, but you could tell you both were as far away from 6 feet tall as possible, much closer to 5 feet. Well, to be exact, you were around 5'3\" or so, while Jordan looked just a teeny bit shorter at 5'2\". A couple centimeters were all that separated you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver lining that the clothes, more importantly the skirt, felt just a bit better with your new height hardly compared to the fear that you both looked the part of high-school girls from all outside appearances.</span></div></div>",

He really did look lovely, you admitted privately, the well kept purple tresses went well with his vivid green eyes and pale skin. Even on his small, but boyishly uncurved body, his schoolgirl's uniform fit him snugly, even if there was currently nothing really to flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you both possessed sufficiently short, petite statures, beautiful faces and hair befitting young Japanese anime girls, your bodies still had notes of boyishness in their shapes. You still had no discernible curves, your hips still narrow, your legs still too thin and lanky, and your chests still flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother song began to play and both of you tensed, bracing yourselves for whatever was about to happen. The pounding of electronic bass filled the air, but no vocals came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you ready?\" you asked grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan looked at you, dread evident in those pretty green eyes. He squeezed them tightly shut, not wanting to look at what was going to happen to you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song began to pick up the pace, ready to drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the music stopped mid note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, some of the tension leaving you. You looked at Jordan, who opened one eye slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... this part of the song?\" he asked warily, tugging on one of his pigtails nervously. It was a strange, disturbingly feminine habit he seemed to have picked up ever since they'd grown in. You'd noticed other things as well, and not just with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had also seemingly picked up the habit of twirling some of the strands that curved around your face when you got nervous or unsettled. You both also seemed to want to rest your hands on your hips more than before, as if there was a curve there you didn't possess... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisturbing. You just hoped that little mannerisms and such were all the mental changes you were going to experience, the thought of you and Jordan ceasing to be, well, <i>yourselves </i>was a sobering one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you said, moving carefully towards your phone as if afraid it would suddenly blast you with sound, \"if it was, it would've started already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared down at the screen and warily tapped it. The screen lit dimly up, the icon for low battery flashing across it. You felt as if a great weight had lifted off yours shoulders. Finally, things might be turning around for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dead, the phone ran out of juice!\" you giggled slightly in relief \"<i>Yatta</i>! I must've forgotten to charge it last night before I went to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact you had just screamed <i>yatta </i> instead of an elated \"Yes!\", you tugged on the audio cable and, surprise surprise, it came loose without issue. You smiled widely, pointedly ignoring just how lovely it looked on your face in the reflection on the phone's darkened screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, Jordan remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe now the changes will stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan made a little noise, a tiny squeak like that of a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around quizzically, wondering why he had made such a noise and found him standing there with his arms crossed over his chest and his fingers holding his shoulder in a death grip. He was as pale as a ghost and had a look of mortified horror on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up? Did you hear me?\" you asked him curiously, \"I said maybe now that music stopped we might stop changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i>,\" He looked up at you, his big green eyes looking even huger, \"its not <i>stopping</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly lowered his arms slightly and his chest bulged out into a pair of rapidly growing lumps under his blazer. The blazer stretched and shifted to accommodate the growing breasts, for they could be nothing else, never losing its well fitted shape despite their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are,\" your mouth went dry, \"are those <i>breasts</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded slowly before his eyes dropped to your own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft tickle in your own chest had you paling and turning away from Jordan's wide eyes. Your previously flat chest swelled and grew into a pair of soft lumps under your own blazer, quickly edging past a small A-cup and working their way into the uppers, then passed that into the B-cup range. Like with Jordan's blazer, yours shifted to accommodate the new growths, pulling snug across your chest until the gentle swells of your new breasts under it were clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath hitching, you undid the buttons on your blazer, then your blouse and carefully pulled it apart. A modest cut of pale, perky B-cup cleavage rested comfortably in a lacy, red bra that went with your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a high pitched squeak of embarrassment, not unlike the one Jordan made, and quickly fumbled with your buttons to hide your chest from your own prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossing your arms over your chest protectively, you looked over your shoulder at Jordan and found him staring at his own chest blushing bright red. You gaped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-big...\" he whispered, \"Karera wa totemo \u014dk\u012b...\" <sup>They're so big...</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, whereas your own breasts had stopped midway in the B-cup range, Jordan's had not, instead shooting past it, well into the C-cups and then possibly just cresting into the D-cup range before stopping. They looked quite large on his tiny frame, their significant cleavage presented to you in a lacy purple bra that, like your own, went well with his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a brief, uncharacteristic swell of envy as you looked away from Jordan's own more substantial cleavage to your own chest, patting it's much smaller additions angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame... so lame...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jordan was stunned into silence as he was looking at this. He suddenly had a bountiful pair of breasts on his chest, and not just any breasts, but big ones that seemed to just be perfect in any way, lacking any sort of realistic take on them. He wasn't sure where he was getting that idea from, but that seemed to be the case. Everything about these female forms just screamed \"anime\" to the point of being perfectly maintained. Heck, they wouldn't look out of place in a real illustrated anime world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up though, he saw you looking to the side a bit, Your cheeks were puffed in a pouty expression, and he could faintly hear your words of \"lame...\" to yourself, even turning your back to him as you were patting your chest a bit. Jordan raised his eyebrows a bit, wondering just what you were turning around for. You were a little bit shy on some things but why now? Honestly, for some reason, Jordan was getting this uncharacteristically curious vibe, bringing his hands down from his own breasts. Almost on autopilot, he creeped up to where you were, back still turned for some reason. It was like Jordan has this...strange urge that had to be quelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in one fast motion, his hands wrapped around you and groped your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!\" you squeaked out really loud, red rushing across your whole face. \"Nanishiteruno?!\" <sup>What are you doing?!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen'nasai! <sup>Sorry!</sup> Jordan cried right back out, face beat red but not nearly as much as yours. \"Anata... Anata no mono wa totemo ch\u012bsaidesu.\" <sup>You...yours are so small.</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure which was flustering you more. The fact that you had breasts, the fact that your friend was touching said breasts, or the fact that you could understand that you just got called small-breasted or something like that. You know, you weren't exactly the bragging type, but somehow the idea of having such small breasts made you feel really indignant. I mean, that wasn't fair right? Why did Jordan have such big breasts?! <i>Baka!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you really had much of an idea of what was going on really, your bodies acting in ways you couldn't understand. However, you doubted anyone wouldn't have heard all the yelling between the two of you right now. That felt pretty embarrassing...and why hadn't Jordan let go yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let me go!\" you squeaked out. You looked behind you, trying to get a look at Jordan. His face was indescribable, and you couldn't figure what was going through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that kind of went out the window as the door to the garage suddenly opened, making you both pause. Immediately, you could tell it was your mother, Heidi, especially from the huge figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything....alright?\" Heidi finished after a pause, seeing....two Japanese girls with one being groped by the other? That...wasn't exactly normal. \"Excuse me, but who are the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...w-well....\" your face was still red. What should you say? Oh <i>Kami</i>, this was so weird....for crying out loud even your thoughts sounded different! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello miss,\" Jordan said, surprisingly calm. \"Alex has really grown, hasn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the heck was THAT supposed to mean?! And how did B-cup breasts mean he had grown? They were small compared....no no no! Those shouldn't be important period! Ugh, stay on track! Suffice to say, your mom was just as confused, if not a little weirded out by two girls acting intimate in her own garage. Come to think of it...wait....where did that Toyota come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay just...where's Alex and Jordan?\" Heidi asked as she walked forward. \"And is that your car? If you're not acquainted with them, then you should leave. I don't want to have to call the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were totally freaked now. No, that would be a terrible idea! How in the world could you explain any of this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, don't do that!\" you cried back. \"We...uh....Watashitachiha Arekkusu to J\u014ddandesu.\" <sup>We are Alex and Jordan.</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Heidi asked, perplexed and wondering if she was being messed with. \"Look, this is going nowhere,\" she added as she was bringing out her phone. Probably as a precaution as she wasn't sure what these \"girls\" were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama janai!\" <sup>No mom!</sup> you cried out suddenly, getting away from Jordan to grab your mom's arm. You know, agitation seemed to bring these Japanese words out more often, but that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi again looked perplexed as you grabbed her arm. However, she didn't get a chance to talk after that, as a bright light shone from the spot where you grabbed her, making everyone present cry out. The light took no time at all in engulfing Heidi, and you were treated to an astonishing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nantekotta.....\" you said with your hands on your mouth, wondering to <i>Kami</i> what you had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sight in front of you was the equivalent of watching a balloon deflate. Your mom's absolutely huge size shrunk like all the air and fat was leaving her, like someone had poked a hole in her or something. It looked like some bizarre transformation scene complete with fluffy background to add extra flair. Heidi's limbs flailed a bit as everything about her shrunk, from overall size to bust to just about everything until she was gaining a figure not so different from your own, complete with a bust size just like your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the big changes came afterwards. Heidi's hair was going from its usual red to a sort of orange/light brown color that looked as perfect as yours and Jordan's. Immediately, said hair styled itself into a side ponytail, tied with a bright pink ribbon. Her eyes turned from their usual green to a brilliant sea blue, them changing form into the same almond-sized and expressive eyes you sported. From there, her clothes rapidly changed from the dress she had before, splitting into different parts. The top turned into a white short-sleeved shirt. A sleeveless pale-blazer formed over it, complete with blue bow like your own. The bottom half shifted into the exact same skirt as well, completing what looked like a summer version of what you wore now. The ensemble completed itself with similar dark socks like yours and the same shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, before stood before you appeared to be another young Japanese schoolgirl, even baring the same uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom?\" you asked gingerly.</span></div></div>",

Her skin a fair peach without any blemishes or imperfections of any kind, her orangey hair perfectly coiffed and tied in a cute side ponytail, her eyes too deep and expressive, the list went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the newly minted orangette was staring vacantly ahead, seemingly in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll from a <i>touch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan, who had seemingly snapped out of his perverted episode, was staring at the girl in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cthat\u2019s... that\u2019s not good...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t say anything in response, still to stunned and horrified by what had just taken place. Your \u201cmom\u201d was still looking incredibly dazed but how long was that going to last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had hoped that no one would bother you and Jordan in the garage for this very reason.

He had been the one to start <i>groping</i><br>\r\nyou out of the blue in some out of character bout of madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you, huge green eyes gleaming with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou touched her,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou touched her and she changed, I touched your car and it changed, you touched your phone and it <i>changed</i>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d you breathed out, looking at your hands like someone had just handed you a loaded gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think... I think it\u2019s like some kind of virus,\u201d he said quietly as he began to once again tug aggressively on one of his pigtails, \u201cits transmitted by touch and from what I can gather, the people and things that are touched by us seem to change quicker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, staring at the clump of glossy purple hair in his tiny fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur changes have been really dragging but everything else seems to change in a flash, pun not intended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the frozen form of your \u201cmom\u201d who, thankfully, seemed to still be in La-la land. Whether or not her brain was still playing catch up with her body or something more sinister remained to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what were you going to do now?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just when you were about to respond to Jordan's words, a suddenly pressure erupted down below, all around your groan and hips. You could immediately tell what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.....\" you groaned, dreading what was to come. What would really make you a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the rest, it wasn't painful. If anything, it disturbingly felt...kind of like pleasure, which didn't make you feel good about it at all. You could tell Jordan had exactly the same things, his face all worried as he had hands on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man.....this is going to suck,\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why? You're probably going to be bigger than me again,\"</i> a thought went through your mind, making you shake your head. Sheesh, this was no time for such thoughts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, nothing could prepare you for the sensation as it started. Your eyes widened in surprise as you felt your hip bones shifting, beginning to adjust to a whole new frame fit for childbirth. The very idea of that though sent your mind in a whole other direction that felt just as disturbing. You had wondered about it from time to time as most guys would, but the idea of you being on the receiving end, becoming pregnant and carrying a child through to birth? Nothing about that felt good, especially when you heard all the stories from other women about it but that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath hitched in your throat as your hips continued to expand, growing out to a nice shape that complimented what your figure had been building up to this whole time. The skirt began to fit perfectly well against them, still way too short for your liking. Sheesh, how did anyone really wear these? Well, in addition to that, the pressure went into your butt as well, making you put your hands on your cheeks as they began to grow as well. Much like your hips, they were growing to a complimentary size, not super big but still more than what you had before, making your skirt fit just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spared a glance towards Jordan, who was feeling the same thing. His hips and butt were growing out all the same, and they were growing to compliment his figure all the same. To your surprise though, his hips actually grew out around the same as yours, if nothing else, perhaps just a little bit smaller. Honestly, you weren't sure how you could ever tell the difference, but something in you just got this good feeling of having just a little bit of a smaller waist and bigger hips than Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, for crying out loud, snap out of it!\"</i> you shouted in your head. This wasn't the time for getting all angsty on girl sizes. You shouldn't even care anyway. Ugh, it was all so stupid! <i>B-Baka!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that could scarcely prepare either of you for the next change, and the fact that it was right on your groins told the whole story. Jordan looked incredibly distressed by it as he should be, and you probably had a similar look. Part of you wanted to pull your skirt up to look, but felt too afraid to do to. You pressed a hand to your skirt, already feeling your thing rapidly shrinking. You had lost in feeling in it already, no doubt thanks to the change in your bones earlier that made it useless. All the while there was a feeling of rearranging going on inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect of motherhood was growing itself inside of your body, making you feel all the more stressed out on it. However, before long, you couldn't feel anything but a flat surface. Out of morbid curiosity, you pulled your skirt up a little, seeing nothing but a smooth surface covered in red panties like your bra. Likewise for Jordan, he had purple panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...you were both girls now. At least...you were where it counted, leaving you both in silence. It was expected at this point, but no less shocking to the mind.</span></div></div>",

You prodded at the smooth surface of your red panties feeling nothing but the faint creases and folds of soft vaginal lips in place of what had once resisted there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with that feeling of surreality came a sense of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male genitalia that you had been born with and carried for nearly two decades had been converted into a fully functioning set of organs that were purpose built for conceiving, carrying, and birthing children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distinctive cognitive dissonance between your now entirely female body and the very much still male mind that sat in your skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose disturbing thoughts of childbirth aside, you felt your lips instinctively curl slightly upwards as your hands moved away from your panties and began to feel your longer, shapelier legs and trace up your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the broader, more rounded curves of your hips, the full heart shape of your butt, the perfect thickness of your smooth thighs and calves, and the slim dip of your waist and felt that sense of triumph that seemed to lurk in the depths of your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou might have bigger breasts than me, but my figure is better, my legs too~\u201d</i> you thought with a smug grin as you eyed Jordan, who was busy inspecting his new \u201cgoods\u201d with a cherry red blush on his, <i>her</i>, face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smug grin froze on your face. What the hell was the matter with you?! Why did it matter who had the better figure or the bigger breasts anyway?! It\u2019s not like either of you wanted a \u201cfigure\u201d at all, let alone breasts! Why were you being such a <i>baka</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut it\u2019s true though, my figure is <b>great</b>~\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kami</i>, you could somehow just hear the <i>tilde<br>\r\n</i> in that thought!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dragged the smug, treasonous thoughts you had just had a moment ago to the deepest corner of your mind and smothered it with a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you turned back to Jordan, who was shifting from foot to foot, inadvertently cocking her hips side to side to accommodate her new balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs... is yours gone, too?\u201d You asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, <i>she</i>, nodded mutely, grabbing a small fistful of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed heavily through your nose. You both were girls, very lovely looking ones, in every way that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-ah...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heads both whipped back to the elephant in the room, your \u201cmom\u201d\u2019s dazed figure. The newly minted orangette shook her head, her side ponytail swinging through the air. Clear blue eyes blinked owlishly at the both of you before she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blanched. It was a bright, wonderful thing like rude sunshine through your blinds at the crack of dawn, full of energy and good cheer. Not at all like the tired smiles your mom usually have her children after working all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkaa-San?\u201d You stammered, \u201cI... I mean, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl\u2019s smile only seemed to grow, impossibly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Ohayo!\u201d She chirped, her voice a high pitched thing radiating a sense of optimism and energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, those clear blue eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I zone out again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Jordan, and found her staring back at you uneasily. She stepped forward a bit and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-miss Tucker?\u201d She tried slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \u201cmom\u2019s\u201d nose scrunched up cutely and she shook her head, sending her ponytail swinging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope! Call me Honoka-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stilled, had your mom lost herself in her transformation? The thought filled you with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom? It\u2019s me, Asu... ah, Alex. Do you remember me?\u201d You dearly hoped so. You decided to ignore the slip in the pronunciation of your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \u201cmom\u201d smiled at you, \u201cof course, silly! You\u2019re my cute musume! But call me Honoka-chan. Calling me that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose scrunched up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... feels a bit weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but Okaa-!\u201d She silenced you by putting a finger on your lips and stepping very close, her big blue eyes unblinkingly staring into your own purple ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-o-n-o-k-a-C-h-a-n.\u201d She repeated firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inwardly grimaced but complied. It seemed like this girl, your \u201cmom\u201d, or whatever she wanted to call herself, wasn\u2019t going to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonoka-chan...\u201d you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled brightly again and clapped her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Was that so hard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. Yes it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, your \u201cmom\u201d seemed to have become an anime schoolgirl much like the ones you and Jordan had turned into, but had also held onto her place as your mother. It didn\u2019t make a lick of sense to you, but \u201cHonoka-chan\u201d seemed like she was the stubborn sort and wasn\u2019t going to accept anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*okaa-san = mother<br>\r\n**musume =daughter</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This left both you and Jordan in a tougher spot. What were you both to do now? You both were anime girls now, with the only thing sort of left being your voices, and your mom had now fully become one and seemed to think of herself squarely as \"Honoka-chan\". Not to mention other things like your phone, car, and Jordan's theory that touching stuff seemed to carry similar transformations like a virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it kind of sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Jordan mumbled, as you could see how distraught she looked. Compared to how she could swear up a storm when agitated, she almost looked demure now, just twirling his hair a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....don't know....\" you mumbled back. <i>Kami</i>, how could you handle this now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka on the other hand didn't seem troubled in the slightest, humming to herself while rolling back and forth on the balls of her feet, making her ponytail bobble up and down as she did. It was one of the most adorable things you had ever seen, and you'd likely enjoy it if not for the current situation. You really couldn't get a grasp on her mentality. She still seemed to believe she was your mom, yet didn't act like it. Asking you to call her \"Honoka-chan\" almost sounded more like something to call a friend rather than your own mom even though she was about your age now. Ugh, it made no sense what so ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That car is so <i>kawaii</i>!\" she squealed, skipping over to your new Toyota. \"Looks all new too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that's...not really a good thing...\" Jordan mumbled before turning to you. \"Seriously man, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I have a better idea?\" you spat out. \"I wouldn't know how to handle becoming some anime girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Honoka giggled as she jumped between you two. \"The day's too short to stand around moping! Ah! I got a great idea! We should get the others. We could have some family fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Susie and Victoria involved? Well, to be honest, Victoria becoming some nice Japanese girl actually wasn't the worst idea. Heck, you could tell Jordan was thinking that over right now, and he didn't seem too troubled. For your little <i>im\u014dto</i> though, that was a little tricky. Would your entire house be full of high school aged girls now? How would they pay for the house and everything? Ugh, too many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka certainly didn't seem troubled though, humming to herself as she continued to bounce. As she did though, she ended up backing into the table that held the stereo and tools and everything by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, whoops.\" she smiled, sticking her tongue out at her oopsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as she did though, that same bright light began to appear, spreading across the table. Yet, it didn't stop there. No, to your surprise, the light continued from the bench towards just about everywhere in the garage, sweeping over anything and everything. You weren't sure what exactly was happening, but you looked towards the bench which made your eyes widen. All the tools you guys used were vanishing. Actually just about every piece of equipment used on cars was vanishing, the garage getting completely clean as the light washed over it all. The stereo seemed to get an upgrade though, becoming a little fancier while turning white with some sparkles. As the light was dying down, the place looked completely immaculate, not a thing out of place and cleaned still it sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...now you knew you couldn't stay here, not if every single thing was at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we need to go!\" you cried out, not wanting to risk anything else and grabbing Honoka's hand, pulling her along to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked, not sounding offended but rather curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're....going to visit Daniel,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a while to remember, but Daniel was basically viewed as a genius. He also happened to be your cousin by the way, living in a mansion a little ways away. Honestly, you didn't visit him often, but he was basically the smartest guy you knew. If he didn't know anything about this, well who would then. Jordan actually hit her forehead once you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! That guy!\" Jordan said. \"I forgot about him. That brainiac you don't like to visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't like him,\" you said as you closed the door to Honoka's seat. \"It's just that it's kind of awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was way better than here, so you guess you both had a plan. Jordan plopped into the passenger's seat while you got into the driver's seat. Hey, it was still your car even when it was different. If there was any positive to this, the car was really comfy. Guess it's kind of a silver lining to this whole situation. Hopefully now you could spare the rest of your house from changing any more. Before long, you had backed the car out of the garage, closed the garage door, and began driving along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do remember how to get there, right?\" Jordan asked, hearing Honoka still humming in the back, swaying back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know Kaori-chan,\" you spoke practically automatically, much like you usually acted when you didn't really want to answer questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that ended up with the both of you widening your eyes in shock at what you just said. You just called \"Kaori-chan\" like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean......\" you blushed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, this was not getting any better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you drove, you tried to forget the fact that you had called your best friend by another name. Kaori was about the <i>furthest </i>possible thing from Jordan that you could get, a quintessentially Japanese name for a Japanese girl. You hadn't even meant to say it, it just kind of slipped out, as if somewhere in between your brain and your mouth the name you had meant to say had, quite literally, gotten lost in translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact that there had been some <i>disturbingly </i>Japanese-sounding thoughts in your head here and there, there had been several other instances of that sort of hiccup that you could remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMom? It\u2019s me, Asu... ah, Alex. Do you remember me?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you had been about to say then, it wasn't your name as you knew it. Alex certainly did not start with <i>Asu</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo,\" Kao-, no <i>Jordan</i>, spoke slowly, \"are we not going to talk about what you just said to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you responded immediately, \"No we are not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour purple haired friend shifted in her seat with an uncomfortable look on her lovely face. You could only imagine what was going through her head right now. Jordan had always been a really logical person, and everything that had happened to him, or rather her, since she had shown up at your house was decidedly not logical at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" Honoka's high, peppy voice called from the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced back at her in the rearview mirror. You were still having a really, really hard time associating your mom with the pretty orangette swaying back and forth in the back seat of your not-Camaro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not yet, Oka-, I mean, Honoka-chan...\" you responded, wincing at the slip of the tongue, \"we'll be there in about a half an hour so please be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka pouted, \"but I'm booooored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced, Honoka seemed to be the hyperactive, bubbly sort. You should've guessed that sitting still for even relatively short periods of time might be an issue for someone like her, who seemed to be moving or doing something at any given moment. The last thing you wanted was for her to wander off and cause chaos by touching things and spreading whatever <i>thing </i>this was. Calling it a virus didn't seem correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... just amuse yourself, onegai,\" Jordan gave a you a sharp glance at the verbal fumble you just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka frowned, her nose scrunching up adorably, before she gave that radiant smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I sing a song?\" she asked, blue eyes practically sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan shared a grim look. There was no telling what sort of effect Honoka's singing might have on things given the fact that everything that had happened so far seemed to stem from the bizarre songs from the J-pop CD that you had found in your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd... prefer if you didn't...\" you said with a wince, \"it's distracting and I need to focus on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka looked incredibly put out, like a puppy that had been denied a treat. You almost felt bad, almost. But as much as you wanted to keep your mom, Honoka, happy, you had best err on the side of caution until you talked to Daniel. If there was anyone that could help you, it would be Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Him\",</i> you thought pessimistically, <i>\"or the fucking CDC.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and you had never been spectacularly close, given your awkward natures but you bonded over your mutual disdain for the teeming masses and your bitchy sisters. Your cousin Christina was just an older, hotter Victoria, as if such a thing was possible. Though, if you could remember correctly, your Aunt, Uncle and Christina had gone away somewhere on vacation and left the monstrous art-deco ancestral Hewitt manor all to Daniel for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you hoped so. You didn't want to encounter <i>anyone </i>else until you figured this out, let alone any more of your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed down on the gas pedal a bit more, easing some more speed from the growling little four cylinder engine that sat where a giant fire-breathing V8 should've been. <i>Kami</i>, this car was so <i>slow </i>compared to your Camaro, which had been a barely street-legal monster. You were still feeling the effects of that particular loss, the wound was definitely still very raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can I hum?\" Honoka whined, looking downright pitiful in the rear view mirror, an adorable pout on her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, looking to Jordan for permission. Wary green eyes stared back at you before she nodded slowly with a grimace. You had to placate her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just keep it quiet, OK? We're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \"mom\" smiled brightly and began swaying back and forth again, a melodic hum coming from her closed lips. Privately, you thought it sounded lovely and you were sure that anything that Honoka sang would likely sound just as wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed the accelerator down more. You needed to pick up the pace, there was no telling how much worse this could get and how much it could spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try slowing down a bit, maybe?\" Jordan hissed at you, her eyes carefully scanning the road ahead, \"Are you trying to get pulled over?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm not going that fast,\" you said back. Seriously, you were only....10 miles above the limit. Could be worse right? You had handled that in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan huffed a bit, leaning to one side and using her hand to prop her head up. Well, if anything happened, it wasn't like she'd get in trouble. It was your car. Though, did this new car come with any identification? Boy, things could go south quickly if you got arrested, especially with the idea of \"touching\" something right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the conversation died down, with the only noise being Honoka's humming, which was to be fully honest very pleasant. It was...almost calming in a sense. Without getting too sappy, it was a very angelic voice, only further enhanced by her appearance and bouncy personality. You weren't sure if that was a good thing or not honestly, but it was the only sense of peace you had since the whole thing started. So, Honoka's sweet humming was all that was heard for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you made a red light stop and Jordan noticed something.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Asuk-uh, <i>Alex</i>,\" Now it was Jordan's turn to nearly slip up. \"That look different to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" you said back, before following Jordan's fingers. \"Oh.....no.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious little signs across the intersection were starting to look different, with many of them changing shape and even changing color. However, one big difference was the emergence of giant Japanese characters appearing on them, the signs becoming brighter and quite frankly more noticeable than the rather small signs of old. Actually, in addition to all of that, more signs were appearing on the street as well on the walking sections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, you had no problem reading it all as if it made perfect sense. Even the names of the streets were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Honoka-chan,\" Jordan said, momentarily pausing at using that name. \"We should tell her to stop,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...we shouldn't....\" you said, looking back at her. She hadn't noticed anything and continued to peacefully hum. \"It's just signs after all. And...I don't want to make her miserable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're too nice sometimes,\" Jordan pouted before looking a little wistful. \"Still, guess that's not a bad thing. You've always had a good moral compass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess that counted as a compliment, though you weren't sure if that was Jordan or <i>Kaori-chan</i> talking there. In any case, you got going once the light went green, and you went right back to the speed you had before. It was no speed you couldn't handle though, even if it was 10 miles above the speed limit. It you could shave a few minutes off, it would make things all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SIREN!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tell-tale alarm of a police car echoed through your ears, and you looked back to see such a car. You could tell you were the target from how it was acting, making you groan. Jordan flashed a \"I told you so\" look back your way, making you pout a bit which didn't mean much on such an angelic face as yours. In any case, you pulled over to the side, to a good place out of the way, and the police car followed you. You sighed, awaiting what this was going to entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day ladies,\" the man said as he approached, being very cordial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...help you officer?\" you asked slowly, feeling quite nervous now. You know, could the officer even understand you? You could hardly tell now whenever you flopped back and forth between English and Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you aware of how fast you were going? I clocked you at about 15 over,\" the man said, not overly stern but you could tell he meant business. \"Can I see some identification, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 over? When did that happen? You thought for sure you kept it rather decent. Guess your speed must have gotten away from you for a time. Oh great. Neither Jordan or Honoka had said anything so far, though you could imagine Jordan being grateful it wasn't his car. In any case though, you went and grabbed your wallet, which by the say looked a hell of a lot more cutesy right now. Eh, kind of par for the course now, not that it made you feel any better though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were so focused on that little annoyance that you thrust your card out. The police officer grabbed it, but you thrusted your hand so much that you made contact with the man's palm at the same time. It was that contact that made your eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh....\" you said as you slowly moved your hand away from the contacted point with the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yokunai...\" <sup>Not good</sup> Jordan said with eyes equally wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka's humming actually stopped at that point, curious at what was happening and why her musume looked so troubled. She turned her head over and leaned to get a better look but didn't say anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer began looking at your ID, but you could already tell the damage was done. A bright bit of light was coming where you touched the man, making you gulp as you knew what was coming. It wasn't as fast as Honoka's change, but you could begin to see the man light up a little all the same. From atop his head, his short hair began to flow down his back before turning a purplish color. It was more or less between your transformation and Honoka's in terms of speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time the man opened his eyes, they were turning a vibrant green, becoming larger and the same distinctive Japanese shape as yours.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't help but stare at the officer as he scrutinized you license but you didn't dare say a word. Short cut dirty blond hair had rapidly graduated to an exotic shade of purple somewhere between maroon and violet and had grown long enough to brush his waist. A shallow part had formed just off center of his forehead while his lengthening bangs swept off to both sides, curling up ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Kaori's, no <i>Jordan's</i>, own soft and serene looking green eyes, the officer's now had a sharper tilt and had a slightly blue tinge swimming in their verdant depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his newly grown purple hair and sharp, but distinctly feminine looking eyes contrasting with his very masculine features, the officer certainly cut a very odd looking figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the officer said, \"I'm going to go run your information, I'll be back in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, those newly grown tresses swaying with the moment. For just a moment, the man looked very confused, reaching up to touch those odd purple strands before he seemed to shake himself out of it. You noticed a small black beauty mark burn itself into the skin below his right eye. He began to walk back to his squad car and you saw him stumble slightly and a brief flicker of light cover his form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure, but had the officer's shoes just grow heels?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the officer shut the door to his squad car, you frantically turned to Jordan, who was looking at you with a horrified expression. Honoka looked perturbed by your troubled looks. You weren't sure if she understood what was happening or if whatever force was at work kept her blissfully ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka!\" Jordan hissed quietly as she leaned in close, the wonderful smell of vanilla filling your nose, \"you touched him! I thought we were going to be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" you whispered furiously back, \"I got nervous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got nervous!? I thought you had this handled! I told you to be careful with your speed, baka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" you feebly tried to rebuff your furious friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry isn't going to help us now, Asuka! We have a big problem now!\" the purplette hissed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew a bit wide, she had called you Asuka just as you had called her Kaori. But, that was small peanuts compared to the disaster you had accidentally created. Jordan was right, you now had a <i>huge </i>problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What're we whispering about?\" Honoka practically breathed in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrieked in surprise, almost smacking your head into the rearview mirror. Jordan frantically made a shushing motion, her eyes frantically glancing at the squad car that still sat behind your car. The windows were dark so you could only see the outline of the officer inside, but you were somehow sure that he was changing just as you, Jordan, and your mother had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't do that! You almost gave me a heart attack!\" you gasped out, trying to control your breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka bopped her head and stuck out her tongue, one of her blue eyes winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehe, sorry Musume-chan...\" she didn't sound all that sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Kaori hissed, \"He's coming back... oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off mid-sentence, staring at the reflection in the passenger side mirror with her jaw dropped wide open, green eyes impossibly wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refrained from sticking your head out of the window to look for yourself as the sound of the officer's footsteps clicked on the concrete. But as you listened, you couldn't help but notice that they didn't sound like those of police issue shoes though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, minna-san <sup><i>everyone</i></sup>,\" a smooth, young female voice that seemed to ooze sophistication and adult charm spoke as the officer approached your window, \"I'm going to give you a warning but make sure you watch your speed from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turned to address the officer and found your face making the same gobsmacked expression your purple haired friend was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, slender young woman stood at your driver's side window, long maroon-purple hair swaying in the wind behind her and blue-green eyes staring down at you with a calm, almost serene expression. Her face was sharp where yours were all rounder shaped, giving her a sophisticated, adult looking beauty that belied her young age, which couldn't have been a year older than your were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit was covered in flickers of pale light, still obviously in the process of changing but currently looked like a mangled fusion of the standard issue highway police uniform and <i>something far different</i>. Before your shocked gaze, the flashes tore away at the police uniform's pants and swiftly gave way to a short, fitted black skirt trimmed in gold, white thigh high stockings with black garters that clung to slender and shapely legs, and black knee high boots with the same gold trim and a raised heel. An intricate and elegant looking violet sash adorned with flowers was draped around her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... officer?\" you said slowly, ignoring Jordan's frantic motions telling you to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't want to shut up, you wanted to test something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" the young woman hummed, looking at you, \"Hai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you feeling different today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl tilted her head and, like before, looked lost and confused for a moment. She reached up and touched her temple as the flashes of light devoured the sleeves of her uniform top and replaced them with black, opera length gloves trimmed with gold near the openings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" she mumbled, a look of extreme discomfort and confusion on her face for a moment before her features returned to the serene, sophisticated look she wore before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling different? No, I can't say I am... why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed slightly. You hadn't imagined it, it was almost like the officer had been resisting it but you weren't 100% sure. A glance at Jordan showed that she had seen it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash of light attacked what was left of her police uniform. Golden epaulets formed as the collar folded and turned white with a thin strip of gold trim. The top conformed more snugly to a slender, well proportioned upper body with full breasts somewhere between yours and Kaori's, not too big and not too small. A final flicker of light saw a purple ascot and a violet flower tucked into the collar to complete the look. It resembled some sort of sexy military-esque uniform, complete with faux medals pinned to her chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugoi!\" Honoka cooed as she practically crawled over you, her eyes glittering in awe, \"Your uniform is soo kawaii!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"officer\" looked surprised for a moment before her cheeks tinged a slight shade of pink. She idly flicked her hair, which was now held in line by a black hairband with a small white feather and smiled. You noticed she was wearing small dangling gold earrings now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigato,\" she accepted the praise graciously, \"my idol group's members designed them. They worked very hard on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that! I can't wait to get something just like it for Kaori-chan and Musume-chan!\" Honoka gushed, much to yours and Jordan's growing sense of horror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was something new. The three of you had just grown school uniforms, but this new officer had an outfit more akin to an idol. Actually, now that you mention it, she outright just mentioned her outfit being designed by her idol group. Guess it could all relate to the fact that music was what caused this whole mess in the first place. Though, did that mean the three of you were in a similar boat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh...being an idol wasn't exactly any more appealing than being a schoolgirl. Actually, that sounded even worse. Being the kind of person to perform on stage in showy outfits?! That was the worst thing possible for a shut-in. And Jordan wasn't exactly much better off in that regard, especially going on his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....uh....arigato,\" you spoke shyly as you got your ID back, wanting to move on from this as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totemo yoi\" <sup>Very good</sup> the officer smiled at you, honestly making you blush a bit. Dang, this new girl really had a cool sophisticated air about her. She just....seemed so cool and mature.... \"Anyway, I should be getting back to work. Say\u014dnara. Ki o tsukete.\" <sup>Good bye. Take care.</sup><br>\r\n\"Oh! Can I have your name, onegaishimasu?\" <sup>please</sup> Honoka jumped up, nearing pushing you all the way to the door comically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl didn't seem to mind though, giving that same adult smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Erena,\" she smiled. \"Come see us the next time my group performs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we will! Say\u014dnara Erena-chan!\" Honoka smiled, before you got frustrated enough and pushed her back into her seat, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you finally got the car started, letting \"Erena-chan\" on her own way. It took a little bit to finally get Honoka calm enough to actually sit down, with Jordan kind of needing to assist there. You actually got a look as Erena left you to return to her car. Actually, now that you noticed it, another police car had arrived, probably just to make sure everything was okay given you had been there a while. You couldn't see the other person though, but Erena seemed to be talking with them, reaching her hand inside. Right at that moment, a bright flash erupted from inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was your cue to leave, not wanting to see any more come of this. Jordan didn't miss it though, slapping her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, now she's not only an idol, but also spreading it. Wonderful,\" she groaned, putting both hands on her face now. \"This is far bigger than us right now, no thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry, okay!\" you cried back, not wanting any of this right now. \"Excuse me if confronting an officer wasn't enough reason to panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka on the other hand seemed blissfully unaware of such things though, and poked her head through again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really though, we should get you two some cool outfits!\" she giggled. \"I want you to look really pretty, Musume-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not sound appealing in the slightest, and Honoka slightly cuddling on your shoulder a bit didn't help. Why did she have to look so adorable while doing all of this. You could tell from the slight red on Jordan's face that she was feeling similarly, though she immediately turned her head when you looked her way. Sheesh, things just felt so awkward now, and will probably get even worse if you get a completely new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka continued to ramble on about things, from either outfits or even song ideas. Most of them didn't even really make sense to you, but you said nothing as she continued to ramble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wonder what Erena-chan's group is like. I bet they're amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, a group of girls like....Erena-chan...sounded...not like the worst thing in the world. You shook your head again of those thoughts. All this cutesy girl stuff was actually starting to sound just a tiny bit appealing. Okay, you had to admit that if you were still a boy right now, you would find it <i>very</i> appealing. Don't lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the car was filled with the sound of Honoka's words and humming along the way as you got outside of the city and towards Daniel's abode.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you drove, neither you or Jordan said a word. To fill the silence, Honoka seemed to content herself by rambling on and on about cute outfits she wanted to force you into or song ideas for the idol group she seemed to be <i>seriously</i> considering creating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered. While the thought of watching a group of young, beautiful girls dancing and singing on stage in showy outfits wasn\u2019t repulsive at all to your still very much male mindset, the idea of being forced into said showy outfit and shoved out onto a stage in front of hundreds of people to sing and dance was wholly unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you had a wonderfully curved, slender young body, a breathtaking, angelic face and, based on the gradual rising of your voice\u2019s pitch, a soon to be beautiful singing voice, there was no way you would ever consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Honoka\u2019s puppy eyed stare was drilling into you. Not a chance. Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed heavily, pushing those thoughts away as you turned off the main highway and sped away from town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urban landscape slowly gave way to seas of gleaming gold wheat and rolling hills and then to a deep forest of  towering pine trees and snakelike, curving roads along rocky ravines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re really in the boonies right now,\u201d Jordan commented idly. He seemed to be trying to ignore Honoka\u2019s nonsensical babbling from the backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd honestly, you couldn\u2019t blame her. If such ideas were nightmarish for you, they were even worse for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you agreed, carving along the sweeping curves of the road that lead to your aunt\u2019s manor, \u201cgreat grandpa Aiden didn\u2019t like cities very much so he built his place out here away from all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t really blame him,\u201d Jordan mumbled, expressing her own disdain for suburbia and the urban sprawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka was practically vibrating in her seat, no doubt she had had her fill of being stuck in the relatively cramped, even for a girl her size, back seat of the Toyota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMusume-chaaaaaan~ my legs are falling asleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, about five minutes out,\u201d you responded, glancing at your \u201cokaa-san\u201d as she shifted around, clear blue eyes looking restlessly out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour car created another curve and the Hewitt manor slid into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSugoi...\u201d Kaori breathed, green eyes locked on the manor as you drove closer, \u201cwhen you said it was huge, you weren\u2019t kidding...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka\u2019s head peeked out from in between your seats, eyes sparkling like the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHai hai! Nee-Chan\u2019s house is something, right?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn\u2019t as immense as some of the \u201dMcMansions\u201d you had seen many times before, it was by no means small by any means. A great, dark brown art-deco masterpiece of architecture built by your okaa-san\u2019s side of the family before the Great Depression, the Hewitt manor loomed before you against the backdrop of the dense forests that surrounded it. A long, cobbled driveway snaked around the front of the manor, crossing a small creek via an ancient looking, but sturdy, wooden bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up to the front of the house, put the car in neutral and pulled up on the handbrake. As soon as you had opened the door and moved the seat for Honoka to get out, you had to quickly grab the bubbly orangette before she shot off like a rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonoka-chan, I need you to stay with us and don\u2019t touch anything, onegaishimasu,\u201d you almost begged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly look crossed her face. Uh oh, you really didn't like that look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkayyyyy, but you and Kaori-chan have to try some cute outfits on for me in return later~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blanched. Oh god, she had you by, the metaphorical anyway, balls. If you didn\u2019t do as she asked, she would be unstoppable and whatever chaos she unleashed would be your <i>doom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d you agreed hurriedly, \u201cjust... l-later on, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice. You just hoped Jordan would forgive you for the hell you had doomed him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal~!\u201d She chirped, bouncing on the soles of her feet, \u201cI\u2019ll be good, musume-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Jordan and blushed heavily as you saw her stretching, that wonderfully curved, slender body and full bosom on full display as she arched her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t drooling, you weren\u2019t. Honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK maybe a little. Kaori was hot, so sue you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she had bigger breasts than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened and tilted her head at the odd look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with that look? Looks like you just made a deal with the devil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced, that wasn\u2019t too far off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s go,\u201d you said with a sigh, \u201clet\u2019s hope Daniel can help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if he can\u2019t?\u201d Jordan asked lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to answer that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the massive oak doors and raised your hand but Jordan\u2019s pale hand gripped your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what your touch will do if you knock.\u201d She reasoned, glancing warily at your hand like it was a loaded gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point..., let me find a stick. I don\u2019t think my aunt will appreciate me smacking a rock on her door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a long stick on the ground and used it to gently poke the doorbell button. A series of low, ominous sounding chimes was heard distantly in the manor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little while passed, though that wasn't anything new as far as you were concerned. If Daniel was by himself, it would take a bit for him to come out. All the while though, Jordan was glancing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I can't help but wonder if us just standing here might change something,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true....though my whole house didn't change last time. Just the garage did,\" you replied. \"So....maybe the mansion won't change even if we step inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as you two were talking, the door slowly opened, revealing your shut-in of a cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex what's.....\" he was groaning until he actually looked forward, seeing two Japanese girls standing on his doorstep. \"Um, can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah of course this would happen. Not like you warned him ahead of time, and like he would believe you anyway. Daniel was very much the analytical type. Convincing him of some supernatural phenomenon like this would be difficult for sure. Still, you had to convince him anyway. Not like Jordan could really help given they hadn't really met much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....well first, hi Daniel....\" you spoke in more or less the same manner as usual to him. \"And....I'm actually Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad you at least spoke English there. Even if keeping it so in your thoughts was hard enough, you needed to make sure you communicated to Daniel clearly. Speaking of which, you could tell from his face that he believed he was getting pranked. It wouldn't be unusual for him to just slam the door right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Daniel sighed as he began to do just that and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you cried out, about to touch the door to stop him from shutting it. Right at that moment, Jordan grabbed your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" she cried out. \"You want to infect the whole place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry!\" you cried back, shaking your wrist from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess you nearly panicked again. Good going Asuka, er <i>Alex</i>. You nearly caused yet another incident. Though, if there was any bright side, the door hadn't closed, and Daniel was still there, not somewhat perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talked about? Infect the whole place?\" he said in a deadpan tone. \"What kind of prank is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look....it's not a prank,\" you said, trying to keep your hands to yourself this time. \"I know...it's hard to say....but I'm Alex. I...I...I'm not sure how else to explain it but....well....who else would know about last year's gathering when you had an accident in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's eyes widened, while Jordan's just looked confused. What incident were you talking about? Well, it was actually a little embarrassing, and you were the only one to have been around when it happened. Daniel made you swear not to reveal it to anyone or else he would find a way to kill you. And frankly, you didn't want to test his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?....\" Daniel said slowly, eyebrow arched. \"Alex? Wait....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly unusual to see Daniel so flustered, which made sense. He got flustered around anything his brain couldn't compute, and who in the world could compute a transformation into a Japanese girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it's confusing, but I'm really Alex,\" you said, hands against your chest, and breasts for that matter which made you blush. \"And we need your help to find a way to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O....kay.....\" Daniel was still visibly confused, but did seem willing to trust you for the time being. \"Well....guess you should come in so you can explain more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Jordan spoke up this time. \"Um...you think there's something we could wear...like gloves or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Daniel asked. \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jordan...Alex's friend,\" she said. \"And...we think anything we touch transforms too. It's...gotten a little crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat went without saying. Daniel looked like he was going to have a migraine. Well, in spite of that though, he complied, perhaps if nothing else than to get this headache over with. It didn't take too long for him to return with a couple pairs of oven mits from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work fine enough?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Jordan said, taking a pair. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou graciously took a pair as well and the two of you entered Daniel's mansion, leaving your shoes by the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mansion inside was somewhat dark and foreboding, with tall, vaulted ceilings shored up with black steel supports and dark, elaborately carved mahogany woodwork. Ornate chandeliers, also made of black steel hung from chains and gave off a bright amber glow, a strangely old fashioned look befitting a relic from a bygone era of American prosperity. It was certainly no the place to find a trio of brightly colored young Japanese girls that looked right out of an anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the heavy oak doors had closed behind you, Daniel turned back to look at you and paused seeing your tiny, stocking clad feet on the dark wood floors. Another look had confirmed that Jordan had also done the same, depositing her shoes with yours in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the lack of shoes?\" he asked flatly, eyes raking across your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just felt like I needed to...\" you replied lamely. Daniel was still the same as you remembered, intense and analytical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel continued to stare at you. No doubt he was analyzing your features. While you certainly had the facial features of one, your coloring certainly didn't jive with the looks of a typical Japanese schoolgirl with your red hair, vivid, unnaturally bright purple eyes, and utterly perfect faces and slender figures. Even Jordan, with his somewhat more subdued coloring, didn't look real with his purple hair and bright green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, weren't there three of you?\" he asked suddenly, only to find himself face to face with a pretty orangette with bright, clear blue eyes that were sparkling with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oikko<i><sup>nephew</sup></i>-chan!\" Honoka cheered, her smile lighting up the room, \"It's been so long~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! What the hell?!\" Daniel exclaimed, practically throwing himself backwards top the floor in surprise, \"Who the hell is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" you said nervously, instinctively twirling a strand of your carmine hair around a finger, \"That's... kind of complex actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's narrow green eyes flickered from you, to Jordan's nervous figure, to the bubbly, bouncing Honoka who was still beaming at him. He slowly climbed back to his feet, making sure to keep a good bit of distance between him and the strange orangette that had gotten in his face. It was better to err on the side of caution, she could be, and probably was, contagious if what you had said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then simplify it for me, use small words,\" he quipped flatly. Oh yeah, he was still the same withdrawn, sarcastic shut-in with asshole tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... this is Honoka-chan,\" you said slowly, \"and she's... well... she's my okaa-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted at you, pale green eyes narrowing in thought. Unlike Kaori's vibrant green pools or \"Officer Erena's\" striking blue-green, Daniels eyes were a very pale shade of green, giving them a piercing look. Combined with his tall, slim figure, messy red hair and haggard looks despite his young age, he certainly held the air of a workaholic scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming that was Japanese, I'm a bit rusty with that language but, if my ears aren't playing tricks on me like my eyes are, you just called her your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hai,\" you looked away from Daniel's intense stare, \"she's my okaa... I mean, my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the happy looking girl who had gotten in his face, eyes widening slightly. This was definitely not who he'd remembered. Your mom, to him, would always be associated with a short heavyset figure, blood red hair, green eyes, large bust and decidedly <i>not </i>a slender young lady with orange hair, a cute side ponytail, and cheerful blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Heidi?\" he asked her carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Call me Honoka-chan!\" she chirped, telling him much the same thing that you had been told after your okaa-san had been changed by your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She insists on being called that,\" Jordan chimed in helpfully, \"she won't accept anything else, even Asuka has to call her that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka? I'm assuming you meant Alex just then?\" Daniel said slowly looking like he was deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah as of later we've begun to... slip... occasionally...\" you said slowly, once again twirling a bit of hair nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the three of you, analyzing what he'd just learned. His mind sorting through the information and coming up with theories and hypothesis after hypothesis in mere moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" he said finally, \"lets head up to my lab upstairs. We're going to run some tests. Follow me, and don't touch anything.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had an idea of where Daniel's lab was, not that you actually saw it much. It didn't surprise you as Daniel began to lead you both upstairs. The mansion was more tall than wide as you had seen outside, having 4 floors in all. Daniel basically had most of the 4th floor to himself, hence why it had his room and lab and just about everything. Walking up and down was inconvenient, but he could at least be assured of his privacy that way whenever guests were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that beside the point, you turned to Honoka and put on the best angry face you could, which looked like little more than a cute pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honoka-chan!\" you said to her. \"I thought we agreed that you'd wait in the car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai,\" Honoka smiled gently. \"But I couldn't resist getting to see my cute oikko-chan after so long. And I wanted to walk around after being in that car for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't even that long...\" you sighed, both hands on your head right now. \"Ugh....I suppose it doesn't matter now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be little you could seriously do to rein in Honoka. She was the kind of anime girl with boundless energy that could never stay in one place for too long. That much was obvious. And she was probably still serious about dressing he two of you up at some point. Terrific. As if this couldn't give you any more of a migraine. Any time you thought you had even a little bit of control over the situation, it just became undone instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan more or less kept to herself the whole time, though you could tell she was thinking along similar lines. She kept on playing with her hair a bit as you began to climb another stair case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully he might be able to figure out something,\" you told Jordan, who nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umaku ikeba,\" <sup>Hopefully</sup> she sighed. You know, you were almost kind of jealous at that adult posture she had. You wouldn't know she was stressed given how gracefully she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Daniel's voice suddenly broke the silence as they were climbing up the stairs. \"You might as well start at the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai,\" you replied. You could tell Daniel's eyes narrowed every time a Japanese word went through your mouth. It wasn't like you had much control over it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you began at the beginning, mentioning how you found a CD underneath your bed to start the day. It was from some unknown group called \"KSS48\" that you knew nothing about, but you downloaded the songs to your phone anyway since you liked the genre. Then, you began working on your car with Jordan when you tried to put music on and the J-Pop began playing without your input, and would continue to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even when you tried to turn it off?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The phone didn't let me,\" you shrugged your shoulders. \"I hit pause and even tried to turn it off. Nothing would interrupt the song.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to describe to Daniel how you felt the whole time, like the song was practically invading your head. Heck, even now, you could remember most if not all of the lyrics you heard right now, which you didn't thankfully. That was how you and Jordan became who you were right now, and even touching your Camaro turned it into what it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By touch?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, that was all it took,\" replied Jordan. \"Didn't mean anything by it. It just happened in a flash, literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about every change was preceded by some flash,\" you added. \"And most of what we ended up touching changed instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...including....\" Daniel pondered as he turned towards Honoka, who was still bouncing behind you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" she giggled, pointing to her cheeks. \"Now I'm totally kawaii just like musume-chan and Kaori-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh....\" Daniel pondered again, though you could tell he looked perturbed. He always had a little quirk of making short words whenever he felt out of his element. Not like you could blame him. He probably didn't even know what all these Japanese words meant, not that you did either before this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And....then somehow we ended up turning the garage too,\" you sighed. \"That was when we decided to come to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we got pulled over by police,\" Jordan huffed, hands crossing underneath her bust. \"And Asuka...<i>Alex</i> caused even more problems and touched him. He then turned into another girl just like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it was an accident...\" you sighed, your expressive face looking downcast at the mention. \"Oh...and...we kind of saw the new girl going to another officer and they probably changed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....\" Daniel have another short answer, taking in all the information. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it, wondering if you missed anything. Your eyes widened a bit at another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and...Honoka-chan....mom actually started humming along the way,\" you added. \"There wasn't anything huge, but we saw some street signs change at an intersection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying a minor change?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to everything else? Hai,\" Jordan nodded. \"Even something that small caused a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it again if you like!\" Honoka giggled, clearly not on the same page as the others here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinaide kudasai,\" <sup>Please don't</sup> Jordan asked back, face slightly red as she glared at Honoka, who just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just nodded, taking in everything he had heard. Conveniently enough, we had all arrived at the top floor. He took an immediate right, heading towards the nearest door, which conveniently had \"Daniel's Lab\" etched into it. He gave us another warning not to touch anything, though you had a thought that it was geared towards Honoka more than the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you entered Daniel's lab. It wasn't the crazy over the top kind of lab you'd expect of a mad scientist, but it was certainly extensive, a product of all the wealth he had to work with. You couldn't understand most of the instruments, but he probably had something for just about every field he cared for. You could tell Honoka had stars in her eyes looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually...did she literally just have stars in her eyes? Ugh, all this anime-ness was getting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've heard your story,\" Daniel said. \"We should begin testing so I can see this firsthand.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked around, there were several desks and tables against the walls, each one looking as expensive and well made as the dizzying array of scientific instruments and computers that sat on top of them. You liked to think you were pretty good in science class and always pulled good grades there, especially since Miss Williams, who was a total sweetheart, had taken over for Mister Burnham last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the instruments and whiteboards filled with equations that, to you, looked more like Egyptian hieroglyphs, you felt <i>really </i>out of your element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Daniel began, turning to regard the three of you, especially Honoka, with a serious look in his eyes, \"if this... thing of yours is spread by touch, under no circumstances are you to <i>touch anything</i>. If you have to touch something, you are to use the gloves unless I ask you not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan nodded, but Honoka seemed to be still looking around, literal stars in her eyes. Yep, all the anime-ness was definitely screwing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Heidi!\" he snapped, seeing her drawn to a very expensive looking device, \"or Honoka or whatever, please don't touch anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...,\" the girl whined like a puppy, shuffling back to Jordan's side, thoroughly chastised, \"so mean... Oikko-chan yelled at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gave Jordan and you a flat, unamused look, totally unaffected by your adorable \"mom's\" display, \"Keep an eye on her, I don't need any of my crap changed because she got curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai,\" you agreed, \"sorry, Daniel-itoko<i><sup>cousin</sup></i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed heavily, raking a hand through his messy red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's begin. Alex, since this all seemed to begin with you, we'll test you first. The rest of you sit over there and don't move. Jordan, keep an eye on... Honoka, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused turning piercing eyes towards your purple haired friend, who stared back at him almost demurely. You could've swore his eyes flicked down to her chest and back and he seemed to blush a bit when Jordan gave a weak smile back, which irritated <i>greatly </i>you for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to you and his brow creased, \"What's with that look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsuni<i><sup>nothing</sup></i>...\" you pouted, your cheeks puffed up in annoyance and crossed your arms under your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that,\" he said with his usual deadpan, though you could see he was definitely blushing as you crossed your shapely legs, \"your making this really uncomfortable for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced. You were acting like a jealous schoolgirl when he looked at your friend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen nasai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel bustled around the lab, setting up a tripod with a video camera perched atop it and booting up a nearby computer before pressing record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Daniel Newman, August 22nd 2019... my cousin Alex Tucker-\" he began to restate what you had told him earlier, creating a record for his experiments like any good scientist would do. Idly, you tried to fix your hair slightly, even though it was already, and always was, perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrifying, isn't it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets begin with the first test, testee Alex states that the change is initiated by touch so I have prepared a series of items for testing this theory,\" Daniel narrated calmly, rolling a steel cart with several items on it towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a what looked like a white undershirt, a pair of swim trunks, an old cell phone, and an English textbook of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alex, you may proceed with the first item, remove your gloves and begin,\" Daniel instructed calmly, his eyes locked on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hai,\" you took the oven mitts off and reached out, your slim fingers gently brushing the first item, a plain white undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your fingertips touched the white shirt, a white flash of light covered the fabric and you could feel it moving around and shifting, changing under your touch. The cloth bunched together, shrinking away and compacting down into something smaller. Soft foam cups bulged out as the sleeves narrowed into thin straps, while a lining of lace crawled along the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light flickered and faded and where the white shirt was sitting was now a cute white bra with pink lace trimming, not dissimilar to the red one that you wore beneath your blouse and blazer. In fact, just by looking at it anyway, it seemed to be your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to Daniel and found his eyes opened wide staring a the bra like it was the most fascinating thing in the world, which you supposed it was to him. Something impossible, proof that magic, or whatever force this was, was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely remarkable,\" he poked a gloved finger at the bra, the supple foam cups dimpled at his prodding, \"guess you weren't kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was,\" you replied darkly, \"but yet here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" he agreed, \"let's continue with the testing, we need to establish any variances if there are any before I can come up with any hypotheses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai,\" you agreed and with another touch, the swimming trunks were enveloped by another flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swim-trunks swiftly restructured themselves into a daring red and black, halter neck bikini top with a black and white bow in between the cups, in your size of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old cell phone became a more modern model, completely with a cutesy red case and feather like charm on a thin black cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the English textbook became a book on Japanese literature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each item changed, Daniel's inquisitive stare became more intense as he muttered to the camera and wrote things in his notepad. You weren't sure what he had in mind, but you hoped dearly that he could reverse all this, or at the very least... halt the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, deep down, there were worse things than being stuck as a beautiful girl. You were determined to return things to how they were this morning but if worse came to worse, you could, theoretically, live with this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That way of thinking made you clamp up a bit. Could you really be able to live like this in the worst case scenario? Guess it wasn't too bad in hindsight. Granted, that brought up so many questions on what you could do if that ended up being the case? What about school and all that? You weren't sure if you could continue high school like this, unless you had to move to Japan for it. Funny enough, with Daniel's wealth, it was probably possible should it come down to it. Still, it wasn't something you wanted to accept just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were pondering though, Daniel was bringing up even more odd objects, some being old clothes like before, and some other objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't these kind of similar to before?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see if some changes are different between you three. I noticed that the clothes you got....seem to be your size if I had to guess,\" Daniel coughed a bit, retaining his composure. \"So, by that nature, I want to see if the same happens with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan piped up a bit at that, blushing at the idea of having more clothes change to suit her measurements, especially with her chest size. Honoka on the other hand seemed a lot more into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Can I try first?!\" she asked nicely, if not enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's fine,\" Daniel sighed. \"Just don't go crazy and touch anything I don't give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai,\" Honoka smiled gently, waiting surprisingly patiently for her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, one after another, Daniel tossed Honoka more of some old clothes he had around, of which he had plenty of. Honoka caught both the shirt and shorts at the same time, causing both to light up instantly. Dominant white and pink colors flooded both garments as the shirt sleeves changed into a new pattern and the shorts fluttered into a layered skirt. Essences of sky blue also dotted the shirt with light ruffles here and there. Some fluff surrounded the shoulders and went down the chest a little as well. Topping it off was the emergence of a pink tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan blushed a bit, seeing what really looked like an idol outfit, and quite the cute one at that. Honoka certainly seemed to seem so, from the excited smile that squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, kawaii! What else do you have?!\" she smiled widely. \"You got some gloves? I'd really want those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure,\" Daniel said, keeping up his log as he did so. \"Curious, so different changes are possible even for similar items. Who causes the change might also affect it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Daniel abided by what she wanted and found some old winter gloves. As Honoka caught them, they lit up, turning into a size fit for her while also turning white, even gaining similar fluff to her top. She giggled at all of this, even winking at the rest of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to try this out. I won't be long,\" she smiled as she began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okaa-san!\" you cried at her, blushing all the whole and covering your eyes. \"Don't undress in front of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to turn away....yet I can't,\" Jordan blushed a bit but didn't turn her eyes away. \"Honoka-chan has a very cute build. Not overly big but not too small either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not again,\" you groaned, thinking back to how Jordan acted when your mom was still normal. In this new form, Jordan didn't overly seem to mind female bodies, even when naked apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was no less surprised by this, though he kept his logs going all the same. Not that Honoka's body size was really necessary for him, but any that helped counted. Not to say he wasn't red in the face though. This was probably the first time he had seen a girl partially naked for any period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn't too long before Honoka was decked out in her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, it's so comfy,\" she smiled. \"I want something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say about not touching anything?!\" Daniel raised his voice, momentarily stopping Honoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit Honoka looked completely adorable like that, not that she wasn't before. You didn't get the overly jealous feeling you did around \"Kaori-chan's\" figure that was for sure. As you were thinking on that though, Honoka kept pestering Daniel for something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine....uh....\" Daniel kept going through his old stuff. Randomly, he brought out a really old pair of headphones. \"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanpekina!\" <sup>Perfect</sup> Honoka smiled as she caught them and put them on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the rest, it lit up, growing significantly smaller all the while. Actually, it was all concentrating on her left side, forming there before something formed around to the front of her face. Once the light died down, it showed a simple yet advanced earpiece, with a clearly identifiable microphone on it. For the most part, Honoka had assembled a completely new idol outfit out of these old items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/love-live/images/d/da/R_334_Transformed_Honoka.png/revision/latest?cb=20160708042054\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/love...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kawaii!\" she cried out. Oh, and apparently that microphone worked, considering what she said echoed rather loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, turn that off!\" Daniel cried out, getting Honoka to do just that. \"Ugh, well indulging her might not have been the best idea, but it gave me a better sense of how each of you creates a different change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing catastrophic had happened yet at the least, though you hoped the whole ordeal gave Daniel even more material to work with. Honoka seemed to satisfied at least, lightly skipping in her new outfit. She did wish she had something else like a new hairpiece for her new outfit, but it was clear Daniel didn't want to push things with how much had already changed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok,\" Daniel said, forcing himself to look away from Honoka's supple legs as she tested out a few dance moves in her new outfit, her skirt fluttering up slightly with her movements, \"I have some data to work with on how this spreads to mundane objects but now I need to examine something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" you asked curiously, tilting your head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared you down intensely before glancing at Jordan, who, judging from the dark blush on her face, was still captivated by the fluttering of Honoka's sinfully short skirt as she danced and twirled around happily. The only reason you weren't joining him in his blatant admiration was that deep down Honoka-chan was still your <i>mom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed some things since you got here that I think are important,\" he began seriously, \"your mannerisms and how you sometimes slip up are something I've been watching very carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you grimaced, you had been noticing that all day with Jordan and yourself since this mess started, \"I'm... aware of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel glanced down at his notebook and began to list off his observations, \"your grasp on English seems to slip here and there and you've been using Japanese honorifics to address people, you use a lot of Japanese terminology, <i>goman nasai </i>and <i>hai </i>and the like, and occasionally your name is substituted with Asuka and Jordan's with Kaori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a breath and turned the page, indicating he had been watching and observing what you did carefully since you arrived and cataloguing it as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there's your mannerisms, you walk like a girl, sit like one, cross your legs, and Jordan's out of character comments about Honoka's figure stick out in particular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all sounded... so <i>clinical </i>when Daniel listed it out like that, so cold and impersonal. It brought up all the insecurities and fears you had been feeling, and suppressing, since you noticed the slip ups and changes you and Jordan exhibited. It felt like stone was sinking in the pit of your stomach. The somewhat light and comical mood that came with Honoka's new outfit was significantly dulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are we going to lose ourselves, Daniel? Is that what you're saying?\" you almost whispered with dread. You were certain that Jordan had a similar look of despair on her face as she listened. Honoka had stopped dancing and was staring Daniel down, her normally happy blue eyes looked like frozen chips of ice as she picked up on her musume's distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiiiiiii.....\" the orangette seemed to somehow be <i>audibly </i>glaring at her nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's cold green gaze didn't waver but his face did soften slightly as he picked up on the fear in your down turned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my professional opinion, no,\" he said, causing your head to snap up in surprise, \"while you are exhibiting typical mannerisms and speech like what I imagine a typical Japanese schoolgirl might behave like, I don't believe that total identity death is a possibility, at least for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what makes you think that?\" Jordan said, relief evident in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That particular finding comes from observing Honoka mostly,\" said girl blinked in confusion, \"while she has changed quite a bit compared to what Aunt Heidi was like, she is still very much your mother and acts as such despite her new... peppy attitude. She's been glaring at me like she wants to set me on fire for upsetting you. Based on this, I believe that the mental changes are based on willpower and sense of self, for lack of a better description.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willpower?\" you asked curiously, that sounded like something from a video game you had played once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, the stronger your sense of self is, the less effective whatever force is changing you will be on your mental state. You might get some mannerisms that fit your current bodies and some other girly nuances, along with language changes and such, but you will, at least according to my observations anyway, still be <i>you </i>at your cores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... your saying its more like a subtle mental adjustment?\" Jordan said, still looking as confused as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Daniel said with a nod, \"you two have <i>very strong </i>senses of self so the changes, for the most part, are likely going to be very minimal whereas Aunt Heidi, from what I remember of her, has always been a tired soul so the change was far more drastic for her, which explains Honoka's 180 degree personality shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt... made sense, actually. Your mom, while a loving woman and fantastic mother despite her faults, was seemingly always <i>tired</i>. She was tired of work, tired of raising three kids by herself, tired of taxes, tired of her life in general. In a way, Honoka-chan was her FOIL, happy and energetic with an inexhaustible sense of optimism. In a strange sense, it was a blessing for her, a respite that you mom never got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of this worthless species though,\" and there was the misanthropic disdain Daniel was known for again, \"most people are sheep so there's a good chance that a lot of people will be totally changed into completely different people if this is allowed to spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said slowly, \"do you maybe have a way to stop this or reverse it?\"</span></div></div>",

Granted, it was kind of hard to disagree with it, despite the cold logic of the matter. Certainly something to hear it spoken with a straight face though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Daniel started. \"I have perhaps an idea to try out. Granted, it's risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" your eyes popped wide at that. The fact that he had anything of the sort to go on was impressive. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply put, we try to use what has typically worked for humanity: anti-bodies,\" Daniel said. \"I would guess that you three are immune to any other sort of influence from these changes, so perhaps samples from you will be able anti-bodies to prevent anyone who hasn't already changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the basic gist of anti-bodies well enough. Any high school student would know that. Though, would it really work? It sounded kind of simple...and this \"idol virus\" as you and Jordan had so affectionately called it didn't exactly work like a typical virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that'll work though?\" Jordan spoke up demurely. \"That sounds like a good science problem, but this feels more like magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer to believe that everything has a basis in something, even for something as bizarre as this,\" Daniel noted, mostly pointing to the changes made to inanimate objects. \"Since everything only seems to change once, there must be some kind of protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all made sense from a science perspective, and he was right about things just changing once. Still, would anti-bodies really be such a factor in this? Both you and Jordan had doubts about that, while Honoka looked kind of lost. Granted, she wasn't trying very hard to understand it. Though she did like the idea of taking risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you need?\" Honoka asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking....some blood samples,\" Daniel pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you cried out. Blood samples? That was done at doctor's appointments for sure but this seemed pretty far from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Daniel shrugged. \"The blood is where you'll find protection from viruses and other such diseases. It's only natural. Plus, I'll spare you the talk of how else I'd put it together. I doubt you'd understand anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really didn't sound right in the slightest, but then again he was the genius here. You and Jordan looked very worried about this, though Honoka seemed all too ready to help, already offering her left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, you can count on me, oikko-chan!\" she said, not flinching in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, through whatever weird process Daniel decided upon, he was soon going through his instruments, putting so and so together. It truly looked like something out of a mad scientists's lab now what with all the chemicals he soon had doing. You groaned as you rubbed your arm a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like this is going to end in disaster,\" you sighed. \"I just hope he doesn't poison himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Jordan replied. \"I don't think I could handle someone dying because of us like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't really much of a timetable given for how long this would take, as Daniel refused to give any specifics. Rather typical honestly. So, the three of you just occupied yourselves with what you had. Funny enough, that transformed book on Japanese literature actually was kind of interesting. You and Jordan actually took it up and looked it over, getting kind of engrossed in it actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So weird that I can actually read all these characters,\" Jordan said, going over character by character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Looks so daunting at first,\" you nodded. \"Hey, look at this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to occupy yourselves with that book while Honoka continued to adore her outfit while also poping in every now and then regarding the book. You weren't sure how much time had passed. Funny to believe this had all started in the morning. Probably still was honestly. Was it around lunch time yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you then heard a clap, bringing all your heads up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's done,\" Daniel said in his usual deadpan manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all looked to see a vial of pink liquid, which seemed to be absolutely sparkling. It...didn't exactly look poisonous, but it didn't look like something you'd ever want in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....really sure about this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scientific method is all about trial and error. There are no absolutes,\" Daniel said as he picked up the vial. \"Unfortunately, we're not exactly in a position to trial run this on a bunch of people like most studies. I don't think anyone would believe us anyway even with my recommendation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough. An \"idol virus\" was a hard sell even with the words of a prodigy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're just going to drink that?\" Jordan asked. \"What do you think will happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it goes like I think, then nothing should happen,\" Daniel explained. \"The point is to try it and then have you touch me to see if it causes anything to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" you asked, sounding a little incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else did you expect to test it? I can't exactly know if it works if I don't touch something that's infected,\" Daniel explained, as calm as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you weren't sure if that was reasonable in the slightest, but you knew Daniel wasn't going to change his mind. Nope, he was going to see his hypothesis through to the very end even if it killed him. You, Jordan, and Honoka all held your breaths as Daniel picked up his vial...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd drunk the whole thing down in one gulp! Okay, it wasn't exactly a lot to begin with but still it was impressive. Daniel wiped the excess off with his hand, shaking his head a bit. There was a tense silence for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....?\" you asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasted like bubble gum,\" Daniel said, almost casually as if nothing was wrong. If you were in an anime right now, it'd probably be the moment where everyone falls to the ground in exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....great,\" Jordan said, giving an uneasy smile that suited her face. \"So.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be digested rather quickly,\" Daniel said as he turned around. \"Now, just touch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't want to do this, but Daniel didn't look like he was giving you much choice in the matter. Your hand shook as you slowly began extending it, the air around you feeling tense. Your hand got closer...and closer......even more closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a fraction of a second, your hand touched down on Daniel's own, making you retreat it quickly as if you touched fire.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as if you <i>distrusted </i>Daniel per say, you just had really strong doubts that a scientific approach to something as abstract as <i>magic </i>was a wise choice. Your wide eyes frantically braced themselves for the telltale flash of light that signified the change you were certain that Daniel was about to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing, no flash, not even a brief sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masaka<sup><i>no way</i></sup>...\" Jordan breathed out, her green eyes wide, \"it worked?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stare, open mouthed. If this was an anime, you were certain your eyes were wide like dinner plates with a jaw that hit the floor in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gave himself a quick once over before a somewhat smug looking grin curled across his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem so...\" he nodded in satisfaction, \"according to previous experiments, the change should've taken place upon immediate contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't believe it...\" you said, still absolutely stunned by this new turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yatta! I don't know what we're excited about, but you did it Oikko-chan!\" Honoka cheered happily, still in her own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd done it. Your misanthropic, shut-in cousin had successfully done the impossible and <i>actually</i> brought the spread of \"idol virus\" to a dead stop, at least in your little group. Of course, now that left the issue of producing more of the stuff and distributing it before Officer Erena and the other unfortunate souls she had changed caused an epidemic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex, as I always say,\" Daniel began, still oozing satisfaction, \"every problem can be solved with a liberal amount of brainpower and science, even something as incomprehensible as <i>magic</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost kinda wanna smack him,\" Jordan mumbled under her breath, \"he doesn't have to be so smug about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and turned to address your friend, \"you get used to it after a while, he's usually right about most things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan didn't say anything in response, instead she was staring over your shoulder and looking like she'd seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, \"what are you looking at me like that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, she just grabbed you by the shoulders and turned you back around. At first, you didn't see anything amiss with Daniel, who was busy jotting down the results of his impromptu drug test and muttering to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him, your heart sinking into a pit in your stomach. You noticed a pair of small, dark lumps of hair slowly emerging from two points on either side of Daniel's head, their inky black color contrasting sharply with the red hair surrounding them. The longer you stared, the larger they seemed to be growing, round black bulbs that almost seemed to resemble the ears of a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, there was no flash when I touched him! No light!\" You frantically hissed at Jordan, \"why is he changing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell would I know, Asuka-chan\" Jordan whispered, still staring at the lumps on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh this wasn't good. Not good at all. The drug hadn't worked after all, only delayed the inevitable and removed the fancy light show that accompanied the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Daniel was going to change just as you, Kaori, and Honoka had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ano, Daniel?\" you asked, not really caring at the slip in your native tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked up from his notebook curiously, the dark lumps of hair practically doubling in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Alex? I need to catalogue the results before I can try and make more of this stuff before things get worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Do... do you feel any different?\" you asked hesitantly, eyes still locked on the now apple-sized lumps of hair as they began to quiver as if they were reaching critical mass. A pair of crimson ribbons slowly seemed to crawl out from his hair, tying themselves into neat bows at the base of each bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no? Didn't we already go through this? The drug worked, Alex, there's nothing to worry about,\" he said firmly, totally assured in the success of his methodology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumps on his head promptly burst open like pimples and long, glossy black pigtails emerged. They trailed down the sides of his head, gently brushing to <i>just </i>past his shoulders. You swallowed heavily, wondering how you were going to break the news that your cousin, still under the impression he had succeeded, now sported a pair of lovely pigtails that certainly fit in with the sort of \"idolized\" girls the virus was creating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked... <i>utterly ridiculous</i>, you thought as you tried to stifle the giggles that suddenly threatened to burst forth from your lips. This was a serious situation! This was not a time to laugh! Daniel was changing now too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really hard to stay quiet though, as Daniel's stern and confident face looked utterly unsuited to the frankly adorable tufts of hair that dangled from the both sides of his obviously male head. Jordan looked like she was trying to do the same, her cheeks flushed in trying to keep her expression neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka, however, had no such reservations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kawaii!\" the bubbly orangette gushed suddenly from her place beside you and Jordan, her eyes literally shining as she practically skipped over to Daniel's confused figure, \"those pigtails look great on you, Oikko-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wha?\" Daniel looked rightly flummoxed by your Okaa-chan's gushing, \"Pigtails? I don't have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up and his fingers encountered strands of glossy black sticking out of his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel's eyes widened a bit, probably the largest amount of emotion you had seen in his eyes since you got here. He pulled a bit harder on his hair, grunting slightly as he accidentally pulled really hard on them. True enough, what hair he held was pure black, as glossy as the other girls in the room, and just as \"perfect\" as everyone else's as well. You actually wondered if he was going to panic like you and Jordan had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you wouldn't be totally opposed to seeing that. Seeing that smug \"oikko-chan\" of yours actually panic like a normal person would actually really amuse you on any other day. Ugh, but this wasn't the time for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see.....\" Daniel stuttered slightly, bringing his other hand to his mouth and coughing a bit, maintaining an air of dignity. \"Obviously....I must not have drank enough of it. Thankfully I made more than enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're going to drink more?\" Jordan asked, hands up in a concerned motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Daniel said, perhaps a little too quickly, his pigtails flying around him as he turned. \"The fact that there was no flash and a slow reaction shows that there is some resistance. All it needs now is more to counteract it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really weren't sure if that was how things worked, not like you were any sort of doctor or whatever. Still, you knew Daniel somewhat well enough that he was really nervous underneath that facade. Most people didn't pay that sort of attention, but you knew that when Daniel started going that fast, it was typically a sign that he was nervous or agitated. You had a feeling he wasn't as confident about his diagnosis as he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, perhaps you shouldn't,\" you said. \"You know what happens when you rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...nothing,\" Daniel said as he picked up the rest of what he had cooked up. \"It's.....a simple solution!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he drunk all that remained of his \"miracle drug\", which frankly looked really sickening. You could only guess he didn't want to take chances, but this had to be dangerous. Hadn't the guy ever heard of overdosing?! People had died from that sort of stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itoko<i><sup>cousin</sup></i>-chan!\" you cried out, running over and putting your hands on his shoulders without thinking. Then again, concern for your cousin was kind of overriding that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka-chan!\" Jordan cried out, noticing you doing that. \"What are you-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, I just know it!\" you replied back. However, right then, Daniel looked back and pushed you off a bit, making you stumble a couple steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh......I-I......I'm fine....UGH....BLARG!\" Daniel groaned, looking like he was about to hurl. \"AHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like he was during that one time he had stomach cramps, though you imagined this felt a lot worse. You didn't remembering feeling sick at all during your own change, which could only mean Daniel's medicine was being more of a hindrance than a help. You actually wondered if it was causing him real pain right now. The very idea of that was actually making your eyes sting at the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel started to thrash a bit, arms wrapped around himself as he continued to move about what little wide open space there was. Audible gasping could be heard from all three of you as he did, looking like he was writhing in some sense of pain. However, during a little moment where he began to stay in one place, you noticed something that made your eyes widen more. Daniel was visibly shrinking! Just like all of you had! More and more, he was shrinking into his clothes, his sweatpants already pooling at the ground as he groaned, continuing to hold himself as his shirt was practically engulfing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oikko-chan!\" Honoka cried out, showing something other than excitement and ran right over to hold Daniel up, trying to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was continuing to shrink, barely even reacting to Honoka's help. He had already shrunken down past your level, and now seemed to be getting even shorter than Honoka. Just how short was he getting? He seemed to slow down just as he got past Honoka's height, probably ending a few centimeters below her. He had to be barely reaching past 5 feet right now, looking very short compared to everyone else here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, oikko-chan?\" Honoka asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's eyes had been shut the whole time, and it looked like he was struggling to open them. He wobbled on his feet, thanks to his radically shortened height and completely oversized clothes. He moved his hands to his eyes, rubbing them a bit as if they were irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.....This....can't be....\" he groaned, barely getting his eyes open. \"....Kore.... Suru koto wa dekimasen...\" <sup>this....can't be...</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first instance of Japanese from his mouth coincided with his eyes practically flickering. His grim and dispassionate green eyes looked like they were beginning to sparkle, the light of life shining through in light red waves. He continued to blink a few times, his eyes showing green and red a few times like Christmas lights. It wasn't long though before their shape changed to the distance Japanese almost shape as well, causing his eyes to pop right open, a new ruby shine glowing from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of this was happening, the black spots that grew his pigtails spread over the rest of his hair, covering every red thread in glossy black, perfectly styled like the rest. His bangs got much longer, with part of it combed towards the left, and some falling down the middle too. A longer piece of his bangs grow on the right side, growing about long enough to reach his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope....nothing had changed. Daniel was turning into a girl just like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itoko<i><sup>cousin</sup></i>-chan,\" you came right over, eyes still stinging a bit as you went past Honoka to hold Daniel now, ruby eyes blinking constantly. \"I-It'll...be okay. Somehow....\" Probably not the best consoling, but you wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't understand....\" Daniel was now visibly very uncomfortable, his eyes going even wider like an anime girl beginning to panic. \"It should...It should have worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a tingling went straight down to his hands, making Daniel slowly pull them right up. Rapidly, his hands were turning small and dainty, with perfectly smooth skin and trimmed fingernails. That was all rather expected from the rest of you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at that moment, a bright light surrounded his hands, and a pair of red fingerless gloves formed, heart shapes on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel....went completely silent, holding his hands up like they were alien. The normally apathetic young man was facing a crisis he never thought possible, the very concept on how he figured everything beginning to shatter. His ruby eyes shone brightly, but were filled with an ever rising panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that....he screamed...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the many years you had known Daniel, you had always seen him as a veritable bastion of common sense and cold logic. Even when faced with things that should have paralyzed him with fear or uncertainty, he remained calm and rational. To him, acting on emotion and devolving into a babbling mess of indecision was just about the worst thing to do. Everything he did was calculated and firmly grounded in reality and fact. It was this stalwart behavior and unflappable attitude that you christened him the \"Monster of Logic\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, however, Daniel's infamous \"Monster of Logic\" status had a serious drawback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was confronted with something that can't be rationalized and can't be controlled, Daniel tended to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iieeeeeeeeeeeee<sup><i>no</i></sup>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...freak out a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Daniel-itoko, calm down, onegai!\" you futilely tried to calm your cousin down as he shrieked at the top of his lungs and began running around like a chicken with its head cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Daniel was far too panicked to even hear you as he tore around the lab in a pigtailed frenzy, frantically waving his arms in the air as if he was trying to dislodge the, admittedly, very cute red gloves that sheathed those dainty little hands of his. You knew Daniel was prone to anxiety attacks when confronted with truly troublesome situations but those normally consisted of loud, angry swearing and copious smashing of things. The sobbing and flailing about, though, that was new to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab him! He's gonna end up hurting himself of breaking something!\" Jordan cried as she leapt at him, trying to pin down Daniel's now much smaller figure as he flailed about and wailed in an almost comical fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he actually crying <i>waterfall tears</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka-chan! Stop staring like a zombie and help me! Honoka-chan you too!\" Jordan's flying tackle missed the twin-tailed blur narrowly and she slammed into the ground in an undignified heap, snapping you out of your disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai hai! Come here Meikko<sup><i>niece</i></sup>-chan!\" Honoka chirped happily with a mock salute, joining your purple haired friend in her attempts to subdue your hysterical cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhhhh <i>good</i>, now your Okaa-chan was calling Daniel her <i>niece</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaaaaa!\" Daniel cried, tears literally streaming from his watery ruby eyes, \"Kore wa okori enai! <sup>This can't be happening!</sup>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, Meikko-chan!\" Honoka had nearly grabbed him, her fingers just barely grazing the baggy pants that, somehow, still clung to Daniel's diminutive figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash encompassed them for a moment and the fabric came alive. The baggy black sweatpants Daniel preferred to wear billowed upwards, their length shrinking until they were barely a quarter of their original length, exposing miles of creamy white flesh not unlike your own. The fabric seemed to tear and flutter, the color flushing a vibrant shade of red that matched the gloves he wore. A layer of darker crimson ruffles emerged from underneath the skirt, for it could be nothing else at this point, as pleating and thin plaid red striping emerged from the formerly uniform fabric. A glittering gold chain snaked out from the hem, a black bow adoring it, while a layered bundle of black ruffles emerged from the right hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel skidded to a halt, looking at the, to you anyway, rather sexy-looking ruffled black and red miniskirt that hung from his boyish hips in utter <i>horror</i>. He'd stopped! This was your chance before he started running around again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" you cried, sprinting and practically tackling Daniel like a football player, the two of you slamming into the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumbled head over heels, your hips ending up straddling your frantic cousin's tiny figure. He squirmed a struggled under you, tear-filled ruby eyes darting back and forth in sheer panic, now compounded by the newly changed skirt that covered his lower half. It was clear he wasn't going to calm down and all that thrashing might allow him to get free, so you pinned his arms over his head with one of yours, using your slightly bigger size and weight to keep them pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SLAP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou delivered a rather merciless, open-palmed slap to his left cheek with your free hand, the sharp crack and the sudden sting of pain as his head jerked to the side causing him to go rigid, his comical sobbing going silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are <i>*huff*</i> are you <i>*huff*</i> are you going to calm down now or <i>*huff*</i> am I gonna have to slap you again <i>*huff*</i>?\" you panted, cheeks flushed with exertion. It was clear your shapely new female body wasn't nearly as suited for such physical activities as your old body was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel turned his head back to you, his pale cheek already sporting an angry red hand print. His eyes were still wide, but they didn't seem to have the frantic and frenzied look they'd had before. Your impromptu slap seemed to have shocked him out of it. For a moment, neither of you moved save for your heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you ok, now? Have you calmed down?\" you asked again, still breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stared at you before nodding slowly, exhaling deeply, \"Y-yeah... yeah, I... I think I'm good now... gomen<sup><i>sorry</i></sup>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced a bit, the Japanese word for <i>sorry </i>that your cousin had just uttered didn't give you much comfort. It seemed like whatever the \"Miracle Cure\" did, it only halted the changes for a scant moment before they smacked into him like a freight train. As you straddled him, you couldn't help but see how small he was now. He was downright petite in a way that even your own shorter, feminine figure wasn't. His eyes, too vibrant a red to be natural, looked huge on his face which, though you still easily recognized it as your cousin's, looked practically androgynous now. The inky black hair and pigtails did little to help, making him look almost doll-like with his soft, smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ecchi... ecchi-musume-chan~\" Honoka interrupted the silence with a quiet giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heads both snapped to stare at Honoka who was trying her best to look at anything but you, he cheeks flushed heavily and playing with a lock of her orange hair in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori, <i>Jordan</i>, on the other hand, was starting at you both with wide, unblinking, green eyes, her cheeks as red as you hair and a tiny trickle of blood leaking from her nose. She was fiddling aggressively with one of her own pigtails and seemed to actually have <i>steam </i>shooting off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As... as much as I'd love to let you guys sit like that and burn this image into my brain forever...\" the purplette said slowly, her cheeks darkening further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you blinked in confusion, looking down at Daniel's equally confused, and <i>increasingly </i>cute, features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed deeply. In the act of tackling and subduing Daniel, you skirt had ridden up even more, revealing more of your, frankly, <i>incredible </i>legs as you straddled his waist. To the outside observer, it looked like a lovely redheaded girl in a school uniform in a suggestive position atop an equally cute black haired girl in a frilly skirt, ignoring the still very boyish figure under those baggy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically leapt off Daniel, your cheeks flushed as red as your hair in embarrassment, refusing to meet anyone's eyes. Daniel got to his feet slowly, his tiny hands tugging nervously on his ill-fitting new skirt, his cheeks equally red. He, like you, refused to make eye contact with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... we have a bit of problem...\" Kaori continued slowly, wiping the blood off her nose, looking oddly serious despite her comically flushed cheeks.</span></div></div>",

What could add to that of all things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Kaori slowly pointed a finger behind you and Daniel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Daniel cocked his head a bit before turning to see what Kaori was pointing to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iieeeeeeeeeeeee!\" he began to cry out once again, his small hands going to the top of his black-haired head. \"Sorerade wanai!\" <sup>Not those!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle sparkles were forming up all over the lab, and you noticed them as places Daniel had run through while he was crying. Come to think of it, there was a funny feeling in the air. Hard to describe but...there was something you could tell that much. Felt like a certain energy if you could describe it somehow. Honestly, feeling it kind of gave you a similar sensation to the J-Pop music from earlier. Well, whatever the case was, they were beginning to shine brighter and brighter, beginning to engulf everything they were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totemo akaruku!\" <sup>So bright</sup> Honoka covered her eyes dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Daniel's chemicals and other such scientific instruments began to morph and change. Some even began to began to combine into larger forms. The one closest to you stretched out into something long and thin before popping into something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...a guitar?\" you asked, one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwa \u0304,\" <sup>Wow</sup> Honoka's smile widened and her eyes sparkled. \"It's really shiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was in stunned silence as he watched things continue to change. More and more, his scientific instruments continued to change into more musical instruments. And there were quite a few of them too, some of them small, and others not so small. Many of them modern, and some even looking some old-style Japanese ones as well. Aside from those, the computers he had around (to which you had always said he had too many), all began sparkling and shifting as well. They were already pretty well up to date technology-wise, so nothing changed in that regard, but their shape changed into something very difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...is that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...that's an audio mixer....or something,\" Jordan put one hand to her cheek, a bit more under control at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like....a recording studio,\" Daniel spoke up for the first time in a while, still as stunned as before though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of that was punctuated when a space in the room was magically cleared out, making all of you jump in the air comically. Some glass walls formed over a decently-sized space, complete with microphones and headphones, and just about anything else one would need to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, any traces of Daniel's old lab were gone, completely changed to a top of the line recording studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore wa tada. ... Akka shite iru.\" <sup>It's just....getting worse.</sup> Kaori, <i>Jordan</i>, spoke again, worry still evident in her soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kore wa kakko\u012b!\" <sup>This looks cool!</sup> Honoka cried out, jumping in the air excitedly. \"I want to try this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinaide kudasai,\" You asked your okaa-chan sincerely to not do that before turning to Daniel. \"It...might not be safe here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, things were getting even more out of control. This was even more extreme than your garage changing earlier. And what was that earlier with seeing Daniel actually do waterfall tears among other things? It...was almost really like something out of an anime, like an illustration of water pouring from Daniel's eyes. It was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you had even noticed visible sweatdrops and other such things of late. Was that a further sign of things to come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh........ahhhhhh.....\" You heard Daniel cry a bit, making you turn your head back to him. What you were seeing made your eyes widen a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's changes weren't stopping in light of this. His t-shirt was becoming more form-fitting to his smaller frame, and turning more of a pure white too. The sleeves puffed up slightly while some fluff formed around the edges to hold them closer to his thin arms. The torso of the shirt continued to gain new designs over the front, giving off a somewhat feathery impression of a blouse if you could call it one. A big kicker though was near the bottom where the shirt started to part a little, showing off his naval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Daniel blushed heavily, wanting to cover that but not having much to cover with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore cloth covered the top part of the shirt, with some black frilling underneath. The front of it became punctuated when a pink bow appeared out of nowhere, resting gently on his chest. Another piece of cloth emerged from the changed top, wrapping around his neck to form a cute little choker made of cloth had suited the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't really surprise you, Jordan, or Honoka, given how it kind of seemed inevitable at this point. Daniel just stared at it, as if his brain was frozen in shock. Nobody seemed to be making much of a move though, making for an awkward silence aside from some high-pitched whimpering from Daniel every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on....\" you spoke up, trying to get everyone's attention. \"We should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Asuka-chan?\" Daniel suddenly spoke up, his ruby eyes lighting up a little at his words. \"Y-Your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" you said, before looking down. \"Nani?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour school uniform was beginning to light up, specifically starting at the spots where Daniel touched earlier. It was quickly spreading throughout your whole ensemble, engulfing the whole thing. Your mind went through the potential possibilities. Was it going to be an idol outfit like Daniel's?</span></div></div>",

His disturbingly androgynous features were screwed up in what looked like severe discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-ano, Daniel, daij\u014dbu<sup><i>are you alright</i></sup>?\u201d you weren\u2019t sure why you even bothered asking that question, it was clear that Daniel was definitely<i> not alright</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own sparkling outfit suddenly seemed far less important. Daniel\u2019s \u201cmiracle cure\u201d seemed to make his physical transformations far more uncomfortable than yours or Jordan\u2019s or Honoka\u2019s , as if whatever force was at work was punishing him for daring to interfere with said changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel trembled slightly, his huge ruby eyes squeezing shut as his face began to change again, what little masculinity being swallowed by the encroachment of girlhood that had him in its ever tightening grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face seemed to crush in on itself, the sharp lines rounding out into a far more feminine heart shape with soft, full cheeks and pale pink lips that gleamed with a slight gloss that hadn\u2019t been there before, much like your own. His new face was notably rounder than your own somewhat aristocratic looking features, adding an irresistibly cute charm to it versus your own more elegant and beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-itai...\u201d Daniel whimpered slightly, his still somewhat male sounding voice wavering for a moment before settling into a high pitched, frankly adorable, sounding thing. It, like yours, Jordan\u2019s, and Honoka\u2019s, had a very distinct musical quality to it and you were certain, for some indescribable reason, sounded like a <i>beautiful</i> singing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeary red eyes opened again, newly darkened and volumed lashes sweeping across his eyelids as Daniel\u2019s skin skewed away from the swarthy freckle-dusted complexion he always had and swiftly replacing it with a pale cream color, utterly bare of any blemish, almost translucent looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beautiful skin, you noted with a strange tinge of jealousy that seemed to come from deep inside your mind. It was notably lighter than your own peach toned skin, contrasting wonderfully with Daniel\u2019s rich black pigtails and vibrant ruby eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a face like that, he was utterly <i>adorable</i>. Honestly, he almost looked like a porcelain doll, like something that needed a good cuddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Asuka-itoko?\u201d Daniel whispered, \u201cI feel...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know Daniel,\u201d you tried to console the tiny girly looking boy that was your cousin, \u201cjust breath, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s pretty face grimaced, but complied, taking deep steadying breaths as his body continued to betray him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis already tiny figure seemed to reproportion itself under his blouse and skirt, his waist whittling down into a more narrowed, toned curve while his hips bloomed outward into a slightly fuller, rounder shape  while still remaining very petite. His pale legs, almost entirely exposed by the ruffled red and black mini skirt shifted, looked longer and more shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite these new curves, with her tiny size, he almost appeared like a small girl that looked much younger than she actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d Daniel shrieked, his arms crossing over his chest as his pale cheeks flushed fire engine red. Based on his reaction, it was pretty obvious what had just grown in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-ah... did... do you have...?\u201d You tried to ask, only to receive an angry, embarrassed glare in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrusai <sup><i>shut up</i></sup>...!\u201d Daniel hissed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flicked down to your own chest and then to Kaori\u2019s and then to Honoka\u2019s and his angry expression seemed to get even more so. He patted his chest and began to grumble under his breath with his cheeks puffed up. Did he look <i>jealous</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...its not <b>fair</b>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted uncomfortably. Daniel\u2019s reaction was eerily similar to your own reaction to Kaori\u2019s much more ample chest back when you had both changed. A part of you pitied him a bit. Though, <i>your</i> breasts were at least respectably sized, and not that mosquito bites that Daniel had likely been <i>blessed</i> with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stiffened abruptly and blanched, his envious expression being replaced with a look of horror as his tiny fingers pressed against the front of his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps it was <i>her</i> skirt now, judging by the horrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel slowly reached down and gripped the ruffled hem of the skirt and pulled up. A pair of rather innocent looking white panties with pink lace greeted your wandering eyes, utterly devoid of any trace of Daniel\u2019s former masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEcchi-itoko-chan...\u201d Honoka\u2019s whispered in Daniel\u2019s ear while the twintailed girl was preoccupied with her new equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shrieked in surprise, practically warping across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-stop doing that, baka-oba-chan<sup><i> stupid aunt</i></sup>!\u201d She hissed, holding her skirt down with an embarrassed flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhe...,\u201d Honoka at least had the decency to look sorry though she was doing a poor job concealing her giggles, \u201cGomen, meikko-chan...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel glared at the orangette before she turned her attention back to you, or more specifically, your sparkling outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the commotion with Daniel\u2019s newfound foray into girlhood, you\u2019d  forgotten all about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy.</span></div></div>",

Seriously though, why was it happening? It was a surprisingly slow change as well, given you just witnessed the remainder of Daniel's transformation in the meanwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right as you were feeling that, your phone started to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hont\u014dni? Ima?\" <sup>Really? Now?</sup> you groaned. However, once you happened to glance at the call number, you noticed it as your home phone. \"It might be Susie or Victoria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should answer it...probably...\" Kaori piped in. \"We left Susie-chan alone....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Kaori lightly slapping her forehead on that. Seemed like honorifics were just coming into everything that came out of your mouths now. Honka and...Daniel still having words, words that were more in Japanese than anything else. Daniel's vocabulary seemed to be growing pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anata wa totemo kawa\u012b, meikko-chan,\" <sup>You're very cute</sup> chirped Honoka. \"Daniel is not very kawaii though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just groaned under the her aunt's star-filled gaze, feeling a whole bunch of emotions she wasn't used to feeling. In a sort of twisted way, seeing him become a bright Japanese girl was honestly quite amusing given his reactions, even though you still felt sorry for him. In any case though, you finally answered your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa,\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hello?\" Susie's squeaky voice came out. \"Uh, is Alex there? I'm hungry and Mom is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went a little red. Crap, in all the commotion, you had left Susie more or less alone since Victoria tended to mind her own business when it came to being around the house. You did after all just take a brief little trip all the way outside just to visit your cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, m\u014dsugu ie ni kaerimasu!\" <sup>Uh, we'll be home again soon!</sup> you cried out, only getting more confusion from Susie on the other side. \"Uh...we'll be home soon....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you Alex's friend?\" Susie asked, clearly not having any idea it was you. \"And why do you have his phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...honestly had no idea how to answer her question, and you could feel the strangeness of whatever your clothes were becoming sinking in. Your sleeves felt like they were becoming longer and a lot looser, and your shirt was like it was wrapping itself closer on to your torso. Bright colors of red, pink, and white were beginning to cover the garment, with a rainbow of colors beginning to color your skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.....Say\u014dnara!\" you cried out, hanging the phone up, immediately regretting it. \"That was terrible. We need to get back home. Susie's getting worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get much of a reply, though Kaori seemed to be looking straight at you, and Honoka and Daniel had actually stopped their conversation to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anata no fuku....\" <sup>Your clothes....</sup> Daniel's new voice spoke out. \"Soshite kami\" <sup>And hair</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened a bit, you looked down to see what had become of them. Some of the sparkles were beginning to die down, revealing how your top now resembled a short kimono. The colors had arranged in many flowery designs across the whole thing, a tapestry of beauty in all honesty. An obi of many colors including red, pink, white, and pink had now covered your waist, keeping the short kimono nice and snug on you. The skirt was about the same length as before, but now shimmering in many colors. Furthermore, your socks and shoes had become a pair of tabi and rubber geta, with their own decorations that added to the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and as for Daniel's last comment there? Apparently while you were busy \"trying\" to hold a conversation with Susie, your hair had braided itself into a new and neat hairstyle, perfectly kept up as if done by an expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.schoolido.lu/cards/transparent/989idolizedTransparent.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.schoolido.lu/cards/transparent...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went beat red at the sight of your new look. Honoka's eyes had literal stars in them again, which didn't surprise you. Though, when you turned to Kaori, you could see her turning her head quickly, a slight trail of red coming from her nose. You sighed at that. Seriously, that again? That was getting out of hand. Well, at least it was just her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you happened to glance over at Daniel. Her ruby eyes were incredibly wide.....and she had a very distinct trail of red coming down her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nidoto nai!\" <sup>Not again!</sup> you cried out, waving your arms up and down exaggeratedly. </span></div></div>",

You already knew that your new female body was a bit of a knockout from the get-go, but your new outfit and artfully done hairstyle made your incredible looks shine like a star, so much so that you couldn't look away from your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short kimono that had been transfigured from your school uniform was absolutely <i>beautiful</i>. Vibrant shades of reds, pinks, and whites drew attention to your creamy skin and vibrant red hair and eyes and really made them <i>pop</i>. The stylized obi was wound snugly around your waist, hinting at the perfectly slender but curvy figure that lay beneath, tied off with cords of red and white in the shape of a flower with dangling tassels that hung near the hem of your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Utsukushii<sup><i>beautiful.</i></sup>...,\" you couldn't help but whisper and, before you could stop yourself, did a slow twirl in the mirror, exposing the large red bow that fanned out behind your obi and causing your skirt to flutter out beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this exposed one teeny little problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stopped twirling, you found Daniel and Kaori, whose cheeks were fire-engine red, frantically trying to stem nosebleeds. Honoka was still giving you that starstruck look, with her eyes gleaming like actual stars. You flushed, pushing down on your skirt. The one problem with your new outfit was that your kimono skirt was just as short as your school uniform's miniskirt had been and exposed the vast majority of your, frankly, <i>incredible</i> legs and likely a brief flash of your panties, judging by Daniel's and Kaori's reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jitto mitsumenaide<sup><i>stop staring at me!</i></sup>!\" you hissed, your flush deepening as you glared at your \"admirers\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it...,\" Daniel mumbled, twirling one of her pigtails cutely, the bloody tissues inexplicably stuffed in her nose somewhat ruining the cute image she was unknowingly giving off. She occasionally snuck glances at you through her bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So kawaii...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumari, anata wa chotto atsui<sup><i>I mean, you're kind of hot</i></sup>...,\" Kaori admitted without an ounce of shame, her big green eyes still locked on your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed an even deeper shade of red, your entire face almost turning the same shade as your hair and steam leaking out of your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah, Kaori-chan, you're creeping me out a bit...\" you mumbled, hugging yourself self consciously at your purple haired friend's intense stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiiiiiiiiii<sup><i>stare</i></sup>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned slowly, only to find your orange-haired kaa-chan's face inches away from your own, her blue eyes opened wide and sparkling like sapphires. She looked down at her white outfit and back to your kimono and her eyes flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuuuusssssuuuummmeee-chaaaaaan!\" Honoka squealed, executing perfect flying tackle as she hurled herself at you with stars in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah Kaa-chan, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Honoka's grabby fingers made contact with your outfit, a bright flash covered her own clothing. The white uniform she had <i>just </i>\"created\" from Daniel's tests rapidly transfigured itself into something new, something familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jacket and blouse slimmed down, conforming more snugly to her chest and waist while her sleeves rapidly lengthened and billowed out into wide bell-shapes. A wide obi with a large bow adorning the back emerged where her belt once sat, with stylized cords tied in the shape of a flower and tassels just like yours. Her skirt fluttered out wider and layered fabric formed over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the formerly white garment flushed with color. Vibrant shades of oranges and yellows emerged like the sunrise after a long night, and intricate flower patterns emerged, crawling across the top and skirt. Matching tabi socks and geta encased her tiny feet where her boots once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/d4166c1331666017\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/d4166c1331...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka giggled and pressed your flushed face into her not-insubstantial bosom, now dressed in a kimono that was, more or less, an orange and yellow variant of the kimono you now wore. And, like your kimono on your own beautiful figure, it looked <i>great </i>on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look musume-chan! We match!\" She squealed, smashing your face further into \"marshmallow hell\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori and Daniel slowly looked at each other and then back to the <i>stimulating </i>image before them and promptly flew backwards from  sudden explosive nosebleeds, landing in twitching heaps on the ground, both of their faces glowing red and spirals in their eyes. Kaori even had a slightly suggestive grin on her face and was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop Kaa-chan! Yamete!\" you struggled vainly against your mother's embrace.</span></div></div>",

Funny how you would have actually enjoyed this more before today, if you had a girlfriend. However, this being your former mom and being a girl yourself now, this didn't feel nearly like what you would have wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaa-chan! Yamete!\" you repeated those same words, eventually pulling yourself out of Honoka's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, kawaii,\" Honoka giggled, flaunting her skirt a bit, a little more willing to show off her own legs, which showed off her panties a bit too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaa-chan!\" you cried out again. \"You don't need to be so....flashy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, but that's the best part,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a groan signaled that Daniel and Kaori were coming to. Daniel was wiping the blood off from her nose, trying to look at least somewhat more composed. Honestly, all that blood from the nosebleed was pretty much gone, just like in your average anime. Seriously, where was all that coming from? It looked so out of place compared to the real world. Not that it made any less sense than anything else that had been happening so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori was still giggling a bit, her face res as she was getting up. Seeing this sort of thing from Jordan of all people was perhaps ones of the weirdest things. Seriously, when did she become so pervy? Just thinking on that reminded you from when she grabbed your breasts earlier. That still felt just as embarrassing right now as it did back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they got up, Honoka smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itchi suru autoshitto ga hitsuy\u014ddesu!\"<sup>We should all have matching outfits!</sup> she jumped in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as your eyes widened at what she said, you pulled her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaa-chan! What about Susie?!\" you cried back. \"We need to go back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai hai,\" Honoka shrugged, not taking any apparent offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it really was about time to leave, given it was near mid-day now. You didn't want to risk changing more of the mansion, and you imagined Daniel didn't either. With that, you ran over and helped him up while Honoka grabbed Kaori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen'nasai,\" you said as you pulled Daniel along. \"We just got you dragged into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daij\u014dbudayo,\" Daniel said, still feeling about the same as she did before. Honestly it was startling how much shorter she was now compared to you. \"It's....just a new experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell Daniel was trying to keep an air of composure like she used to, but it was clear it was hard to to do so. Kind of like how Kaori had some new qualities, it seemed like Daniel had some too, whatever those were. You had to admit though, getting a closer look, she was indeed super beautiful. Her skin especially looked wonderful. Honestly, you felt a similar kind of jealousy compared to Kaori's large breasts. Funny how you all seemed a little more sensitive regarding your bodies now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you wondered how to even call Daniel right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...Daniel?\"you asked as you were coming down the last set of stairs. \"You...have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked a little confused as to what you had meant, though it barely took a second for there to be a sparkle in her ruby eyes like some sudden realization. Granted, you could tell the idea embarrassed her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naomi.....\" she queaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naomi-chan?\" you spoke almost instinctively. You actually smiled at that. \"Sore wa kawa\u012b namaedesu.\" <sup>That's a cute name</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel' face went red at that, though it felt like she held your hand a little tighter as you were pulling her out of the mansion. You had to wonder about the last time she even went out of here. Still, it was pretty cute to see her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, that IS kawaii!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sadly, the worst possible person heard it. Right when you weren't looking, Honoka appeared from behind Daniel, wrapping her up in a big hug that started making her outfit glow just like yours. Daniel stuttered as the inevitable changes started, her old idol outfit transforming into a matching short pink kimono. An assortment of white flower designs adorned the outfit, with some orange tassel and an obi that resembled your own to an extent. A little pink flower even adorned itself around her left pigtail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all intents and purposes, it was very similar in theme aside from a little more flutter on the skirt. One little difference though were the socks, which almost looked more like white stockings that reached her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Daniel was left to stutter in her new outfit, you actually had to suppress a nosebleed yourself. Seriously, being that cute should be a crime. She was so much like an adorable doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we match!\" Honoka cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, during their trip downstairs, Honoka had taken the liberty of changing Kaori's as well. Hers was by far the darkest theme, that or a vibrant purple with its own flower arrangements. Some lighter colors adorned the bottom of the skirt, but otherwise it was a dark contrast to the other brighter uniforms. No less cute though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell....if Honoka was satisfied, what were you to do about it now? You sighed as you took it all in, seeing you all in matching kimono outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subarash\u012b. ... S\u0101ik\u014d!\" <sup>Great....now let's go!</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that order, you finally got everyone to head into the car. Time to get back before things got worse for Susie.</span></div></div>",

God, it might be <i>the</i> country album.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cobalt blue sky stretched across the landscape of the CD, the field of grain and cherry red barn completing the assembly of primary colors. The brown moonshine jug in the foreground shattered that aesthetic to pieces, along with the title \u2014 you had to stifle a giggling fit, lest it undo you \u2014 \u2018Jean Shorts and Dirt Roads\u2019, in a black blotchy-paint-font.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t exactly <i>hate</i> country; Johnny Cash was a decent listen, Willie Nelson was alright, and, hell, Marty Robbins scored a good deal of your virtual treks through the Mojave. But songs of the \u2018country pop\u2019 genre \u2014 as you\u2019ve heard it called \u2014 all seem to be about pickup trucks, denim, beer, and barn-adjacent parties. Judging by its art, this album seemed to be of the latter variety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet travel towards your computer half-automatically.  Morbid fascination thrums through your body like electricity. You <i>have</i> to see what this album is like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop down in your computer chair and open the disc drive on your PC, catching the name on the disc: \u2018Brandi Staxx\u2019. God, this is going to be <i>wonderful</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You do some cursory Googling while the disc whirls to life in your tower. But, confusingly enough, you can\u2019t turn up any results for the album. You turn up a few near-misses for the name, but they all belong to adult film stars or strippers. Figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be a debut.\u201d you mutter to yourself. But curiously enough, the record label doesn\u2019t even seem to exist. How could that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Explorer window pops up with the disc\u2019s data, as if to interrupt your thoughts. You nearly bust a gut at the song titles: \u2018Nothin\u2019 Hotter Than A Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u2019 and \u2018Rollin\u2019 Around in the Harvested Hay\u2019 being two particular highlights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly start the transfer of your songs to your iPhone. This\u2019d be great to show the guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snag your phone after a few seconds of data transfer, ready to listen to some absolute <i>dreck</i>, but you\u2019re stopped by\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried really hard to not focus on that ellipses, and the implication it carried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yeah, Ted was cool. He even gave you your first beer three years back. You hated it, sure, but it was the thought, and not the boisterous laughter coming from him, that counted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been enlisted, through the contractor Heidi Tucker, to help him at his place of work for three or four hours.

Average house, average family, average looks... just average <i>everything</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou name is Alexander J Tucker, or more commonly, just Alex. You're, unsurprisingly, a pretty average kid of seventeen, 5'11, slim but sinewy build. You're a bit of a misanthropic shut-in with a few close friends, love strategy and racing games and have a mild obsession with messing around under the hoods of old classic cars. Despite your rather cynical outlook, you're an annoyingly <i>average</i> and unremarkable brown haired, brown eyed kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi Tucker nee Hewitt (Your Mother) - A 39-year old mother of three. She had apparently been a bombshell when she was younger but the strain of giving birth and raising 3 children all on her own while having very little time for herself lead her to put on a lot of weight. She's a kindhearted woman, if a little clingy towards her children, who does her best to provide for her family. She's the very image of the Hewitt-clan, pale skinned, green eyes, and deep red hair. She's fairly short at 5'2 with a thickly set, pear shaped figure with a very generous bustline (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/83/94/90/839490247f5a64205c95340dd2baba3d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/83/94/90/839490247f5a64205c95340dd2baba3d.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Tucker (Your Elder Sister) - 19 years old, a freshman in college, and queen bitch. You and Victoria, or Tori as she prefers to be called, have never really gotten along. There might have been a time you two could be in a room together without devolving into verbal sparring but ever since she got to high school, those days had long since come to an end. To you, she's the very image of a spoiled, stuck up, hot girl with a nasty attitude that could curdle milk. Like her Mother, she is the very picture of the Hewitt genes, with the same eye color, skin tone, and red hair as your mother with none of the extra weight. She's hot and she knows it. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thumb-p9.xhcdn.com/a/3t0ZoW7UgHLtDIWA5QjsyA/000/229/267/249_1000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://thumb-p9.xhcdn.com/a/3t0ZoW7UgHLtDIWA5QjsyA/000/229/267/249_1000.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanna Tucker (Your Younger Sister) - 10 years old and a hyperactive little hellion. She's a mischievous little imp who's deceptively intelligent behind her childish bearing and knows how to wind your mom around her little finger. She's strong with the Hewitt genes with the same red hair, pale skin, and greenish blue eyes as both Victoria and your Mother. She's a tiny thing, only 3'8, but already showing signs of the same sort of beauty as your Mother and Elder Sister. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d8/f8/04/d8f80414e89807ee6e32a22e7a5ab68f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d8/f8/04/d8f80414e89807ee6e32a22e7a5ab68f.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrianna Newman nee Hewitt (Your Aunt) - A deceptively youthful looking woman of 42, she hardly looks her age, appearing in her early thirties. She has the typical Hewitt-clan vibrant red hair and creamy pale skin, though she is unique in the fact that she's heterochromic, with on brown eye and one green. She has a bombshell hourglass figure with the perfect amount of curves, and large breasts. She inherited the old Hewitt family manor and all of its mysteries. Her teasing nature hides her true motives (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrIEBzhW4AArihu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrIEBzhW4AArihu.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina Newman (Your Aunt's Daughter) - The very image of a breathtaking example of fine breeding, your 21-year old cousin Christina could certainly turn heads. Unfortunately, like your sister, she has a fair bit of Queen Bitch Syndrome, though to a lesser extent. While she never goes out of her way to bother you, neither does she treat you particularly kindly, preferring a standoffish and distant attitude. She has the typical Hewitt family red hair, pale white skin, and green eyes. She's arguably more beautfiul than Victoria with her hourglass fiugre, lovely face, and D-cup breasts. The sort of beauty that turns heads without trying. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CXwBrl0WkAQtyCf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CXwBrl0WkAQtyCf.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Newman (Your Aunt's Son) - The sole exception to the rule, your 19 year old cousin Daniel is the only male in your mother's side of the family to have the Hewitt red hair and green eyes. He's a notorious shut in and has a disdain for most of humankind. He is incredibly intelligent, having graduated from MIT when he was 15. You and him get a long fairly well, being the \"family rejects\" with bitchy sisters. He's a good looking, if scruffy guy and always looks like he'd prefer to be anywhere else.

An expectant single mother to be, she still does her best to teach her classes to the best of her ability despite being heavily pregnant. She has a bit of a soft spot for you and often relies on your help in class given her reduced mobility. A lovely woman with a beautiful face, warm brown eyes, and silky blonde hair, she's the subject of many a crush from her male students, yourself included (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/jizzbanger/3927509/962886493/Pregnant3686.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/jizzbanger/3927509/962886493/Pregnant3686.jp...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay Riker (Classmate) - 17 years old and a rare exception to the hot/popular girl has to be a stuck up bitch stereotype. Lindsay has been your classmate for a long time, she's pretty, and a member of the school dance team, and has been one of the few popular kids to treat you kindly. She's the very image of a high school beauty with tanned skin, soft blonde hair, a slender figure, and modest C-cup breasts. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/d172871328152985\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/d172871328152985</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie Adams (Classmate) - 17 years old and one of your few female friends. Both of you have been the butt of ridicule from the popular crowd and it became a way for you two to bond as friends. A sarcastic girl with strong country accent and a pension for getting her hands dirty, you two had been friends since freshman year. She's of average height, about 5'5, a slightly chubby and busty figure, and strawberry blond hair. She wears braces to fix her bad teeth and becomes quickly agitated when they're mentioned. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn5-images.motherlessmedia.com/images/65EF1AB.jpg?fs=opencloud\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn5-images.motherlessmedia.com/images/65EF1AB.jpg?fs=opencloud</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia Talbot (Neighbor) - 19 years old, Sophia and her family moved in next door not long ago. Sweet and good-natured, Sophia has that girl-next-door charm to go with her good looks. She's quite literally Victoria's polar opposite in terms of attitude, which has you nursing a not-so-tiny crush on her. She's a somewhat short thing, about 5'1, with a very busty figure with just a hint of chubbiness to her, long glossy black hair, dark brown eyes, and glasses (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/f2/f3/39f2f33be8aba26a6fd71f34d887667a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/f2/f3/39f2f33be8aba26a6fd71f34d887667a.jpg</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina Fortes - 19 years old, and your sister's best friend from college, Carolina, though she prefers to go by Carrie, is a bit of an odd fit. A half-blooded girl with a Filipino father and American mother, she's quite the looker, with copper toned skin typical of Filipinos and long, thick and silky black hair, slender, supple figure, with legs, ass and hips that you've not-so-secretly ogled many times. She tends to dress in snug clothing, usually tank tops and yoga pants, that's easy to move around in given her place on the University's cheerleading team. Unlike Victoria though, Carrie seems to be a genuinely friendly and outgoing person, making her friendship with your elder sister a bit of an odd thing. She's at your house quite a bit with school being out for the summer (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/7397161333700134\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/7397161333700134</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your humdrum life of woe and misery, summer vacation has just begun. The weather is heating up and school has come to and end. All things considered, it's a normal summer for a normal kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, however, your life as you know it is about to change drastically.<br>\r\n<u><br>\r\nHowdy!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to the story! I only have a couple of rules for those that want to add to the story. The subject matter is TG TF related but it can realistically be anything you want, just no smut and such, m'may?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1: Use proper grammar! Try and keep the nonsense speak and crap spelling and punctuation out of here, m'kay? I'll be watching, children. If things get too nasty I'll likely edit them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2: Try and refrain from overly simplistic changes and additions. So none of \"Suddenly he had tits and stuff, da end\" m'kay? This is a place where a well written change is appreciated and encouraged. Unless its a chapter solely for choices, keep things longer than a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3: Don't intentionally dead-end chapters, I'll step in and edit them up a bit if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4: Go nuts! Have fun with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, go crazy.<br>\r\nWarmest Regards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpookyNoodles</td>",
