He was finally here, he made it to college. His mind was racing and his palms sweat as he began to panic over the coming school year. Just then, Mary came in and gently picked him up. \"What's the matter, sweetie? Nervous?\" Sam nodded. Mary giggled, \"You'll be fine. We're taking almost the same schedule!\" Sam remembered. They were both culinary arts majors and would be in a lot of the same classes. Though Sam was focused more on baking.while Mary was looking into catering. Sam let out a sigh of relief as the last of the boxes were brought up. Mary hugged her mother as she waved goodbye and left. \"Well, Sammy. Here we are. A college couple.\" she giggled again as she gently kissed Sam. Her soft, crimson lips pressed against his entire body as he blushed bright red. \"Well, you be safe, dear. I have to buy our books. You stay put and don't go wandering. You might end up a meal.\" Mary giggled as she shut the door behind her. Sam found himself alone in the apartment. He decided to take a nap and was heading to his custom-fit bed when suddenly the door knocked, and without waiting for a response it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was at the door?</span></div></div>",

The RA!\" Sam was going to have to get used to her personality but she seemed nice enough. He introduced himself and was taken off guard as Cathy scooped him up and pressed him tight against her chest, not that Sam was complaining about this fact. She was pretty cute. \"Aren't you just the cutest thing! I'm going to love you to pieces.\" And before Sam could say another word he was quickly escorted out of the apartment and down the hall in a blur as she flew to her apartment and slammed the door behind her. She dropped Sam on her bed and plopped down beside him, smiling wide. \"I am so glad I found you! I was sooooo lonely. But now I got a new pet and I am so happy!\" Sam was confused and began to protest, \"I'm not a pet! I'm a student, like you.\" Cathy's expression turned grim, \"Are you back talking? I'm in charge and you'll obey lest you end up dead. Understood?\" Sam nodded his head and Cathy snapped back to her bubbly attitude from earlier, \"Great! You're going to have so much fun! Just watch out for Celeste.\" Sam was concerned, \"Uh. Who's Celeste?\" Cathy responded, \"My apartment mate, she hates me and always breaks my pets.\" Sam became even more worried. But he couldn't dare escape and face Cathy's wrath. He was snapped out of his thoughts when he heard Cathy's voice again, \"So, what do you want to do today? Classes don't start for another day, so we can have fun! Oh! I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Cathy have planned for the day?</span></div></div>",

It was a comfy trek down to the college green where the festival was held. Sam was in awe. There were numerous stalls set up, food stalls, student organization stalls, face painting stalls, everything a festival would have. There were rides and games. He figured something wasn't right but Cathy was moving too fast for him to think straight. She bounced from stall to stall, trying food, winning prizes and the like. She barely paid Sam any attention. So it was no surprise that when she was bumped by a passing student, causing Sam to fall out, she didn't notice. Sam was now lost at the festival. Numerous students walking all around him, he knew he had to get help soon or end up crushed. He couldn't read any of the signs so he just headed to the closest stall and hoped for the best. It was risky, but better than the alternative. Sam ventured out and approach the stall, the nailed 2x4 boards and uneven paint job was a dead give away that is was constructed at the last minute. He chuckled to himself and went around back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich stall was he at? </span></div></div>",

The fresh aroma of pastry and the warm smell of cooked food was enough for Sam to realize he hadn't eaten all day. But he needed to get the stall attendant's attention. He began to climb her denim jean leg, the large seams provided a nice holding. He was able to quickly climb up the pants and leap over to the counter. After a short scream from Sam, the student discovered him and gently picked him up. She had long black hair, green eyes, heavy makeup and a filled out body. \"Hiya, little guy. You must be new to school. I'm Sara.\" Sam introduced himself and told Sara what had happened and that he needed to get back to Mary. Sara listened but seemed to have different plans in mind. \"You know what? That sounds fine and all but I got a better plan.\" Sam was nervous but curiosity got the better of him. \"What's your plan?\" He asked. Sara grinned an evil grin, \"You'll see soon enough, little one. Just hold on tight.\" Sam was scared now and he had to get away. While Sara was dealing with a customer, he made a break for it and began to run. Sara spotted him and quickly slammed her hand down on him. \"Not so fast now. You haven't heard my plan yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was her plan? </span></div></div>",

Sam was now trapped and could do nothing but just wait it out and see what she had planned for him. He soon dozed off, and before he knew it, the zipper was reopened and Sam was removed to find himself in a standard dorm room. \"Welcome home, little guy.\" Sara said as she grabbed some water from the micro fridge. From out the window he could see it was now evening. \"Let me go! I'm a student!\" Sam yelled at the giant woman almost causing her to choke on her water from laughter. Sara sat down the water, sat on her bed and turned her head to Sam on the desk. \"You don't know, do you?\" Sara asked, \"If you go missing, the school doesn't care. It's finders-keepers. And I'm keeping you!\" And with that Sara got back up and proceeded to make herself a simple PB&amp;J on white. Sam sat down as he had to soak it all in. He was in disbelief. Sara, realizing this, felt a little sorry. \"Hey, cheer up little guy. Or I'll put you in my sandwich.\" She giggled, but didn't let on if it was really a joke. Sam continued to be in disbelief, it just couldn't be true. This college was the end of him? He was shaken from his thoughts as Sara picked him up. \"I told you to cheer up and you didn't.\" She then presses Sam into the peanut butter covered slice of bread, it was so fluffy and soft Sam almost felt relaxed if it wasn't for the danger. But he was too depressed to care. Sara pressed the jelly slice of bread on top of him, with only his head sticking out. Using the palm of her hand she pressed it tight and picked up the sandwich. Sam was completely stuck, immobilized. The jelly began to drip into his eyes and blurred his vision of Sara's ever-approaching maw. Licking her lips she moved in for the bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...?</span></div></div>",

He watched as Sara chewed the sandwich up and swallowed it. He watched the lump go down her throat and knew that he would be in that position soon enough. But to his surprise, Sara sat down the sandwich, peeled the top slice back and plucked Sam out. She then proceeded to wash off the jelly and peanut butter with her tongue, gently grazing over his body, leaving a slim layer of saliva behind, soon Sam was completely cleaned off and Sara sat him to the side as she finished her sandwich. Sam didn't say a word but just watched her eat. Knowing that he was so close to being eaten. Sara finished up, wiped her mouth with her sleeve then turned to Sam. \"Don't think I like you or anything. It's just you're too cute to get rid of so quickly.\" Sara smiled, and then got ready for bed. Sam couldn't help but stare as she removed her clothes and slipped into a long shirt. It's like she wanted him to look, but he wasn't sure yet. As Sara got in bed, she placed Sam on the desk, planted a kiss on him and went to bed. Sam was confused and didn't know what to think. But he knew he needed to find Mary. Or did he, Sara seemed to be taking a liking to him, and she was pretty cute. Sam was torn, but if he was going to do something, now was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Sam do?</span></div></div>",

You are so sweet, yes. You'll do fine.\" Sam was terrified. He began to cry as a student approached the stall. She was a junior, red hair, green eyes, tall and athletic. She spied Sam and asked Sara if he was on the menu, Sara confirmed it, and the student became giddy. She looked at the menu hanging above the service window. It was a basic menu with the standard festival fare, hot dogs, cakes, corn dogs, and the like. After a few minutes, the student had decided. She told Sara she wanted a corn dog. Sara nodded in acknowledgement and went to the prep station. With the still-frightened Sam in hand she prepared the batter, and coating. Humming to herself she placed Sam on the worktop, and forcefully rammed the wooden stick down his throat. At this point, Sam was loosing consciousness, he was fading in and out. The last thing he remembered was the sound of sizzling oil and the sticky feel of batter and then an immense heat as he was held under.A few minutes later, Sara presented the student, who's name was Erica, with the corn dog. Unassuming on the outside, but as Erica cheerfully chomped, the darker secret was revealed. But no one seemed to pay it any mind as Erica enjoyed the festival and the food. </span></div></div>",

The classroom was set up more like a lab, than a classroom. There were long tables with stools, and various machines strewn across the top. Sam struggled to get on top of the stool, and was taken by surprise when a mysterious hand helped him up. Sam looked behind him to see who it was, but the student was already gone. Sam gave it a shrug and prepared for class to start. The professor made her way to the front of the class and ordered everyone to pair up. There were about a 13 students in total, and of course Sam was the odd one out due to his size. The professor noticed this, and she seemed to have gotten an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she remedy the odd number?</span></div></div>",

Sam tried to struggle and squirm but her grip just got tighter. She hummed to herself as she laid out her veggie wrap. She began to unroll it as Sam got even more scared. And before he could blink he found himself tossed onto the cold expanse on lettuce. The cold hit him head on as he soon became drenched in salad dressing that Kelly was pouring. \"You're going to be so tasty!\" she said as she sprinkled some shredded carrot across the wrap. Satisfied with the creation she began to roll it back up. Sam became dizzy as the surroundings just spun, his head was sticking out of the wrap but it was so tight there was no chance of escape. He could only look head on as Kelly licked her lips and opened her maw to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humid air hit Sam immediately as he found himself being slowly placed in her mouth, he went past her crimson lips and was greeted by her tongue playfully stroking his face. With a loud crunch, Sam fell. Kelly had bitten the wrap and he was now trapped in the dark expanse of her mouth. Again, her tongue harassed him. It slid across his body, wrapped around him, and just toyed with him, as the teeth effortlessly masticated the wrap. Flashes of white was all Sam could see. Soon the chewing stopped, and he could hear the muscles begin to churn as the wad of food made its way to the throat. Sam tried to stay away, but the tongue pushed him down. Sam could feel the pulsations as the muscles rhythmically brought Sam down to the stomach where he landed with splash. The immediate burn of the acid was too much, as Sam screamed in agony.

She took Sam into her room, dropped him in her book bag and then went to sleep. Sam didn't wake up until mid morning the next day. He was confused and disoriented as he found himself in a dark area. He tried to feel his way around and came across the familiar feel of brown paper. Sam knew it was a lunch bag, and he realized he hadn't eaten in the longest time. He easily ripped through the bag and felt a bottle of water, an apple, and plastic wrap. Sam peeled back the plastic wrap and his smell told him he had come across a salad. Hungrily he dove into the salad and quickly ate his fill. But by this time he heard a rumbling coming from above and a sudden jolt as the bag was removed roughly. Sam tried to get out of the salad but as he climbed the side of the container he lost his grip and fell back in, getting covered with dressing and having a slice of cucumber fall on top of him. He was stuck as light poured into the bag and the salad was removed. Celeste smiled down at him. \"Looks like you did the work for me.\" She licked her lips and pulled out a fork. Fiercely stabbing the surrounding lettuce, spinach, cucumber, and carrots, Sam knew he was doomed. Before too long he found himself being brought towards Celeste's crimson lips and gaping maw, the humidity of the cave struck him like a bus as it got dark. Her tongue ran down Sam's sides, caressing him all over. Sam couldn't help but be slightly aroused by this but he was still horrified. Just when the chewing stopped around him and he thought swallowing was near. Everything became still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then?</span></div></div>",

Sam heard muffled screams from the other girl's and then the pounding which he identified as the Heimlich. And soon enough, the breathing became regular again. But the cucumber slice she was choking on came up so violently that as it slammed into Sam and flew out of Celeste's mouth, Sam flew with it, screaming the whole way as everything around him was a blur. He was just fortunate enough to have escaped. Soon, the cucumber slice landed across the cafeteria, and came to a stop on the floor. Sam brushed himself off, and looked around. He needed to find Mary, and hoped she was here. Sam began to look around but knew he needed a better view. He needed to climb. He climbed the nearest structure he could find.

I'm Linda! I'm a 3rd year and live next door. Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself, I assume your apartment mate is out?\" Sam nodded, \"Yeah, she just left to pick up the text books. I'm Sam, and my apartment mate is Mary. We're first-years.\" Linda nodded, but didn't seem to be really listening. Sam's eyes moved over to the other student, who was still partly hiding behind Linda. \"Um. Who do you have with you, Linda?\" Sam asked as he gestured towards the other girl, his motion causing her to shy away. \"Oh,\" Linda replied, \"That's just my apartment mate.\" The other girl interrupted Linda stepping into the light for the first time, \"I'm Iris,\" she said in a soft tone. She was taller than Linda when she stood up straight, she was very lean, modest chest, long blond hair, and soft blue eyes. She obviously had some problems with social situations and seemed to feed off of Linda's extroverted nature. Iris was shy but she looked kind as she gave Sam a split second smile. \"Well, it was nice meeting you two.\" Sam said as he gestured toward the door. \"Oh. I don't think we're leaving yet,\" Linda said with a fierce look in her eyes. And before Sam could react he found him tossed in a bag and carried out of the apartment, a few minutes later he was dumped out of the bag and onto the carpeted floor of an apartment similar to his but he knew it was Linda's and Iris'. \"Why'd you kidnap me?! I demand you take me back right now!\" Sam yelled to his captors as they towered over him. Linda was still smiling, \"I don't think that's possible. When we heard there'd be a tiny on our floor we knew we just had to get him for ourselves.\" Iris nodded her head in agreement, still shy but Sam could feel her warming up towards him. \"We got big plans for you.\" Linda continued. \"Plans?\" Sam echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat plans?</span></div></div>",

Iris nodded her head enthusiastically as Linda picked Sam up and carried him to the sink. Iris turned on the cold water and Linda gently ran Sam under the water to get him clean. Iris then took a small pole with a simple \"LI\" at the end and proceeded to heat it over a small open flame. Sam tried to squirm and break free, but Linda's grasp was too tight and his squirming only made it tighter. Iris took the pole which now grew red hot, and Linda held Sam still as Iris placed the pole against the bare flesh of Sam's side. Sam screamed in pain, Linda laughed, and Iris cringed, turned away and closed her eyes as the burning of skin resounded. Soon the branding was complete and the area was washed with cold water again. \"There we go!\" Linda said with a smile so wide.

Linda agreed and set Sam down on the counter. \"Welcome to your new home, Sammy.\" Iris said in a sing-song voice as she gently patted his head.

I\u2019m not going to be your pet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Valarie plucked Sam off the table with her fingers and placed him on her open palm. All the girls surrounded them and all Sam could see was their smiling faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle boys like you don\u2019t get to make decisions\u201d Valarie Said in a babying tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right you need big people to make decisions for you.\u201d Added the red headed girl. \u201cAnd who better than lovely ladies like us huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Sam, we will take good care of you\u201d said Valarie as one of the other girls started stroking you with their finger. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be our new mascot and pet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls squealed in excitement after hearing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do with him first?\u201d Asked the Asian girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell..\u201d Valarie starts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl lifted you up to her pale, soft face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello\u201d Sam says nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Sam, please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there cutie. My name is Pamala, but everyone calls me Pam\u201d the girl said smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just stared up at her shaking in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t hurt you\u201d Pam says softly stroking your head. \u201cI would never hurt anything as precious as you. None of us would right girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam look around and saw all the girls nodding in agreement with their eyes glued to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me hold him\u201d shouted the Asian girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sam could protest he was plucked off Pam\u2019s hand and placed on the palm of the Asian beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Mia!\u201d She said with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m so glad Valarie caught you. I just want to cuddle you all day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she smooshed Sam up against her cheek and softly rubbed him up and down. Sam felt really embarrassed being treated this way even though he knew he was in no real danger. He still wanted to be treated like a grown man in college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn!\u201d Shouted the red headed girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia looked disappointed as she pulled Sam away from her cheek but nonetheless gave him to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Emily\u201d she said cupping you in her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t worry little man, you\u2019ll get used to being a pet. You wouldn\u2019t survive long without us anyway. Now how about giving mommy a kiss?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sam could react with the indignation he felt, he was brought to Emily\u2019s puckered lips and kissed rapidly multiple times. The other girls giggled as Sam laid there helplessly knowing there was nothing he could do to stop the bombardment of kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough Emily!\u201d Jen said snatching you away. \u201cYou\u2019ll smother him\u201d she said gently petting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was red in the face feeling more embarrassed than he ever had in his life. All the girls did was smile down at him and go \u201cawwww\u201d at his obvious sense of embarrassment, each one taking turns at stroking him while he sad in Jen\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Sam Williams' life has just gone from bad to worse. The good news is, he got into Diminutive State. The bad news was he was only four inches tall. He had been this way since puberty. It was only by exception was Sam allowed to attend the all-girl's school. And not every girl would be kind towards a powerless guy. His girlfriend, Mary had also been accepted, they had been going out for three years and he felt safe around her. However, would Mary be enough to keep Sam alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Only one male. Sam<br>\r\n2. Only one tiny. Sam. Though others can be referenced, they can't be actual characters. <br>\r\n3. Posts will be written in third person. (Sam did... She did... they did.... etc.)<br>\r\n4. Any death is allowed, though vore is preferred. If Sam is eaten with food, he's the meat.<br>\r\n5. New characters are allowed, just be descriptive. Only female. Regular sized. Age from 18-35. <br>\r\n6. At least five good sentence per addition.<br>\r\n7. After a death, there is a chance Sam can reform as a result of the shrinking. The reformation takes a day.<br>\r\n8. I reserve the right to change or delete any chapter I deem violates these rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Please have fun and enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam Williams: An 18 year old, four inch tall male with brown hair and blue eyes. A first year student at Diminutive State, he will be rooming with is girlfriend in an on campus apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Douglas: A 19 year old red-head with green eyes, and a nice body, with D cup breasts. She has a very protective nature and would never think of harming Sam knowingly, though she has been known to have mood swings, one time tossing Sam across the room. Could be dangerous if caught in the wrong mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty Davis: The 25 year old guidance counselor. She has been personally assigned to Sam and will keep an eye on him. Though behind the blond haired, green eyed exterior could lie a dangerous predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly Michael: The 21 year old student body president. She acts like she owns the campus, and will do as she pleases. A very cruel and merciless woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy Wallace: A bubbly personality wrapped in a brown haired exterior. She seems gentle enough but is incredibly unpredictable. She is the RA for the building and no one knows exactly what to expect from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add more characters during the story. I will as well. Please enjoy. Tell me what I can do to improve and please add.</td>",
