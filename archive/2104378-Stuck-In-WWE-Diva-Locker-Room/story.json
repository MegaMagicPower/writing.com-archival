He seen the divas like they are goddess. The way they overpower people in the ring it just made him crazy in love with them. He knows every other diva personailtiy, what they like and what they hate, he might know them better than they do.<br>\r\nWhen Jim heard that the WWE is coming to his town he was thrilled. Jim works at construction and when he found out he has to work the same day WWE is coming he was heartbroken. But when he came to work he found out that the event center where the WWe is going to be at needs construction in the Divas locker room he almost cried of happiness. While he was with hanging around his friends watching the game at a bar he talkabout he has full access to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow you mean to tell me you can go the divas locker room right now\" said Jim's friend<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course im the head of construction\" said Jim<br>\r\n\"hey can we go right now\"Jim friends said<br>\r\n\"no way man i can get fired \"-jim<br>\r\n\"grow some balls i dare you to go inside and take thier bikin or something i would give you 2,000 dollars if you get me something like a bikin\"-jims friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim thought of the idea two thousand bucks is a lot of money<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"alright i do it make sure you have the money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[the day of the event]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground is very lumpy inside the locker room.The concrete is very unstable, he had to put a blue matt so it would safe to step on. His job was to fix the floor but he told the manager it would take a week and he had to stop working on the day of the event. It was almost time for the event and he found out that the divas left their gear inside the locker room a day before the event. He knows now is his chance to do it. Jim sneak inside the locker room to look for the bikins he seen the bag but heard some footsteps outside the locker room then voices it sounded like one of the divas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"shit if they catch me here i would be fired and go to prison for sure, i would look like a pervet\"jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was looking all around to hide, he had not that many places to hide. He look down and seen the blue matt. It was very thick and the floor is already lumpy nobody would notice him and its not like their going to stand on him for a long time so he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was hearing the sound of heels click clack click clack. In the section of Jims face their was small whole and he can see throught it. The door open and it was Kelly Kelly one of the wwe divas. She was this very dumb blonde girl, she reminded him as a paris hilton. She was on the phone talking like one of those white teenage girls. Then her heel of her 3 inc steeltto pump hit the head of his cock. Jim was screaming in his head. Then her other foot came side by side. Jim had his cock pin down with two heels on its head.When all this was happening Kelly Kelly just stood their on the phone<br>\r\n\"Yeah they doing some construction or watever and it so hard to walk\"<br>\r\nJim was crying why haven't she move yet she is just stanidng there. She looks so thin how can she give so much pressure. Then Kelly Kelly lifted up her left leg and slam it down very hard on his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Maria did what, that girl is crazy i can't belive she did that Well steph im going to call you back i need to get ready, bye bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was in so much pain Kelly step of his balls and step on his stomach and miss his face. The stomach part wasn't so bad becasue he has a big belly but his balls was on fire hecan't belive the tortue of those heels and Kelly Kelly was the lightest diva she is about 110 lbs. Then Jim heard the door open.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They looked over towards the mat and then at each other. \"What the hell is that?\" \"Victoria retorically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks to me like a really lumpy mat with something nail-in underneath it,\" said Sara. Sara continued, \"A little unusual but it quite useless with all those lumps and bumps.\" \"You're right, let's see if we can make it safer and more practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to the mat and both of them tested the mat by proding the lumps and bumps with their stilettos. Jim was petrified at this point and tried to keep himself from shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim felt a sudden intense pressure on his groin as sharp object was forcing its way down onto and through one on his balls. The aim could not have been better (Or worse) if he were completely visable. Anothe object was investigating the depths of his intestines. The sharp objects seem destined to touch the floor under Jim. God, he surely never expected this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jim felt another intense surge of pain as one, then two sharp objects probed powerfully Jim's face. Jim felt one of the pressure points on the bridge of his nose and another on the edge of his chin. God, just one tiny slip off the nose bridge and one eye would be crushed and gone... history! Jim was struggling to keep his chin up with his teeth clengthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was far more than he was prepared to handle. Two or three strolls on this carpet and I'm dead meat for sure! And here I am with no protection! What a Dumn ass!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ran so fast she tripped on Jim's concealed head and came crashing down on top of him. Her knee cracked his nuts, and it was a miracle he didn't yell out in pain.<br>\r\n\"Kelly! Have you heard how they Re-Mixed my Entrance Music on the new WWE CD?<br>\r\n\"No, Why in God's name would I listen to YOUR music when I hear it every night?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, they changed the tone to make it better, I can dance to this all night!\"<br>\r\nCandice popped the CD into the stereo and hit play. Her Improved entrance Theme Music started to play. Jim kind of liked it, But Kelly was still standing on his nut sack! Candice started to dance, her heel of her left high-heel directly on his chin stomping at almost every beat. <br>\r\n(How's THAT for Sweet Chin Music?)</span></div></div>",

He looked through his and saw Eve Torres walking towards him, in a pair of shiny black leather boots. She had on a skin-tight black mini-skirt with matching top and had on a black leather jacket that matched her boots. She was dressed all in black except for the gold cross around her neck and the dark red color she wore on her nails and lips. She was very tall and about 130 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked over she stopped for a moment and looked through her purse. Jim pray to god she would not step on him, she had very sharp heels, but no such luck. He was taken by surprise, all of a sudden he felt the cold toe of her boot in his side, causing him to let out an involuntary groan in his head. The sound was hardly out of his mouth when he felt her standing on his chest. <br>\r\nShe had jumped and landed on his chest so quickly he didn\u2019t realize it until she was standing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was very playful she acts like a little kid sometimes and skips around or jumps around. When she saw the lumpy matt it made her think of her childhood. She jump hard on the matt and starts to look at the mirror that is above Jim's body. Everytime before Eve gets ready to for her match she likes to warm up. The way she warms up is jumping up and down while looking at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomped and jumped around all over his body, letting each blow sink in. She liked to alternate between gentle and hard stomping, repeatedly stomping his stomach, chest and groin. Jim is getting exhausted and nearly forced all the air out of his lungs, when she finally stopped. He felt her walking up his chest. In a flash the sole of her boot was in his face, millimeters from his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped up with her hard boot soles right on his face. He could feel her dirty soles squashing his face as she stood with her full weight bearing down on his head. Then steps off him and heads to her locker. Jim can't believe what just happen. His whole body not fells like its on fire. Jim really needs to get out of there before he gets badly injuried.</span></div></div>",
