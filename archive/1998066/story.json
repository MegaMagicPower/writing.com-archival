Suddenly she's standing at the edge of a large pit, she attempts to stop but regardless falls down into the abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she comes to her she's lying on a tile floor. \" Oww.\" She whispers as she looks up, but finds no hole above her head. She's now lieing in a parlor of sorts, her weapon lying next to her. As she reaches for it, somone else grabs it. It was Weiss, \" Hey, give that back!\" Ruby shouts, it was that girl she had been partnered with. Ruby chases her to a smaller door, she had cornered her. \" Ha, nowhere to run!\" Weiss just points her saber to the floor as a circle surrounds her feet. She instantly begins shrinking until she's small enough to slip through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby just squeed at the sight. \" Aww, look how cute you are!\" Weiss just opened the little door and runs off.

Two being tiny, and two being atleast fifty feet tall. Ruby looks to the table and sees a red drink and a box of chocolate chip cookies, along with four keys matching there respective doors.

It as a warm spring day outside, the sun still shining bright despite the late afternoon hour. As she walked down the road she noticed a friend of hers, Tsurugaya. It would be difficult to miss her distinctive maid attire. \" Hey, Tsurugaya, what are you doing out so late.\" Instead of responding the maid simply smiled and began running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Okami gave chase finding her friends reaction to be very strange. It seemed she was leading her to a field. After a while Tsurugaya just seemed to vanish. \" What the hell?\" Okami questioned looking around confused. She walked around the grassy square in search of her disappearing friend. As she did she felt her foot slip, and she found herself falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Okami fell and fell as she tumbled over and over again until she reached the bottom with a thud. Okami gowned in response to her soar body as she struggled to her feet. As she looked onward her pain was overshadowed by her disbelief. Infront of her looked like some eligant parlor. \" No way, did I hit my head in that fall?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Okami walked around the circular room, in front of her laid to doors. One incredibly small one that was no taller than her boots, the other was a massive door at least twenty feet tall!\" Next she looked at the table, setting there as if left for her was a glass bottle of what looked like cherry juice, and a box of frosted cookies. She looked around to make sure none was watching and shrugged \" Might as well .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich item dose she go for?</span></div></div>",

It smelled of cherry's, but also other fruits as well, strange. She quickly downs the substance and gags at the taste, resembling bitter tasting cough syrup. \" Gross.\" She said setting the empty vial on the table. She next turned her attention to the two keys on the table. She picked up the small key, the peculiar thing was it seemed to be growing in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Okami just watched as the table grew in-front of her. She just stood dumbfound as she dwindled down to six inches tall! \" W... What happened to me?! I'm the size of a doll!\" She shouts before hearing her now high pitched voice, clasping her hand over her mouth. She suddenly is glad Tsurugaya isn't here. Okami picks up the side of the now giant key, and drags it over to the door. She struggles for a bit as she lifts it to the key hole, then pushes with all her might to turn the key, and the door creeks open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkami steps through the door and sees that everything is _______!</span></div></div>",

Okami let's herself get spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha there you are Mary Ann! You've been quit ill behaved today\" said the \"Mega Maid\" said as her giant gloved right hand picked up Okami by the back of her clothing and lifted the shrunken girl up hovering above her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill clutching the bottle Okami gulped a twinge of doubt over this plan surfacing. Luckily her captor and \"employer\" was more concerned about scolding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Mary Ann what has gotten into you today?\" Started the Maid. Okami wasted little time and hurled the entire bottle down the larger girls throat mid way thru the next sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously your disrespectful attitude and lack of work ethic are..ACK **Gulp** problematic to say the least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! Okami thought and prayed it worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that you just made me swallow?! You know I don't like not condone alcohol\" continued the Maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle was taking it's time to work if it would work at all and she could almost kick herself for leaving the lid on the bottle. Luckily the Maids digestive acid would melt the lid and crack the glass enough for leaks to occur not that either of them knew this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ridiculous! 1st I catch you drinking in front of my house and slacking off\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pause*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next you clearly disobey an order an instead choose to play games\" she continued think Okami aka Mary Ann's shrunken state was a game and not the least bit odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pause*<br>\r\nThis time slight gurgling and then a growl came from the Maid's stomach but was short lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please let that be a sign the bottle is working' Okami prayed silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid noticed \"Mary Ann\" seemed distracted and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! Are you paying attention?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkami looked back in defeat as the Maid felt satisfied enough to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I catch you sneaking yet another drink\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished that sentence Okami noticed something. In a brief instance the 2 fingers holding her seemed slightly bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no am I somehow shrinking again' feared Okami<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fear however was replaced with an even worse realization as time Okami could see the Maid grow a little more. This was not good the Maid was growing in spurts and not only was Okami a shrunken captive but she had unknowingly unintentionally let a chance to grow slip through her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next you force said drink upon me\" continues the Maid seemingly unaware of any changes yet as another spurt hits bringing her up to 6 foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkami watches and listens in helpless dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you ignore me\" says the Maid creeping up  another foot this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you ignore me again\" she says gaining another foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to say for yourself\" asked the Maid gaining yet another foot courtesy of the growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Um yea watch your head\" said Okami only now discovering her High pitched voice in her shrunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid would've questioned her employee but the next spurt made her head gently tap the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what did you do to me Mary Ann?! I-I'm growing\" said the Maid as the next spurt hit and she had to sit on her bed now being 12 Feet tall and presumably not done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spurts seemed to be getting more frequent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Then another then another then 1 more.<br>\r\nShe was getting too big for the room and her legs and feet pressed up against the bedroom door and corner of the room respectively. At this point the Maid dropped Okami on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spurt hit followed by 2 very close after. Her right foot and leg burst through the bedroom doom whilst her left busted through the wall and through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 18 or more spurts later her feet had burst through her own house and the scene resembled this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pklewd2014/status/565583957270749186\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/pklewd2014/status/56...</a><br>\r\nAnd<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pklewd2014/status/565583884600242177\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/pklewd2014/status/56...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid's legs were in front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe filled most of her house.

It as a warm spring day outside, the sun still shining bright despite the late afternoon hour. As she walked down the road she noticed a strange girl she had never seen seemingly dressed as a rabbit girl. Interested in the girl she followed. Soon she was catching up. \"Excuse me please, I'm interested in your cosplay\" she said. Instead of responding the girl simply smiled and began running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtsuu gave chase finding her reaction to be very strange. It seemed she was leading her to a field. After a while she  just seemed to vanish. \" What the heck?\" Otsuu questioned looking around confused. She walked around the grassy square in search of her disappearing friend. As she did she felt her foot slip, and she found herself falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtsuu fell and fell as she tumbled over and over again until she reached the bottom with a thud. Otsuu gowned in response to her sore body as she struggled to her feet. As she looked onward her pain was overshadowed by her disbelief. Infront of her looked like some eligant parlor. \" No way, did I hit my head in that fall?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtsuu walked around the circular room, in front of her laid to doors. One incredibly small one that was no taller than her shoes, the other was a massive door at least 50 feet tall!\" Next she looked at the clear glass table, sitting there as if left for her was a glass bottle of what looked like cherry juice, and a Big box of frosted cookies, at least 4 or 5 dozen. Also there were 2 keys 1 tiny and 1 So big it was larger than the table to and hung off at both ends. She looked around to make sure none was watching and shrugged \" Might as well .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she go for?</span></div></div>",

I do hope there is a way out\" she said as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began walking down the hall. Eventually she came to a room at the end. She entered and found herself in the largest grandest most elegant ballroom she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a staircase leading to a balcony overlooking the entire room and a chandelier in the middle. The room oddly however only had 2 other doors aside from the one Toko had entered through. 1 door was tiny maybe 6 inches tall tops the other door was huge at least 60 feet tall and about 20 feet shy of the ballroom ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what an amazing ballroom! I wonder why no one seems to be here though\" said Toko as she looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward she stopped in front of the 2 doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this place is odd! Who on earth could ever fit through these 2 doors. Perhaps ill just turnaround\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she turned around she noticed the door she had entered through had somehow disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door I came through.. I-its gone it vanished somehow\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she noticed a glass end table nearby that wasn't there before. On it was a very odd assortment of objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny key presumably for the tiny door, a very large key at least twice as large as Toko was tall, a tea kettle and an empty teacup and lastly a box of at least 3 dozen cookies all with the words \"EAT ME\" on them in icing or sprinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToko walked up to the table and mulled over the objects on it when her stomach growled in hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving into her sweet tooth and her stomach.<br>\r\nToko grabbed a cookie and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Toko began to feel strange then to her surprise she started growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what in the world? I-I'm growing bigger somehow\" she exclaimed as she inched bigger and bigger. The only good news was her clothing and everything were all growing in even proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger Toko grew until she was 50 feet tall a bit shy of the 60 foot tall door and 80 foot tall ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my that was such a strange experience and I got so big too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToko then grabbed the box of cookies and placed it in 1 of the pockets of her pink dress. As of yet she hasn't realized food , drink or certain other things in this strange place could affect her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an extra cookie appeared on a plate next to the tea kettle and teacup. For the moment Toko ignored this. Feeling thirsty taking advantage of of size she opted to forego the teacup and picked up the tea kettle with 2 fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing it to her mouth she poured 1/2 its contents down her throat. Satisfied Toko sat the team kettle back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she contemplated what to do when..</span></div></div>",

It's for your summer reading.\" He was a boy around the same age as Melody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had messy chocolate brown hair and bright green eyes. He wore a black  T-shirt, brown pants and blue shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. I just wish there something fun we could do instead.\" Melody argued as she went to the river. \"Don't you ever wish that life could be, could be...\" Melody paused for a minute before an idea came to her. \"That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it?\" Ben asked her. \"If we had our own little world everything would be nonsense. There'll be animals would wear clothes, flowers can talk and clouds we can ride on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sits down beside her and smiles, \"That sounds like fun. That's what I like about you Melody, it's your imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them laugh as they stared at their reflections in the water. It wasn't long before they heard fast approaching feet. Melody looked  up and was amazed by what she saw. \"Ben,\" She cried as she shook his shoulder. \"Melody, what is...\" He stopped in mid sentence as saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a white rabbit wearing a waist coat?\" He asked as he notice the white rabbit wearing expensive clothes. The rabbit pulled out a chained watch out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a pocket watch?\" Melody added. The rabbit panicked.  \"Oh my fur and whiskers! I'm so very late.\" The white rabbit dashed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, what could a rabbit be late for? A carrot convention?\" Ben Joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll would like to know,\" Melody announced as she got off. \"Mr. Rabbit, please wait.\" She cried as she hurried after him. \"Are you sure this is good idea?\" Ben yelled as she followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit dove into a cave so small that one would have to get on their hands and knees and crawl to get in. By the time Ben arrived, Melody was half-way in. Against his better judgement, he went into the cave. \"Melody, are you sure this is a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you curious about where this rabbit?\" She responded. Both teens kept on going. \"I'm pretty sure this counts as stalking, and curiosity often lead to trou-BBLLE!\" He cried as the ground under disappeared and the two teens fall down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody finally landed on something soft. \"That was weird,\" She said. She looked up and saw several objects floating around. There was a mirror, a chair, a jar and even a book case full of books. \"Good thing we didn't get hurt,\" She smiled before looking at down. Her eyes widen as she realize her clothes had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is what she's dress like, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoQ4jKYb46Y&amp;t=2m28s\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoQ4jKYb4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY COW! WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?\" She screamed. \"How this happened? Why am I dressed like this?\" She was both scared and disturb by this. Then she remembered something much more important; Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben? Ben Where are you?\" She called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here,\" a voiced groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody quickly got  up and turned to help her friend up. But stopped. Her friend had been transformed into a rabbit. \"Ben,\" Melody stuttered. Ben blissfully unaware of this looked gazed upwards at her. \"UH did you get taller?\"  She was 3 times his size. Now he only came up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody delayed with the answer. How can tell her friend he was no longer human Then an idea came to her.  She grabbed the mirror that floating by and handed it to him. \"I think you need to see for yourself.\"  He stared at  his reflection  to see he had became a brown rabbit. He had the only natural reaction to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL? I'M A RABBIT!\" He shouted. \"Aww it's not that bad,\" She said reassuringly as she got down on her knees and pet his ears. \"You're kinda cute like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to scold for saying that but stopped as she stroke his new ears, \"Thanks Melody. And you look very pretty in that dress.\" Melody blushed after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late, I'm late!\" They turned their heads to see the white rabbit running to a door neither of them had noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Rabbit, we need your help!\" She cried as she got up and followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" Ben called out as he followed them. \"Cursed these short legs,\" He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">What will happen to our heroes now?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( edited for better flow, grammar etc by PK @ 12:57 AM on 8/24/15 )</span></div></div>",

And what's your excuse? Your legs are longer than mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody didn't answer as she looked at the door and opened it. Both entered and ended up in what could be best described as a very long hallway with many doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one did he go through,\" Ben wondered aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody shrugged and went to the first  door on the left and tried to open it. But it was locked. She went around the hallway and tried to open the others but they were locked too. They return to the place where they had entered but the door had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there once was a door big enough for a horse to walk through was now a door so small that only Ben could fit in. Luckily for it wasn't locked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going get through?\" She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a small 3 legged stool with a plate with Mochi cakes on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't there before,\" Ben commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....But considering Melody was wearing a new outfit and Ben was a rabbit, she really didn't put any thought in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mochi are Japanese Rice cakes)<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two types of Mochi on said plate, red mochi and white mochi. As well a sheet of paper attach to the table with the words, 'Eat Me and Enter' written on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat me and enter?\" ......  \"What does that even mean?\" Ben questioned. This place was getting curiouser and curiouser by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I eat of these, I'll get smaller,\" Melody said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I got a bad feeling about this.\" Ben replied. He really felt this was a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody wasn't listening as she picked up one of the white mochi, \"I am kinda hungry. Besides, whats the worst that could happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite of it,  suddenly she began to grow at a rapid speed in growth spurts. She gasped and cried out a bit with with each of the growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/VPNHA-LcoCg</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had 5 spurts in all \"OUCH!\" She screamed as her head hit the ceiling from the final growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had managed to dash away from her explosive growth. Thankfully her growing was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over to and shouted, \"Are you all right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO I'M NOT!\" She bellowed.  Ben heard her sniffle a bit, \"Now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gulped as he feared what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, NOW I WILL NEVER GET HOME!\" She started crying like there was no tomorrow. Even worse, her tears were bucket size, one of them landed on Ben, leaving him wet as a drowned rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on Melody, you're a big girl! You're too old for this!\" Her loud moaning blocked out his voiced. He got scared as he notice the water level was rising. He climbed up her white apron to avoid drowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, please stop this! You're gonna drown me,\" He shouted why hopped up and down. That's when he saw the plate of red and white mochi floating in the tears. If the white ones made her grow, then maybe a red one will shrink her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, you have to eat one of the red mochi!\" Ben cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Does she hear him</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( edited for grammar, flow, spacing and other reasons by PK @ 1:18 AM )</span></div></div>",

Oh well down the hatch\" she says tossing the now tiny to her morsel down her mouth and throat whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked on horrorstricken however after a few moments nothing seemed to be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

Wait I feel weird, I think something is happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly both Melody and the room got a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like before Melody had 5 more growth spurts this time the room growing bigger to accommodate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around. The door was still just as tiny plus the stool , plate, and mochi hadn't changed size and the water level seemed far lower in fact Ben could see the floor underwater, but soon he had his answer. The room and Melody had tripled their previous sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO THAT JUST MADE THINGS WAY WORSE\" wailed Melody beginning to cry anew though now the tears were shockingly 4X larger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she sat there wringing out her ruined wedding dress soaked from the rain the soft ground beneath her feet gave away and she let out a scream as she was sucked into the earth \"Ahhhhhhhhh someone help me!\" She cried as she was soon falling but luckily her wedding dress is so big she is able to use it as a type of parachute to slow her descend \"Ohh thank goodness!\" She thought as it looked like it was going to be smooth sailing from here when out of the blue there was another scream but it didn't come from her but from a person,a boy right above her also falling down the hole at a amazing speed one she'd never seen before he had dark brown hair,green eyes,was wearing a black T-shirt,brown pants and white shoes Clarisse was so absorbed stating at the ten year old boy shooting past her she didn't notice her dress suddenly deflating as she also fell through the air only to land on solid ground \"Ohh good thing I managed to land safety and sound but I do wonder what happened to that strange little boy I saw earlier?\" She thought to herself then she noticed the ground she was on happened to be soft,really soft and it was breathing and squirming around a bit \"Ohh how odd...Ohhh dear!\" She cried as she realized what she was sitting on was that strange little boy she quickly got off him and reached down helping him up \"Ohh dear me I'm very sorry about that are you alright?\" She asked he nodded <br>\r\n\"Yeah although that was some crazy fall anyway who are you and where am I?\" <br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you the same why are your clothes so odd looking?\" <br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain so I'll start out with the easy part my name is Ben and why are you dressed like that? You going to get married or something?\" Clarisse blushed <br>\r\n\"Well I was but unfortunately the man I was supposed to be getting married to is a complete rude and cold-hearted person so I fled for my life but that's no longer important right now since we're both sort of stuck here we might as well find and find a way out ohh sorry I didn't introduce myself my name is Princess Clarisse.\" As she held out her hand for him to shake <br>\r\n\"You're a princess,a actual princess? Whoa cool!\" Ben exclaimed awestruck Clarisse giggled at his expression as they continued onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's happening to me?\" As she grew smaller and smaller soon Ben resembled a giant even his feet towered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops sorry Clarisse guess I should have seen that coming but hey take a bite of one of these...\" As he saw the tiny box filled with cookies at his feet and handed her one the minute she bit into it Clarisse's eyes grew wide,she got a funny feeling in her stomach and suddenly without warnings she grew rather than shrink! Taller and wider she became until now she was the one who towered over Ben at least over 70 feet tall the top of her head was smushed up against the roof of the room almost breaking through \"Ohhh My!\" She cried out Ben had to cover his ears from the sound of her voice and patted her left foot <br>\r\n\"Now Clarisse it...its...not that bad,could be worse!\" He joked hoping she would calm down but on the contrary she became hysterical <br>\r\n\"Worse? How can this possibly be an....worse.....\" As she sniffled Ben saw what was about to occur<br>\r\n\"Uh oh! Please Clarisse don't,....\" He begged but too late she became crying and as she was a nearly 70 foot giantess her tears were enormous Ben had the toughest time dodging them as the room quickly filled up <br>\r\n\"Clarisse Please Stop Crying! Yo...you'll flood the room and is along with it!\" But she couldn't force herself to stop<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh this is too much! I....I'm far too big to move! Ben....get out of here while you still can!\" But he refused to leave her even that meant he drowned in her pool of tears and touched by his refusal Clarisse reached down and scooped him up saving him from a fatal fate and granted him a quick,passionate kiss before taking the bottle from before now filled with her salty tears she took a sip and magically shrunk back to normal <br>\r\n\"Help I can't swim!\" Ben cried out as he was struggling to stay afloat as she accidentally dropped him when she shrunk Clarisse quickly grabbed hold of his hands and pulled him into the bottle big enough to contain both luckily the door from before was knocked off its hinges by Clarisse's frantic crying fit and both were on their way to the rest of Wonderland </span></div></div>",

She couldn't help but notice that Ben blushed and giggled.  Clarisse found to the boy to be cute and guess she had a crush on him. Alas, the boy was far too young for her. Then they found a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess opened it only to find smaller door that opened from the opposite. She opened that door and found another door, even smaller. She kept on until the last door which was so small that she and Ben had to get on their hands and knees to crawl through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they had entered was big as the inside of a barn. On the other end on the room was a door the size of a rabbit hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do now?\" Ben asked.  Clarisse thought for a moment or two and notice a glass table with a golden key and a plate of cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't there before,\" Clarisse said. There were two types of cookies on said plate, chocolate cookies with the words 'Eat Me' written in chocolate chips and sugar cookies with the words written frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she skipped breakfast, Clarisse felt hungry and took one of the chocolate cookies. No sooner as she ate the cookie she grew at a ridiculous speed that she fell on her rear end. Her head had slammed into ceiling. Now she was 70 feet tall and nearly filled the whole room. Ben climbed up her dress and sat on her knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a sad look on her face and smiled, \"Cheer up, it's not like it's the end of the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this had the opposite reaction he hopping for. \"Well it may not be for you but this is the worst day of my life!\" She cried so loudly that Ben had to cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents want me to marry a horrible man, I had to run away from my home...and now,\" she sniffled. Ben gulped as he knew what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now I get even get out!\" Princess Clarisse started crying, Ben was hit by one of her bucket size tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon to the room began to flood and Ben desperately tried get her to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse! You need to stop or you'll drown us both!\" He yelled. She stopped crying and picked Ben up and hugged him. Suddenly the floor disappeared, sending the giant princess plummeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was over the ocean and was falling like a stone. She held Ben closed to her bosom as they plunges into the salty waters. A few seconds later she breach the surface and looked at Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay,\" She asked calmly. Ben sat in the palm of her hand coughed smiled at her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I'm fine. How did we wind up in the middle of the ocean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied before she placed him on top her head before.

Mey Rin slipped her pale feet into her black stockings as she laced up her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The red haired woman looked in the mirror at her uncovered hazel eyes. Part of her wished that she could go without her hideous glasses, perhaps then Black or even Baldroy would see her more than the maid who couldn't help herself.... Perhaps tomorrow, she thought to herself as she slipped on the eyewear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMey Rin hummed to herself as she walked down the hall, the young masters breakfast in hand. \" Wake up young master.\" Her annoying, heavily accented voice called out. No response was given as she spoke to the walls. \" M... Master Ciel?!\" She called as she set the tray to the side and investigated more. The room was undisturbed besides the unmade bed and open window near said bed... Which she made in a quick manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid walked over to the open window seeing a blurry figure in the distance... She removed the glasses and instantly focused in on the person... It was Ran-Mao, staring tauntingly back at her on the window! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kuroshitsuji.wikia.com/wiki/Ran-Mao\" target=\"_blank\">http://kuroshitsuji.wikia.com/wiki/Ran-M...</a> ) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oriental woman  acrobatically leapt past her and hurried down the hallway. \" That woman better not have anything to do with this.\" Her voice now velvet like. Mey Rin clenched her fists in anger and was about to call to her comrades but seeing as they were surly busy, and she could handle the intruder herself. She pursued only to come to a seeming dead end with three doors... One small and the other large, and the middle door normal sized, but with a broken handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n\"What is this room? I've never seen it before..\" She asked herself as she looked around, nearby on a end table sat a drink of some kind and a jar of candy and sweets. Her stomach growled. As she looked at them... She approached them as if drawn to them by some addiction. But which one does she choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Who doesnt love Alice In Wonderland? And its MANY Interpretations?  We've surely seen some adaption or another especially in Anime or Manga so I figured Why not do an interactive take on that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm pretty open on this but airing on the side of caution the ASR rating is for Anime characters that can get a bit non PG/E<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules as Follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: NO ENDING OF THE STORY PERIOD!! Personally I find the original and it's adaptions far too short so keep things going as long as possible please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Growing and Shrinking ( Size Change ) scenes are highly encouraged! The more the merrier! Frankly I feel some adaptations don't have enough or rush the story. Heck even the original sadly only had around 4 of each. So have fun just dont go overkill on huge ( Planet sized ) or Tiny ( Microscopic and such )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">3: NO American McGee, Tim Burton or the like incarnation I didn't care for those! Likewise NO Creepy Pasta! Shrinking or out growing of clothes is permissible other than that the rest is a no go</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: NO Death, No Scat or the like<br>\r\n5: Please try to use decent spelling and grammar. I'm not a Grammar Nazi but at least make it readable! This includes spacing of Paragraphs. Reading entries that are a Wall-O-Text is a pet peeve<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6: After a certain point please try to minimize short chapters unless it's for adding choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7: I reserve the right to Edit, modify, delete chapters for ANY Reasons but usually only for rule breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8: in case I didn't say it aside from American McGee, Tim Burton or creepy stuff ANY Alice In Wonderland incarnation including books, films, specials, movies, Anime, manga, fan art, fan fiction ,or even something completely different as long as the story is kept going sticks to Alice In Wonderland in some manner and size changes occur to whoever is playing the part of \"Alice\" it's fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo go have fun peeps<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"><br>\r\n** 4/13/2015 7:05pm EST<br>\r\nUpdate + New rule since I've apparently had to make it a rule on account of 3 people ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule # 9  if you Insist on choosing a Male to play Alice HE MUST Either be turned Female at some point or at least be a \"TRAP\" ( I.E. Can crossdress and pass as female because after all Alice always wears some kind of dress or Skirt and by pass as female I actually mean you look at them and could almost never guess they were cross dressing )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm all for \"Gender Equality\" however male size change is NOT Really my cup of tea and there are a bunch of interactive a that openly allow makes with little to no restriction. Sorry for this but please respect the wishes of the story moderators</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** 5/12/2015 Update<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rule<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule #10 Since someone didn't find it self explanatory or obvious please Limit the Number of Non Human characters. This isn't  Charmy Kitty, Cats or Animals in wonderland. I'll settle for what was already added recently but please stick to the main focus/idea <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 10 A: I Will allow Anthros leaning towards mostly human appearence. ( Neko/Catgirls, Mousegirls, Fox Girls, Some Dog/Wolfgirls but thats it )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***12/5/15 update <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain people please STOP TRYING TO HAVE/ADD Size changing males in here!
