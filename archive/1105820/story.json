            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lara enters the ancient tomb of an mysterious Viking king she has uncovered weeks ago. The ruins were hidden for hundreds of years without anyone knowing just a single bit of information about them. For some reason the inside of the ruins are very warm compared to the cold weather of Greenland outside. She takes off some of her thick clothes to not drown in her own sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Lara says to herself. \"Although Greenland was the first island prison, some of the Vikings saw themselves as colonists. They even crowned a monarch in those buildings...\" The walls tell her even more about the history of this place. But right when a curse or disease is mentioned the wall is all messed up and unreadable. Because she can't read more she walks deeper into the ruins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark hallway leads her to a great room. The middle of the room is illuminated by a pillar of light shining down from the ceiling. \"Weird. I didn't see an opening for that light.\" Lara says while walking to the middle of the room. As she comes closer to the middle, she spots a little altar with some ancient artifacts on it. Lara is a bit cautious because she hasn't activated a trap yet, which is very suspicious because she normally encounters something dangerous when she walks into a tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe altar is positioned right underneath the puller of light. On it lay weapons, jewelry, bones and other stuff that was probably made for decorative purposes. Before she touches anything she takes out a flashlight and looks at the walls around to see if there are any messages the Vikings have written down here. Most of the walls are covered in ice or are mostly devastated to the point they have become unreadable. But she catches some single information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The king build up a great kingdom isolated from the world. Her fought every intruder of with his own hands, standing shoulder on shoulder with his soldiers. But after great battles and great victory her found an spring of... Well... Sadly the ice has destroyed this part. The rest is also just nonsense. And that part doesn't tell me anything important.\" Lara is disappointed by the condition of the ruins. Normally she steps upon some ancient text, which tells her about a great tragedy or a coming apocalypse. But this time nothing important other than the existence of A kingdom the world never saw. Because it's her duty to write her new knowledge down she notes everything she sees and takes pictures of the whole place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she photographed the whole place, her interest turns to the altar. She inspects the things and comes to the conclusion: \"This must be the remains of the great king who was mentioned. I'm surprised the bones are placed like that. So well ordered and preserved. But why didn't they bury him like every great Viking on a burning boat?\" In her speak she looks closer at an axe laying beside the bones. Letters engraved on the handle of the weapon are the most confusing thing she has seen in this tomb so far. She can't read majority of the letters but she knows that they are some kind of norse. The only words she can read are \"big\" and \"gods\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a strong wind runs through the tomb. Surprisingly it didn't cause any rumble or destruction inside the ruins, like it would always be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara quickly recovers from the rush and looks around. To her surprise nothing happened. A little worried she takes photos of the altar and slowly leaves the tomb. \"I will come back one day and find out more about you my little tomb.\" she says while leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara packs her stuff, puts on the thick winter clothes again and heads outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later she writes about the Viking tomb she has discovered, inside her home in California. After she finishes to describe the tomb in every detail she saw, Lara decides to go for a little nerve calming swim in her pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing an nice an comfortable bikini she enters the water and sits down at the edge of the pool. Her body starts relaxing instantly in the warm water. She leans her head back and closes her eyes to relax even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time relaxing she suddenly feels her bikini digging into her body. Wondering what's wrong she stands up but shrugges as she realizes she the water barely covers her boobs although she stands in deep water. Normally the water would touch her nose if she stands in this part of the pool. But for some reason the water only covers her body up to her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she checks her bikini and tries to adjust it until it fits perfectly again. But her bikini remains tight. Suddenly a body rushes through her body. Lara moans and closes her eyes because of the strange and arousing feeling. She pants after the feeling fades away. Shocked she notices that the water sunk even lower. Now the water only covers up to an area above her bellybutton. She decides to leave the pool quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wants to leave, another rush hits her. When she looks down at her again the water sunk below her bellybutton, already touching the rim of her bikini bottom. Quickly she jumps out of the water before someone sees her. In the hallway of her home she gets hit by another rush. While the feeling rushes through her body she hears a loud snap. Her bikini top flies of and the bottom struggles not to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara stumbles into the high main lobby while covering her boobs. Her whole body shakes before another feeling hits her. This time the feeling feels much stronger and causes her to fall on her knees, trying to endure the feeling. After just a few seconds her bikini bottom also snaps and she has to cover both of her private parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew seconds after her head bumps against the wall behind her. Panting she looks around, trying not to moan lustful because of the feeling flowing through her body. Now she realizes, she is growing. She has to bend, because otherwise she would probably burst through the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two she sits in the main lobby bumping her head on the ceiling. \"I'm... I'm huge!\" Lara says scared of the situation. After doing quick math she figures out she stands 100 ft tall. Any move would probably cause the walls to collapse. But she can't just sit there doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should or can Lara do?</span></div></div>",

It had been nearly an hour since his partner, world famous explorer Lara Croft had ventured into the cave, alone. Simon scratched his head under his turban, sweating in the hot sun. The plan was simple enough. Simon obtained the map to a priceless treasure (through methods best left unexplained), and he had hired Lara to retrieve it. In any other circumstances, Simon would have gone himself, but he had broken his ankle on a previous hunt, and he had owed Lara a favor. His thoughts were interupted by a soft noise deep in the dark cave. Simon peered in, not seeing anything more than 15 feet in. He momentarily had the crazy notion that Lara had found an alternate exit, and left Simon here with his head in the clouds. He shook that idea away. He had known Lara for a few years, she would never do a thing like that. Especially considering the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was supposedly a necklace that turned a man into a god, at least that's what the translations had read. He knew Lara would understand his own curiousity and would be eager to show Simon it's power, if any. Simon sighed, and began to walk away from the entrance, until he noticed a small movement deep inside the cave entrance. Simon stepped cautiously closer, pulling out his handgun. It seemed to be an enourmous snake, writhing ever closer to the entrance. It's head was flat and shiny and pointed, and it seemed to slide across the cave floor and into the light. As it did, Simon's eyes widened. It wasn't a snake. It was a finger. A gigantic finger, with an equally huge hand behind it. With a quick flick of the wrist, the entrance of the cave was demolished. Simon fell on his rear as the now house-sized head of Lara Croft rose from the hole in the ground that was once a cave. Around her neck was a dark brown, jewel-encrusted necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon suddenly understood what the translations meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sat on the ground, staring at the gargantuan body of Lara Croft, who now stood in full view. Lara was now about 7 stories tall. Simon slowly stood up, and against his better judgement, walked a little closer to Lara. His head just cleared her little toe, as he noted she had taken off her boots for some reason. He looked up her body towards her head. She was still wearing her tradmark blue top and Daisy Dukes, complete with guns the size of tractor trailers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay up above, Lara breathed in the fresh air. All the dusty cave atmosphere had clogged her up. She looked down at her bare feet. She had removed her boots much earlier, before she grew, to walk a tightrope over a drop that would have spelled instant death. Unfortunetly, she dropped them going over. Oh well, she thought, no use worrying about that now. She crouched down, her face a few yards from tiny little Simon. Wow, I guess the Incans were right about the god thing, she thought to herself, slightly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon?\" she asked down to her bug-sized partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon stared into her huge eyes. It was definetly her, the tell-tale British accent was evident. Lara smiled down at him, and he relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Croft?\" he responded. \"I'm guessing that the necklace isn't a hoax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo, little guy,\" Lara returned. \"Guess I should have waited until I got out here to test 'er out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, what can you do?\" asked Simon. \"So, now what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara sat down, crushing a tree under her titanic bottom, and began to think. The problem with all this, she thought to herself, is the fact that Simon will probably want to sell this, or some other rubbish. We can't let this fall into the wrong hands. Lara turned her head towards Simon, staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked uneasily into those door-sized eyes. He didn't like the looks of them. He averted his eyes form hers, and began to back away from her right foot. Suddenly, Lara shifted, and placed her bare foot easily on top of Simon, careful not to smash him into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, that should hold him for now, thought Lara. As she ran through her options in her mind, she felt Simon's tiny form squirming beneath her sole, tickling her slightly. Annoyed, she lifted her foot, seeing Simon stare up at her. She shot him a quick smirk, and placed her big toe directly on top of him, trapping him instantly. He still struggled, but at least she could think. After a minute of pondering, she had made up her mind. In that time, Simon had managed to squirm up and get himself stuck between her sweaty toes. Lara reached down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara reached down and plucked Simon carefully from between her toes. She brought him slowly towards her face, right before her eyes. Simon stared back into them, fear etched onto his face. She gave him another smile, tilted her head back, opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue. With Simon kicking and screaming, she lowered him towards her enormous tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon thrashed between Lara's fingers. He could see directly into Lara's mouth a short distance below him. Her huge, wet tongue stuck out like some surreal waterslide, leading into the dark cave of her throat. Simon fought with all his might, and after a few seconds of struggling, he freed himself from Lara's fingers. He plummeted for a few feet, and landed on a soft, wet landing pad. He began to run for the tip of Lara's tongue, but as he did, she began pulling her tongue back into the dark recesses of her mouth. Simon slipped and fell face first onto the pink muscle, and as he looked up, he saw teeth, gums, and other assorted sections of the mouth surround him. Lara had her mouth slightly open, leaving him enough light to see where he was. Simon could smell the strong scent of a tuna fish sandwich, Lara's lunch earlier in the day. Only one chance, he thought, and Simon dashed towards the opening Lara had left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara felt Simon get to his feet and run towards her open lips. She smiled, and instantly closed her mouth, trapping Simon in darkness. She bounced him around on her tongue. Lara couldn't believe it, but this was actually relaxing, and a bit fun. She giggled as she felt Simon slip around on her tongue, struggling in her saliva. As fun as teasing her partner was, it was time for business. Lara straightened up, and positioned Simon right at the end of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Simon,\" she said in her oddly sweet accent, her voice booming up in Simon's face. \"I guess I'll see what's left of you in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lara closed her eyes, tilted her head back, and swallowed her partner. She felt Simon slide into her throat, down a few inches, and then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon slid down the slick, tight tube for a few seconds until he reached an opening, which propelled him into a large, dark area. Simon picked up his head, looked around, and realized suddenly that he had been eaten by Lara Croft. He could hear her heart beating right above him, loud, resonating thumps that jostled her entire stomach and its new contents. He suddenly tumbled forward, as Lara was moving. He guessed she was laying down. A large piece of partially digested tuna sandwich landed on top of him. Simon would soon be next, joining that sandwich inside Lara's digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara woke a few hours later, still right next to the cave. A small deer had wandered next to her face, probably still smelling her last meal. Lara suddenly whipped out her tongue, sticking the tiny animal to it. She pulled the deer into her mouth, and quickly swallowed it whole. She smiled and sat up as she felt the creature begin its journey down her throat and into her belly. She thought about Simon, and imagined that he was probably inside her intestines by now, maybe somewhere near her bowels. She stood up, streched, and began to walk towards civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
