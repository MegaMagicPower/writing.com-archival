Unfortunately your home town is too small to have a high-school so your parents have decided that you will move in with your mother's friend, Ms Thompson, who lives in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****PLEASE NOTE (Especially if you are adding chapters)*****<br>\r\nThere are two types of decisions in this story: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first are choices which Daniel (the reader) can make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: It is still 15 minutes to recess but the pressure on your bladder is almost too much. <br>\r\n[What do you do?]<br>\r\n1) Try to hold on.<br>\r\n2) Ask for permission to go to the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second are events outside of Daniel's control. These can be either random events or decisions other characters make. These are decided by rolling a normal 6-sided die (or use <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.random.org/dice/?num=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.random.org/dice/?num=1</a> if you don't have one handy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: You decide to hold on until recess but as time drags on you begin to doubt that you'll make it that long.<br>\r\n[Roll a die.]<br>\r\n(1 to 4) You manage to hold on until recess.<br>\r\n(5 or 6) You wet yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Example: You raise your hand and ask for permission to go to the toilet.<br>\r\n[Roll a die.]<br>\r\n(1 to 3) The teacher lets you go.<br>\r\n(4 to 6) The teacher tells you to wait until recess.</td>",
