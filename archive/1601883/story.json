But at least you're going to be far away from them now. Of course, this place didn't seem to be much better. Calloway's Military School, not exactly a spa, but at least the place looked clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the school itself was a basic school building made of brown brick, with a large steel fence surrounding it. You didn't know much about military school, but movies and rumors had given you the idea you'd be spending a lot of time peeling potatoes and cleaning latrines. With a sigh your notice a comm with a large button, you press it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\" A voice comes from the comm. You notice a nearby camera, and assume whoever was on the comm was also watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your newest student.\" You say with no emotion in your voice, wishing for a moment you were anywhere but here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\" The voice asks. You give him your name, and for a moment you can here him shuffle through papers. \"No, you're definitely not registered here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a confused look and wonder if the guy had screwed up or if something if wrong with the paper work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a call about you earlier, you're not registered here, you're registered at Grimwood. It the building the right next to us up the hill, you can't miss it.\" The man on the other side of the comm said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You're not registered here? How did that happen? For a moment, you're actually pretty happy, this means no Military school. But then you looked up the hill and notice the 'school'. You're not sure how you missed it before. It was a big old building, that looked decrepit, and cute spooky. That couldn't be a school, it looked more like a haunted house. You press the buzzer again, but the person on the other side of the comm is done talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know the area at all, and it looked like it would rain any minute. With no other options you grab your bags and start heading up the hill. Thankfully it was to long a walk, unfortunately the school looked worse up close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead plant life, insects everywhere, and the building looked even scarier up close. Gather up all your courage you knock on the door, secretly hoping for no one to answer. Like most of your wishes, this one didn't come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman who appeared to be middle aged opened the door, grabbed your arm and pulled you in. You let out a yelp and nearly drop your bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're here.\" The woman lets go of your arm and speaks to you. \"I was wondering what was taking so long. The girls have been so excited about your arrival. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Miss Grimwood and this is my school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she let go, you calmed down a little, but frankly this place was even scarier on the inside then the outside. \"I think there's been a mix up. I'm supposed to be going to Calloway's.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Grimwood shook her head. \"Oh my, no I'm afraid you're mixed up. We got your application for my school quite a while ago.\" She pulled the application out of her pocket and showed it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat so it because someone got the address wrong, it looks like you're being spending the year in this run down shack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am proud to welcome you, the first ever student for my school who is male and the first student who is human, to Miss Grimwood's School for Ghouls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blink for a moment, not understanding what she was saying at all. Was this woman crazy? This couldn't be a real school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this experience will be educational for both you and my girls, and here's one of them now.\" Miss Grimwood motioned to the figure that just entered the room it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then you hear something like a bird flapping in the distance then something small and purple flys out of the door and threw another to fast to see what it was. \"Wow what was that!?\" you say as you look into the blackened doorway that the thing flew into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear that was Sibella one of your classmates. she must not have seen you. Oh Sibella do come back and greet our new student\" Miss grimwood called out and you both looked down into the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the flapping again but its louder and not coming from the doorway. You tern to see a furry purple face right in front of yours. \"AHHH!\" you cry out as you jump back tripping on your own feet and landing on your butt. Looking up you see that it was a bat flapping in place screeching in a way that almost sounds like its laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe this. It was bad enough that you were mistakenly enrolled in the wrong school...FOR GIRLS!, but for it to be an animal training school! If word of this gets out back home you'll never hear the end of it. You can picture your girlfriend buying you a pink dog collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you bend over to get up you hear a strange noise then the sound of the bats screeching is replaced by a girls laughing. You look up to see a goth girl with purple skin and hair that looked un-brushed and reached down to her shins. She had blood red lipstick on and green eyes, wearing a black dress that reached past her feet and was cut open at the bottom in a slit up to just over her knee with one leg sticking out. she had no socks on and was wearing blood red hi heels, the sleeves on her dress seemed shredded like the ends where ripped off and on her wast was a red sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. My name is Sibella. Its fang-tastic to meet you\" she said in a proper/seductive voice as she held out her hand to help you up. \"Hi, where did the bat go? you ask as you take her hand and are pulled up off the ground with inhuman strength. \"I'm right heer\" she replies with a broad smile showing off her teeth and a...set...of...fangs? Sibella then stretches out her arms and you hear that same strange sound as a strange light surrounded her and as it dispersed you saw that bat flapping toward you. it landed on your head and bent over too look down at your face.</span></div></div>",

You blink a few times and see a few different faces looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He Woke up! He woke up!\" A voice of a young girl scream's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can see that Tannis.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice sounded familiar. Suddenly you remembered what happened the next moment you sit up straight in your bed. You look around and see different girl ghouls watching at you. You suddenly noticed a small figure sitting on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! I'm Tannis. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the voice of a young girl you heard before. Young is the right word. The girl is about two feet high. But what's more strange she is wrapped up in bandage from head to toe except for her blue eyes that look kindly at you. Together with the pink bow on her head and sweet little kid smile she does't seem scary but you also see she's a mummy. You attention goes to the other girls who all look curious at you.<br>\r\nOne of the has white hair and you can see right through her. <br>\r\nAnother one  has black hair and is stitched together like some sort of doll. <br>\r\nThen you see Sibella and a little girl with brown fur and red curly hair. She smiles at you that's probably mend friendly, but seeing a mouth full of razor sharp teeth gives the wrong effect.<br>\r\nYou gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. Tannis asked you a question.\" The werewolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does't look too good. A little pale. Maybe he's sick.\" The ghost girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you.\" The mummy girl asks while she crawls over too you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... y... you are ghouls. Girl ghouls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you never met a girl ghoul before.\" Sibella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have't.\" You manage too say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha haa! Well then that explains why you fainted.\" The phantom girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not a son from a famous monster.\" Sibella says and bents for over and you almost get lost in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway... welcome to ghoul school!\" The girl who's stitched together says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks ... eh... \" You look wondered at the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll look calm and friendly at you. In the movies you have seen monsters like this killing people, drinking their blood, ripping of limbs or simply strangle them. But not one of these girl acted like that. Besides after you fainted they put you in bed. If they wanted to kill you they would't have done that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like i said i'm Tannis and this is Winnie,\" The mummy girl said and pointed to the werewolf girl and after that too the ghost girl. \"That's Phantasma mostly called Phanty. You already know Sibella and last but not least Elsa Frankenteen.\" She said while she pointed to the girl that was stitched together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still not sure what too do. They all look at you and you look back like a hypnotized bunny. All seemed very friendly. But still this are ghouls. The things you used to had nightmares about.<br>\r\nThen Miss Grimwood comes in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you're up. I wanted to meet you too the gym teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it's a zombie i rather pass out again. You think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the teacher who come in seems pretty normal. He's followed by two dogs. One big and one little dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this is a zombie he passed away recently. He seems to be a human just like you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see another girl. You two are running so fast there's no chance you can stop on time. You prepare yourself too ran into her. One moment you see her surprised face and the next moment you two pass through her. You wish you had't since it feels like a cold shower.<br>\r\nYou look at the girl with open mouth. You just went right through her. That's not possible. Besides that you notice you can see right through her. Another thing is she floats above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaa. You must be the new student!\" She laughs. \" I'm Fanthasma. But they mostly call me Fanty. What kind of ghoul are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... eh...\" Is all you're able to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were't kidding. This really is a school for ghouls. Girl ghouls. You now know something is really wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Look! Hahaa. Thare's Sibella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see a purple bat that flies over too you. For one moment  you wonder if the name of the bat is Sibella but then the bat grows and get's arms and legs. For you stands a girl. Purple skin and long purple hair and she wares a long dark purple gown. You must admit she looks very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. It's fang-tastic to have you here. Always nice to see new blood\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do a few steps back. You're afraid that's for sure. All right you could think that the werewolf girl is wearing a costume. But what about that ghost girl. You went right through her. She could be a projection but that does't make sense why when you ran through her it felt like you went under an ice cold shower. It also does't explain how a bat changed into a girl. <br>\r\nNow you know for sure these girl are real ghouls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Bat got your thong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think what too do when you suddenly feel a hand on your shoulder. You see the has stitches at the wrist like it's stitched on. You look over your shoulder afraid of what you might see.<br>\r\nYou see girl with black hair that's stitched together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Nice to meet you I'm Elsa Frankenteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the other girls. Winnie has a grin. You can clearly see her razor sharp teeth grow out of  living gums. Sibella has a grin wide enough to see two sharp fangs. Fanty is just laughing while she is floating in the air.<br>\r\nThe next moment you ran away screaming like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say hello.\" Elsa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah i guess he's just shy.\" Sibella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and he's the only guy. Say has anyone seen Tannis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran through some rooms and suddenly you see a small girl. She looks pretty normal. No fangs, razor sharp teeth, claws, looking through or stitched on limbs. Just a normal little girl except she is wrapped up in bandage. Without a doubt a mummy but she look really cute whit her pink bow and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Your new here right. I'm Tannis. I'm the youngest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriendly she sticks out her arm. You don't know what else too do then shake it. It's just a normal hand. She is't squeezing or and cracking the bones. Just a normal handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eh i think i must be going now.\" You say while you're walking too the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a green lizard jumped before the door making hissing sounds. <br>\r\nYou do one step back. The the lizard get's red and suddenly it spits fire. <br>\r\nBefore it hits you a lasso made of bandage wraps around you and someone pulls you away just in time. It's the mummy girl Tannis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Thanks Tannis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mummy walks over too the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matches how dare you? That's a new student and Miss Grimwood told us to make sure he would feel at home here. It's very important that monsters and humans can live in harmony and this is the first step. But instead of helping you try to roast him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon made some strange sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care you don't know him. Careful or you sleep outside tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are.\" Miss Grimwood says. \"I know Matches does't like strangers but when you know him he's fine.\"    <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen the other girls walk in. But the also a human and two dogs. they don't seem scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" The man said. \"Nice to finally see another human her except for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like this guy really is a human and is't scared from all the scary girls. Maybe the're not so bad. That mummy girl Tannis saved you. And if they were planning to kill you they could already have done it. Besides that other human also looks fine. So why would they kill you and what that Mummy girl said sounded like they wanted to have you here.<br>\r\nYou decide to put you fear away and get to know the girls. </span></div></div>",

You insist to the girls you find it yourself, wanting to finally put some distance between you and them. You breath a sigh of relief when you find the room, enter, and shut the door. Then suddenly you start coughing violently due to all the dust in the air. Apparently monsters weren't great house keepers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly your room was just as dark and dank as everything else in the horrible place: The wood floor looked like it was rotting, the only furniture you had was old bed and a cabinet that had burn marks on it, but at least you had a window. Meaning, you now had a way out, and none of the Ghouls where here to stop you this time. You're on the second floor, but willing to risk a jump if it meant getting out. You open the window and scan the area below: Brown dried grass, dead or dying plants, and a small fence, nothing too threatening. You could make it this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're half way out of the window when suddenly you notice something on the roof just above you. It was that freaky werewolf girl again, grinning while looking down at you. \"Hey you must be feeling better, what are you doing? Is this a new game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin nervously and pull back into the room and shut the window. Nope, you weren't going anywhere. Everywhere you turn there is one of these things trying to stop you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, maybe you could call for help? You look around...but no phone in sight, but maybe there was one somewhere else in the house? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the old bed you've been provided and try and think up a plan, only then do you notice a small note on a white sheet of paper on the bed. You pick it up and read it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Trust no one<br>\r\n-Whisper'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's weird. But no more weird than anything else in this place. You don't even know a Whisper, that couldn't be a real name. You disregard the note and examine your options.</span></div></div>",

She nearly took a bite out of you earlier, but then again, she did heal the wound and apologize. Realizing she wasn't leaving you slowly got off the bed and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, she didn't look as scary as before. Taking a closure look, she actually was quite pretty. Her long hair hanging to her legs, smooth violet skin, and eyes that matched her skin. Frankly, in a different situation you might try hitting on her, if you weren't so afraid she'll eat you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sure.\" You reply, taking a glance around the room to see if there was anything you could defend yourself with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella brightened a little. \"Good, I just wanted to really say welcome. I know you're first day here hasn't been great, but we do want you to like it here, and we really want you to stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, well, you hadn't expected her to say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie saw you trying to climb out your window, she thought you were playing. Look I don't know much about mortals, but please give this a chance, I think Miss Grimwood was right about us learning from each other.\" She pleaded with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment, still unsure about all of this. Basically, what it came down to was you would have to spend at least a year here with monsters, ghouls, and whatever untold dangerous if you agreed. But if you didn't, who knew what the consequences could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you didn't really have anywhere else to go. At least it would be interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay, but you'd better take it easy on me.\" You say, half joking, half serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella smiles and nods. She leaves, and you decide to hit the hay, you just realized, you might need to tell someone about that strange letter. But that could wait.

Though there did seem to be an awful lot of poison ivy around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dark clouds in the sky, nearly blocking out the sun, and you had a feeling this was typical weather for this place. You remind yourself you agreed to give this place a chance, and try to ignore the glum surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy and Scooby stopped, and turned around, looking at you and the other students. \"Okay gang, we like beat Calloway last year in a game of volleyball.

Like, outside the gate cause it's a lot less scary on the other side.\" He turns to you. \"Like, don't worry if you don't win man, you are dealing with some tough competition. Just try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, wondering if you even stand a chance. Everyone stretches for a bit, before lining up at the starting line. \"Like, get ready, set, go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie pulls ahead as the race starts. Elsa falls behind, unfortunately being stitched together doesn't make her very quick. Tanis is much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly you manage to pull ahead of Sibella, she really should have worn something easier to run in than her normal outfit. Around the first turn you catch up to, and pass Phantasma, who you guess isn't use to running, as she usually floats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while, but as you approach the finish line you even catch up to Winnie, you're both neck and neck as you bolt towards the finish. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps the dank depressing school house was getting to you; a change of scenery would be nice. However visiting their parents seemed pretty frightening, still something inside of your mind tells you to do it, something you can't seem to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody.\" Tanis says with a smile, \"We should all go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Grimwood entered the room. \"Everyone ready to go? Well, see you all tonight my students.\" Grimwood raised what looked to be a wand and suddenly the world seemed to disappear around you. A split second later and the world reappeared, but you weren't in the school anymore, but you suddenly missed the school dearly as you were now in a village that looked like something you'd see in a nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was filled with old decrepit buildings, rotted away by time, savage looking creatures, giant insects, snakes, and rats filled the land; skeletal remains of unknown beings littered the land. You took a step back in fear, in the process you bumped into Sibella, who didn't even notice as she was mesmerized by the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah home sweet home.\" Sibella said, the other girls all voiced their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming here was a mistake.\" You murmured to yourself, none of the girls seemed to hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our dads will be at the Castle, we'd better go there.\" Winnie told the others. The Castle is only a short walk from the village, and it was a big improvement, but still looked like something of a black and white horror film. You and the others entered and once inside you noticed the large number of monsters inside. There were monsters of all shapes and sizes and they all seemed to be acting civil, like regular people. You half expected the castle full of creatures to rip you to shreds the moment you entered, but they paid little attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying close to the girls you follow them into a large room in the castle, inside was a large table and sitting by the table sat five monsters that were very familiar. Yes, you remembered them from the many horror films they have appeared in; Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy and the Phantom of the Opera. As the enthusiastic girl ran to greet their fathers fear\u2019s grip on you tightened your mind races and you look to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should take your chances with the other monsters in the castle, maybe it was better than what might happen when these horror icons realize you\u2019re going to school with their daughters.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looks tough\u201d said one <br>\r\n<br>\r\nboy. \u201cWhat are you a bunch of babies\u201d? The boy known as Tug rhetorically asked his companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's six of us and one of him. So quit your bellyaching\u201d he said assertively. From behind the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbushes the girls looked on in great surprise. \u201cHoly Howlers, what a bod\u201d! Exclaimed Winnie. \u201cI know, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've never seen this side of him before\u201d added Elsa as they both looked at the expression on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a big grin on your face, almost as if you were excited. \u201cWhat are you waiting for! I'm right <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere\u201d you say arrogantly. \u201cYou heard him\u201d said Tug. \u201cGet him\u201d! He yelled. All of the cadets except for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTug charge at you. \u201cHeh heh\u201d you laugh slightly amused at their ignorance. \u201cHA\u201d! You yell as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncharge them as well. What seems like instantaneously, you desemate the five cadets in a spectacular <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndisplay of martial arts the likes of which neither of the girls nor Tug have ever seen before. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nscreams of pain from the cadets seemed to echo as you continued to land blow after agonizing blow in <br>\r\n<br>\r\na flurry of strikes and kicks at speeds that seemed to surpass even a cobra's strike. All the boys landed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin a heap one on top of the other like a stack of flapjacks as you proved they were no match for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to their leader Tug with a smirk on your face. The girls were speechless from their hiding <br>\r\n<br>\r\nplace. They merely stared, mouths agape. \u201cThat wasn't nearly as fun as I thought it would be\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought military cadets would give me a better challenge than this\u201d. You begin to walk slowly over <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto Tug, all the while smiling. He takes a few steps back, obviously scared of what you might do. \u201cWhat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nkind of military man sends his troops into battle without any kind of support\u201d you say, lecturing him as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou continue to close in on him. \u201cA coward, that's who\u201d you say answering your own question. You're <br>\r\n<br>\r\nonly a few feet away from him now and he snaps. Like a cornered rat. He pulls out a small switch <br>\r\n<br>\r\nblade. \u201cStay back you FREAK\u201d! He yells holding the pocket knife in front of him to hopefully keep <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou at bay.  Seeing the small knife, you merely chuckle. As quick as a flash you make your move and <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrab the knife. \u201cNow that's not fair, I'm not even armed\u201d you say sarcastically. Tug looks to his now <br>\r\n<br>\r\nempty hand and back to you, realizing that you now have his knife. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d!!! He screams. \u201cY-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour a m-monster just like the rest of those freaks at Grimwood\u201d. Says Tug. This made your sarcastic <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmile disappear. It was replaced with a stern and serious look. You grab the hilt of the knife and place <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour thumb at the base of the blade. \u201cYou can make fun of me. You can call me names. You can try to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhurt me. But if you DARE insult those girls again.....\u201d You pause for a moment and flex your hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhich is holding the blade. Tug and the girls hear a loud SNAP as the blade of the knife falls to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nground. You snapped the knife in two, using nothing but your thumb. \u201cI will END you\u201d! You exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is QUITE enough\u201d you hear someone yell. You and Tug both turn to see the Head Master of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamp Calloway, Colonel Calloway himself. He heard moaning and groaning and looked down to see <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis cadets stacked on top of each other beaten and bruised. \u201cWhat happened\u201d! He yelled concerned. \u201cIt <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas him\u201d! Yelled Tug pointing at you. \u201cAnd he was about to do the same to me\u201d he continued. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel walked over to you. Do you have anything to say for yourself\u201d? He asked in an angry tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d you say nonchalantly. You wait a few moments. \u201cWell\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cYou're cadets need <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmore training, that's for sure\u201d you say arrogantly. \u201cGrrrrr\u201d He looks at you angrily gritting his teeth.......</span></div></div>",

Inquired <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy as he and Scooby made their way to the scene. \u201cOne of your students harassed and beat my <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncadets\u201d! The Colonel shouted. \u201cZoinks, like, is that true\u201d? Shaggy asked looking at you and you threw <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour shirt back on. \u201cYes unfortunately, but only after they tried to attack me first. It was only in self <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndefense\u201d you say in defense. \u201cOh really\u201d? Asked the Colonel looking back towards Tug. \u201cIs that true <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTug? Were you and the boys harassing this young man\u201d? He asks, interrogating his cadet. \u201cW-well uh\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid Tug nervously as he looked about. He looked back towards the Colonel to see his arms folded and <br>\r\n<br>\r\na stern look on his face. You walk over to him. Tug flinches expecting the worst, but you merely place a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhand on his shoulder. \u201cLook\u201d you say. \u201cYou've already made some pretty bad decisions today and your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfriends paid the price for it. Don't add lying to the list. Do what's right and come clean\u201d. Tug looks to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe ground then back to the Colonel. \u201cY-yes, we started it sir\u201d. \u201cWell, if that's the case\u201d says Calloway <br>\r\n<br>\r\nturning his attention to you. \u201cThen I'm sorry my cadets caused you so much trouble\u201d. You turn to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand say \u201cThank yo-\u201d \u201cBut that's no excuse for what you did\u201d he interrupted. \u201cHuh\u201d? You ask confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you may have been acting in self defense, there was no reason for you to use such excessive <br>\r\n<br>\r\nforce\u201d. You realize he was right. \u201cI'm sorry sir, I guess I just let myself get carried away\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\napologetically. \u201cJust see to it it doesn't happen again\u201d he said sternly. \u201cDon't worry\u201d said Shaggy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalking over to you, placing a hand on your shoulder. \u201cLike, don't worry man. We'll make sure it <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndoesn't\u201d. \u201cReah, ron't rappen ragain\u201d added Scooby. \u201cGood\u201d replied the Colonel. \u201cAnd as for you\u201d he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid as he walked over to Tug. He then yanked his ear, pulling him back into camp. \u201cYeow, ow, ow, <br>\r\n<br>\r\now\u201d! Tug yelped as they went back to camp. \u201cLike, what was all that about\u201d? Shaggy asked. \u201cNothing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\njust a little scuffle between boys\u201d you reply. \u201cWelp, whatever happened, glad it's over\u201d he said. \u201cLet's <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngo on back to the Mystery Machine, I got lunch ready and I'm starving\u201d. \u201cReah, rarving\u201d said Scooby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d you say smiling, as you follow them.

They were in the common room talking amongst each other. \u201cGirls! You'll never believe it\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExclaimed Elsa as she and Winnie made their way to the common room. \u201cMy goodness, what is it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat's got your bolts in a twist\u201d? Asked Tannis. \u201cIt was amazing\u201d! Interrupted Winnie. The Calloway <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncadets were all like \u201cWere gonna beat you up\u201d and he was all like \u201cI don't think so. Hiya, Hiya, Hiya\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued as she struck several awkward looking fighting poses. Sibella, Tannis, and Phanty just <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook at each other confused.  \u201cWhat in the world are you talking about\u201d? Asked Sibella. At this time <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Grimwood and Matches make their way through the common room to the kitchen. \u201cAfternoon <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngirls, dinner will be ready in a little while\u201d. \u201cThanks Ms. Grimwood\u201d they all say in unison. Winnie <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmotions for the girls to move closer together and they all go into a huddle. She and Elsa go on to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexplain how they saw you take on and beat the cadets without even breaking a sweat. \u201cI'm telling you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe was spooktactular\u201d said Winnie. \u201cReally\u201d? Asked Phanty. \u201cOh yeah, his moves were incredible. He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas so nimble and graceful\u201d. She paused for a moment and cupped her hands under her chin as she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfantasized about the next portion of her story. \u201cAnd what a bod\u201d she said. This caught Phanty and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella's full attention \u201cHis what\u201d? Asked Sibella. \u201cYeah, as soon as he took his shirt off, it was like a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfull moon, I couldn't look away\u201d. \u201cOh brother\u201d said Elsa, rolling her eyes. \u201cLet's go Tannis, I think your <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntoo young for this portion of the conversation. Tannis just looked confusedly back at the other girls as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa took her out of the room. Winnie continued \u201cHis chizzled abs, bulging pecs, and his strong arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a stud\u201d she let out a heavy sigh as she began to daydream about you. \u201cWow\u201d Sibella and Phanty <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsay in unison as they follow suit and begin to daydream about you as well. Sibella is the first to snap <br>\r\n<br>\r\nout of it, realizing that she's not the only one thinking of you. \u201cWait a minute\u201d she says. \u201cWinnie, you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndon't like-like him do you\u201d? \u201cOf course I do\u201d Winnie replies somewhat defensively. \u201cB-but you can't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike him. I like him\u201d retorted Sibella. \u201cHey\u201d Phanty spoke up. \u201cYou two can't like him. I like him\u201d! She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexclaimed. \u201cWhat\u201d?! Both Winnie and Sibella say in unison. All three girls then begin to stare each <br>\r\n<br>\r\nother down with a great fierceness. You could almost see the static coming from their eyes. \u201cHe's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmine\u201d! Stated Sibella. \u201cNo way, phantoms first\u201d! Said Phanty as a rebuttal. \u201cYou're both crazy, he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nobviously likes me best\u201d! Said Winnie. The three begin to argue amongst each other about who is most <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuitable and whom among them you like best. You seem to have bad timing as you, Shaggy, Scooby, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Scrappy all walk in and see what looks like World War Three going on. Shaggy is the first to try <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand intervene. \u201cGirls like, what's going on\u201d? He asks. They all just turn and give him a death stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoinks\u201d! He exclaims. \u201cIs it something I said\u201d? He asked nervously. The girls then see you with them <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand immediately rush over to you. \u201cGah\u201d! You say as this catches you by surprise. \u201cWhich of us do you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike\u201d? They all ask you flatly and in unison. \u201cHuh? W-well, I like all of you girls\u201d you say thinking you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanswered correctly. (Boy were you wrong) \u201cNO\u201d! They say again in unison. \u201cWhich of us do you like-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike\u201d Phanty insisted. \u201cIt's me right\u201d? She asked striking a sexy pose. \u201cNo way, I'm the clear winner. I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAM the prettiest\u201d said Sibella. \u201cYeah right\u201d interrupted Winnie. \u201cHe obviously likes ME best\u201d. \u201cWell, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhich is it\u201d they say heckling you for an answer. \u201cI uummm\u201d you say as sweat begins to drip down <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour face. You look towards Shaggy for support, only to see that he, Scrappy, and Scooby were already <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngone. 'Don't leave me' you thought to yourself. \u201cWell\u201d the girls asked again, eager for an answer. \u201cW-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell, you see. I um.....\u201d \u201cYes\u201d? All the girls say seductively as they cling to you. \u201cEveryone, dinner's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nready\u201d shouts Ms. Grimwood. \u201cOh would you look at that. Welp, guess we'll have to continue this <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconversation some other time\u201d you say talking a mile a minute and run as fast as you can to the kitchen, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nleaving a trail of dust behind you. \u201cOooohhhhh\u201d all the girls say in unison once again as they fold their <br>\r\n<br>\r\narms, obviously disappointed with your lack of an answer. You quickly take your seat at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was that insanity about' you think to yourself as you try to clear your head.</span></div></div>",

You look back at the three of them and smile. \u201cThank you girls, you have <br>\r\n<br>\r\nno idea how good that makes me feel\u201d you say. They all come in for another hug and you accept their <br>\r\n<br>\r\nloving embrace. 'I think I can get use to this' you think to yourself. In the darkness of the night, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhisper watches closely from a distance, so as not to be seen. He sees the loving environment you are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin and shakes his head in disapproval. He turns and begins to walk away. 'This isn't good. I don't need <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim growing attached to those freaks. This could muck up everything' he thinks to himself as he walks <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfurther into the darkness. \u201cBy the way\u201d said Phanty. Who taught you all that cool stuff\u201d? \u201cYes, surely <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhad some sort of teacher\u201d said Sibella. Winnie looked to you in interest just as the others did. \u201cWell\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou reply looking into their eyes. \u201cIt was......my father\u201d. \u201cReally, wow! If you're that good, then your <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndad must be GREAT\u201d! She exclaimed. \u201cYeah\u201d you say, pausing for a moment as you look up toward <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe ceiling. \u201cHe was\u201d you say coldly. \u201cWas\u201d? Asks Sibella. \u201cY-you means he's-\u201d \u201cDead, yes\u201d. You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninterrupting her. \u201cI'm so sorry\u201d said Phanty. \u201cIt couldn't be helped\u201d you say. \u201cHe died doing what he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nloved\u201d. \u201cReally? What did your dad do\u201d? Asked Winnie. \u201cC'mon girls, this could be a really sensitive <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsubject for him\u201d says Sibella. \u201cIt's okay\u201d you say \u201cYou girls should know\u201d. You take in a long deep <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreath, knowing that they wouldn't like the answer. \u201cSigh, my father.....was-\u201d \u201cHey everyone\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nscreamed Shaggy from downstairs, interrupting you. \u201cLike, Ms. Grimwood says it's time for bed\u201d! He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshouted so everyone could hear. \u201cMan! He always has bad timing\u201d said Winnie. \u201cI know, I wanted to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhear more\u201d said Phanty. \u201cCome on, you can tell us before bed\u201d said Sibella. \u201cWell\u201d you say. \u201cC'mon, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlights out girls\u201d said Shaggy opening the door enough to pop his head in. \u201cReah, rights out\u201d added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooby. The girls look back to you for a response. \u201cSorry girls\u201d you say smiling. \u201cGuess I'll have to tell <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou another time\u201d you say shrugging your shoulders. \u201cAaaawwwww\u201d all the girls say in unison. \u201cLet's <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngo girls, let him get ready for bed\u201d said Shaggy as the girls exited your room. Before he left Shaggy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nturned back to you giving you a thumbs up as if saying \u201cYour welcome\u201d. \u201cHeh heh\u201d you chuckle <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrubbing the back of your head as you return the thumbs up. As soon as he leaves and shuts the door <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbehind him you flop down onto your bed and let out a heavy sigh. \u201cAm I some kind of idiot? How in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe world can I tell them THAT\u201d! You say out loud to yourself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Well, tonight's the night' You thought to yourself as you woke up on Halloween morning. You put on a <br>\r\n<br>\r\npair of jogging pants and decide to forget the shirt and go downstairs to see everyone else already <br>\r\n<br>\r\nawake. \u201cGood morning sleepy head\u201d said Phanty as she floated over to you, giving you a hug. As you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreach the bottom of the stairs Sibella and Winnie do the same, embracing you in a hug. \u201cGood <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmorning\u201d they both say. Morning girls, you say smiling sheepishly, while slightly blushing. You then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook over to see Elsa and Tannis carving pumpkins. \u201cMorning Elsa, morning Tannis\u201d you say waving to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthem. \u201cGood morning\u201d they both say. You put your shoes on and begin walking out the door. \u201cWhere <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare you going\u201d? Asked Sibella. \u201cI figured since you girls know about my martial arts skills now, there's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nno reason for me to hide it anymore. I'm just going to get in a good work out before breakfast\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I watch\u201d? Asked Winnie. \u201cMe too\u201d. \u201cMe three\u201d added Sibella and Phanty. 'Oh brother' you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, the more the merrier. Just try not to get in the way\u201d you say politely. \u201cWe won't\u201d the girls say in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunison as they follow you out the door. Elsa just shakes her head and rolls her eyes as she moves on to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nspreading the cob webs. Tannis looks out the window to see the girls following right behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I didn't know the girls were so interested in martial karts\u201d she said. \u201cIt's pronounced martial arts, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand they're not trust me. They're interested in something else entirely\u201d. \u201cWhat's that\u201d? Asked Tannis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll tell you when you're older\u201d Elsa replied. \u201cI hate that excuse\u201d said Tannis folding her arms. As you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfind a nice, wide open area, you begin your stretches. The girls enjoy the view from the sidelines as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreach down to stretch your legs. You hear the girls giggling amongst each other but decide to ignore <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthem, after all it's not causing any harm. \u201cAw man, that feels better\u201d you say finishing your stretches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get started\u201d. You lay in a push up position, nothing out of the ordinary, but what the girls see <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnext shocks them. You proceed to doing your push ups with only your left thumb! You begin to count <br>\r\n<br>\r\noff nonchalantly. \u201cOne, two, three, four.....\u201d without any discomfort. \u201cY-your only using your thumb\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella exclaimed. You stop for a moment. You look to your thumb and back to them. \u201cYou're right\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say. \u201cI should add some weight\u201d. All the girls face fault to the ground. They all quickly recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood grief\u201d says Phanty. \u201cHey Winnie\u201d you say. \u201cHm\u201d? She asks. \u201cCould you come sit on my back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nplease\u201d? She obliges of course, quickly running over and jumping on your back and sitting Indian style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d you say. \u201cAnything for you\u201d she says sticking her tongue out at the other girls. Sibella and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhanty give her pouty faces as they fold their arms. \u201cUh, okay, well hold on\u201d you say as you continue <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour push ups. About half an hour later Sibella and Phanty are watching in amazement and Winnie  was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas well as she sat on your back. \u201c497, 498, 499, 500\u201d you say. \u201cThanks Winnie, you can hop off now\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hops down as you get up stretching your arms. \u201cOh yeah\u201d you say. \u201cThat really got the blood <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflowing\u201d. \u201cSo your all done with your push ups\u201d? Asked Phanty. \u201cYep\u201d you reply. The girls sigh in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrelief, thinking that they would finally get to see some martial arts. \u201cTime for squats\u201d you say. All the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngirls face fault again. After you finish working out your arms, legs, and abs, you finally start the martial <br>\r\n<br>\r\narts portion of your daily routine. The girls look on with earnest as this is the moment they've been <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwaiting for. You show off for them for about ten or fifteen minutes, showing them a display of a wide <br>\r\n<br>\r\narray of different strikes, kicks, knees, and elbows that were very pleasing to the eyes, letting  them get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat they came for. You finish off the routine and are met with applause from the girls as they clearly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nenjoyed your performance. You say \u201cThanks girls, but there's still one technique I have yet to show <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou\u201d. \u201cOh, show us please\u201d said Winnie. \u201cYeah, pretty please\u201d added Phanty. \u201cSure\u201d you reply. \u201cBut <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou girls may want to step back a little\u201d. They take a few steps back as you walk up to a nearby tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing growing on it so you knew it was okay to do what you were about to do. You take a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsolid stance as the girls watch, anxiously waiting to see the technique. You draw in a few deep breaths, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then \u201cFIST OF HEAVEN\u201d! You shout and a loud CRACK is heard as you punch the tree and the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntree shatters and splinters all over the place, leaving nothing but a stump where the tree used to be. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nturn back to the girls and bow. They then give you a thunderous applause. \u201cHoly Howlers that was <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngreat\u201d! Said Winnie. \u201cI'll say\u201d said Sibella. \u201cIt was spooktactular\u201d added Phanty.  \u201cWelp\u201d you say. \u201cI'm <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoing to go back up to my room and meditate for a while\u201d you girls should go help get ready for the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nopen house tonight. Your dad's are coming right\u201d? You ask. \u201cYes, it's going to be fangtastic\u201d said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella. The four of you walk back to Grimwood and you walk upstairs to your room and the girls help <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinish setting up the decorations. As the sun sets it gets dark and it's just about time for the open house <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto begin. Knowing your own family isn't coming you sneak your way to the back door and walk out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry girls' you think to yourself. 'But I think I am just going to sit this one out'. \u201cTheir dads made it <br>\r\n<br>\r\npretty clear they don't like me the last time we met anyway\u201d you say to yourself. You decide to trek into <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe woods and wait for the open house to be over. \u201cAh, this looks like a good spot\u201d you say as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreach an open area. You look up at the full moon. \u201cThe moon sure is beautiful\u201d you say. \u201cIt sure is\u201d a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nvoice replies. You jump back and take a fighting stance on reflex only to see that it is Whisper. \u201cWoah, <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntake it easy, it's only me. I'm here like I said I would be\u201d he says. You drop your stance. \u201cYeah, fine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen. Say what you have to say\u201d you reply. \u201cRight to the point huh, no 'Hi how have you been' or <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanything\u201d? He asks sarcastically. \u201cJust stop with the formalities and get to the point\u201d you say. \u201cAlright <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen\u201d he says. \u201cIf you insist\u201d. \u201cHiya\u201d! He yells throwing a side kick at you. You just barely avoid it and  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthrow a spinning hook kick in return, which he blocks. \u201cAh, still as quick as ever\u201d he says grabbing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour kicking leg and throwing you. You flip while still in the air and land on your feet. \u201cAnd nimble I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsee\u201d he added. \u201cWhat are you talking about\u201d? You ask as you charge at him. You begin to throw a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflurry of punches and kicks \u201cWe've never fought before\u201d you state matter of factly. Whisper is easily <br>\r\n<br>\r\navoiding all of your strikes and kicks. \u201cThat's where you'd be wrong my friend\u201d he replies. He then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbegins his own offensive. You are shocked at his strength and speed as he lands blow after blow. He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen throws a hard jab right at your chin sending you flying to the ground. Needless to say you are a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlittle shaken up. 'H-his moves, they look just like mine. They're identical'! You think. You quickly get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nup, wiping the blood from your lip. \u201cAlright then asshole, you asked for it\u201d you say forming a fist. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncharge at him at full speed. \u201cFIST OF HEAVEN\u201d! You yell. A loud THOOM echos throughout the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwoods and birds and animals run and scatter from the impact of your strike. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at Griimwood the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnoise is heard as is echos through the school. \u201cLike, what in the world was that\u201d? Inquires Shaggy. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngirls and their fathers hear it as well. \u201cI don't like the sound of that\u201d said Dracula. \u201cWait a minute\u201d said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella. \u201cWhere is he\u201d. Everyone looks around. Phanty floats up to your bedroom door and phases her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhead through. She quickly pulls it back out. \u201cHe's not there\u201d she said in a worried tone. \u201cI don't like the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook of this\u201d said Ms. Grimwood. Frankenstein pointed out the window at the flocking birds. \u201cLook, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhatever it is, it's coming from over there. They immediately bust open the back door. Winnie takes a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndeep whiff of the air. \u201cSniff sniff.....Gasp! It IS him. He's this way she said pointing in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and everyone else rush to your location. \u201cI hope he's okay\u201d said Tannis. \u201cDon't worry dear, I'm sure <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour little friend will be fine\u201d said the Mummy. He had no idea how wrong he was. Back with you and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhisper, what you saw, you almost couldn't comprehend. \u201cY-you blocked it\u201d! You exclaimed. \u201cT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere's only one man in the world that knows the counter to the Fist of Heaven\u201d you say staggering <br>\r\n<br>\r\nback. You are literally trembling all over. Whisper walks into the moonlight. \u201cI-it can't be\u201d you say as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour eyes begin to tear up. \u201cThat's right\u201d says Whisper. He reaches for and rips off his masks, finally <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrevealing his face. You fall to your knees in shock. \u201cD-dad\u201d you stutter. \u201cYes son, it's me\u201d he says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalking over to you. \u201cI'm sorry about the secrecy, but I couldn't risk letting those monsters discover my <br>\r\n<br>\r\nidentity\u201d. You are completely speechless at this point. \u201cThe only reason I attacked you was to examine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhow much your skills had progressed, and I am impressed. You've done well keeping up with your <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntraining\u201d he says smiling at you. You are still on your knees completely dumbfounded. \u201cBut that's not <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe only reason I've come\u201d he continues. \u201cFrom the information I've gathered over the past few months, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthese monsters are amassing some kind of army to wipe out the human race. As you know, being who I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nam I can't allow that to happen. I've been gathering an army of my own to combat this threat, but there <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas no one on par with me who could help me lead the troops\u201d he said looking down at you. \u201cAnd then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered you. You were the only one I trained and instilled with the skills necessary for such a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntask. Join me son\u201d he says extending a hand to you. \u201cJoin me, so that we can end this destructive <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconflict between the monsters and humanity. Join me, so that we may bring peace to the world\u201d. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook up at him and slowly grab his hand. He begins to lift you up when you suddenly punch him as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhard as you can right in the face. He falls to the ground with a THUD. \u201cYOU BASTARD\u201d! You yell at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim. \u201cI thought you were DEAD\u201d! He slowly gets up, brushing the dirt from his jacket. \u201cI had no <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice. Once I got wind of what the monsters were planning I had to take the necessary precautions to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmake sure they wouldn't try to come after me\u201d he says as he looks deeply into your eyes, which are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstreaming with tears. \u201cOr anyone close to me\u201d he finished. \u201cMom's married to that asshole and doesn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngive two shits about me anymore\u201d! You continue to yell. \u201cHow can you possibly justify that\u201d?! \u201cI was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nafraid and alone for so long. I had no one to turn to. You hear me? NO ONE\u201d! You say. You are bawling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat this point and welling up with a wide array of different emotions. Your eyes are closed as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinue to weep. You then open them in shock as you feel your father wrap his arms around you in a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhug. \u201cI'm sorry son\u201d he says as he begins to cry to. \u201cYou're right, there's no justifying what you've gone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthrough\u201d. \u201cI-I love you son\u201d.  You finally give in and hug him back with all your might. \u201cDad! I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthought I lost you\u201d you say. \u201cIt's okay son, I'm here now, and I'm here to stay\u201d he says reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook son, as heart warming as this reunion is, we need to get our wits about us. There's no doubt those <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmonsters from the school heard that punch earlier. I'd bet anything they'll be here any minute\u201d. \u201cI need <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto leave for now, before I'm discovered\u201d. \u201cBut dad\u201d you say. \u201cI have so many questions about all this-\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother time\u201d he says interrupting you. He grabs his mask and puts it back on. \u201cDon't worry son\u201d he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsays as you wipe the tears from your eyes. \u201cI'll be in touch, and closer than you think\u201d he says as he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nruns off into the woods. After all that has just happened you take in a breath and let out a heavy sigh as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou flop onto the hard ground, completely exhausted. You stare up at the full moon for the next few <br>\r\n<br>\r\nminutes. \u201cHappy Halloween Dad\u201d you say to yourself as you hear the pitter patter of many feet running <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin your direction.</span></div></div>",

Then with a wave of her wand she summoned her spider <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbats. \u201cNow go my spider bats, and bring the ghoul girls to me! MWAHAHAHA\u201d! Her and Creeper <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncackled maniacally as the spider bats flew out into the night.</span></div></div>",

You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook down placing a hand on your head, remembering what transpired last night. You see that your in a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncold sweat and you have bandages all over your body. You go and open the curtains to see that the sun <br>\r\n<br>\r\nis up. You then look up to see Phanty's head phased through the door. \u201cUgh, haven't you ever heard of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nknocking\u201d? You ask sarcastically. \u201cWhat if I had been naked or something\u201d? \u201cThat would be fine with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nme\u201d she said winking at you. You just roll your eyes as you go to sit on the bed. \u201cHe's up everybody\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yells downstairs. You then hear what sounds like a stampede as the rest of the girls, Ms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimwood, Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy all come in to see you. You are immediately bombarded with <br>\r\n<br>\r\na million question. You raise a hand to get everyone to be quiet. \u201cThank you for the concern but you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan relax everybody, I'm fine\u201d. \u201cLike, what in the world happened\u201d? Asked Shaggy. \u201cJust a scuffle with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsome wierdo, luckily I scared him off\u201d you say hoping they believe you. \u201cWow! He must have been <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntough to be able to go toe to toe with you\u201d said Sibella. \u201cYeah\u201d you say looking out the window as the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsunlight pours in. \u201cHe was\u201d. You hop out of bed and grab a towel. \u201cUm, you guys mind getting out of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe way? I kind of smell like ass\u201d you say. \u201cOh\u201d they reply stepping aside as you walk out of the room <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand down the hall to the bathroom. Everyone pokes their head out of the door to see you closing the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbathroom door behind you. \u201cWell, he certainly seems like he's okay\u201d said Ms. Grimwood as she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy went back downstairs to prepare for the schools activities for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look at each other with concern and back to the bathroom. \u201cI sure hope so\u201d said Winnie as the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngirls dispersed to ready themselves for the day. All except for Phanty who had a mischievous grin on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher face as she waited for the other girls to head back to their respective rooms. Once the coast was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nclear she casually floated over to the bathroom. Inside the bathroom you've already hopped in the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshower. Your hand is firmly planted on the tile wall in front of you as you look down at the floor of the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntub as the water poured down onto your head. You keep going over the events of last night through <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour head, trying to make sense of what your father said. 'The monsters are amassing an army'? You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthink. 'They haven't done anything even remotely suspicious looking since I got here'. 'I hope he <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndecides to show himself again soon'. \u201cSigh, this is all so confusing\u201d. \u201cI could clear things up for you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou hear a voice from behind you in the tub. Acting solely on reflex you throw a punch stopping just <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore it hit the person right in face once you realize who it is. \u201cPhanty\u201d! You exclaim. \u201cWoah! That <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas a little too close\u201d she said nonchalantly as if there was nothing wrong with the situation. \u201cWhat are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou doing?! I'M NAKED\u201d!  You yell. \u201cThat's why I'm here\u201d she replied. \u201cI just wanted to see IT before <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanyone else\u201d she says looking down at your package. \u201cNice to see your well equipped, that's good to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nknow\u201d she said winking. You immediately yank the shower curtain to cover yourself. \u201cWill you get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nout\u201d?! You shout. She floats above the shower, almost touching the ceiling. \u201cWhy? Things getting a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlittle too 'steamy' for you\u201d she asks as she began laughing at the terrible pun. \u201cGrrrrr.....GET OUT\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell. \u201cOh fine, Mr. Party Pooper\u201d she replied with a pouty face, phasing through the ceiling. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreathe in heavily and let out a long sigh as you try to calm yourself and finish your shower'What am I <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoing to do with her' you think to yourself. But then you hear someone open the door. \u201cGeepers, is <br>\r\n<br>\r\neverything, like, okay in here\u201d? Asked Shaggy. You pull back the curtain giving him the 'I will kill you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook'. \u201cZoinks! Like, sorry I asked\u201d? He said shutting the door. After a little while you finish your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshower and hop out to dry yourself off. You look up at the ceiling and smile. 'Well, at least everyone's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin good spirits' you think to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You turn to face the window saying \u201cHopefully I can get through the rest of the day witho-\u201d you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstop in mid sentence upon seeing Winnie standing by the window. That wasn't the only thing wrong <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhowever. She was naked! \u201cBWAH\u201d! You yell in surprise. \u201cGasp, what in the world are you doing\u201d? She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nasked sarcastically. \u201cWhat do you mean? This is MY room\u201d! You exclaim. \u201cWhat\u201d? She asked as she <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinued in her sarcastic tone. \u201cI could have sworn this was my room\u201d. \u201cYeah right\u201d you say putting a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhand over your eyes as you stagger blindly over to the bed trying to get your towel. \u201cPlease just go <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie\u201d you say as nicely as possible trying to control your temper. You grab you towel and quickly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwrap it around your waist. \u201cWhat's the hurry\u201d? She asked seductively as she walked over to you as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstill had a hand over your eyes. She grabs your hand pulling it away from your face. \u201cI want you to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsee\u201d she whispers. You look down at her, seeing all her 'assets' you become flustered. \u201cC-come on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie. J-just leave\u201d you say, your face beet red as you reach for the door. Winnie then wraps her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnaked self around you. \u201cG-GAH\u201d! You yell as Winnie nuzzles her furry face into your masculine chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-Winnie! I've got training to do\u201d! You say trying to come up with an excuse for yourself. Come <br>\r\n<br>\r\non\u201d she said. \u201cI'm naked. You're naked. I'm sure I could give you a hard workout\u201d she said winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger backward and trip onto your bed. \u201cI-I think I'll pass\u201d you say. \u201cOh really\u201d? She asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhands on her hips. \u201cYou might be saying no, but your 'little friend' is saying other wise\u201d she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\npointing down at your member. You look down to see it pitching a tent with your towel. 'Great, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbetrayed by my own manhood' you think to yourself. Winnie takes this opportunity and pounces on top <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou. She wraps her legs around your waist to prevent your escape. You begin to shake nervously with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanxiety. Winnie places both of her warm, comforting, furry hands on each side of your face. \u201cNow <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnow\u201d she said comfortingly. \u201cThis will be just as pleasurable for you as it is for me\u201d she said. She then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nclosed her eyes and leaned in for a kiss while still holding your head in place. You then hear the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwindows burst open as a purple bat flies in and grabs Winnie by the hair. You see that it's Sibella in bat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nform. \u201cGAH\u201d! Yelled Winnie as Sibella pulled her back towards the window. \u201cWhat the hell are you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndoing you batty bitch\u201d! Shouted Winnie. You hear a bunch of bat shrieks as Sibella pulls Winnie out the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwindow and back to her own room. She then flies back to your window to see if your okay. She sees <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou lying flat on your bed, pale as a sheet. Your out cold with a slight nose bleed and a goofy looking <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrin on your face. 'Oh brother' thought Sibella as she flew back to her own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls....ghosts.....werewolves......bats....\u201d You begin muttering to yourself in your semiconscious state.</span></div></div>",

'Good grief, I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike the girls and all, but they're really driving me batty'. You then stop and face palm yourself in the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nforehead, realizing your inadvertent play on words. You reach the bottom of the stairs and exchange <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsalutations with everyone as you make your way out the door. Winnie and Phanty try to tag along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook girls, I need a little 'me' time, so please don't follow me. It's nothing personal. I'm going out for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsome training, I'll be back in a little while\u201d you say, waving 'bye' to everyone. As you make your way <br>\r\n<br>\r\noutside you think. 'Just to make sure I'm not followed'. You jump high into the air and begin jumping <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom tree to tree as quickly as you can, almost instantly disappearing from the girl's sights. Both Phanty <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Winnie look disappointed. Then Phanty quickly looked around, realizing someone was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, where's Sibella\u201d? She asked. Winnie's ears then perked up as she looked around frantically for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher. She was then hit with the realization. Her eyes narrowed as she said \u201cOh no she didn't\u201d. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinue to leap from tree to tree as you see a dense bog up ahead. 'That's perfect, they'll never think to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook for me in there you think as you jump down into the bog. You begin walking deeper into the bog <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand find a quaint little spot to begin your training. \u201cThis looks like a good enough spot\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, there was a little purple bat perched upside down on the tree above you, watching <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou with a cute little smirk. 'Finally, I've got him all to myself' she thought. She flew ahead of you to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransform without being noticed. As she does that you notice a few crocs is the swamp ahead and make <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour way into it. The crocodiles take notice and make their way towards you. You see them <br>\r\n<br>\r\napproaching and smirk. 'Just the kind of training I've been needing' you think. \u201cCome on then, I could <br>\r\n<br>\r\nuse a new pair of boots and wallet\u201d. The alpha male, about twice your size, rushes towards you mouth <br>\r\n<br>\r\nopen. You grab his upper and lower jaws before they snap on you. \u201cHeh, this is fun. I should've done <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis sooner\u201d you say. The croc tries to overpower you to no avail. You throw it's head to the side and it <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntries swinging it's tail at you. You however, grab it's tail and lift him up and begin slamming him from <br>\r\n<br>\r\nside to side. Then to finish it off you spin him round and round, picking up momentum. You then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrelease him, sending it flying, headfirst into a tree with a loud CRASH and then SPLASH as it fell back <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninto the water. As it floated to the top, you saw it was dizzy and unconscious. \u201cMan, that was a good <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwarm up\u201d you say, You look back towards the other crocs smiling. \u201cWho's next\u201d? You ask excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all immediately turn and swim away. \u201cAw man, that wasn't nearly as fun as I thought it would be\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say disappointed as you walk out of the swamp. \u201cI'll happily be next\u201d you hear a sultry voice say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your left to see bikini clad Sibella standing there in a seductive pose. \u201cHi Sibella\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhalf heartedly. \u201cAw, what's with that tone\u201d? She asks, walking over to you. \u201cWell as you saw earlier <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour not the only girl to try this today\u201d you say. \u201cDon't get me wrong, I do appreciate what you did, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie was out of control\u201d. \u201cI agree\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is why I'm here to show you how IN control I <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan be\u201d she said seductively as she rubbed her hands on your chest. \u201cI really don't need this right now\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say as you turn to walk away, only to see Sibella standing in front of you again. \u201cGWAH\u201d! You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyell as you trip and fall on your butt. This makes Sibella giggle. You stand back up. \u201cOh right, I forgot <br>\r\n<br>\r\nvampires could do that\u201d you say wiping the dirt from your pants. \u201cYes, it's just another one of our <br>\r\n<br>\r\npredatory powers\u201d she replied. \u201cReally, does that make me your prey\u201d? You ask jokingly. \u201cMaybe\u201d she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsays wrapping her arms around your shoulders, holding you tight. \u201cW-what are you doing\u201d? You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnervously. \u201cJust relax\u201d she says in a very calming tone of voice. You can't help but look into her bright, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nemerald green eyes, almost as if they were hypnotizing you. Sibella then begins embracing you. \u201cDid <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou know that we vampires also have an overwhelming power of seduction\u201d she asked coyly as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncouldn't look away from her gaze. \u201cI......didn't......know........that......\u201d you say spacing out as you were <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfalling prey to Sibella's vampiric influence. \u201cKiss me\u201d she said as she leaned in for one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes......mistress......\u201d you say as you do the same. \u201cSIBELLA\u201d! You hear a familiar voice say as it <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninterrupts you. \u201cDamn\u201d said Sibella. \u201cWhat rotten timing\u201d she said looking at who it was that impeded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher. It was Phanty and Winnie. \u201cHey, that's cheating\u201d! Yelled Phanty. \u201cYou can't use your powers like <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat\u201d. \u201cI don't want to hear it Ms. 'I'm going to phase into the bathroom while he's showering'. Phanty <br>\r\n<br>\r\nquickly looked away, embarrassed. \u201cYou're not even giving him a choice\u201d! Said Winnie. \u201cSays the girl <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho had him pinned to the bed an hour ago\u201d. She did have a good point. The three continued to argue <br>\r\n<br>\r\namongst one another for a good ten minutes. Then Sibella spoke up. \u201cHey, hold on a sec. Where is he\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked. The girls looked around, only to see that you were long gone. You had made your way out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof the forest, rubbing your head. \u201cThis is getting far too ridiculous. I need a break\u201d you say. You then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsee the Calloway camp. \u201cThat's it\u201d you say. </span></div></div>",

They say flinching. \u201cTake it easy\u201d said Tug. \u201cWe just wanted to apologize for what <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhappened last time we met\u201d. \u201cOh, well I suppose we can put all that behind us\u201d you say shaking each of <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntheir hands. Actually, we've been wanting to ask you something\u201d one of the boys said. \u201cOh\u201d? You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d said Tug. \u201cAfter we saw how good of a fighter you are, we were wondering if you could teach <br>\r\n<br>\r\nus how to fight like that\u201d. You look at each of them, seeing the sincerity in their faces. \u201cSorry to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndisappoint you guys, but my teacher told me to never teach these skills to anyone else. They are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nextremely dangerous, not only to the people around you, but to you yourself if performed incorrectly\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou state, matter of factly. They all look very disappointed. You then get an idea. \u201cAlthough\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrabbing their attention. \u201cIf you were to just so happen to see me training, and copy my movements, I <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndon't suppose I could stop you\u201d you say winking at them. \u201cReally, thanks\u201d they say. \u201cFor what\u201d? You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreply. \u201cI have no idea what you're talking about\u201d. You walk outside and the boys follow. You proceed to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntrain for the next hour or so as the boys watched from a distance and mimicked your movements. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinish your training and wipe the sweat from your brow. \u201cHey come with us\u201d they say motioning for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou to follow them. As you follow them you see a large watchtower. The boys begin climbing to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntop and you follow right behind them. You reach the top and see a pretty ritzy set up. One of the boys <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoes to a fridge and offers you pizza. Your mouth is watering, considering you haven't had a slice of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNORMAL pizza since you started at Grimwood. From the watchtower you could see Grimwood, and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe girls out in front of the school, most likely waiting for you. Unbeknownst to you though, the girls <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhad agreed to quit bickering amongst one another. \u201cSo we all agree then\u201d said Sibella. \u201cWhomever he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchooses, that will be his decision right\u201d? She asked. \u201cYep\u201d said both Winnie and Phanty in unison. Elsa <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Tannis were also in the front yard playing when all five girls saw some black creatures approaching <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom the sky. \u201cHey what the heck is that\u201d? Asked Elsa pointing at the objects flying towards them. As <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe objects flew closer they saw what they were. \u201cSpiderbats\u201d! Shrieked Tannis. The spiderbats quickly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nswarmed the girls. From the watchtower at the Calloway camp you see the girls in a bit of a frenzy but <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan't quite make out what's going on. \u201cHey Tug, hand me your binoculars\u201d. He complies. What you see <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshocks you. \u201cOh no! THE GIRLS\u201d! You exclaim. You see the terrified looks on their faces as they are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nenveloped by the spiderbats' webs. It is then that an anger wells up inside of you, the likes of which you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhave never felt before. You drop the binoculars and jump from the watchtower. The boys watch in <br>\r\n<br>\r\namazement as you jump from tree to tree. You have a look of sheer hatred on your face as you make <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour way back to Grimwood. By now the girls, along with Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and Ms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimwood are all trapped and encased in the spiderbats' webs. They are just about to grab the girls to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfly them back to Revolta's lair when everyone saw what looked like a dot in the sunlight, growing in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsize. It quickly became an outline of a person. Then everyone heard a loud THOOM. Once the dust <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncleared everyone saw you, but you didn't look like yourself. \u201cYou're here\u201d! Said the girls. You didn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrespond. You look at the spiderbats as they screech at you. You merely continue to look at them with a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook of pure hate. Then you finally speak up. \u201cI'll say this once. Leave now.....\u201dyou say taking a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfighting stance. \u201c.....Or DIE\u201d! You say in a deep tone of voice.</span></div></div>",

They screech at you in an attempt to intimidate you, but to no avail. You simply <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstand there, stone faced. Two of the spiderbats them try to swoop down on you, trying to encase you in <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntheir web, just as they did the others. You have other plans however. You grab both of them by their <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsquealing heads. They begin to flail about madly in a desperate attempt to get away. All you do is scowl <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat their pathetic attempts. Then CRUSH! You clench your fists and crush their skulls and their lifeless <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbodies flop on the ground. You then release your grip, letting the remnants of their heads fall to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nground as well. Everyone looks at you in astonishment at your unexpected level of brutality. The other <br>\r\n<br>\r\neight bats then swarm you together, thinking it was their only chance for survival. You punch and kick <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat them but they continue scratching at you, leaving fresh claw marks all over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRRAAAHHH\u201d! You yell, extending a hand, grabbing another one of the spiderbats. You raise it high <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin the air and quickly slam it down to the ground, crushing it's body. Then you jump away from the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nother bats for a moment to breath. In the vegetable patch not far from you, was a spying eye. A venus <br>\r\n<br>\r\nspy trap to be exact. On the receiving end of the spy trap's video feed, was Revolta, watching your fight <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith her spiderbats. \u201cWhat in the world IS he\u201d? She asked out loud. \u201cGee, I don't know my queen\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nresponded the Grim Creeper. \u201cHe can't be human, no human has THAT kind of strength\u201d he finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell apparently THIS one does\u201d said Revolta. She looked at you with increasing interest. \u201cHmmm, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat face....those features.....and that fighting style.....\u201d she thought out loud. \u201cWhat is it my queen\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsked Creeper. \u201cIt could just be coincidence\u201d she said scratching her chin in thought. \u201cCreeper, bring <br>\r\n<br>\r\nme my monster survival guide\u201d. \u201cWhy would you need that old thing your nastiness\u201d? He asked. \u201cJust <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo it\u201d! She exclaimed. \u201cYipes! Y-yes my queen\u201d. He rushed over to the book shelf, grabbed the book, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand brought it over to her. She proceeded to yank it from him and began flipping earnestly through the <br>\r\n<br>\r\npages. \u201cLet's see, 'S', 'T', \u201cU', Ah! Here it is\u201d she said holding the book up to the screen. \u201cI don't believe <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit\u201d! She said, shocked. \u201cThe likeness is uncanny\u201d. In the book she was holding, under the V's was a <br>\r\n<br>\r\npicture of your father. Above the picture it read \u201cMonster Hunter, Van Helsing\u201d and below the picture, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin big bold letters, it read \u201cAVOID AT ALL COSTS!\u201d. \u201cI thought he looked familiar\u201d she said. \u201cYes, he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmust be the offspring of Van Helsing. This changes everything\u201d! She exclaimed. \u201cWhy your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmaliciousness\u201d? Asked Creeper. \u201cThink about it Creeper\u201d she replied. \u201cWith him under my control, my <br>\r\n<br>\r\narmy will be unstoppable\u201d. \u201cB-but you tried to do the same thing to Van Helsing years ago and it didn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwork\u201d Creeper rebuttaled. \u201cYes, but you know what they say, if you can't seize the hawk, then go for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe hatchling\u201d she said with an evil smirk. \u201cBut even so, he IS only human, AND the son of the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnotorious monster hunter Van Helsing, no one in your army would listen to him\u201d. \u201cYou just let me <br>\r\n<br>\r\nworry about that Creeper, you call off the spiderbats\u201d  she replied. \u201cYes your highness\u201d he said bowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeessss\u201d she said hissing. \u201cHe's perfect. MWAHAHAHA\u201d! She cackled as the screen focused in on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour face. Back at Grimwood, you had been successfully fending off the attack of the spiderbats. Then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuddenly, they stopped attacking. The remaining spiderbats quickly flew off, retreating from the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour look of hatred and malice was replaced with a smile, thinking you were victorious. Then you fall <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto a knee, as the adrenaline from the fight wears off. You are riddled with scratches. You walk over to <br>\r\n<br>\r\neveryone to help them. \u201cAre you guys okay\u201d? You ask. \u201cYeah, thanks to you\u201d said Elsa. \u201cThat's good\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say as you walk over to Shaggy. You pull out a little switch blade the Calloway boys gave you as a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmemento of your stay with them. You smile down at Shaggy. \u201cNice sleeping bag\u201d you say. \u201cHeh heh, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyeah, but like, it's a little too snug for my tastes\u201d he replies. \u201cI can fix that\u201d you reply. You hold the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nblade to the webs. \u201cHold perfectly still\u201d you say. You then slice open the web, freeing Shaggy of his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconfines. Then you do the same for everyone else. All the girls rush to you, embracing you in a very <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntight hug. \u201cOh Thank you, thank you, thank you\u201d said Phanty. \u201cYes, that was very brave\u201d added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella. \u201cYou were great\u201d! Exclaimed Winnie. \u201cAck! Too tight! Too tight\u201d! You wheeze as you gasp for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreath. \u201cOh! Sorry\u201d they say blushing as they release you from their grip. \u201cIt's no problem\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrubbing the back of your head. \u201cI'm just glad you girls are o-\u201d you stop mid sentence to see that your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nvision is going blurry and you are staggering. Next thing you know you black out and fall to the ground <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith a loud THUD. \u201cOh no! Quickly, get him inside\u201d is the last thing you hear before you're out cold.    </span></div></div>",

Then you look to the foot of your bed to see Winnie curled up, asleep as well. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen look up to see Phanty asleep, floating above your bed. 'They must have been up all night watching <br>\r\n<br>\r\nover me' you think to yourself. You remove your blankets and get up.

She asks. \u201cGood\u201d you reply. \u201cThat's a relief\u201d said Phanty as she floated down <br>\r\n<br>\r\nonto your bed, sitting beside you. \u201cYes, thanks to the tender love and care of you girls\u201d you say.

The four of you walk downstairs and are greeted by Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Grimwood. You exchange pleasantries with everyone and continue to the common room. There <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou see Elsa and Tannis. You begin walking over to them to say hello, but Tannis steps away from you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin fear. \u201cHuh\u201d? You ask. \u201cWhat's wrong with her\u201d? \u201cYou, that's what's wrong with her\u201d said Elsa in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTannis' defense. \u201cWhat are you talking about\u201d? You ask, confused. \u201cYou were a totally different person <br>\r\n<br>\r\nout there yesterday\u201d she said. \u201cYou showed a side of yourself we didn't even know you had\u201d. \u201cHey\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Winnie, speaking up. \u201cHe saved us, or did you forget that little detail\u201d. \u201cYes, I\u201dm not denying that, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut what you did was unacceptable\u201d she said picking up Tannis. \u201cYou were totally out of line and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nscared Tannis half to death with that sadistic looking mug of yours\u201d. You look over to Tannis. \u201cTannis, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI-I'm so sorry\u201d you say trying to reach over to her. She just nuzzles herself further into Elsa and Elsa <br>\r\n<br>\r\nslaps your hand away. \u201cDon't you think you've done enough\u201d she says. You merely drop your head in <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndefeat and turn away. You begin walking away. \u201cHey! You can't talk to him like tha-\u201d \u201cStop Phanty\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say interrupting her.

You try to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmove, only to see that you are tightly strapped down to a table. \u201cOh you're finally awake\u201d said a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to see it was Revolta. \u201cWhat are you doing\u201d!? You ask frantically. \u201cLet me go\u201d! You <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndemand. \u201cOh, well I'm afraid I can't do that\u201d she replied. \u201cI have BIG plans for you\u201d. You take a deep <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreath, calming yourself. \u201cAnd what would that be\u201d? You ask. \u201cIt's very simple\u201d she replied. \u201cI'm going <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto give you what you want\u201d she said. This confused you. You ask \u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? \u201cAcceptance\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe says. \u201cAcceptance dear boy, the love, understanding and acceptance of your precious Grimwood <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngirls\u201d. She was right. That is what you wanted most you thought, as images of what had transpired the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nday before began rushing through your head. \u201cThey fear you, you know\u201d. \u201cThey just don't understand\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe continued. You turned away and frowned. \u201cBut don't worry my dear, I have the perfect treatment <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor you that will make you closer to them than you ever were before\u201d said Revolta. \u201cA-and what <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntreatment is that\u201d? You ask hesitantly. \u201cI'm glad you asked. This treatment will transform you! Make <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou more like them. Make you more like the girls you've grown to love so much. It will make you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmore compatible with them and give them a greater understanding of you and your power\u201d she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexplained. \u201cR-really\u201d?! You ask, slightly excited at the prospect of the idea. \u201cBut....Why am I strapped <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto a table\u201d? You ask. \u201cTrust me dear, the procedure is painful. I can't have you squirming around. That's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nalso why we're outside. I can't have you trashing my castle\u201d. Her story seemed to make perfect sense to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou. \u201cWell my dear, what do you say\u201d? Revolta asked. Do you want the treatment? Do you want the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlove and affection of the girls you love so much? Do you want acceptance and understanding\u201d? She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nasked, as if she were giving you a choice. You think for a long hard moment, having flashbacks of all <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe fun times you had with the girls. 'She right' you thought to yourself. 'As nothing but a human, I <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncould never hope to gain their acceptance. Perhaps this treatment is the answer I've been looking for'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Revolta, let;'s do it\u201d! You say, nodding to give her the go ahead. \u201cExcellent choice dear\u201d she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid. \u201cCreeper! Bring me the vials\u201d Creeper immediately brought over three vials with different liquids <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin them. One red, one glowing blue, and one a clearish green. \u201cThe procedure is simple, just swallow <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat's in these three vials and you will be transformed into a being way more compatible with your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nghoul girls than your human self could ever be\u201d. \u201cThat's it? Then let's hurry up and do this\u201d you say as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou continue to think about how much you've grown to love the girls. \u201cVery well\u201d said Revolta. \u201cBut <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe warned, this will be the most excruciating pain you've ever felt in your life\u201d she said. \u201cI'm willing to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntake that pain. Let's do it\u201d you say. \u201cAlright then\u201d she nods. \u201cFirst\u201d she says raising the red vial over <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour open mouth. \u201cThe Vampires blood\u201d she said pouring it into your mouth. You hesitantly gulp down <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe thick liquid, thinking of how much better things will be afterward. You drink it all and she moves <br>\r\n<br>\r\non to the next vial. \u201cNext\u201d she says raising the clearish green vial over your mouth. \u201cThe werewolves <br>\r\n<br>\r\nvenom\u201d she says pouring down your throat. You swallow it all down as quickly as possible, even <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthough it stung your throat. \u201cAnd finally\u201d Revolta stated, holding the glowing blue vile over your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmouth. \u201cThe Ghostly Ectoplasm\u201d she said pouring the liquid in your mouth. You gulp it down,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanxiously awaiting for the procedure to be over. \u201cIt is done\u201d she said. \u201cHuh? What are you talking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabout\u201d? You ask. \u201cI don't feel any di-UGH\u201d! You say as a searing pain jolts through your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHHH\u201d!!! You scream at the top of your lungs as your body convulses and your <br>\r\n<br>\r\neyes roll into the back of your head. Minutes pass and you continue to shake and scream in agony. Your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhair is the first to change. It's becoming a pale white and your eyes begin to turn black as your irises <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchange to a bright green. Hair begins to cover every part of your body, excluding your head, chest, abs, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhands, and feet. Revolta looks on with great pleasure as you begin to grow a set of fangs and the hair <br>\r\n<br>\r\non your head grows down past your shoulders. You continue to scream as a green aura envelops you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand you feel a large and wide array of power begin to seep into every fiber of your being. It was the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmost exhilarating and painful thing you had ever experienced. But then through your new found <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstrength, you broke the bonds that held you and you stood, clasping your hands to the side of your head <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin pain as you began to grow pointy ears, just like Winnie's. Then, in one final, deafening loud BOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation was complete. Revolta and Creeper looked on, from behind the safety of a large <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrock. Once the smoke and dust cleared they saw you. White, flowing hair. Green, glowing eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawed hands, and fanged teeth. Revolta walked out from behind the rock. \u201cThe transformation is <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncomplete. \u201cYou are now part werewolf, part ghost, and part vampire. You are the first Ghoul Hybrid\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exclaimed. \u201cHow do you feel\u201d? She asked. You take a moment to look at all your new features and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook into the palms of your hands as you feel the new found power within you. \u201cI feel.....I feel.....I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFEEL GREAT\u201d! You exclaim as you raise your fists to the sky, and the green aura envelops you again <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand green lightning crackles in the sky. \u201cThat's wonderful\u201d says Revolta. \u201cBecause now, you are under <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmy control\u201d she says snapping her fingers.</span></div></div>",

Do you have trouble falling asleep?\" She asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too. Must sound funny too you. A mummy who can't fall asleep. When i first got here i was pyramid sick. But after a few weeks i was fine. Can you hand me a glass of water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water taste gross. I don't think you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Can i try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your shoulders and hand her a glass of water. She takes one sip and tastes it.

I would really like you too stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Eh that's really nice eh... What was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tannis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. That's really nice Tannis. Thank you. I think i'll stay. For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Everyone here at school is some sort of family. We can be your sisters and you can be our brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs you around your legs.<br>\r\nEvery book or movie you read or saw about a living mummy does't compare in the least with Tannis except maybe for the bandage. Too be totally honest Tannis looks to cute to be scared of.<br>\r\nMaybe you can trust her with a secret and ask about the letter. Maybe she knows if it's just a prank. Besides she was the youngest. Young children are easy distracted so she probably would't tell the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tannis do you know anything about this?\" You ask while you hand her the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at it squinting her her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can read! But only Egyptian hieroglyphics.\" She said scraping with her feet on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It say's: Trust no one. Is this just a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I think not. We all want too have you here. So i don't know who should wanna play a prank on you. Don't worry too much about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can better go back too bed. It's much too late. My mummy get's angry if i don't get enough sleep. Besides if you don't like the water you can take some water out of one of the bottles from Shaggy. I'm sure he does't mind. He's pretty cool and nice for a gym teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great thanks Tannis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Welcome. Sweet nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you take a glass of water from one of the bottles you think about the girls. Cute girl that Tannis. A bit strange like she said sweet nightmares but anyway she seemed to mend it nice.<br>\r\nMaybe it was't so bad here. Not one of ghouls here tried to hurt you. At least not on purpose. Most of them seemed pretty nice. <br>\r\nIf it was't for the strange note you would't have any doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You nearly scared me to death!\" You said to her in a shaken voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and said, \"I'm sorry, I tend to come in unannounced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and say, \"Ah well, no harm done.

She floats down right next to  as you begin telling her about yourself. You first tell her about your troubled childhood as you were born when your father left her due to his straining relationship with her. You tell her about your step-father, how he never got along with you and how he never gave you respect as much as your mother. Then you tell her about your school life before you came to here, you had trouble trying to focus on your studies since you fell into the wrong crowd and began getting into trouble. You eventually left them, but it never ended there. Your step-dad had convinced your mother to send you to boot camp after school ended, which was Calloway Military School, and that was how you eventually got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a sad look, she really must have felt bad for you. \"I'm so sorry, I hope I didn't make you feel depressed bringing that all up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm used to it.\" I said, \"I try not to dwell on it so much, let's talk about you know. What's your life like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells me that her father was a opera singer/pianist that stayed hidden from the city who called him \"The Phantom of the Opera\". They would hear him sing contributed with the sounds of an organ every night from the Paris Opera House. She never knew a whole lot about her father, but she knew he used to be very well known. She wanted to be like him so much, she started playing the organ being taught lessons from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you really look up to him a lot.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, he's really a big influence on me.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with a smile and say, \"Hey, thanks for talking with me, I really needed to let some steam of today from my step-dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to talk, that's all. But I'm glad you feel better though.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to take a liking to Phantasma; she appeared to have a wacky personality, but now this must have been another side of it though. She was very pretty too, for a phantom, of course. You could say she was even beautiful.

So they decided to ship you off to Calloway's Military school just to get rid of you. But, due to a mix up in the mail, Miss Grimwood's School for Ghouls received the application. And Miss Grimwood is delighted to accept the first application ever from a human student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're going to Ghoul School. Will you survive? Will you enjoy yourself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are your classmates: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella: Daughter of Dracula, able to transform into a bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantasma: Daughter of the Phantom. Has a strange sense of humor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa Frankensteen: Daughter of Frankenstein. Stitched together like her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie: Daughter of the Wolfman. Energetic, and constantly howling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanis: The youngest. Daughter of the Mummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Teachers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Grimwood: The headmistress of the school. Looks forward to the first human student and what it will do for human/monster relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy: The only other human at the school. Nice, but flakey, always hungry, more cowardly then you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooby Doo: Shaggy's dog, also cowardly and always hungry. Able to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrappy Doo: Scooby's nephew, a little annoying, but at least he's brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatches: The pet dragon of Miss Grimwood. Bad temper and fire breather = bad combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Inc: The group Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy are members of. Mystery solvers, might be stopping by to visit at some point: Velma, Daphne, Fred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVincent Van Ghoul: Human warlock, friend of Mystery Inc, could show up in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalloway's School: Where you were suppose to go. At least there will be humans near by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillains:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevolta: Witch of the Web, tried to take over the school last year. Might be hanging around still. Watch out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Military: Seems the military might have taken interest in the Ghouls. Be careful if you see black vans around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhisper: Black trenchcoat wearing human, seems to have some interest in you, hard to say if he's a friend or foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No one liner chapters, please.<br>\r\n2. Keep swearing to a minimum.<br>\r\n3. If you intend to post something with a rating higher than 13+, post it in the chapter title to give warning. <br>\r\n4. The main character will remain nameless, unless I change my mind. Please remember that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember, this is a work in process, adding is always welcome. </td>",
