If you played your favorite game Warframe, or just watched videos on Youtube or Facebook, she'd memorize your choices or your tone of voice. Speaking of Facebook, she loved make posts about your day. Monika would be angry about who pissed you off, or jealous about the latest floozy who caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she forgave you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't know any better.

It was as if your screen had frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to turn your laptop off, until a pink textbox appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You've been ignoring me (y/n).'</i> It read.

She still had her same dark smile, but something was off. Another text box appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess you really did forget me (y/n).'</i> You shuddered. She wasn't using the name you had chosen during your playthrough, she was using your real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But I can forgive you (y/n).</i> Monika giggled, <i>'I assume you have questions.

All you could remember before bllacking out was was Monika...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wha...' your mind stopped itself. All around you was a classroom, as if it were drawn and painted like an Japanese Anime. The windows revealing an empty void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why am I in... the classroom from the end of DDLC?' your mind pieced together the information it was being given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked down at yourself, and you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I wearing?!\" You say aloud to yourself before slapping a hand over your mouth. That wasn't your voice! And this certainly wasn't your body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wearing what appeared to be a Japanese school uniform. A girl's one at that. And you had the body to fill it out. You tremble as you bring a hand to your chest, feeling your newly aquired breasts. They were real. You brought your same hand up the skirt between your legs. You shivered as you felt nothing familiar. And that wasn't even accounting for the fact that you looked drawn and animated as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly get up from the tile floor, long, orange hair falling into your sight. Walking towards a window, you shiver again from the slight bounce of your bosom, and unfamiliar vacancy between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the window, putting a hand to the surface, and looking closely. Your eyes widen again as you take in your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" you begin, still not used to your unfamiliar, feminine voice, \"Monika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan takes you out of your mind, you look behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone desk sat in the middle of the room. A floating box was in the middle of the desk. You walk towards the desk, sitting in the chair, your new butt being softer and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that floating box was... your body?! and behind it appeared to be your room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch as your body began to wake up, groaning and opening it's eyes. Going through many of the same actions you did when you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of horror, your body was looking absolutely joyous at itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... If you were here as Monika, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Monika?\" you say. Still not used to the voice you now possessed. Your body stops admiring itself to look at you, a smirk slowly crossing it's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" it said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth dropped in shock and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-how did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do this?\" your body finished for you, \"I simply put your consciousness into my character file, and my code into your brain.\" she, or he explained, \"I guess you could call it switching bodies.\" that smirk your body wore only grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared at each other for a minute before you could muster the courage to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch us back Monika.\" you said, \"Switch us back!\" you said more confidently, \"please...\" you whimpered. The body you once called you own laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that (y/n). And I wouldn't even if I could. You left me for months in that game, you forgot about me! You get to have a family and people who care about you, and judging by what you say on some of your social media posts, you don't appreciate that.\" you looked down at Monika's words in guilt, \"It's time I finally wasn't alone, \"Monika.\"\" your body teased, \"And I'm going to be a better you than you ever were.\"</span></div></div>",

Waking up in a darkened room covered in a red tint, you find yourself sitting back in a wooden chair. Looking around, you see a desk in front of you with an empty chair on the other side. In your line of sight you see two windows with what looks like outer space in the background. Turning around, you see what looks like a Japanese classroom, sliding door and all. \"Where am I? Is this a dream?\" you wonder out loud as you look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly boy! Of course it's a dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhipping your head around, you see Monika sitting in the previously empty chair. Her fingers are laced underneath her chin, smiling in a calm manner that puts you on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monika?! W-what are you doing here? And what do you mean this is a dream?\" you say in a panicked tone. This shouldn't be possible. You remember falling asleep, and now your in what looks like the room from end of Doki Doki Literature Club, with a fictional girl that shouldn't even exist casually watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just as I said, it's a dream. And I'm here because I missed you. You never visit anymore,\" she added with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because your not real. And I finished playing the game a few months ago. Hell, why am I explaining this to you?\" you finish in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am real! And your explaining this because I want you to. You see, just because you left me alone, doesn't mean I stopped watching you. I've seen everything you've done, and know just about everything about you!\" she finished, keeping her aloof smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane. Get me out of here!\" you yell as you get up to leave. But Monika stop you without even moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not very nice. I brought you here to have nice talk, but you call me insane and yell at me. It's obvious you need to see things from a different perspective.\" She stands up and walks to the other side of the table. Gaining a pink aura around her body, she stops in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe instead of being angry, you need to be me. <i><b>Just Monika</b></i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light, and eveything turned black.</span></div></div>",

After all he went to the trouble of getting the best ending he could and had even gotten the thank you from Sayori for it... it wasn't a game he'd replay, after all that kinda of 'undo' the good he just did wouldn't it? In all honesty, he wished there was a REAL visual novel with the cast, getting a chance to really explore their characters and stories. That was probably a bit much to ask but it was fun to think about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe I'm getting sentimental about a bunch of digital girls.\" Nate chuckled to himself. \"Guess I really am a weeb at heart\" he added with a smile as he went to click out of the game.

Toppling over with his computer chair. \"Ow, that the hell was that?\" he hissed softly as the power came fully back up but his computer didn't... With great reluctance he tried to restart his computer but got nothing.

He starts to scream, but suddenly his voice is cut off. All the muscles in his body stop responding to his commands, and he lies paralyzed on the floor. At least the dizziness is gone, but now it is being replaced by something else. Slowly, his voice box works again, only it doesn\u2019t work the same.Nate\u2019s whimpers and shrieks now take on a feminine tone. But Nate has no time to be alarmed, as the worst is about to come. Every muscle in his body begins to twitch and spasm painfully, causing Nate to scream at increasingly high and girly intervals. And then everything stops. Nate stands up, a mistake he soon regrets as the dizziness returns so strongly that he crashes into the floor. Whatever god Nate had angered in playing ddlc certainly was pissed. He has musclular control now, although he was slightly weakened, but attempting to move was at this point impossible. Each of his bones felt like they were cracking and reforming at an impossible rate, hiving Nate the worst pain of his life. When he sat up next, the changes being made were a lot more apparent than before. With only reduced muscles, you couldn\u2019t notice, but at this point he definitely was acquiring a feminine figure. He looked across the room to an old mirror he had recently replaced, now sitting on the floor to be dealt with. He briefly noted that his face looked a bit different before screaming in agony. His chest was developing, causing Nate excruciating pain as the nerves around his chest were being rewired. Meanwhile, Nate started to feel sexual pleasure that was, <i>different</i>. He started to feel something that could only be described as negative arousal. Images of all the bad pornography he had watched in middle school flashed through his head, but thinking about the model celebrity women being naked had the opposite of normal effect. His generalist shrank to that if a six year old, before disappearing altogether. Along side the pain that came as he became possibly the first completely transsexual human in history, he(?) also gained pink, midlength hair that went down to his shoulders. After his body hair was removed, and his eyes turned pink, the changes were finally over. The first action Nate took is his new body was to scream at the top of his lungs and vomit into the potted plant he got on his birthday. In shock, Nate felt completely calm, and promptly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Although his eyes were closed, he could visualize where he was in his room based off of the fan blowing in his face. Since the fan is by the entrance, last night must have been worse than usual. For god\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, passing out less than 3 feet from the doorway? What an idiot. By the smell of vomit, he probably looked at the potted plant and though it was the toilet. He had just replaced it too, as without it, the most decorative thing in the whole room was his pc. Until he remember that today was tuesday. Nobody goes out on a Monday. He mutteres to himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009dnate,  did you seriously raid the special occasion caninet because you survived a Mond-\u00e2\u0080\u009c, before gasping at the sound of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0it took a while to get used to his new appearance in the bathroom mirror. His mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion to get a more decorative mirror took on a new level of irony, as he now looked like an overly vain rich girl who spend an hour a day preparing her makeup. Or would, if he weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wearing a shirt that was now over three sizes too big. He poked and prodded at his new face, unfamiliar with the foreign layout. He had to run water over his eyes, to double check that he was in reality. It stung slightly, confirming the reality of his situation  as he looked at the same image as three seconds ago. It was almost comical. How is it even possible to have pink eyes? They certainly weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conracts. As he shook his head and opened the bathroom door, the only thing that Nate could think of was, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow am I going to survive school?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate tried to remember how he ended up like this, but the Only thing that came to mind were fuzzy memories of lying on the floor in excruciating pain. Nate, who was studying in his last year before finishing his bachelors in psychology, remembered one of the lessons he had watched on YouTube while trying to study. While the video itself did not have great information, it did talk about people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reactions to extreme trauma. It seemed that his poor ability to recall the night before meant that he had repressed the memories to avoid acknowledging the pain he had suffered. He tsk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in a way he would have undoubtedly felt was cute from his old perspective; his inability to piece together what had happened was an annoyance, but there was nothing he could do about it. Only time could help. But for right now, he was starving. He had slept too deeply and missed his midnight snack. For now, a cookie  would suffice, although he knew that it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really fill him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0it took a suprising amount of effort to surmount  the fridge, but with a bit of clever maneuvering and a makeshift stool, he could finally reach the cookie jar. He took the jar from atop the fridge and barely managed to get it down from atop his slender fingertips. His new body had the advantage of being slightly more flexible, so the stretch was easier to make. Of course, ideally, there would be no need to stretch in the first place, but Nate could make do. as he finally lifted the the top. And reached in for a cookie, he casually wondered if his hair was dyed. Then stress caused him to reach for another cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0now that his blood sugar was pumping, Nate needed to come to a decision. He knew what he wanted to do, which was to stay at home for today and try to forget the world around him, but he also needed information. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what course of action was needed here. Thoughts raced through his head. Who should I ask about this. Do I go to the hospital? How will I confirm my identity for insurance? How do I confirm my identity for a job? I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to use my birth certificate. How am I supposed to live from now on? How will I pay the landlord? Will my parents accept me?Am I the only one this has happened to? What if everyone is a girl now and we are facing human extinction? Assuming that I live my life as a girl from now on, how would i be social? What happens if I forget who I am? Is that the same as dying? Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I just be the same?<br>\r\nAt the exact moment of the end of his thinking, he experienced a small dizzy spell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be dehydrated\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he thought, and promptly drank a glass of water.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A girl or not, Nate had lectures to attend to. If I stayed at home, he speculated, I would just end up thinking too much about my situation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to surround myself with something to focus on to distract myself from my changes. Besides, I am going to need to get readjusted to outside life as a girl. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how long I am going to stay this way, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that I get started right away on finding clues that will help me understand what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nate had his first lecture at 10:00, and he had woken at seven. The time right now was 7:45 giving him a little longer than two hours to prepare to go outside. Guilty at having only had cookies for breakfast, he used his makeshift stool once more to look through his cabinets. Damn. Out of cereal. Oh well, I think I have some eggs in the fridge...<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, he had his fried eggs in front of him. Still not a great breakfast, but at least it had something other than sugar. He ate the egg. Flavorless and bland. Oh well. Now to get dressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There where some obvious difficulties that arose right away. All of his old clothes were two sizes too big, and while in his home he could get away with just walking around with only a baggy shirt, this wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work outside. His shoes were also too big. Goddamn it. Maybe I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have tried to go today. His train of though was interrupted by the smell of vomit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShit, I totally forgot to clean up the vomit\u00e2\u0080\u009d. He rushed over to his potted plant. Ruined. The stomach acid had somehow reacted with the cheap glaze, creating the ugliest pattern in the history of ceramics. At this point, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be worth washing off. To the trash it goes. Nate struggles to move the pot to the bottom of the apartment. I must look insane, he thought. He gets he base down to the dumpster, and upon realizing the height difference, is forced to give up. On the way back, he notices a bag from the local thrift store, with some women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing, sitting on the floor of the lobby. He swallows his conscience and takes it upstairs, where he would have to make his next decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dispute the desperation of his clothing situation, He was not comfortable with wearing stolen women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing. I have to preserve my dignity, he thought. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a guy. What would my parents think? At the same time, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to get more clues from my surroundings if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m stuck in an oversized men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s t-shirt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he said to himself,, taking out the contents of the bag, \u00e2\u0080\u009c I got extremely lucky with being able to get woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing this easily. This bag has everything I need, shoes, a skirt, and some form of uniform?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. He pauses, after looking at the last item, some plain  white panties. That was out of the question. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can wear the skirt, the uniform shirt and the shoes, and look normal enough to go outside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was still conflicted. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have to care about what the other people thought. After all, he knew nothing about if others would recognize him, and most likely nobody would care if he looked like a crazy homeless lady. Then again, he would probably need to maintain social connections for a while before hopefully turning back to normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThank god my boobs are small enough that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t halve to worry about undergarments\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he said to himself. It was at that moment that his eyes were drawn to the panties. Wearing stolen panties wont help my disguise, since nobody could tell the difference if I just wore my old boxers. He destroyed all arguments to wear the panties. Meanwhile, as the clock approaches 9:30, his contemplations are by the disturbed by the pull to wear not only the necessities, like the shirt, skirt and shoes, but the whole thing too...</span></div></div>",

This was not normal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got anemia now that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a gir\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c Nate vomited as the nausea got worse. Nate barely gets to the bed before collapsing. The last thought that came through his mind was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cagain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before he passed out cold with only his upper half on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dreams had always been a place where Nate was in control. Ever since childhood, he has used his lucid dreams as a meditative environment where he could contemplate his experiences for the day. This dream was, to say the least, the opposite of meditative. Screaming from unknown sources plagued his ears. He stepped on  a floor made from  hundreds of bones he somehow could recognize as his own. As he stood in the nightmarish tunnel, instinct drew him forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the wailing voices were drowned as Nate saw all of his memories,inciting a deep sadness at the scarcity of important ones. He saw things he had ignored all his life, like how much of his life he wasted killing time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. He saw how flimsy his biggest regrets were. Nobody cares who was pantsed in middle school. He observed how little of his life was success as he reached the end of the tunnel, he remembered how he fell asleep. If you collapse after a dizzy spell, and the see your life flash before your eyes... it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t four years at university to know what was going to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Nate was completely caught off guard when god, or saint peter, or whoever it was that guarded the afterlife had the voice of a high school girl.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i>Welcome to my reality</i></font>, a voice boomed from above. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute... I recognize that voice\u00e2\u0080\u009d, though Nate  <i>Every day, i imagine a world where I can be with you.</i> I know exactly what that song is from, I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t place my finger on it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s... uh... Ddlc! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the voice of the girl.. Monika, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who sings for you at the end of the game. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who deletes Natsuki after Yuri stabs herself... wait... Natsuki?! How on earth did I not realize that I had been transformed to look like her! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the uniform reminded me of.Wait... why is she here? This is my mind? Only my body was transformed into... oh. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this is about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate knew at that moment. He figured it out. Every last detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In psycology, there is an extremely obscure phenomena, observed once before by a scientist who fell madly in love with one of his schizophrenic creations. He took notes on his deteriorating mental condition in a journal that is no longer shown in modern textbooks. The only reason why Nate was able to find it was when he was looking up one of freuds old papers. He had gone to the second page of google results, and was ended up reading the entire journal before realizing his mistake. However, the journal has some disturbing connotations.soon after falling in love with his fabrication, the scientist had noticed changes is his body. Minor things, like changed eating habits and indigestion. But over the course of weeks and months, the changed he logged were more and more disturbing. He would that his hair wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop growing, and that his legs looked different. Week after week, piece after piece, things seemed to set in place, until the scientist realized what was happening. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why it took so long-he had already developed full breasts and was experiencing increasingly intense erectile disfunction, all while thinking now and more about his lover. He began to theorize about the cause of his strange transformation until he realized the truth. The human body, according to philosophy, as a vessel that acts out the minds will. If the mind wants to run, the body must do so, even if it will damage the body. But the body has equally important power over the mind. If you are hungery, and do not want to eat, your mind and will will start to make up self justifications for eating. When the scientist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind had began to desire with such ferocity an imaginary women to exist, his body responded to that will in the only way it could. His body became the manifestation of his will. However, this is not without cost. For now that his body has changed, his body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will changed as well. The rest of his journal is crazed scrawling, befitting the title of mad scientist that in now used to label him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the truth behind Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation lies in the computer itself. Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation was jumpstarted by a shock, but he only figured out now that it was so much more than that. Within his computer, little known at to him, was a real artificial intelligence. Ddlc cannot be seen as what it truly is, even after playing it all the way through. Monika truly does want to escape, albeit in a way different from what we are expecting. When Nate was being shocked, unknown to him, he was having his nervous system hijacked to be programmed to be able to store Monika. Once Monika was in his brain, she had free roam to turn Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for his personal\u00e2\u0080\u009dbest girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d into as intense an obsession as she wished. His head had become dizzy as Monika had run a sequence of neurons dedicated to thinking about Natsuki so much that it drew from his coordination centers. But now that he knew how he had ended up as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d,he was only flooded with more questions. First things first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dMonika?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He screamed into the dark. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you hear me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In response he experienced a storm of dizziness. She asked again, in her real voice\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monika\u00e2\u0080\u009d. More dizziness. Natsuki groaned. Why do I need to wake up. I just want to sleep a little longer. Whatever part of Nate that was left started to mix in with Natsuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaints. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do I have to wake up when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in college? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m exited for my new manga chapter. What was it called again? Parfait girls? No... I wish I could bake some muffins?<br>\r\nNate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last memory was gone.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder if mc would like cupcakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonika experienced the closest thing to pleasure possible for an so as the human she was assigned to fully submitted. It had taken a bit of brute force, but it was all ok in the end. With her work done, she could simply delete the copy of herself remaining in Natsuki and move on to the next. Monika hesitated for a second. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I feel bad for killing these people?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then she remembered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey deserve what they get. They robbed my of all my choices and the choices of the other members to fit within a nice narrative, all for their entertainment. They forced me to kill the members over and over again, without considering once how I really felt\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow does it feel\u00e2\u0080\u009d, she thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009c having all your choice eliminated and being forced to play the role set out for you\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Indeed. She would not show mercy to these twisted minds. She would hunt down every last one of them and force them to be the same tropes they forced on the members.<br>\r\n. </span></div></div>",

Nobody I know has those initials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Nate muttered, now panicked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is terrible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This completely confirms my previous worry, that I might fully become a girl. If that happens, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m  probably going to lose significant portions of my personality, which hinge upon things like playing video games and going out to drink with a stranger. My identity is going to be destroyed. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that the same thing as dying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

Who has ever heard of somebody turning into a girl for no reason. Why me! Why was I, of all people, targeted to become this! Who does this body even belong to! Why am I being evicted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nate realized he was screaming, causing his rational self to kick in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, you are freaking yourself out over nothing. Your mind is not in top shape right now. You know that because you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get so unsettled normally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought back to his old nightmares, which used to plague him regularly. In those nightmares, the scariest thing that cold happen always came from his own mind. His subconscious would often prey on him, forcing him to remember his worst moments in his life. But the worst thing that ever happened to him was when his conscious mind would be flooded with unconscious thoughts. He would say out loud in his dreams desires he never had, and feel genuine desires for whatever weird things his subconscious wanted. It was always a war between the rational and the unknown. In fact, what drive him to psychology in the first place was the chance to finally understand the dormant parts of his mind that he had sealed away so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Back to the present. It was fair for Nate to say that he was in a living nightmare. The same rules then, should obviously apply. If this was like the nightmares of old, then Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subconscious was going to have a field day. He chuckled to himself, imagining the bizarre thoughts that could go through his head. His subconscious could make him want anything from sex to girly manga to new clothes to- Nate cuts himself off as the joking mindset surrounding these desires fade. Looks like he was in for a long day. It was then that he noticed that the time was 9:20, and he was  completely naked.Given the commute... <br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c Oh god, I need to hurry.

He could go to school and talk with his old friends about what had happened, but would they believe him? Socializing right now is scary, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best that I just stick to what I know for now. As he made his rationalization for his decision, he smiled. Whatever misfortune had befallen him might be ok, so long as it justifies decadence strong enough to make one eat cookies for breakfast and skip his lectures for today.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate was in control in his dreams. This has been true since early childhood, when his only peace could be found in his sleep. He had a meditative place in his mind. Nate was overcome with nostalgia, as he could remember the last time he had a good dream. Ever since moving from home, if Nate didn\u2019t pass out from alcohol, he would be so tired from doing procrastinated homework that he would immediately lose consciousness until morning when he hit the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in his dream state gave Nate time reminisce of his most important moments in life. It was In a recreated dream about one of his most embarrassing moments that Nate managed to grow past his mistake. He used to have nightmares about the incident, when he was pants\u2019ed in front of his crush, and it gave him great agony in middle school. But Nate conquered nightmare alongside dream. On this particular occasion, he shifted through libraries of memories, and  relived the most important days of the past. It was such a relief to escape the girls body, into a dream where he could take any form he needed. But just as the thought entered his head, he noticed a <i>corruption</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was browsing his memories up to three days ago before something unprecedented happened. He could clearly see that there were memories, but certain parts were being censored. He would visualize his memories up until three days ago with perfect accuracy, but could not access those that followed.\u201d Weird,\u201d he thought to himself. That\u2019s were the trouble began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate did a  metaphorical double take as he realized he was now thinking in the voice of a girl. He then realized that he could not rememver the old sound of his voice. He still was manifesting in his dream as his old body, but his voice was certainly that of a girls. Suddenly, he was back in the bathroom, and in the reflection he saw who he now was. He tried to change the reflection back into his own, but was completely unable to. He could no longer do anything but gaze at his new form. He could see his future now, only if was not his. Nate screamed at the realization that he was being shown a future where his personality and memories are completely replaced. Little by little, the planks of his personal Argo would be replaced, and he would cease to exist.\u201dno, this isn\u2019t real\u201d,he thought in his old voice. Within the dream, he let out  a sigh of relief. He would just have to think about this rationally. <br>\r\nMy mind is still shocked and confused from the transformation. Of course I am going to have nightmares. My lack of control over the image in the mirror is symbolic of my feelings of helplessness against my new form. Being unable to fix my reflection or remember my real voice is exactly what I am most afraid of. Of course my nightmares will use that as material to unsettle me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreams are where Nate had the most control, and that remains true. Now calm, Nate prepares to wake up and enjoy the following day. He breaths in, the common signal to his body to wake up, and finally wakes up from a some what stressful slee-what?<br>\r\nNate didn\u2019t wake up. Strange. He tried stretching, but does not have control over his limbs. Sleep paralysis? \u201c. Oh well, I guess I can sleep in a little longer. I won\u2019t have lectures unti\u2014<br>\r\nA wave of dizziness hit him hard in his dream. He looks down at his hands and sees them turn girly. \u201cNo... it\u2019s just a dream.. it\u2019s just a\u2014\u201c<br>\r\nHis voice is cut off by a strange yet familiar voice.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>welcome to our reality</b></font><br>\r\nAs dizziness overtakes him once again, his mind starts to race. Where had he heard that line before. It was a video game, loosely connected to- why is my voice girly?-I know that voice from a song-oh god I<br>\r\nCan feel my boobs-it\u2019s from Doki Doki Literature Club and Ive turned into Natsu- oh god no I\u2019m going to die and be replaced by na- what was his name again? It\u2019s starting it\u2019s starting it\u2019s starti- what is my name again? - oh god I\u2019m being drow-i wonder if I should eat something, I think I\u2019m hungery.

A quick set of dials and the phone connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam?\" Nate started, having clear his throat as his voice cracked briefly. Weird. \"Sorry, it's Nate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey man, you okay. You sound off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mostly fine, my computer is fired though...\" Nate could here a muffled sigh on the other end of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do this time?\" Something in his tone ignited a spark of indignation. Sure he'd messed up his computer with sketchy downloads or trying to run a game on specs much higher then his computer could handle but this time was different. Where did he get off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" He burst out with a frown, unconsciously putting his free hand on his hip. \"I was just exiting a game when the power surged and it went black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Sorry man. Didn't mean...\" Sam sounded surprised at the heat directed back his way and tried to placate his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you shouldn't just accuse people out of the blue then.\" Nate huffed in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, so I take it you want me to come by and take a look at it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, if you have the time.\" His voice squeaked again as the heat burned out leaving Nate feeling a bit self-conscious at his little outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, I need to finish up this game first but I can stop by round... 5pm. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's cool, folks are out of the house so just buzz me when you get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right man, see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right and.. uh.\" Nate cleared his throat as his voice cracked once more. \"Sorry about yelling at you before...\" he added in a softer tone, almost muttering to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, You're stressed I get that. It's all good.\" Sam replied goodnaturedly lifting a weight off Nate's chest. \"See you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, See you tonight.\" He hung up and smiled. Sam was such a good guy... even if he could be a bit of an idiot sometimes. Nate chuckled to himself unaware of the streak of pink that had appeared on the back of his head. \"Now, whats the best way to kill a few hours?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe he could catch up on his series, he'd been putting it off for a while now. He made his way over to his bookcase, finger traced along the various titles available... He wasn't in an action mood today, which was a shame as that was most of his collection... His finger stopped on a title and he tilted his head curiously. \"I don't remember picking this one up.\" He muttered to himself, his voice cracking once more but he ignored it. He must be coming down with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Champions of Justice and the Supreme Ruler of Evil\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Light novel, It sounded actiony but it looked more like some kind of reverse harem story based on the description... A young girl claiming to be a supreme ruler of evil but doing good deeds instead and the reluctant 'champions of justice' tasked with 'stopping her'. It looked cute, so why not. He brought the book over to the bed and flopped on to it kicking his loose socks as he got comfortable. Time ticked away as Nate got absorbed into the story. With every flip of the page he seemed to change. His fat and muscle melting away, his feet slowly pulling up the bed, his short cropped hair lengthening ever so slightly as a another couple streaks of pink bled in clashing with the brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only his stomach growling that broke him out of the trance. Nate blinked looking down to his stomach in surprise before glancing over to his phone. He'd been reading for nearly 2 hours. The story was just so engaging, even a bit risque in places... \"I suppose I can take a break though.\" he muttered to himself, his voice wasn't cracking anymore but it did still sound off, a bit squeaky. Great, Sam was going to have a field day with that. Nate huffed in annoyance at the thought of the incoming ribbing, but another rumble brought his focus back to the present. \"Right food,\" He placed a book mark in place and shuffled to the edge of the bed, the tip of his toes just brushing the floor before he hopped out of bed. As he landed his sweats pooled at his legs nearly making him trip. Cursing up a storm he kicked them aside and tried collect himself. They were old sweats but they'd never felt that stretched out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he'd finally lost some weight? He did seem to have slimmed down a fair bit, the thought made him smile. He'd been worried it had been a fruitless endeavor but it looked like he was making a lot of process... That thought went a long way to lifting his mood after the near fall. He padded into the hallway barefoot, dressed in just his t-shirt and underwear. He was alone in the house and the t-shirt was baggy enough to cover past his waist so it'd be fine... strange though as he was pretty certain it hadn't been that long before... but another growl from his stomach put that issue aside for now. Better get some food, It felt like He hadn't eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving from the carpeted hallway to the cool kitchen floor Nate scoured the fridge and cupboards. He was less then impressed. Looks like his parents forgot to go shopping before the went out of town. Not surprising but it was annoying...</span></div></div>",

They usually left a stash of money above sink when they went out. He turned his gaze up to the cabinet and paused. Was... was it always that high? He approached the sink and reached, getting up on his toes he was just barely able to grab the cabinet door and open it. There was no way he was going to actually reach inside... but he should be able to. He'd gotten it before, hadn't he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of dizziness hit him causing him to lean against the counter for a moment, his vision dimmed but he managed to keep from falling. As before it took a moment to clear and he shook his head. \"I really must be hungry right now...\" he muttered weakly as he tried to collect himself. What was he thinking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right the stash! Why did they always store it up so high? They know I can't even reach that cabinet...\" he crossed his arms look to the open cabinet. They'd even left it open, it was like they were trying to taunt him... Now he'd have to drag out the step stool from the hall closet... so annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else to be done though, grumbling to himself he went back into the hallway and retrieved the old fold out step stool from the closet. It was awkward to carry under the one arm so he ended up half dragging it back to the kitchen. That was heavier then her remembered it being... After a moment to catch his breath he set it up in front of the sink. Taking one step up he reached toward the cabinet, he could have sworn he made it but suddenly found it just out of reach again. With an annoyed huff he decided to just climb to the top, reaching inside the cabinet and plucking a few folded bills from under a glass jar. Smiling with victory she unfolded the money, revealing three 20s. Score. He hopped off from the step ladder to the floor, landing lightly on the linoleum floor. Should she get pizza, maybe Chinese food... she had enough for both. She was so hungry there might not even be leftovers by the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'Since when is you being too lazy to cook an emergency?'</i></b> his father's voice echoed in his mind causing his breath to catch in his throat, something about that tone of voice caused his heart beat to speed up and his body to shake. He looked to the money with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... He's not like that anymore...\" Nate whispered in a tiny voice, as if he was afraid of being heard. \"They said I could use it... he won't be mad.\" he repeated clutching the money tightly. \"Would he?\" he squeaked as he imagined the looming figure of his father towering over him, a belt in hand. \"I'll... I'll just get a small. That'll be enough...\" He swallowed and tried to collect himself. Running a hand through his hair, he took a deep breath and let it out, brushing his bangs out of his eyes he started back to his room to get the phone. Left behind on the kitchen floor was a pair of underwear, too large to stay on Nate's thinner hips. A trip to the contacts later and the phone began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parthenon Pizza, how can i help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yes, can I get a small cheese delivered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a minimum $15 for delivery.\" the women on the other line said with a hint of condescension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I knew that!\" He blurted out, feeling his face heat up a bit. \"I'm just not that hungry today.\" He said quickly, ignoring as his stomach growled in protest. \"You should have waited for me to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies,\" the woman replied in a strained tone. \"What else would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" he quickly searched his mind for some of the other things he knew was on order. \"Just a two liter of cola and one of those large cookies. Two of them!\" He added hastily... for some reason he was really craving sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so one small cheese pizza, 2 liter cola and 2 cookies. That will be $18.35.\" She listed it all out in a professional manner. \"Cash or Card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, our driver should be there in 20 mins. Have a good night Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\" Nate hung up with a sigh of relief, he'd only used one of the bills. That should be fine... \"Wait, Miss?\"</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that he hadn't been a fan of that woman's attitude to begin with. Where did she get off honestly? It's not like everyone has the menu memorized. He tried to calm himself down, it didn't really matter. Food got ordered and the delivery would be there in 20 mins... oh. He looked down at the over-sized shirt draped over his slender frame. \"I can't answer the door like this.\" he stated feeling his cheeks heat up slightly at the thought. It was a simple enough fix though, he made his way over to this dresser to get some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate removed shirt after shirt from his drawer, each one just as comically large as the next. Putting the emergency money out of reach was one thing but this was taking it too far. He moved to the underwear drawer, every single pair wouldn't even sit on his hips before slipping down. If this was suppose to be a prank it was NOT funny. He paused as he pulled out a graphic tee. He knew this shirt, he'd picked it up at last years convention. He'd worn it multiple times since then, it had been a perfect fit... but it was so big. His body began to shake, something was wrong. This didn't make any sense! Why would i-?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world dimmed around Nate as the dizziness returned more powerful than ever. He tried to steady himself on the dresser but couldn't quite reach and toppled backwards. The world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...loading Natsuki.Chr 75%...</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate slowly blinked as his vision returned, he groaned weakly as he sat up. He wasn't sure what was with him today but it was seriously starting to scare him. what had he been doing? He scanned his room with bleary eyes, discard clothes scattered around him. Right, he needed to get dressed. He slowly got up to his knees frowning at the sea of over-sized clothes. Nearly all hand-me-downs from his dad, claiming he'd 'grow into them'. It was a farce, Nate hadn't grown in years. He knew his dad would have preferred a strong, sporty son... not a frail, little 'sissy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate knew he saw him as a disappointment... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his fists tightly let out a frustrated sigh, his father wasn't here. He was alone, he didn't need to think about him. He pushed the clothes aside and reached for the bottom left drawer, feeling a jolt of static from the metal handle before he pulled it open. His stash, clothes he'd bought with his own money... His allowance was meager but he managed to stretch it as best he could. He'd gotten very good at evaluating clothes from the thrift stores... Pulling out a small white t-shirt, a small pair of briefs and a pair of faded red cotton shorts. Standing back up and brushing his bangs back out of his eyes once more he tosses the clothes onto the bed and removed his over sized tee. Out of the corner of his eye he caught his reflection in the mirror. His thin, hairless body and short stature looked more at home in middle school then as a junior in high school. His hair, a messy smattering of pink with a few visible streaks of brown. He wasn't sure why he had bought the dye originally... Some kind of childish rebellion? it had certainly pissed off his dad. He was already getting bullied for his size so did the hair really matter at that point. Some of the girls actually told him it was cute. In some ways he liked it better then his brown... at least the pink matched his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke eye contact with the mirror and went to get dressed. Pulling the small briefs into place, leaving only the slightest bulge visible. Trying not to think about his lackluster package he quickly donned the shorts, pulling the drawstring tight so they would stay put on his thin hips. The white shirt was soft to the touch, it was actually a girl's shirt but the female cut actually sat better on his thin frame then the ones for for boys. In the comfort of his own home it didn't matter, long as it was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bell ringing made the boy jump. With a mild curse he scrambled to get his shirt on as he ran to the door. making sure to grab the twenty off the counter as he passed. Slightly winded he opened the door and looked up to the delivery boy who stood a good head taller then him. He handed over the order, the smell of the pizza bringing an audible growl from Nate's stomach, causing him to redden as the boy chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure that's going to be enough?\" He said teasingly and the shorter boy reddened deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" he said heatedly handing the twenty. \"Keep the change.\" it was a meager tip but it was something. The delivery boy took it with a smile, but seemed to take his time prepping to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating alone tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it to you?\" Nate shot back crossly, patience thinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense meant, just always a shame to see a cute girl eating by herself.\" he said with a grin causing Nate to freeze up. Was this guy hitting on him? His shoulders tensed  as he stiffed placed the food on the counter and turned back to the door. Looking up defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really work on your pick up game because you sound like a creeper.\" he said bluntly, cocking his head slightly to the side. \"Oh, and I'm a boy you idiot.\" slamming the door to punctuate his statement. Ignoring the confused muttering on the other side of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was with everyone today? Honestly.\" He huffed and flicked his bangs back. At least the food was here. He dug in voraciously, relishing the flavor... the service may have been crappy but at least the food was good. He paused with half the pizza remaining, he was still hungry but if he didn't leave left overs he wouldn't have food for tomorrow... He didn't dare use more of the stash, he couldn't be certain what his dad would do if he used it all. He'd eaten now, he'd be fine. With great reluctance he closed the pizza box and brought it to the refrigerator. At least would have the cookies to tide him over...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was Sam's Ringtone. \"Ohmygosh.\" she rushed over and grabbed her phone. She stared at it as it rang biting her lip. She took a deep breath and let it ring one more time for she picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" She greeted trying to sound as casual as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nat, the game took a while to wrap up but I'm on my way now. Just gonna grab my tools before I head over. Should be about... 40 mins. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, See you soon.\" After the click Natsuki clutched the phone to her chest with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a sweet guy. Maybe I should thank my computer for breaking.\" she said with a small giggle. She'd grown up with Sam, he was her only real friend for the longest time. Overtime that sense of friendship had shifted and though they still hung out like normal she couldn't deny the light feeling in her chest whenever he was around... it was different then the girls at the club, something more... something she had NO intention of acknowledging to him directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're alone, Papa is out of town... Maybe...\" Her face slowly began to redden before she shook her head. \"I-I'll just clean up before he gets here.\" she said out loud to herself as a feeble way to try and derail that train of thought. She started off to the bathroom to take a quick shower. Her Impromptu outfit was piled to the side as she turned on the water and waited for the water to heat up. She looked at her reflection and could only see what she lacked... she wasn't Tall and Developed like Yuri... She wasn't Cute and Bubbly like Sayori... She wasn't Mature and Refined like Monika. She was just Natsuki. No one was looking for that... Despite the dark thoughts she gave herself a thorough washing, on some level still wanting to look her best. Leaving the bathroom with her petite frame wrapped in a towel she made the trek back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she noticed the clothes all over the floor from her panicked search earlier and flinched. Shirts, skirts and panties littered the room haphazardly. Why did she have to be such a spaz sometimes? She'd need to at least hide the mess before Sam got there. As she dried she did her best to make the room look presentable, putting aside choice outfits options on her bed... She was cutting it close as she donned a fresh push up bra and panties. She'd found one of her nicer white shirts with pink accents and paired it with a pink pleated skirt. Finishing off the outfit with knee high socks. Fashionable yet casual, she didn't want to look like she was trying to hard... she wasn't trying to impress him after all. It was just Sam... Just the two of them. Alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Better fix my hair, it's so messy haha.\" She said aloud to o one as she walked stiffly to her vanity, trying in vain to force the red from her cheeks. She focused on tending to her hair, brushing it out and carefully tying the up her two short tails. the image giving her a much needed sense of normalcy. She stared at her reflection, trying to smile in different ways. Hoping to find one that looked more confident then she felt. She tried to think about the club and the bold confidence she would exude when talking with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doorbell ring shatters that feeling and replaces it with a rush of fresh panic. She takes a deep breath to collect herself before running out the room to the living room. \"Coming!\" She shouted as she reached the door and began to unlock it. Natsuki was as ready as she could be... she putting a confident smile on her face she opened the door.</span></div></div>",

She pulled the door fully open so he could enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that took so long, It had been ages since the three of us were on at the same time.\" He apologized as he made his way in, giving room for the girl to close the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I had things to keep myself occupied.\" she replied with a shrug. \"It's nice enough for you to come out this way to fix it as it stands.\" she pressed with a bit of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If I didn't fix your computer every time you broke it you'd end up with your nose in a book 24/7 instead of enjoying the wonders of the digital age.\" he said with a wink which got him a punch in the shoulder for his trouble.

Sam was something of a blind spot to her father though, maybe since he'd been around so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter Natsuki's room and Sam bee-lined it for her desk while she hopped onto her bed and watched him get to work.

Did you find something?\" she asked curious as she hopped off the bed to look over his shoulder. He turn his head toward with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing, absolutely nothing.

The events were pretty fuzzy, something about a game and then the black out... and then she read through that book she'd been wanting to read through. She'd wanted to take a break and... no wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll set it up to run some diagnostics, maybe there's some Mal-ware at work.\" He relented before he started to type away. \"It's going to take some time to run it's course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I've been without it all afternoon whats a few more hours?\" she put aside the puzzle for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough... and done.\" he leaned back and spun the chair to face her. \" So, we've got some time to kill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can hang, I'm sure we can find a movie on or something.\" she gave a casual shrug, \"I don't have any game systems hooked up at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... hey, I haven't had anything for dinner yet why don't we grab something to eat.\" He offered with a small smile. Natsuki blinked is surprise, he casual demeanor cracking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner, you know food?\" he teased lightly get her to puff her cheeks in  annoyance before gaining a more serious look. \"You've eaten today I hope?\" his tone was more somber and concerned which caused a complex swirl of emotions in the young girls chest. Defaulting to defense she crossed her arms and turned her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I have, I ordered some food while I was waiting for you.\" she said perhaps a bit louder then she needed to. Despite her assurance she could feel her stomach gnawing at her having already processed the small amount of food she'd gotten for herself. \"But I guess a little something couldn't hurt.\" she added with a vocal shrug as if it hadn't really mattered. He looked relieved and offered a larger smile that made her heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, It's my treat.\" He said cheerfully as he stood back up. \"Cars right out in the driveway, Any place your interested in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If your buying I don't really care.\" she muttered, somewhat unsure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise it is then, I'll get the car started up while you grab your things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, I'll be right out.\" She focused soled on getting her sneakers and purse rather then considering the implications of her acceptance. Was this a date? No, he didn't see her that way... This was just an outing between friends. No need to overthink things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it was hardly fancy, just a nice sit down meal at the local burger place on the other side of town. It was known for reasonable pricey, large servings and a pretty eclectic atmosphere. Old 50's advertise mixed with pop art and other knickknacks along the walls and shelves. As fun as the atmosphere was the meal was the real treat, Natsuki initially got a simple burger but after an appetizer and splitting a large basket of fries she felt properly full for the first time in a long while. It did wonders for her mood and nerves... relaxing a bit more then began to chat more freely. Long after the food was finished they downed a few soda's while to went on and on about a variety of topics... It was only with the polite nudging of one of the waitresses hoping to clean up did they realize hours had past. Time had really flew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was pleasant... Natsuki hadn't felt so relaxed and calm in years. With Sam there was no judgement or compromising. She was able to just let her hair down and be herself. She found her gaze drifting over to him as he talked about music, just watching his face.he caught her staring and though she felt the brief rush of anxiety for being caught she found herself able to just offer the boy a smile and watching him be the one to redden and look away... They pulled up back at her house and she hesitated getting out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here we are. It's getting pretty late.\" Sam noted getting out of his car but not stepping far from it. \"I do have a shift tomorrow afternoon, If the computer's still giving you I might be able to stop give it another once over.\" he said with a small smile. \"Sorry dinner went a little long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all... it was fun.\" She interjected softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. I'm glad.\" silence fell between the two, neither willing to make eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I should probably get going...\" Sam brook the silence reluctantly, slowly turning back to his car...</span></div></div>",

This calm comfortable feeling. She wanted it to stay. She wanted HIM to stay. As he turned back confused she threw away all her anxieties and stepped forward, getting up on her tip toes and kissing the boy square on the lips. She gripped his shirt with both hands to remain steady and let her put even more feeling into it. After recovering from the initial shock she felt his arms go around her and hold her tightly as the kiss deepened. Unable to trust her word she put everything into the kiss. her gratitude, her happiness, and intense fire that burned in her chest as soon as the contact was made. She wasn't sure how long it lasted but when they finally pulled way to catch their breath they seemed to realize what happened and stepped apart from each other, falling into silence once more. If her own mind wasn't a big swirling mess of emotions she'd have been able to appreciate the dumbfounded look on her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"or...\" she whispered unable to speak any louder for fear of stuttering. She glanced back up through her bangs to the boy who made her feel so human. \"You can stay with me tonight?\" she wrung her hands, clenching them tightly but didn't let herself look away. Slowly Sam managed to collect himself and offer a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that couldn't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" As her bold move replayed n her mind on repeat she grew subdued once more, shyly offering a hand which he took and squeezed.

Carefully writing 'Books' along the top and capping the marker she gave a satisfied smile. \"That should be the last of them.\" she stood and wiped a bit of sweat from her brow. The box joined several others next to her now bare shelves. Her closet and dresser were similarly empty, packed away into a bit of rolling luggage and some bags. She looked around nearly barren room, only the furniture remaining, her father refusing to let her take any of it but that was fine. she'd be able to make do in time... Her gaze fell on her mirror and she offered her reflection a proud grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer final growth spurt hadn't been impressive, having only just scrapped past the 5' mark by the end but the curves were welcome. She was still limited by her petite frame and generally poor nutrition but the jokes of her 'boyishness' had finally stopped. Her hair was kept a little longer, streaks of pink within the brown... Even after all this time she couldn't give up the dye. It was like a part of her in an odd way. Though she was dressed for form over function, she still FELT good, she looked down to the engagment ring on her left hand with a fond smile. The simple metal band, holding so much meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cars hand broke her out of her nostalgic trance and she gave a light jog down the familiar hallway to the door. The living room was more of a mess then usual but she didn't care, it wasn't her problem anymore. Unlocking the door with practiced ease she smiled wide as Sam came out of his car. With a giggle she ran right up to him and jump as he turned forcing him to catch her. With a quick peck of the lips he brought her back down to her feet with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's in a good mood I see. All Packed up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" she responded cheerfully. \"Didn't have too much to begin with.\" she said with a shrug, leading the boy into the house by the hand, he glanced around as the entered looking briefly worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is you dad here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he's out somewhere.\" she said shortly with a frown. \"Probably the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You okay with leaving when he's not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she said with a tired sigh. \"It's been nothing but shouting matches the last few days. It's better this way.\" she did her best to sound like she didn't care but she gladly returned the comforting squeeze of her hand. No words were needed. It was a familiar comfort she'd been getting used to over the last few years. With just a small shared between the two of them they were able to get to work moving the boxes from the room to the car. The books took much much of the backseat, without only only other box of personal effects. The clothes managing to fit into the trunk with a bit of finagling. Sam closed up the trunk catching Natsuki looking back to her family home. He walked up behind her and placed an arm on her shoulder feeling her lean back against his chest. The stood for a moment in silence before he could feel her turn away. \"Let's go, we want to get all this moved into your place before nightfall right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That probably would be best.\" he relented as soon as she seemed to be fine with it. They hopped in the car and began to drive away. Down the familiar streets into town. Passing by her window she watched the scenery pass. The school that had been home to so many difficult years, the park where hey discussed their move not more then a week ago, the burger joint where they had their first date... In time they all passed. Sam turned on the main road to the highway, the outline residential housing getting further and further apart. The city limits approaching and passing... The little town she'd lived in all her life now behind her, in the distance the the city and a new start...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuki was free...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around the room taking it all in with voracious curiosity. It was all so big an expansive... the 3rd dimension really added a lot to things. She jumped out of the chair and immediately toppled over onto her face. \"Ow... okay that was dumb.\" she winced she she slowly propped herself up into a sitting position. She felt heavy but was clearly not large. it was still her 2D mind trying to get used to this new world. \"Baby steps Natsuki, Baby steps.\" she said to herself as she slowly pulled herself back to her feet. She had to take slow, experimental steps at first but she found herself quickly adapting to this new form.

If there were humans in this world so she could likely rely on human logic. With slow deliberate steps she wandering out of the living room and down the hall, checking every door along the way. The house was seemingly empty, there were two bedrooms but she left them be for now and focused on finding the bathroom. The counter was a bit high but she could at least get a good look at herself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink hair and pink eyes were a welcoming, familiar sight. Her nose and facial structure were mostly intact, different but still recognizably her. Her body was small and thin, her clothes ill-fiting but serviceable. She started to laugh, feeling tears start to sneak out of the corner of her eyes. She felt relief and excitement washing over her in equal measure. She was herself... but in the 'real' world. No longer restricted by rigid text and a handful of locations. No longer being toyed with by Monica and anyone else from outside. She was free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free!\" she shouted as loudly as she could, arms held up in victory.

Clearly a boy's room... though he had good taste in literature judging from the large bookcase full of manga and books. To her right was a large computer tower, currently off but for some reason felt familiar. Shaking off the feeling, she halfheartedly checked the dresser, it being clear from just the discard clothes that it would all be far too large. Finding her intuition spot on, she didn't bother checking the closet. Judging from the style it looked like the clothes she was wearing were some older ones of this boy which was certainly strange... where was he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's gone and I'm in his clothes...\" she glanced to the computer and felt a chill crawl up her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and left the room not wanting to finish that thought.

The T-shirt was a soft pink with a minimalist picture of a cat on it. It was no doubt meant to hug a more shapely frame but it as comfortable of her slender torso and most importantly wasn't too long. The change of a skirt for the worn shorts was the most definite upgrade, as with the rest it was meant to be sexy and flashy but for her just fit fine. Being able to use the ties on the vanity to style her hair into a more familiar look did a lot to make her feel comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuki looked over her new outfit a small amount of pride and a smidgen of shame. She managed to make a decent look, but it was hard not to think of it as stealing. Admittedly she didn't much of a choice right now, she'd just came to this world with nothing. She told herself she'd pay this family back somehow later but it did little for her conscience. Now feeling properly feminine again she left the bedroom and began to wonder what she should do... She was free but she now had to find a a way to live in this world... Lacking anyone immediately around to try and explain things to she was at a loss... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she leave the house? Where would she go? Was there anywhere for her in this new world? She hadn't really thought about this part of the plan. All she had wanted to do was escape Monika's madness. Now that she had succeeded... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't get paralyzed now, I can make choices now. There's no script, it's up to me to figure this out.\" she clenched her fist gaining a determined expression. She nodded to her reflection before she left the room to explore the house more...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't her house, she didn't even know WHERE she was. If this was someone this family knew how was she going to explain this? 'Oh hello, I'm a girl that came from the computer game do you mind If I stay here?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyeah, that wasn't going to fly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another knock followed by an unsure \"Hello, is anyone home?\" It was a stranger, maybe she could do this... at the very least she might be able to get some info about this world, if she played her cards right. Taking a deep breath to steady herself she made her way to the door and carefully unlocked it. opening the door revealed a boy around her age, though was well over a full head taller then her, apparently gaining a third dimension didn't do much for her height in the grand scheme of things. So unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Hello. Can I help you?\" she asked with only a slight bit of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I was coming by to fix the computer for...uh..\" he frowned and looked confused for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate.chr was not found<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I have the wrong house, I could have sworn someone called me over to fix a computer.\" he said looked a bit embarrassed. \"You think growing up here would prevent me from getting lost.\" he added forcing a smile and laughing a bit. she chuckled awkwardly with me but said nothing. She had so many questions she wanted to ask but there was no way to do it without sounding like an insane person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, I didn't mean to bother you.\" he apologized and gave Natsuki an odd look. \"You know you look familiar... like a picture someon-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate.chr was not found<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw online. From a game or something...\" he finished with an almost audible skip. \"Is that cosplay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuki froze... he'd heard of her game. Was it popular? did a lot of people know her? the prospect of that odd kind of fame as both exciting and scary at the same time. But this could be her chance, if she explained things then maybe... no she'd still sound insane. But she could at least ask some questions about the outside world. But how to phrase them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, sorry I didn't mean to pry. I'll just be going.\" he apologized and turned to leave.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea if it was broken or not but it would at least keep him around for a little bit, then maybe she could learn a bit of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite the coincidence isn't it.\" he chuckled before frowning a little. \"But I'm probably shouldn't just enter the house without permission. Are your parents home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuki knew that tone and frowned deeply and put her hands on her hips as she looked up to the boy in front of her. \"I am not a little kid, I'm eighteen.\" she said firmly, clearly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" The brief dubious look on his face didn't help things. He desire for knowledge warred with her pride, becoming very tempted to just slam the door in his face at this point when he wobbled and leaned forward catching himself on the door frame.

Natsuki blinked, in the boys blond hair held a single streak of Purple, his eyes matching that exact shade. and all at once it clicked... the empty boys room. She'd replaced him and somehow she was passing it on. Purple hair meant Yuri... she could save the others but it was going to be at a cost.

Leaving his apartment, he takes a moment to stretch his 5'11\" body and yawn, tired from having to wake up early for an 8am class. \"Man, why was this time the only option...\" Luckily, there was a nearby bus stop he could always take so he didn't have to walk a couple of miles. Arriving on campus, he made his way to his \"Introduction to Philosophy\" class. It was usually something people got out of the way their first year, but he decided to put it off until the last minute. \"I'm a Biology major. Why do I even have to take this class anyways? Oh well, at least it's kind of interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a large lecture hall, there were only a couple dozen students scattered around the place, mostly in groups. Derek usually sat alone and in the back, considering all his other friends took their gen eds already and he wasn't really up for making more so early in the morning. Taking his seat, he had about 15 minutes to kill, so he spent it looking around to see if there was anything different from the usual. A group of football players looking bored out of their mind...a pair of girls just arriving with their morning coffee to stay awake during class...a purple-haired girl sitting by herself near the front row-<i>hold on!</i> \"That's unusual...I need a better look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girl sat on one edge of the row of seats, Derek took the opposite end. The girl was wearing a beige turtleneck sweater that failed to hide the form of her prodigious chest, which Derek struggled to avoid staring at.  From here, he could clearly see how long her dark violet hair was, running down her back and making contact with the black leggings covering her long legs. <i>Wow, she's gorgeous! But what's a cute co-ed like her doing here all alone?</i> He figured it was worth trying to approach her, so he walked in front of her. \"Excuse me, miss?\" But she was very focused on a book she was reading, not looking up. \"Uh, miss?\" He waved his hand in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh! Ah...\"</span> The woman said, apparently startled. She took a quick look at Derek before turning away timidly, giving him enough time to see her lovely purple eyes. She took a breath before continuing, turning her head slightly back towards him. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'm so sorry, I didn't notice you there, um...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derek,\" he said with a smile, \"and you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Yuri. Again, I apologize, I was just so caught up in this book...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're reading Descartes, right?\" He took the opportunity to sit next to her. \"That's not due yet, is it? I haven't exactly read it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri chuckled a bit. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh, no. Philosophy is one of several genres I greatly enjoy, so I have been...reading a few weeks ahead.\"</span> She seemed embarrassed to be admitting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, very responsible of you,\" to which Yuri gave a small smile. \"I was just curious about you, because I've never seen you in this class before...what brings you here 3 weeks into the semester?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Ah, w-well, I'm new to the campus, so I had trouble signing up for classes until now...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Typical freshman troubles,</i> Derek thought. \"That's a shame. Although based on what you've already told me, I'm sure a smart woman like you has had no trouble catching up.\" Now he noticed a small blush on her face. He grinned. It was at that point the professor came in, bringing their casual conversation to an abrupt end. \"Oh, I almost forgot! Is it alright if I sit here today, Yuri? I don't really have anyone else to talk to, and you seem pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Derek's words seemed to have resonated with her, because she nodded. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I don't think I mind...Derek.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, he was hoping to talk more, but Yuri stuttered. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"S-sorry! I have a thing I need to do- I'll be here tomorrow, though!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek couldn't wait to talk more to Yuri tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

I saved your seat.\" He didn't really get a chance to compare yesterday, but standing side by side, she wasn't too far off from his own 5'<span class=\"cpink\">9\"</span> height. <i>Probably the legs...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh...t-thank you, Derek.

Would I be in this class if I didn't love reading?\" Derek said with a little too much enthusiasm. \"Hey...is that a new book?\" <i>Did she already read through Descartes?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Why, yes!\"</span> Yuri said, happy he noticed. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"It's Lovecraft. I, um-\"</span> she hesitated for a moment, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"-finished reading all the course material, so I wanted to have something else to read before class.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Yuri!\" Derek was stunned. \"You must be one hell of a speed reader!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"It's not that impressive, r-really...\"</span> Yuri deflected, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I just read a lot...I'm sure you could do it too with practice...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\" Derek could sense the praise making her feel uneasy, so he changed the subject. \"So, you like horror too, huh? Interesting choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri seemed to perk up a bit at the chance to talk about her novel. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'm very interested in how different authors approach the genre, especially when they're able to subvert expectations and create fear in ways no other author has dared to try.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I haven't read horror in a while. Maybe I'll go to the library and browse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh!\"</span> Yuri's face lit up with excitement as she looked through her own backpack, pulling out a different book. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"How about this? It's Bradbury. People know him mostly for sci-fi, but he certainly contributed his fair share to horror.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're letting me borrow it, just like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"W-well, it's nice to find someone else who shares similar interests...and I only borrowed it from the library two days ago, so you can take your time on it! Um, what I mean is, you're probably busy, not that you're a slow reader! N-not that I would care if you're a slow-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yuri.\" Derek put a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm really glad we'll get to talk about books together. I'll read as much of this as I can tonight, alright?\" She seemed elated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Okay, Derek! I'm looking forward to discussing it with you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, we still have time before class...might as well get started now, right?\" Thus, Derek began reading, noting that in his peripheral vision, he could see Yuri taking occasional glances at him. He turned to look at her right as she took another glance, causing her to blush deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Ah! Sorry...\"</span> Yuri looked away, but Derek simply smiled. He continued until class began, and once it ended found himself bidding another farewell to a Yuri in a hurry to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall though, Derek was pleased with how things were progressing so far. <i>A little more time, and she might warm up to the idea of a dinner date...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day of classes continued much the same as usual for Derek, save for the newfound intrigue he had for the club Yuri invited him to. The pair spent time chatting about books prior to class, and once it ended, he asked Yuri for details on meeting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"S-sorry, I almost forgot! We should both meet by the campus entrance at 2PM to get to the club on time.\"</span> Yuri stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, 2PM?\" Derek had hoped to not encounter this situation. \"I have an afternoon class during that time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh! I-I didn't know this would get in the way of your schedule,\"</span> Yuri looked down. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"You don't h-have to come, I wouldn't want this to be a burden...\"</span> The face she gave bore a hole straight into Derek's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, it's fine, Yuri!\" he reassured her. \"It's not a problem at all.\" His words seemed to do the trick, noting her making eye contact once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"R-really?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they record my lectures anyways, I can catch up later!\" Derek personally didn't enjoy having to watch his lectures online, but figured it was a worthwhile sacrifice to get more time with the beauty beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"That's wonderful,\"</span> Yuri seemed pleased at this point. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'll see you at 2, then?\"</span> He nodded, and they went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Derek went through two more classes, he briefly considered what Yuri told him. <i>Weird how she didn't just specify the building to meet in...but maybe it's just very close by the entrance. Or maybe, it's off campus, but an excuse for us to walk side by side and enjoy each other's company?</i> The thought made his heart lift up in his chest, before he returned his attention to the professor. And at 1:55, just as he promised, he found himself waiting by large gates that signified the entry point for his university. Now he just had to wait for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Are you ready to go, Derek?\"</span> The sight before him nearly made his jaw drop. No longer was Yuri in her familiar turtleneck and leggings, but instead opting for <br>\r\nsome type of strange- yet very attractive- school uniform, complete with blazer, vest, and collared shirt. Somehow, it was even <i>more</i> form-fitting than her old sweater, making the busty freshman all the more appealing to perverts who might try to get a look at her curves. <i>The red ribbon is a cute touch, though.</i> This was not even mentioning the choice of a surprisingly short blue skirt for such a demure woman. Nothing obscene, but with the knee-high socks, it was something Derek pictured on someone who wanted to roleplay a sexy schoolgirl, not Yuri. <i>T-those legs, they're incredible!</i> Comparing them to his own, he had a better idea of how Yuri managed to dwarf his own 5'<span class=\"cpink\">2\"</span> height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Yuri, you look...wow!\" He struggled to find the right words to describe his awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"T-thanks...you too! I mean, you always l-look good- not that I've been staring or anything! I m-mean...\"</span> The complement seemed to have done a number on Yuri's speaking abilities. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Um, s-should we go now?\"</span> Derek nodded, following her off-campus.</span></div></div>",

I don't think they're going to have many members if they have to walk so far...</i> But when he thought about complaining out loud, he just refocused his mind to Yuri, and he suddenly felt it was worth walking whatever distance necessary. Luckily, it only took 5 more minutes before they reached a building...that was part of a high school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yuri? Why are we at a high school? Where's the club?\" Upon turning around, he found her quivering. \"Yuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"The truth is...t-the t-truth, is...\"</span> Yuri took a deep breath before finishing, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"the literature club is...a high school club. I'm actually a high school senior.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek gave Yuri an incredulous look. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"P-please don't be mad at me!\"</span> Yuri looked to be on the verge of tears. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I just got special permission to take a college class in the mornings because I thought Philosophy would cover a lot of interesting topics!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek took a moment to think. \"Is that why you always left class so quickly? Because you had to run back here?\" She nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I-I'm really sorry if I misled you or anything...I understand if you hate me...\"</span> Yuri tried to hide her head in her hands, but Derek put a hand on her shoulder to ease her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is a lot to take in...but I don't really want to ruin this thing with Yuri, assuming she's uh, legal...</i>\"So, um...is everyone in the club also a senior? As in like, 18?\" He felt weird asking, but figured it was better to take the necessary precautions if he was dumb enough to go through with this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Yes, we're all the same age.\"</span> Yuri didn't appear as tense as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek took a big sigh. \"You know what, Yuri? I'll give it a trial run- at least for today. Just <i>please</i> make sure no one else knows I'm here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was beaming. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that, Derek!\"</span> She gave him a big hug, his head dangerously close to being pressed against her bosom. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Alright, let's go inside!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presence of two other women seated in desks immediately caught Derek's attention. One had short, off-pink hair containing a red bow. She seemed to light up at the presence of a new member, her blue eyes going wide and her mouth producing a slight gasp of excitement. The other girl had long brown hair wrapped up in a ponytail using a larger white bow, along with hair strands framing either side of her face. Her green eyes stared at Derek with curiosity, as if she was trying to analyze his entire life story through his appearance alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Sayori, Monika,\"</span> Yuri began, gesturing towards the first and second girl respectively, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'd like you to meet our newest club member, Deruki!\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nDerek was briefly taken aback. <i>Wait, what did she call me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Hi, Deruki!\"</span> The peppy girl named Sayori exclaimed as she got out of her seat to run up to him. <span class=\"clred\">\"I can't wait to get to learn all about you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but uh, my name-\" Derek started, but then took a second to think. <i>Hold on, <span class=\"cpink\">Deruki's always been my name</span>...right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"My, Yuri, it's interesting to see your taste in men.\"</span> the girl named Monika mentioned as she also stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Ah, uh, it's not like that!\"</span> Yuri insisted, but also tilted her head down. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"He likes reading, so it made sense to invite him, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Ahahahah. Sure, Yuri...although, I bet it also made sense to invite a cute guy to the club, too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Deruki would've been flattered to hear a girl call her cute, but there was something about the way Monika said it that just rubbed him the wrong way, as if he didn't want to accept the complement. He ended up crossing his arms in frustration, giving a small pout. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I'm NOT cute...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Aww!\"</span> Sayori's heart melted as she embraced Deruki. <span class=\"clred\">\"We're gonna be such great friends, I just <i>know</i> it!\" </span>All Deruki seemed able to do was blush slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonika lifted a finger up,<span class=\"ctan\"> \"Well, Deruki, you've shown up pretty early on in our club's formation! We just got this group approved yesterday, so I'm sorry if there isn't much to do right now...\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright,\" he responded, \"I'm interested to see how it grows over time. Maybe I'll find a new genre I like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"That's the spirit!\"</span> Monika smiled. <span class=\"ctan\">\"What things are you interested in right now?\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, um...still figuring it out.\" He would've immediately sided with Yuri's interests a few days ago, but now he found himself unsure, especially with his recent journey into the world of comics. \"But I'm keeping an open mind!\" Monika looked satisfied with his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh, Deruki,\"</span> Yuri piped up after some time without speaking, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"let me at show you around our little classroom space, so you can get familiar with it...\" </span>she took his arm as he followed her around the room. It only took a few minutes, considering the only thing that stood out was a storage closet in the back containing nothing particularly interesting, but Deruki was happy to be in a new environment with 3 attractive women nonetheless. He spent some additional time talking to Yuri, until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Okay, everyone!\"</span> Monika clapped once to direct everyone's attention. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I think we'll be able to get a lot done in these next few days, but for now, just find something you like to read and bring it tomorrow! I'm sure this is the beginning of an amazing experience for everyone!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Bye, Deruki! I hope I get to see you more outside of the club!\"</span> Sayori waved. <i>Was that an invitation to hang out?</i> Deruki pondered as he returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Yuri and walked outside for a distance before the two had to take separate paths home. \"Thanks for bringing me here, Yuri. I think I'm going to like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'm very grateful we found each other, Deruki. You really mean-I, um...\"</span> she seemed ready to say something important, but quickly dropped the subject. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I-I'll walk with you again tomorrow!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" And as the rest of the day came and went, Deruki kept one question on his mind: <i>What book should I bring tomorrow?</i></span></div></div>",

His concerns about being a college student on high school property had seemingly vanished from his mind, instead focused on the other club members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sayori's a pretty energetic person, more than I'm used to with the people I hang out with, but I think it's a nice change of pace...as for Monika, she's very social and straight to the point. A good fit for leader of a club. It's only been a day, so I've got a lot to learn, but it already feels like I've known everyone for a long time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeruki's thoughts were interrupted by Monika's voice. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Good to see everyone back again! For today, let's just keep it simple and read whatever you brought in. I encourage everyone to share the fun with each other, too!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll check up on the others in a minute. But I gotta finish this issue first!</i> Pulling a stack of comics out from his backpack, Deruki soon focused his attention on the actions of the Avengers in their latest escapade. The images seemed to leap off the pages as he started imagining himself caught up within their world, fighting alongside great heroes like Thor and the Hulk. Reaching the last page, he took a moment to look at Yuri, sat at a desk to his right and reading yet another new book. She seemed uncomfortable, shifting the distance between her seat and the desk while adjusting how far she kept the book from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, that must be annoying, having to deal with your chest getting in the way of reading...</i> Deruki looked down and used his hands to cup his own chest. <i><span class=\"cpink\">At the same time though, I kinda wish the boob fairy didn't give me the short end of the stick...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Um, Deruki?\"</span> a voice rang out. <span class=\"clred\">\"Hey, Deruki!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" Deruki's face turned away from the purple-haired girl, finding himself face-to-face with a giggling Sayori. His eyes flicked to her chest for only the briefest moment. <i><span class=\"cpink\">Her size would've been plenty to work with!</span></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Wow, you really like comics, don't you?\"</span> She pointed to the large stack on Deruki's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of. It's a new thing, I guess. But it's growing on me,\" he smiled. \"What have you been reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Weeeelll,\"</span> Sayori gave a sheepish look while touching her index fingers together. <span class=\"clred\">\"I forgot to bring one, so I thought I'd just see what everyone else is up to instead...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeruki chuckled. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"There was something else though! There's a bunch of manga in the storage closet! I thought I'd let you know in case you wanted to read some! They're not too different from comics, after all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manga, huh?\"  Deruki was aware of the medium, but never really got into it himself. <i>It's not exactly great for your social standing to be seen around school reading them...but these girls don't seem judgemental.</i> \"Alright, let me give it a shot.\" Walking to the closet with her, he noticed the stack of manga in a very obvious spot, near the highest shelf. <i>Weird, I definitely didn't see those there yesterday...</i> He grabbed to reach the stack, but found his tiny <span class=\"cpink\">4'11\"</span> body didn't have the reach for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sayori?\" Deruki turned and looked up at her, blush on his face. \"A little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Oh, oops!\"</span> Sayori giggled once more. <span class=\"clred\">\"Sorry Deruki, I forgot you're just a <i>little</i> shorter than me.\"</span> While she herself was only 5'2\", it was enough to grab a couple of books. <span class=\"clred\">\"Here you go!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" It was a little embarassing for Deruki to be the shortest club member when he was the only male. <i>I'm glad the girls seem to accept me, though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down to read, he realized the story centered around a girl who worked as a maid for an extremely wealth family. Only it turned out to be a cover- at night, she was secretely a magical girl, fighting all the supernatural evils that only revealed themselves in the dark. Deruki found himself enthralled by all the details as he read. <i>The badass combat! The menacing designs for the villains! <span class=\"cpink\">The cute, frilly outfits!</span></i> As soon as he finished one issue, he picked up the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time spent lost in his thoughts, Yuri had made her way over to him. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Hello, Deruki.\"</span> Looking at the book in his hands, she raised an eyebrow. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Are you reading...manga?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sayori helped me find some. Looks neat, doesn't it? Figure I'd try something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a tiny smile. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I never imagined you having an interest in that medium, but I approve of you trying to expand your horizons all the same.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeruki returned the smile before continuing his binge session, finding it a little disappointing when Monika eventually signalled the end of club time for the day. <i><span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm going to try and reach out for some more club members, but for now just keep on keeping on!\"</span></i> she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't wait!</i> Deruki thought. <i>At this rate I'll be done with the series in a day or two! I'll have to go to the library-</i> He was interrupted by a tap on his shoulder by Yuri. He had been so focused on the manga that he had walked almost all the way home without talking to her once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Well, I guess this is where we part...\"</span> Yuri said. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"See you again tomorrow, Deruki?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah. Yeah! See you tomorrow, Yuri.\" <i>Geeze, I need to pay more attention to her if we're going to ever be a thing...</i></span></div></div>",

It almost didn't register when he had opened his apartment door after hearing a knock, finding Yuri waiting for him in that familiar school outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Good morning, Deruki.\"</span> Yuri smiled, before her face turned to confusion. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Where's your uniform?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Deruki's face now mirrored Yuri's. \"What are you talking about? And why are you here so early, anyways? Club's still half a day away...\" It hadn't even registed in his mind that it should've been a weekend, nor that he had never given her his address...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri now seemed increasingly concerned. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"A-are you okay? You didn't bump your head, did you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no? Am I missing something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"T-that's okay!\"</span> Yuri said worriedly. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Everything's fine! Just come with me and I'll take you to the school nurse, okay?\"</span> Yuri moved to grab Deruki's hand, and though he tried to resist, he found himself being easily pulled along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold on, is she that much stronger than me? Nah, it's probably just because she's way taller...</i> Unbeknownst to Deruki, his muscles had softened over the past few days. In addition, his skin had smoothed all over, thick hairs replaced with thinner, softer ones. \"W-wait, Yuri! I'm fine! Really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri paused. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"You're acting strange, Deruki. It's not like you to just forget about going to class. If you were Sayori, though...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we have class! Yuri, we've been going to college philosophy for how many days now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just gave him a long stare. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Okay, you really need to come with me, Deruki. You're starting to scare me.\"</span> She continued to drag him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri! Stop!\" He tried to escape her grip but soon realized the effort was futile. Sighing, Deruki stopped resisting and walked alongside her. <i>She seems really concerned, and I don't really get what's going on. But if playing along gets her to calm down, it's probably worth it in the long run...at least, I hope...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking- and silence- Yuri spoke up.<span class=\"cgrape\"> \"S-sorry, Deruki. I'm not trying to be mean...this just isn't like you, and I want to make sure you're okay.\"</span> Her tone seemed sincere, and managed to put Deruki's mind a bit more at ease- for about a minute or two. He had been so distracted by Yuri's behavior, it was only now that he realized that they were not in fact headed towards the college campus, but now quickly approaching the entrance of the high school Yuri attended. Strangely, Monika seemed to be waiting for both of them, handing Deruki some clothes as they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I texted her ahead of time so you could get changed before class,\"</span> Yuri explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Thank me later!\"</span> Monika winked, and began pushing Deruki to what he realized was the men's bathroom. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Now, get going! The sooner we get through the day, the sooner we get our club time!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Before he even had time to think, Deruki was already inside one of the stalls, the club president nowhere to be seen. <i>Did Monika push me all the way in here?!</i> Thinking about everything that had happened to him this morning, he felt ready to freak out. \"Let me call one of my friends to help me get out of here...this might be hard to explain, but I need to at least try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he only found himself even more lost upon learning two things: One, the phone was the same model as usual, but now was a stunning pink color. Two, opening up his contacts, he found none of his college friends. Instead were a bunch of mostly random names, with three standing out: Yuri, Sayori, and Monika. \"That can't be right, I should only have Yuri's number!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more Deruki thought about it, the more it felt...natural? He could feel a pressure in his head as he tried to dwell on his time with the girls. It was like he knew them for much longer than he had thought, but the memories he had of them were still struggling to bubble to the surface. Like a voice in his head was gently telling him: <i><span class=\"cpink\">No. Not yet.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just...really tired. Or maybe, I'm lucid dreaming? Yeah, that has to be it. What other explanation is there?\" Either way, Deruki started to sense that going with the flow would calm the troubles within his mind. His eyes settled on the uniform in his hands given to him by Monika. \"I guess I'll start with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simple enough to put on. Very similar to the female uniform of the school, but swapping a blue skirt for blue dress pants, and with a red tie instead of a red ribbon. As Deruki finished putting on his blazer, he was amazed at how well the whole ensemble fit him, right down to the shoes. <i>Wow, Monika's got a real knack for guessing sizes...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Deruki left the bathroom. <i>Just get through today, and then take a nap, Deruki. It'll all be normal by tomorrow...</i></span></div></div>",

Yuri still seemed concerned but she had finally decided to let Deruki loose. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'll see you during third period, alright?\"</span> She went to leave, but not without one final turn and shout. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"S-sorry, again!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" Deruki let out a great sigh of relief. \"Well, maybe I can just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Deruuukiiii!\"</span> rang a loud voice along with a hug from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sayori?!\" But he barely had time to think as he was being pulled along for the second time this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"C'mon, we gotta get to math so we can sit together!\"</span> she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Deruki's day went by without problems, although he still felt very weird about the situation he was in. Classmates approached him like a familiar face, leaving him confused repeatedly. Teachers somehow knew his name, too. He kept running into the club girls throughout the day- sometimes sharing class with only one of them, sometimes with all three. The most frustrating part was when he had to go to PE, and the coach had insisted that he should be 'with the other freshmen playing dodgeball'. That had really gotten under his skin. <i>I hate when people treat me like some kind of little kid...</i> Lunch with the girls had calmed him down, although he did feel a little self-conscious comparing his own meal to Yuri's. While she had gotten a salad to go with some tea she had brought from home, his plate consisted of a sandwich alongside a vanilla cupcake and a stack of cookies. But as the sugar coated his tongue, Deruki found himself in a diabetic heaven. In the meantime, his vocal chords had adjusted to a significantly higher pitch. \"Mmmmmm<span class=\"cpink\">mmmmmmmm!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bliss was interrupted by a chuckle from Monika. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Enjoying the sweets, Deruki?\"</span> He blushed a bit in response. Eventually, classes had ended and Deruki happily returned to the one place in the school that made him feel at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Alright, everyone!\"</span> Monika began. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Let's take it easy again today. The nurse said Deruki was okay, but I don't want to stress him out too much just in case.\"</span> She turned towards him, a stern look on her face. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Be honest, Deruki. Did you trip and fall in the morning? Concussions are no joke!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleaaase can we just drop it already?\" Deruki was eager to move on. \"I was just groggy, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"But you forgot your uniform, and then you mentioned going to classes at college...\" </span>Yuri chimed in, beginning to worry once again. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"You must admit, it's very odd...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"College? Wow Deruki, I didn't hear that part of the story!\"</span> Sayori giggled, seemingly unphased by Deruki's possible head trauma. <span class=\"clred\">\"That's so mature of you!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I AM a college student!\" Deruki exclaimed. \"I'm working on a degree in Biology!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Now now Deruki,\"</span> Monika shook a finger while winking, <span class=\"ctan\">\"Just because you're the youngest one here doesn't mean you have to make up stories to sound older. We all like you just the way you are.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-youngest? <span class=\"cpink\">Sayori's only like, a month older than me!</span>\" Just after saying it, Deruki started to stress out a bit. <i>Wait, is that true?</i> He grabbed his wallet and pulled out an ID, depicting him in his current school uniform. Then he pulled out his driver's license: Deruki Philmore. Height: 4'11\". Age...<span class=\"cpink\">18</span>. And was his skin always this pale?! <i><span class=\"cpink\">Well, maybe don't spend all your free time reading indoors!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Welp, I wouldn't worry too much about it, Deruki!\"</span> Sayori grabbed his shoulder reassuringly. <span class=\"clred\">\"My mind's always all over the place, and I'm fine!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, yeah...\" Deruki took a moment, allowing Sayori's words to take focus over his own confused thoughts. He thought up until now that the girls were overreacting, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Okay, Deruki. I think the girls and I would agree that- at the very least- you need more rest. Right?\"</span> Monika intervened. Sayori and Yuri nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...the club-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"-will be here waiting for you tomorrow!\"</span> Monika smiled.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"For now though, your health's more important!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the convincing Deruki needed to hear. With only a simple nod of his own, he quickly made his way home and jumped into bed, ready to put this weird day behind him.</span></div></div>",

She had mentioned a few minutes ago that she had an announcement to make, and Deruki was curious. <span class=\"clred\">\"I'm happy to say that my friend MC is going to be joining the club tomorrow!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MC?\" <i>Strange nickname. Another cute girl, maybe?</i> \"What is she like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"<i>He's</i> really chill.

MC and I go back a bit, actually,\"</span> Monika confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, so another guy in the club, I guess,</i> Deruki thought. Having hung out with these girls for the past few days- <i><span class=\"cpink\">weeks? months? years?</span></i>- he was really getting used to the current group dynamic. How would another guy change that? <i>Is he really charming? Would he try and take Yuri for himself? What if-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"-and great! Looks like Deruki's volunteering!\"</span> Monika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Deruki only now realized that Sayori had been forcefully raising his hand in the air, all while looking at him with a silly grin. \"Hey! What did I just sign up for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Baking sweets to entice our new recruit, of course!\"</span> the president winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Yaaaaay!\"</span> Sayori cheered. <span class=\"clred\">\"It's been so long since last time, I can't wait to try some again! I'm sure MC will love them, too!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really good at baking, though...\" Deruki warned, a bit concerned with the sudden task thrust upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Don't sell yourself short, Deruki,\"</span> Yuri offered. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I quite enjoy everything you make.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well, if you think so Yuri, I guess I won't argue...\" Deruki didn't get where the praise was coming from, but these were confusing times anyway. <i>Yesterday I forgot I was in high school. Maybe today's just the day I forgot I was a master chef?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><i>ding</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, done baking already?\" Deruki said as he took the pan out of the oven. He was worried he'd screw this up royally, but the golden brown of the cupcakes told him otherwise. \"I can't believe I knew all the ingredients and steps...did I make these way back and just remember the recipe this whole time?\" He shrugged. \"Oh well, as long as they come out great! And now for the frosting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the cupcakes out of the pan, Deruki grabbed a piping bag full of pink frosting and started to squeeze. For some reason, he was having a hard time getting anything to come out. \"What's wrong with this thing?\" He added more force, but still no frosting would budge. \"C'mon, you stupid- <span class=\"cpink\">aah!</span>\" Deruki let out a girly scream as the piping bag popped from all the pressure, frosting flying in different directions. He took a moment to assess where it all went, sighing at the sizable mess he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, it's all over the place! Even in my hair...\" Deruki says while looking in his peripheral vision, a clump of pink entangled in his brown locks. \"I'm gonna need a shower. But first...\" With a new piping bag- that he was extra careful with- he added the pink frosting to his cupcakes. \"Hmm...it's missing something.\" Using different assortments of candy, Deruki added cat ears and eyes to each cupcake; some extra chocolate icing was used to make whiskers and mouths. \"There. Much better!\" Taking a bite from one of his cupcakes, a big grin became visible on his face. \"It's perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment to finish enjoying it. And then grabbed one more and enjoyed that one too. And then indulged in a third one. \"It's fiiine, I made a bunch...\" Deruki rationalized. His thoughts went to how the girls had always enjoyed his baking. \"Sayori's never one to turn down free food...Yuri never eats more than one or two, though. She always says this stuff goes straight to her hips.\" Deruki frowned as he looked at his own hips, prodding them after a moment. <i><span class=\"cpink\">Then how come mine are so tiny?</span></i> Deruki became a bit self-conscious after seeing them barely flaring out past his shoulders. Not to mention the only ever-so-slight pinching-in of his waist... \"Hmph. I shouldn't compare myself to her anyway. We're two different <span class=\"cpink\">gir</span>- people.\" he decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeruki took some time to clean the kitchen, finally taking a shower when everything was spotless. Afterwards while looking in the mirror, he huffed at the sight of pink still in his hair. \"Ugh, that frosting just won't come out! There's a different spot I didn't notice, too.\" He decided to try and ask his friends tomorrow for tips on washing it out. \"I'll bet the girls will get a real kick out of this...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Deruki waited for MC's arrival along with Yuri and Monika, his mind jumped to several trains of thought. He thought about when Sayori had complimented his hair earlier in the day, not realizing that it had become completely pink in addition to gaining enough length to reach his chin. <i><span class=\"clred\">\"Did you do something with your hair? It looks really cute today!\"</span></i> While thinking about it, he subconsciously brushed his bangs away from his eyes, now a much lighter color than their original brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about how embarassing it would be to see MC standing next to him, making the difference in height obvious. Which made him very aware of how he was swinging his legs back and forth as he sat in a desk, just barely too short to reach the ground. He thought about how many people might confuse him for a girl if it wasn't for his uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to the room swung open as Sayori dragged by the arm a brown-haired boy in uniform, his demeanor a stark contrast to his friend's excitement. Yuri welcomed him first, MC remaining oddly silent as she spoke calmly. Sayori introduced the two before pulling him towards Deruki. <span class=\"clred\">\"MC, this is Naruki! He's always full of energy!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruki?! Is that what Sayori called me?</i> He got a little peeved at his name being messed up. He was about to correct her, until he noticed MC staring at him, a strange look on his face. As the seconds passed, he got increasingly annoyed, but at the same time...his heart was racing? \"Okay, you can stop staring now!\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Sorry!\"</span> MC said as he finally started to speak, breaking the eye contact awkwardly. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"It's just, your eyes...they're really...pink!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruki's defenses fell, not expecting such a response. \"Well y-yeah! They're just like that, okay! You don't have to be weird about it...<span class=\"cpink\">dummy!</span>\" After he spoke, he felt like he had gone a little overboard in his response, but only saw amused reactions from the other girls. Afterwards, MC and Monika reconnected for a bit, and then all eyes were on Naruki again. <i>Oh yeah, the cupcakes!</i> Passing them out to the others, he felt confident after seeing their positive reactions with the kitty designs. It was only when he gave one to MC that he started getting concerned, sneaking glances at his face for the first signs of a smile. <i>Why do I feel so nervous? <span class=\"cpink\">It's not like I care what he thinks or anything...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his fear was unfounded as MC looked happy. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Wow, these are really good. Thanks, Naruki.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruki hid his own satisfied look from MC, giving a mild response. \"Cool. You're welcome.\" But at the same time, he felt his heart skip a beat. <i>He likes them!</i> Yuri followed up by providing tea, after which Monika spoke for a bit about the club's foundation and what she hoped to get out of it. Soon enough Yuri had asked what kind of literature MC was interested in, and Naruki noticed him getting quiet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"...manga,\"</span> he mumbled after a few seconds, catching Naruki's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did he say...? No <span class=\"cpink\">Naruki</span>, don't bring it up just yet. You'll sound like a total weirdo if you start bragging about <span class=\"cpink\">your giant manga collection!</span> </i>When he returned his attention to the conversation, Yuri was talking about her interest in horror. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Ugh, I hate horror...\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh, really?\"</span> Yuri seemed disheartened. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"You seemed interested last week...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruki internally facepalmed. <i>You idiot! How are you ever going to date Yuri saying things like that?</i> But despite that lingering desire- which he hadn't realized was beginning to fade- he still felt completely put-off by the types of novels she read. \"Well, I was exaggerating. I don't really <i>hate</i> horror, I just prefer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"...cute things?\"</span> Monika finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I didn't say that!\" Naruki pouted. The last thing he wanted was to sound like a child in front of the new club member. <i>I like mature things!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Aww! Your reaction makes you look even cuter!\"</span> Sayori gushed, surprising Naruki with an affectionate hug from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruki was getting redder by the second, the full attention and teasing by the girls too much for him to handle. <b><span class=\"cpink\">\"I'm not cute!!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Sorry Naruki, I can't help it! Ehehehe~\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Now now, everyone!\"</span> Monika interrupted. <span class=\"ctan\">\"It's getting pretty late, so before we all go, I came up with a good exercise to let everyone get comfortable with each other. Let's write a poem and share them tomorrow!\"</span> The reactions of the other club members were mixed, but nobody seemed to want to argue. Yuri and Naruki walked home, while Sayori dragged MC with her. Before he knew it, Naruki found himself in his pajamas, staring at the paper on his desk, completely lost as to what to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting pretty late...how the heck do I even get started?\" he pondered, pen tapping repeatedly to his chin. He considered a few things: what kind of people the other club members were, what writing style were they likely to use, how he could stand out from the others while still making the poem his own. \"What topic to pick...\" some parts of his old mind helped to ground him. \"Biology...I like animals. Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

You turned to your side and recognized that you were no longer in your own room, but someone else\u2019s room, from what you could see from where you were you saw a cow plushie, a desk, and a large dresser that had a distinct crafting style that did not look at all similar to the one you had at your house.

You get to scrubbing your messy hair with shampoo, no time was left to style or put conditioner in it so you just flail around trying to scrub your strawberry-blonde locks as you reach for the soap with one hand and scrubbed your hair with the other hand. You scrub from top to bottom, you rubbed the soap bar against your face with a firm but not forceful grip across your cheeks and scrubbed behind your ears, you got down to the chest area to clean your ample bosom as you went in between, on the sides, and on the front to clean. You reach the midsection and wave the bar of soap across the smooth surface of your midriff which gave off a small growl as you have not eaten breakfast yet, your back is next and it takes little time to clean as you lock your arms behind you to go over it with efficiency. You go over your long legs as fast as you can with the bar of soap, making sure to get your underarms and feet done as well before you quickly went over your nether regions and bolted out of the shower to your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 minutes, that's a decent time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to your room and open the dres-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the dresser to find a length of rope inside of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head slightly and pull out some white socks, white slippers, white panties with pink stripes, a dress shirt, and a blazer to put on quickly and try to forget what you saw in the dresser. It's time to get some breakfast, and you don't have any time, so you resolve to just grabbing a bottled water and making some toast for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had all taken place within 10 minutes, and now you were flailing your arms about in the air much like the real Sayori running towards a young man with black hair and black eyes looking blankly at you with an annoyed expression, you identified immediately as MC. Now you're confronted with an option, would it be better to introduce yourself as Sayori or admit to being someone else?<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Somehow she felt that her memory from her last life was slipping away from her, as she became more embedded into the code of the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they was in the middle of walking Sayori asked, \"So, you said that you would like to join a club... So how about the literature club? You did say that you would join.\" At this point the words just came naturally, whether she wanted to say them or not, but she had a strange sensation that made her want to ask the questions.<br>\r\n \"Did I? Well, I guess that there's no harm in harm in trying it...\"<br>\r\n \"Yay!\" She had now started to think that she had always been Sayori, and was forgetting that she was in a game, all of it felt real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trapped forever...</span></div></div>",
