The \"mouse\" of the school. She was shy. She didn't care if she talked to anybody, she just wanted to talk to her friends. And there was nothing to say. There was definately nothing to say. All of this was on Emma's mind when she realized she was the only one home in the house.</span></div></div>",

In fact, she begins to realize that her breasts are probably the largest in her grade. Her right hand then moves down to her shorts and she pulls them down slowly, followed shortly by her panties. \"I wonder what it would feel like to be fucked by a big cock...\" She thought to herself. She begins to pull the banana out of her throat, thick trings of saliva connect the banana to her mouth. She uses her right hand to rub her saliva into the banana, completely lubing it up. As she moves the banana to her warm sex, she begins to wonder why no boys talk to her. \"I'm sure that I could geta date with someone... especialy that new kid Dallas... If only I wasn't so shy...\" Just as she touches the banana to her clit, the phone starts to ring. nervously, she pulls her shorts and panties up quickly, and looks at the caller id.

Emma often zones out whenever she talks to Daniella, because she has a tendency to just rattle on about the most insignificant things.

I try to make friendly conversation and all you can do is isolate yourself even further from the people around you. They want to be your friends,\u201d his tone caught Emma off guard.
