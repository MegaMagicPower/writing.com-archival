She looked around at her laboratory, the hall sported a collection of hairbrained gadgets and gizmos, many of which she'd made on a whim. Whilst it was nice that the world wasn't at stake and she had enough time for her inventions, things had gotten relatively dull for the genius inventor. Her husband and son spent most of their time training, even if there wasn't an incoming threat it was something that most of her social circle engaged in. Goku, Vegeta, Krillin... and even Yamcha, seemed to spend every free moment trying to hit something harder. All of them had been doing it for years, decades even, and made significant progress. Even her own son was powerful enough to destroy the creeps that she'd seen on Namek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got to enjoy it, otherwise they wouldn't bother.\" Bulma pondered, resting back on her desk. \"Maybe there's more to it than I thought? I'm already the smartest woman on Earth... maybe this would be a change of pace for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be easy by any means, the others had a massive headstart on her, and her own human biology was another limit - the likes of Krillin and Tien had fallen far behind even with dedication. Whatver her approach, she'd need to be clever and, thankfully, she had the brains to do it. None of the others could match her in terms of technology. Failing that, there was a certain magical dragon she could ask for a hand... so she had options. </span></div></div>",

Vegeta\u2019s saiyan armour, it\u2019s bound to be full of his sweat or maybe even hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired genius left her lab to find any of Vegeta\u2019s worn out armours and luckily, she knew how much of a habit it is for her husband to go so many of them after tearing apart or ruining them from each battle he has had with them. Eventually, she found one in the gravity chamber and as she predicted it was drenched with some sweat and some pieces of his hair was caught by the collar of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Bulma beamed happily, as she collected what she needed and bolted off to her laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got the materials needed, Bulma darted straight to her computer in search of the records of past experiments that had anything to do with DNA-splicing. It was best to check if she had a pre-existing one already back up in her files; before attempting to make one from scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching many folders from past projects, Bulma eventually found something. A past project that was perfect to solve the situation at hand. Accessing the files, Bulma discovered an abandoned project designed to turn a inject DNA from different species into humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so perfect, it's unbelievable. I never imagined this experiment would come in handy someday,\u201d Bulma rejoiced happily. \u201cGood thing a genius such as myself saved the data, I never would've thought that this would be so beneficial, why did I even abandon it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraising herself and babbled on and on, Bulma soon stopped and got straight to work in creating this forgotten project of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn roughly two hours, she managed to construct the machine from the blueprints she found from the data; as Bulma stood back and gazed upon awe of her crafty work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is,\" Bulma said with great pride. \"Saiya-Generator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large machine that had a large monitor and keyboard that was hooked up a giant satellite dish that was facing down towards the ground. Beside the monitor was a small glass container, where Bulma stored Vegeta\u2019s DNA samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma then prepared the specs and calculations on the monitors. Soon the machine started to fire up, making a loud ringing sound, as green energy started building upon inside. Bulma then quickly away from the monitor and stood where the satellite dish was going to fire; as she saw the tip of building up a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, the blunette was shot by a giant bright beam of emerald shimmering, as she felt the effects of the generator's energy tingling her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma began to grunt and moan as she felt her muscles stretch and harden. Her bones becoming stronger and gaining more layers, so they could withstand stronger forces or attacks. As Bulma danced around from the pains and odd pleasure, a lump started to grow above her ass until it burst out of her blue jeans. A long blue tail popped out from her clothes, waving around above her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam soon started to slowly fade away, as Bulma was left huffing and panting from the tiresome changes that have been done to her. Bulma leaned over and looked down at herself, as she felt...</div></span></div></div>",

It's always possible that either of the two options could fail thanks to any number of immune system responses her body might have, but altering herself on the genetic level only holds the weight that what she does is permanent... and considering such a thing is exactly what she wants, it's not as if that's a downside, now is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Bulma quickly begins to scrawl down the various theoretical ways she would have to alter her DNA in order to garner what she's looking for, which is marginally increased body durability and stamina, and a healthy promotion of muscle growth through altering her metabolism and appetite. By increasing her durability and stamina, she'll have an edge on the humans since she can push her body far harder for much longer during trianing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sure, she may not be able to challenge the likes of a Super Saiyan, but it's not like she can't coerce Goku into teaching her the Kaio-Ken technique if she's really strapped for power at that point. Regardless, she eventually has a very rough idea of what she has to do to her genetics, and with that she decides to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Who knew I'd ever use this old thing again.\" Bulma pulls a tarp off of a tall object in the back of her lab, coughing and choking a little as dust fills the air. When the dust clears, she's face to face with some sort of walk-in chamber. \"My old genetic re-sequencer, my pride and joy.\" You see, Bulma has long ago cracked the ability to alter genetic code, but when she took some time to consider the implications, the scientist simply scrapped the project, kept it unknown, and stowed the machine away never to be used again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>'Now I'm planning to use this for the very reason I scrapped it... its ability to produce soldiers that surpass the likes of our current superhuman fighters...'</i> Really, Bulma can't help but feel proud of this! Who knows, maybe she'll play with the portion of genetics that controls aging as well. Some elongated youth never hurt anybody, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The blue-haired genius clears the area around the sequencer, hooking it up to the water, coolant, and exhaust pipes that go through the entire building. Next she runs a quick diagnostic test just to make sure everything is in working order. Before long, the machine is on and ready, and Bulma is entering the alterations she'll need done to get genetic code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Aaaaand there we <i>go!</i>\" With a press of the Enter button, the machine confirms the changes, and the door to enter it opens. Bulma steps in, clad in a skintight black bodysuit, the bodysuit littered with small holes. Standing dead center in the middle of the small chamber, the door seals shut and the old re-sequencer begins to whir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The lights within go from normal to black lights, and small needles extend from every wall. Shivers run down Bulma's spine as each needle pokes into one of the many holes in the suit, while many needles go directly into her bare skin from the neck up. Small injections are occasionally let out, as the light changes gradually between different types of mild radiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It feels like an eternity for Bulma, but soon all the needles retract, and the machine whirs to a stop. The door opens and Bulma steps out... looking down at herself, Bulma feels very...</span></div></div>",

Sleepily, she pulled herself from her bed and made her way to the bathroom to get ready for her morning routine. As she undressed in the bathroom, she glanced into the mirror with a bit of a smug look. The crime fighting and training with Gohan really did wonders on her figure. A trim, fit, stomach with a few hints of abs, perky breasts, and a nice firm butt.. all of it came packaged nicely together onto her svelte frame. However, Videl returned to her routine as quickly as she had deviated from it. She couldn't really afford to spend the entirety of the day just looking at herself in the mirror. She had training to do! After an hour or so, Videl emerged from her room dressed in her usual gym outfit. Ever since she graduated from Orange Star High, training has been her best way to pass the time. As much as she hated the grueling schedule, it paid off. At least she had fun friends to do it with, like Erasa and Gohan. Speaking of which, she should probably message one of them to let them know she's on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel bounced downstairs and made her way to the front door before pausing.

Sitting atop the kitchen table is a large feast, comparable to the amount of food present during breakfast at Chi-Chi's house. Approaching the table, she just barely makes out the poofy afro of her father from behind it. \"D-dad? What is all this?\" From behind the table, Hercule pops out in a messy apron, covered in flower and other such edible materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good morning, sweet pea!\" He's practically beaming, no doubt proud of the feast that he's assembled. \"I remembered this morning when I got back from my jog that we'd never properly celebrated your graduation, so I figured I knew just the way to do it!\" The burly man gestures to the table, which is filled completely with various foods. \"So I spent the whole morning cooking all of your favorite foods as best as I could! With the help of Buu, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Buu smiles as wide as Hercule, if not wider. Smoke wafts from the antenna on his head, so it's fairly obvious there's a bit of this that was just candy beamed to completion. Regardless, Videl can't help but smile at the thought the two put into it. \"Thank you daddy, thank you Buu!\" She gives them both a hug, and looks to the food.

The main idea is weight gain though, so please stick to that. I'd prefer you stray away from focusing on scat and watersports, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Beyond that, there are no rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The methods of gain are really up to you. Stay consistent with the preceding chapters if you can, though. There are always going to be more choices so you'll have a chance to break off sooner rather than later. I hope you enjoy!</td>",
