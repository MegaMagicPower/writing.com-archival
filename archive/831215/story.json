I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this in no time! \u201c With enthusiastic strides, Gomez began to pace back and forth through the room. \u201cWhere should I begin... I could get a fingerprint analysis! Or maybe there\u2019s some clue to be found in that armor. The helmet looks like Prussian cavalry armor -except that it has a bellows visor, of course- but then there\u2019s that cuirass..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Fester cut in. Gomez stopped in his tracks, interrupted, to hear the suggestion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take off his helmet and see if any of us recognize him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrilliant idea, Old Man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho could that be?\u201d Morticia wondered, taking a step toward the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps another piece of the puzzle!\u201d Gomez replied, already heading out of the room. He ran down the stairs just in time to see Lurch open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d came a woman\u2019s surprised voice. \u201c<i>Please</i> tell me <i>you\u2019re</i> not Gomez Addams!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurch groaned and then motioned for the woman to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Lurch, old man,\u201d Gomez laughed. \u201cIs it really <i> that</i> bad to be mistaken for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurch turned to Gomez and let out a long, low groan before turning back to close the door. Gomez frowned at the response: apparently it <i>was</i> that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Mistaken for you\u2019? Then you must be Mr. Addams!\u201d The young woman was tall and shapely. Her tanned skin contrasted with her long, blond hair and the pearly white teeth of her broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt your service.\u201d Gomez bowed his head in a polite greeting. For Addams men, chivalry wasn\u2019t dead - even in times when an ugly duckling came knocking at their doors. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m... Oh! I\u2019m sorry.  My name is Glenda Goodman. I sell perfumes and colognes... But I... That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here today. You see, I\u2019m having some car problems and was hoping I could use your phone...\u201d The poor girl seemed very nervous. Gomez sympathised for her; she had probably led a very hard life, being as unsightly as she was. It had clearly damaged her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy certainly, Ms. Goodman. Just follow me.\u201d After leading his visitor to the phone, Gomez spotted Morticia and Fester, both quietly observing the young women from the top of the stairs. He scaled the steps and began explaining the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of her, Gomez. You\u2019d better keep an eye one her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Fester,\u201d Morticia scolded. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you can,\u201d Fester insisted. \u201cRemember that book I bought about the black plague? The reason I picked it out in the first place was the picture of the big rat on the cover!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia considered Fester\u2019s comment. He did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Fester,\u201d Gomez assured. He looked down the stairwell at his visitor. \u201cShe won\u2019t be here long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia sighed. \u201cVery well, Darling. I think I\u2019ll go help the children. They\u2019re talking about stating a lemonade stand. Apparently they\u2019ve been experimenting with ingredients.\u201d She turned and, with her normal grace, headed down the hallway. Fester sent a sneer down the stairs at the young women, before following after Mortica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Addams?\u201d Ms. Goodman called.  Gomez heard the sound of the phone receiver being put down and decided it was time to return downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have any luck?\u201d He asked in his usual, charming manner. He certainly hoped she had had luck. She didn\u2019t seem to hold any clues for his investigation and the sooner she left, the sooner he'd be able to get back to solving the mystery. Not to mention the prospect of finally beginning funeral arrangements!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. AAA is sending someone to help me right away.\u201d She smiled and stepped in closer to Gomez. \u201c...I don\u2019t know how to repay you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the use of my phone?\u201d He frowned and leaned back. With the young lady drawing nearer, he couldn\u2019t help but notice how rosy and pink her cheeks were... The poor girl was truly hideous. It took all of his willpower to hold back a cringe.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFor that and... other things,\u201d she said in a deep voice, still drawing closer. \u201cOh, I know how I can repay you!\u201d She was now only inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d asked Gomez in a hoarse voice. He was beginning to wish he\u2019d heeded Fester\u2019s warnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-hu.\u201d Suddenly, she lifted a large briefcase up in front of Gomez\u2019s face. \u201cPerfume!\u201d She shifted to rest her case on a nearby table and popped open the case\u2019s top. \u201cI\u2019ll let you pick out a bottle - for free. It would make a great gift for your wife!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGomez smiled, glad to once again have some distance between himself and the young woman. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I won\u2019t take 'no' for an answer! Here, come try a sample of a few of our most popular fragrances.\u201d She quickly picked out two decorative bottles. One was a lush deep color that resembled black but was actually a subtle lace of reds and purples. The second bottle was very different: a bright, cheery pink color that closely resembled at the same time both cotton candy and Ms. Goodman\u2019s rosy cheeks. \u201cWhich one would you like to try?\u201d she asked.</span></div></div>",

You were neither gay nor straight before now, being simply uninterested in anyone in your dull, sunny town. When you saw that vision of radiant darkness giving a report on the joys of poison in literature, you just had to have her. It was like a lightning bolt to the head, and almost as much fun.</span></div></div>",

It was slightly different though arm restraints that held them upwards, exposing your underarms and any other part of your body you want to hide. Not to mention you were already stripped of all your clothing prior to meeting Uncle Fester. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Completely vulnerable, you sat there with Fester\u2019s electrodes attacked to your soft, pink nipples, and to the smooth, creamy soles of your feet. You had no idea what was in store for you but you were certain you weren\u2019t going to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSoooo you thought you could spy on us huh?\u201d Questioned fester. <br>\r\nBefore you could even try to plead your innocence again, Fester cut you off, \u201cThought you could fool us and gain our trust, only to betray us and take everything from us?\u201d<br>\r\nYou were frightened and confused. \u2018Why didn\u2019t I work a different block\u2019 you thought to yourself with remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually my dear spy, that was a GREAT plan, I quite like it.\u201d Uncle Fester said, with seemingly genuine glee. \u201cBut you, my dear spy, messed with the WRONG family.\u201d Said Fester, making a complete 180 in tone from his prior statement. <br>\r\n        You began to worry even more, from his now grim and irritated visage. What was he going to do to you?? Were you going to be hurt?? Or even worse DIE?!?!? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t have to question much longer for Uncle Fester was preparing for you. He looked you up and down, admiring your young, muscular physic. Luckily for you, very well endowed, although this all began to give you a twinge of embarrassment to go with you anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear spy\u201d began Fester. \u201cDid you know that we Addams don\u2019t take too well to spays?\u201d The question was rhetorical for he soon continued his speech to you. Though he had begun circling you bound figure, every now and then getting REAL familiar with his enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You were quite muscular for just a newspaper boy. You had well defined pecs, nice toned arms, and even a SHREDDED set of abs. All of this being taken in by Uncle Fester, who seemed almost complete with his examination. He then stopped for a second by your right exposed armpit, he stared at it quite intently for a moment. That was before he dug his finger into slightly sweaty hallow. You INSTANTLY reacted, trying to, futilely, squirm away from his thick probing fingers. Uncle Fester had gotten exactly what he was hoping for out of you, it even fueled his flames and put him in a playful mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          He went behind you once more, not once stopping his wiggling fingers, he then proceeded to open his mouth into a big goofy smile, lowering his tongue towards you. While this distracted you he readied his other hand near your left side. IN AN INSTANT, without warning, Fester dove his second hand into your exposed left arm pit, doubling what you were already feeling. Uncle was not done with his \u201cexamination\u201d tho as he proceeded to continue his tongues trajectory and RAVISHED your right ear, slobbering all over it just to make you even more uncomfortable than you already were, all while his fingers reached a new speed and force in your armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          This went on for another minute\u2014 or ten, before he let up and went back to he was saying.<br>\r\n\u201cWell my dear spy, now that we\u2019ve had our fun I can continue to how you must be dealt with,\u201d Fester now back to his menacing form. \u201cAs I was saying we Addams don\u2019t like spies very much,\u201d he picked up a small grey apparatus with a lever that jutted out from it. \u201cAnd do you know what we do to spies?\u201d  Asked Uncle Fester as he made eye contact with you again. This time you split eye contact to follow the wires that were attached apparatus lead. Up they trailed, coming in closer and closer in your direction, when you finally connected the wires with the same as those of the electrodes attached to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            You gulped, now understanding what was about to happen. You pleaded in your head but sadly all you could whimper our was, \u201c....please not again....\u201d  <br>\r\n             Uncle Fester replied to you begging face and anxious tone with a BIG GOOFY GRIN again as he flipped the lever to ON.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got to look at the shrunked little guys and they looked fantastic. One guy was painted to look like a banana and he actually did. Another kind of chubby guy actually had been changed into a tomato, one into a baked and served turkey and so on. They all looked terrified. Wednesday explained how they hadn't exactly volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked me to get undressed so she could start shaving me. I didn't want to be shaved, but she was one of my best friends and good actor would do almost everything for his part, so I got undressed in front Wednesday. You're underwear too, Wednesday blushed. My god, was this going to be a totally nude one? She said that after she painted me I would get to wear a string, but she had to paint me first. So I undressed and then she took me to a shower. She shaved me from top to bottom and not one hair was left on my body. Not a single one. I was smooth all over and actually getting quite excited because of it. Wednesday saw my nude and blushed, smiling she looked away but didn't say a thing. I had to shower but she only had cold water,  after I dried myself I went back into her studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally told me her plan. She was going to paint me into a hotdog. I have seen some things like that before so I guessed I had to curl up and Wednesday would paint the bread and the sausage on my back, but that was not his plan. She told me I would be painted like a sausage and put in a bread that would fit a sausage my size. I was amazed that she would make bread that big just for this occasion, especially if she was going to shrink me, but I guess I was wrong there. So she put me in place and started painting.Wednesday's strong yet soft hands were all over me, while she painted me all over. her brush went over over and over again and making me hotdog-brown all over. It took her quite a while to cover my entire body, but then finally she said she was finished and put me in the room with the other art subjects to dry. I was her last piece and tomorrow the exhibition would start. Tomorrow? I asked, but then I discovered that I couldn't move my body anymore. Hey Wednesday, what has happened to me? I can't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's normal, she said. She needed the time and that's why she put something in the paint to make me and the others incapable of moving, because she couldn't do it just in the morning and have us on display in the evening. She than sprinkled some sort of dust on me and I started to shrink. Pretty soon I was staring up at my giant friend. She than smiled, turned and left<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I just stood there in a dark corner, watching all the other boys.</span></div></div>",

She sprayed something on me and with that I could move again. It was just for a little while, she said, because she had to make sure I could get in my right position just before the exhibition would start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the spray would dry I would be frozen again. I just let her carry and she brought me to a table on which was a huge silver plate with an even bigger bun on it. She asked me to lay down on it and so I did. I lay on my side with my back on the outside, cause people weren't supposed to see my face, arms and other bodyfeatures, I had to look like a real hotdog. At least as much as a human like me could look like one. Just when I found the right position the spray started to dry and I couldn't move again. She told me that I looked perfect and then she put the upperpart of the bread on top of me, after she added real ketchup and mustard so I would look right to the visitors. She then moved away from me and placed all the others in the room for display. With that we headed off to the contest. It was crammed to the brim with freaky looking people. I was scared as giant faces leered down at me. Was this a mistake coming here? Guests were amazed about the work Wednesday had done. Ah's and Oh's were all around me and I could even feel people touch me to see if I was real. They said I even felt like a sausage, which was kind of weird cause I just was human with a little paint and I didn't know they were alowed to touch me. But I could't move or speak anymore, so even the coldest hands didn't get a reaction from me. </span></div></div>",

You tried to sit up but  a sharp pain throughout your body forced you to lay back down.

Wednesday noticed your expression and frowned. \"I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now, my angered friend.\" she said, raising a dramatic hand to her forehead. \"Betrayed by your best friend, painted to look like a hot dog, made unable to move, placed in a bun and coved with condiments only to be served as a snack at a family party and eaten alive!\" she let out a longing sigh, lowering her hand. \"How I envy you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some strange reason, all of your anger melted and you laughed out loud until the sharp pains inside of you from being chewed up forced you to stop. \"I... It was a unique experience.\" you said painfully. \"Um... I'm not used to such pains, though, can you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWednesday eyes suddenly widened as she realized that you were not actually enjoying your pain and sprinkled some powder onto you, causing the pain to cease. \"Please forgive me, my mortal friend.\" she said. \"I momentarily forgot that you are not an Addams.\" she paused, grinning. \"However, as you had won first prize, I have been given permission to give you a one time offer to become a member of the Addams family clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, you want to 'adopt' me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWednesday nodded, her eyes widening more with excitement. \"It's very rare that a person as young as you is given this most generous offer.\" she said. \"Also, this is the first time I had been given the honor of making a person a member of the family.\" she hugged you to the point you swore you heard a few ribs crack. \"Oh, please say yes, my beloved friend and hopeful sibling! It would mean the world to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of my original family?\" you asked, worried. \"They might fight you, knowing that you are taking me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWednesday smiled. \"They already think you are dead and buried.\" she replied. \"If you agree to become one of us, you will live on as a new family member of my choice, including a family pet or a new favorite living doll.\" she then shrugged. \"If you refuse, well, it was nice knowing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not much of a choice, unless Wednesday was bluffing.

You barely have time to question it before you hear the familiar voice of the Addam's oldest child Pugsley talking to his father.<br>\r\n\"Wow, pops, we're really gonna eat somebody?\"<br>\r\n\"Not we, my boy, you.\" Gomez says proudly as he leads his son into the kitchen \"It's an Addams tradition for a boy your age. You need to get a taste for blood like the rest of the Addam's men\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and it'll put some meat on your bones!\" Uncle Fester chimes in as the men turn the corner to where you can see them, and they can see you.<br>\r\n\"WOW, I know him from school, he's always fallowing me home and stuff.\"Pugsley says with a sinister smile that scares you, your young bare body shivering more from fear than coldness now.<br>\r\n\"Had Lurch grab him before he took your mother and Wednesday out to the shopping mall for their girl time. What better first meal,\" Gomez explains, walking over and giving you a swat on the butt that makes you whimper \"But he's not ready yet, first he needs to be prepared. Fester, you get started on the stuffing, I'll do the garnish\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Gomez.\" Uncle Fester replies before going over and starting to mix together an odd mush in a large bowl. Pugsley walks over and runs a hand over your butt cheek and up your back, making you shudder and cry out for help before an arm reaches out of a nearby box and shoves an apple in your mouth<br>\r\n\"Thanks Thing.\" Pugsley chuckles as the hand motions in response before slipping back into the box and closing the hinged lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further adieu, Pugsley pulls a stool over and hits to watch his father start slicing onions potatoes and veggies into a large roasting pan. He then lifts you and sets you into it on your knees and chest. You cry muffledly through the apple, but they ignore it. Gomez opens the box the hand reached out of before and drops in a pineapple. there's a moment wet cutting sound before several large pineapple slices flew out of the box and landed in a line down your back, which forks to the last two land on head butt cheek.<br>\r\n\"Good show, Thing old man!\" Gomez calls, looking into the box before being squirted in the face with pineapple juice and pulp, which he just wipes away with a chuckle as the box's lid closes \"That sneaky little scamp.\"<br>\r\n\"So, is he ready yet, Pop?\" Pugsley asks with a tone of excitement that makes you whimper<br>\r\n\"Not yet! We still gotta stuff 'em\" Fester replies as he walks up behind you and pulls up his sleeve before burying a handful of the warm much he'd made into your exposed rear. You cry out into the apple gagging you as he pulls his hand out and stuffs in another handful. and another, packing it in good and tight and till Gomez stops him.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Fester, slow down. You don't want to poor lad. Not yet anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I got a little caught up in the moment\" Fest says with a cheeky grin before stuffing a large root vegetable into your hole, keeping the stuffing from being pushed out. You look around nervously before notice Pugsley drooling over your naked form \"Is he ready now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, son. We've still gotta roast him in the oven.\" Gomez says, reaching up and turning the dial of the large appliance to Preheat.<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on Gomez, let the kid have a little fun.\" Fester eggs him on a bit \"nothin tastes better than a boy swallowed whole.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gomez smiles and offers a cheery \"Atta boy\" as his son opens the oven door and slides his male classmate inside. It was easily big enough, you didn't even touch the sides. You barely have time to adjust to the heat beginning to prickly your skin before Pugsley slams the door on you, smirking as he watches you through the window, illuminated only by the burning hot coils roasting your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and writhe as the heat washes over you, making you sweat all over, which mixes with the pineapple juice and starts to sizzle. You can feel your skin tighten and darken, the stuffing in your butt expanding and making you feel even fuller as you roast alive. All the while, the Addams boy you thought was sorta cool watched you with a sadistic glee as you browned like a thanksgiving turkey. The minute feel like hours, but after about an hour, you're still conscious enough to see Gomez open the oven door to squirt a brown sauce over you from a turkey baster. He wets your entire body before closing the door again. The sauce sizzles on your skin just like your sweat and the pineapples, but you can barely feel it. This process would repeat every hour until you were fully roasted and all but numb. You questioned how you were alive and conscious at this point, but you don't have much time before Uncle Fester pulls your golden brown body out of the oven and scoops you out onto a silver platter. <br>\r\n\"One last thing\" The mischievous bald man says in an almost sing-song tone as he slips a pair of paper turkey frills onto your ankles before serving you to his nephew.<br>\r\n\"Are the booties really necessary, Fester?\" Gomez asks, tapping his chin as he looked over the roast boy.<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" He replies, before popping an extra one in his mouth and munching on it \"plus they taste pretty good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again find yourself staring down a ravenous Pugsley and it looks like you're lunch.
