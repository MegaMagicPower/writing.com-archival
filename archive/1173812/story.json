Before you can question the matter even further You see a figure riding toward you in the distance. You quickly notice him and wave him over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Another one\" You grunt at your brother once he's close enough to hear. Your brother, Barkroot, lowers himself from the Worg, which is a large Hyena like beast, that he had been riding on and walks over to the thing at your feet. He nods at you but doesn't seem as concerned about this creature as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Stranger at village. He come for you.\" Your brother reports. You look at Barkroot cautiously wondering what this man could want with you. \"Skin this,\" you point at the dead beast \"bring back to village.\" At that you get back up onto your own Worg and start to travel to your village.

Almost everyone in the tribe thought that these stories were all false since a seer had not been seen in hundreds of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell more.\" you grunt at the seer. A weak smile appears on the man's face. \"Ten will rise before the fall. Save your blood and all will drown.\" With each word, the old man visibly became weaker and all he gave you was more riddles.  \"You speak of beasts I killed?\" There had been ten of them. But that hadn't explained anything about what he meant about your blood, unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around before the ancient man can speak. Could your brother be in danger? You rush to your Worg jumping onto his back, the creature giving a squeal of surprise. It doesn't take you long before you have it under control and it's flying across the hilly plains your tribe inhabits. As you approach the spot you had left Barkroot you see him engaged in battle with several men clad in the unnatural grey skins of their people. You yell out a battle roar as you push your Worg faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are four of these intruders fighting your brother, it looks like your brother had already downed two of them, but his Worg already lay dead. You could jump off your Worg and have him keep two of them busy while you fight the other two or you could try to engage all four while mounted on top of your creature. </span></div></div>",

You retrieve your Worg where you had tied him up, and head back to where you had left your brother this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrive it's dark, so it isn't until you almost trample over your brother that you see him.

How could this have happened? You immediately think back to the decrepit man's words 'All you love will fall'  Did that madman place a curse on you? It seemed foolish to believe that something like that could even happen but his words still haunted you. You continue to look around where your brother had been slain, and find footprints leading in the opposite direction that the man had left your village.

It was hard to tell what exactly had happened to him, but you could see spots where blood had soaked through the bandages he wore. \"What you want?\" You commanded the man. He continued to look at you with a dull gaze as he spoke \"There are beasts,\" His voice sounded raspy and anguished \"They've been attacking my town nightly. At first they weren't so bad, but their numbers kept growing. My companions and I came here to get help. I had been injured a couple nights ago and so I had been excused from keeping watch. When I woke up this Morning, they were all gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't move your eyes from the man as he tells his story.

On the other hand it might be worth it to scout that way so you can learn about the enemy.

If you go now... you may be able to save some of them before its too late.\" A few moments passed as you turned away called one of your fellows to come to the door.

Probably dangerious.\" Your brother says as you and him take the lead in front of the others.

You were Perry's age then and also had the job of being squire to one of your father's dearest friends, only because your father had perished two years before that in a battle with the Outlaws of Namyn. You also remember the look on your mother's face as you left the castle to battle, and possibly your doom. Your mother had looked nothing like Perry's had. Yours had a stern face that was weathered by years of toil and service. She was happy to send her son to serve the king. She would never forget to remind you that if you had no way of surviving then fight to your last and die a good, honorable death.<br>\r\n                       These thoughts are pushed away as Perry's mother throws herself into your chest and gives you a vice like hug.<br>\r\n                        \"Take care of my boy, please!

Surprised and stunned Sir Henri stumble back a couple of steps before coming crashing down to his back. Gasping for air he coughs violently as he rolls over to a fetal position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clisten, if I see you on the battle field run..

You then eat your dinner and relax in your newly built shelter contemplating the good taste of your meal. For one thing it was a change from the seafood that you were used to eating while at sea, but it also sucked that your former crew threw off the plank because they wanted your first mate Amelia Sharp to be captain instead of you.

After the acolytes finish the chant the acolytes' souls are absorbed by the statue. The goddess then comes to life. She then wrecks havoc on the island that you are on.

Over the years, the forest has become your home, and you feel a certain responsibility to know what might be disturbing its creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first light, you gather your few belongings and set out to the west, the rising sun at your back.  This has always been your favorite time of the day, especially at the start of a journey; the forest is more alive than usual, and the world just seems so alight with possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a creek, you skip from stone to stone, taking the familiar path to the opposite bank.  You love the forest, yet...the last few years have been lonely ones.  There is always an animal willing to talk, but they can be so different from you.  They generally live on impulse, spending little time on emotion, their only goal to survive. Often you find yourself longing for human company. But you always shake those thoughts out of your head...you lost that chance long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk until noon and come to a halt beneath a patch of wizened apple trees.  Relieved that you will not have to hunt (it is so hard  to kill something when you have spoken to it, seen inside its mind...), you reach for the lowest branch and swing yourself up.  The best fruit is always found on the topmost branches, as the lower ones were often missing a bite or two due to hungry deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not until you reach the top that you hear the sound of a rough voice carrying up from below.  You stop, midreach for an apple. That was no voice of a badger or bear. It was human.

After a moment, it becomes clear that there is no one else in a near vicinity. Climbing down a ways, you notice that he is still breathing. You freeze again, wondering if it is a trap. You hear the branch you are holding onto crack, and you quickly hurry down. When you get to the bottom, you move to stand over the man. The wound isn't large, but it is deep. You kneel down and shake him gently, and he groans a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You ask, not sure if he could respond. It is still worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nath- Nathaniel Horsemaster\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Can you communicate with animals too?\" Not the best question to have asked in this situation, but spending so long with animals, most of which are too-the-point creatures, can make someone like you somewhat anti-social and socially awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asks as he tries to sit up. His eyes are glazed over. You wonder what could have done something like this, when you see a sword laying on the ground a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. What did this to you?\" You ask as you reach for the sword. It has not been bloodied in any way, and it leads you to believe that the thing that attacked him attacked swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I can't describe it very well... It was large, the size of a bear, yet more like a wolf... If you had a piece of parchment, I could possibly draw it... Once my hand stops shaking.\" You help him up and lead him to your campsite. You always keep some medical supplies, just in case, but in a situation like this, you have hardly any experience. Luckily, he knows what to do. Once his wound is bound, you clear some of the mud off a nearby boulder, and give him a sharp rock to draw with. You never kept parchment or charcoal with you. There wasn't much use for it out here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts drawing. You watch as a head takes form, then, from the head, a wide, short body, then a long somewhat fluffy tail. You leave him there to finish. You have apples to collect for lunch. When you return, he has finished the drawing and is now asleep against an old rotten log. The drawing is a good one, quite detailed. It looks like a large wolverine, with beady little eyes, bear-like ears, and long thick hairs along it's back. Like a hyena's. Overall, terrifying. You silently hope that you never run into this beast. It isn't a battle you are sure you could win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfternoon is edging on to evening, so you decide to try and get some sleep. You lay down under a rock outcropping, and close your eyes. When you open them again, it is bright out. You look around, trying to figure out where you are. You remember, and you look over to where the man is sitting, leaning against the log. He has drawn more things around the wolverthing (that's what you decided to call it) and is currently drawing a very realistic apple tree next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good drawing.\" You say. He jumps, startled, and look up at you. He has added more details to the wolverthing, including stripes along it's back, and sharp teeth in an open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. The original was more like the beast that attacked me. I was just bored. I'm sorry, but I ate one of your apples. I was pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got then for us. Feel free to eat another is your still hungry.\" You say as you take one. It is a beautiful shade of pink, mixed with highlights of green. You take a bite and ponder what to do next. The man does not look like he is trained with the sword that he carries, and if you let him go with you you may have to do all the protecting and hunting for both of you. If you leave him, he may die from his wound, or the beast may come back and attack him again. So, you...</span></div></div>",

Always studying your father's spell books in secret you mastered many spells, however in recent years the magical community has been under heavy scrutiny. Not only are female spell casters being killed, but now people are killing off all who practice magic. The once great powerful magic guilds of Torlok have been burned to the ground. Many a magic user had to hide that they were actual wizards, witches, warlocks, druids, or sorcerers for fear of being killed by the church. The whole persecution of all magic users started when one guild destroyed an entire city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember hearing about the Great Casualty of Moondrawn. The terrible war started two years ago. During that time you were seeking refuge in the church where your grandmother served. Unfortunately both of your parents were killed by the church. The church had dubbed your father a warlock and a son of evil and your mother was killed by petty thieves. To make matters worse your grandmother was struck with an illness that not even your magic could cure. It was from that time you sought work as a freelance mage. Yet you often had to conceal your gender and work by the cover of night, since many people hated all magic users with vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently working for a widower who's children had fallen ill. The man was quite wealthy, but with his job at the tavern he barely had time to spend with sons and daughters. He had four kids, two sets of fraternal twins. The youngest twins were running high fevers and the maid that he hired couldn't find a doctor who could cure them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you arrived. My master is out late at the tavern and his eldest children are also out workings as apprentices. Mistress Madison and Master Blake have been running terrible fevers for a whole day. Every remedy I tried has had very little affect on their malady. Please sir, your the only one who could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head in response so you keep your gender hidden. The cloak that you are wearing is so loose and thick that it is easy for people to think that you're a man. You always wore a hood over your head and a mask over your face. The maid takes you to the tavern keeper's children. Once in the room you see it full of books and various animal hides. On the beds two children no older than seven years old were laying down. Their features were flushed white due to the fever and their bodies looked clammy. The maid walks outside the room as you perform your spell. You whisper the incantation and your gloved hands glow with a divine light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the children and place each each on their foreheads. The children are enveloped by the healing light. A rosy hue returns to their faces and they start breathing normally. You then walk out of the room. The tavern owner's maid starts crying with joy as she sees the two children in good health. Upon walking out the door you see a large man in his late 20s or early 30s. The man was wearing the typical outfit of a tavern owner. He had red hair and piercing green eyes that shone like emeralds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for healing my kids. It's not easy owning a tavern with four kids and no wife at home. Here's your pay as promised. Don't go spending it all in one place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave goodbye as the man enters his home to see his son and daughter. Underneath your mask you had a smile on your face. As you continued walking down the streets and to your home you noticed a group of young men standing outside. There were five men altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is! It's the famous Mage of the Night!\" One young man said as he noticed you staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other young men walks forward to greet you. The man was tall and lanky. He wore glasses and had short black hair and a short mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Mage of the Night. I am Xaiver Brook founder of the Magic Tear Guild. We're a new guild and we would like you to join. I know that most magic guilds have almost faded out of existence, but a magician of your caliber would be a welcome addition\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to think about your answer. Meanwhile the other guild members start talking among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he'll join Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure Rick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he'll join, right Mason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he is a man. The way the Mage of the Night's walks indicates that she's a woman, Brett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's a woman, Mason. It would be cool if he was though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Nathan! You're such a pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen! Please don't interrupt! I'm trying to talk to the Mage of the Night.\" Xavier yelled at the other four mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to contain yourself but couldn't help but laugh. It seemed like the mages acted like they were brothers or something. You notice all the mages except Mason stare at you in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a woman?! No man has a voice that high-pitched.\" Nathan said in a surprised, but excited manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason crosses his muscular arms across his chest. His bright blue eyes glittering in the moonlight. He was the same height as Xavier, but noticeably stronger. \"I was right. I knew it. Letting a woman join our guild may be a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Xavier replied. \"Would you mind taking off your hood and mask ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your hood and mask. Your beautiful blond hair falls to your shoulders and your brown eyes sparkle in the night. Your lips had a natural red tint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, she's smoking hot.\" Nathan said as a grin formed on his face. His red hair and black eyes expressed pure lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it Nathan.\" Jonathan said to Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Nathan wanted to ask you out for a drink, but unfortunately for him he's not your type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys let her answer the question.\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then can't help but let out another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join. You guys are just way too funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Nathan cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful news. Hopefully with you in our guild we can be a bit more serious. Being a magician is a lot of hard work.\" Xavier said as he extended his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then tell them your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty name. Would you like to see the location of our guild?\"</span></div></div>",

Your gut hits his shoulder painfully as he increases his gait, jogging toward the west exit of the garden courtyard. A glance behind you reveals your fiance, adjusting his gloves before kneeling and arranging the bodies. If you chew through the vine between your teeth, a loud shout might bring more guards to him. Reginald was, after all, the one who'd been attacking. As you start to gnaw on the vine, Reginald turns and heads along the wall away from the west exit and to the northern one. Another thought occurs as he passes through the gate and descends the stairs, nothing but a forty foot drop on the other side. If you could twist well enough to the left, and throw him off balance he might fall over the side. </span></div></div>",

On the ground is a small piece of paper that looks as if it had been torn off a larger piece. You bend down and pick it up. On the piece of paper is the seal of your fiance's country. It must have been from a letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could find the letter it might be enough proof for your father. The only problem is that your wedding starts in almost half an hour which only gives you time to search one place for it.</span></div></div>",

The gaurds that stood at the entry greeted you \"Your magesty. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be getting ready?\" It seemed everyone was concerned about your state of attire instead of more pressing matters. \"Is my fiance in there?\" you ask the one you recognise as Jordich. He has stood watch over the castle since he was a paige and you have grown up around him. The coversations you did have were always very formal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to walk past , but Jordich spoke up \"your majesty, it is bad look for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. You could hear how nervous he was, and there would be lots of people inside if you did go in. You had to find a way to get that letter though.</span></div></div>",

A silence stirred through the crowd as the she lay there. you could tell that she was alive but she wasn't going to be getting up. Your mother, who was in charge of helping the wounded, helped remove the unconscious girl from the center. You sighed and moved to the edge of the arena which was just a cleared circle of earth made for purposes such as these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to girl who you will be fighting. Her name's Star Sky, you and her have been friends since you were little. she was always a better fighter than you and you both knew it. You were almost done too. All you had to do was win this fight and one more. You nod to Star Sky wishing that she wasn't your opponent. Someone yells for you both to start the fight. \"Sorry\" you mutter \"But I can't let you win this.\"</span></div></div>",

You know she's on to you but you don't let up, You turn your right foot on it's side and drag it along the ground in a quick motion kicking dirt into her face. Your other foot following up a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight doesn't last much longer, With the strong start you provided  Star Sky can't make up for it. \"I give up\" She shouts amongst the savage beating you give her. You Stand up victoriously but no one cheers or says anything, Your mother rushes up and helps Star Sky up, and towards the Healing Hut. Star Sky  looks back at you but averts her gaze as you look at her. You think to yourself about how it was a neccessary cost to lead your tribe to victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman walks up to you and holds out her hand, \"You Cheated!\" You sneer at her and laugh, \"Prove it.\" She nods calmly \"Open your hands show us how you won\"</span></div></div>",

You and a couple of the other girls trying to move up the ladder? You're too weak to fight on your own. You have to rely on others just to get anywhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's face had turned a beat red with anger \"How dare you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare,\" you boast \"Because it's true.

Grabbing the woman's arm you twist it behind her back, maneuvering behind her. You force her onto the arena ground applying pressure on her arm so she is completely at your mercy. You lean to her ear and whisper \"Accuse me of cheating again, and I will snap your arm\"  slowly she nods her acknowledgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push her onto the ground shaking your head in disgust. then walk off the small dirt arena floor, eyes following you as you go. </span></div></div>",

She had been expecting this and had her feet planted, ready to meet your charge, head on. Seeing this, you quickly change what would have been a full on body check to a running sweep. She lifts her foot  to avoid your sweep as her fist come boldly towards your head, Star Sky only narrowly connects with the top of your head. It's not enough to cause any real damage, but It does cause you to fall onto your back.  She quickly moves on top of you and puts you into a choke lock <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up\" Your long time friend whispers to you as you feel the air escaping from your lungs, You try to Speak but you only succeed in losing more air.
