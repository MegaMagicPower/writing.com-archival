Smash your foe first and ask questions... after some more smashing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we get to the fun part... What breed of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Juggernaut:</u> Powerfully built, your claws can rip a boulder in half.  Aggressive, you've been fighting since you were out of the shell and not much can stand against the heavy bone mace at the end of your short, thick tail.  All that muscle doesn't do much for your aerial agility however, and your compressed flame sac is quite small.  Colors come mainly in earth tones, particularly reds and browns.  Two mighty horns adorn the head either facing forward like a bull or curling backwards like a ram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Fire-Lord</u>:  You are a bit scrawny for a typical dragon and almost half the normal size standing at a mere nine feet at the shoulder.  None dare mock your skinny frame or over-sized wings however as the bulbous sacs to either side of the base of your neck contain liquid, molten death.  With your breath weapon, you can lay waste to your foes from afar, but be careful, even your supply of fire isn't indefinite.  Those huge flames sacs take a lot of nutrition to sustain, however, giving you an appetite equal to a quite large dragon.  Elaborate coat markings of black, red, orange and even yellow give this breed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.  A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.  And that suits them just fine.  Always solid black, you are a hunter of the night and while you can see into the blackest abyss, your eyes are sensitive to bright lights without the time to acclimate.  A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You begin madly struggling against the chains, thrashing around and hitting yourself against the wall. And though they creaked and groaned, they refused to yield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie down, feeling exhausted. You try and gather your strength before trying once more, but before you do so the wooden door to your cell opened. You saw the fat king waddle inside, along with a few of his guards. The king was breathing heavily, both from fear and from having to run over to here. He crouches down to catch his breath, and he orders his men: \"Guards! Barricade the door, they are coming! And start unchaining the dragon!\". Most of the guards began blocking up the entrance, while one of them approached the king and said. \"Sire, are you sure unchaining this beast is a good idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no choice! This beast is our only hope of defeating them! Now hurry up!\" The panicking king replied. Your eyes instantly widened, the day had finally come. You stayed still as a few guards hesitantly approached you and began unlocking your heavy chains. You stood still, barely able to contain your rage, but attacking them before they set you free would be an extremely stupid idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before they finished unlocking your restraints, the enemy forces bashed open the door and barged in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fire was more intense than anything that Blaze could have summoned up himself.  The air was acrid and stank from the chemicals near the collapsing artist's guild.  Iskierka\u2026  The golden dragoness he'd seen disappear into collapsing stone and dust was surely dead, but Darzhja had rushed back towards the heart of the inferno anyways along with her hulking companion Kaj.  Blaze wished he could be brave like her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke rising from the burning merchant district forced the young fire-lord down still lower.  Blaze's scales shined iridescently in the heat of the flames, turning back the heat better than a typical dragon's, but his lungs were no better equipped to handle smog and ash than your average fire-breathing lizard.  Coughing, he alighted heavily onto the hard cobbles of a street once so familiar and now a burning hellscape.  The screaming of humanoids and dragons filled his ears.  They were burning, they were all burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pyromaniac by nature, Blaze never imagined the true horror that fire could visit on a world of flesh and tinder.  His insides chured with a manifested phantom guilt, as if the entire tragedy were somehow his fault.  But then, maybe it was just the smoke.  Blaze shuddered and then emptied his crop and then his true stomach onto the darkened stones.  The fluid bubbled and steamed almost immediately among the small round rocks he'd also purged himself of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost more heat than even he could withstand.  Where was the orphanage?  Part of Blaze wanted to blame Darzhja for sending him this way on his own.  Why hadn't she helped him get back to Lady Ramoth's?  The red fire drake, his scales blackening with ash as it settled on him, walked forward blindly in the inferno.  He could barely see a tail's length ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stopped again with a fit of coughing and retched up more bile and the last two stones knocking around his crop.  He struck out with a claw against a smoldering wagon, the charred remains of a pony still attached to one end, knocking the destroyed heap into the gutted and glowing interior of a one-time proprietor of ceramic pots.  He struck out against the pain in his lungs, against his watery eyes, against Darzhja who'd expected him to be able to save himself and against himself for being <i>unable</i> to save himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outburst left him off balanced and Blaze wobbled in the street, feeling more than a little dizzy.  At least there were fewer screams now\u2026 how long had he been wandering up this boulevard from Hell?  Flames were only licking up the larger buildings and skyscrapers now.  Most of shops and such were now only glowing coals in the skeletons of their frames.  The fires waited, dormant, Blaze knew, inside the wood and even inside the corpses of those who had owned the once magnificent buildings as well as those who had labored in them, now all charcoal and ash.  In the artificial night, the glowing embers peeking out from their borrowed homes looked like advertisements and billboards lining the street, beckoning entertainment within for a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze crawled through the street, the smoke like a ceiling overhead.  He must really be losing it, he thought.  Even now, he was entertaining delusions of rescue.  Up ahead the street even seemed to end.  Of course it couldn't have.  Inferno Boulevard had no end as any sensible denizen of the Fire-World knew.  The young drake scrambled through a cool snow bank laying in the middle of the road.  <i>Ah, refreshing</i>  thought Blaze as he paused to rest.  But it was odd snow, this.  Much lighter than he was used to\u2026 and somewhat crunchy in places.  There were all these\u2026 bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze cried out and leapt away, nearly colliding with the cliff face in front of him.  He coughed and looked blearily at the stairs cut into the side of the tall Teir.  He set his forepaws on them.  These were stairs he knew!  They led directly up back to Lady Ramoth's orphanage.  To home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire-lord would have cried out if his throat were not baked raw.  Delusions fled from his eyes as he gathered the last of his strength for the long climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before his tail have even cleared ground level, there came a ruckus from below, in the direction were the coals were faintest.  Blaze droped his neck down over the edge of the carved stairs and saw humanoids below!  How could little creatures such as those survive down there  when dragons themselves were reduced to ash!?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, but these creatures had breathing masks on as well as heavy coats to protect them from the heat.  They spread out in a deliberate manner, moving quickly through the streets and the rubble, kicking over debris and poking cursorily through the remains of the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rescue workers!\"  thought Blaze immediately, though he thought it strange that their jackets were a motley collection of brown and black rather than something more visible, like yellow.  But he hardly cared, all Blaze wanted was to be away from here, to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wasn't safety right up these steps?  He wondered.  Perhaps he shouldn't bother them, they might rescue someone else in more need than he in the time it takes them to get him away.  But how could he be sure that these steps did lead back to the orphanage, or that he would be able to climb up all the way through the smoke?  He was so tired\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, who was he to think that he could possibly even do something as simple as rescue his own hide?  He was 48 years old, but that was barely an adolescent by dragon standards.  That's why he lived in an orphanage.  No, it'd be safer to put his life in their hands than to trust his own claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze slithered over the edge of the stairs and back down to the street.  It was easily the worst decision he'd ever made in his life.</span></div></div>",

The stairways been blocked off by some falling rubble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gasped, \"Then...what am I going to do? How am I going to get back to the orphanage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a safe place you can stay for the time being. Its right down this alleyway. If you'd just follow us...\" said another of the brown clad humanoids. Were Blaze thinking straight, he would have known not to trust these rather odd individuals. After all, as an orphan, he was well aware these were untrustworthy people out on the streets. In his panic, Blaze failed to notice the glint in the humanoid's eyes, but rather was thankful that someone cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!!\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze followed the brown clad humanoids down the chaotic streets toward what he hoped was safety. He remembered going down a number of turns, navigating through a tight corridor that the skinny Fire Drake could barely maneuver through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly are we going?\u201d asked Blaze, tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo a safe place. There\u2019s no time for details\u2026\u201d uttered the lead humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Blaze was led to a small cave dug into the side of the terrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuickly!! In here!!\u201d gestured one of them, pointing to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked inside, it looked tight and cramped and it made him a little uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for!! Get in!!\u201d cried the humanoid again, giving him a slight push inside. Blaze grunted; he sure wasn\u2019t a friendly individual, yet compared to having to face the raging inferno he could care less about comfort or how friendly people were.  He gave a nod and scampered inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested upon his belly, relieved to find the air was rather cool compared to the outside. Yet something didn\u2019t seem right about this place. There was a rather odd smell; a combination of a rotting carcass mixed with that of young drakes\u2026 as if that he were not the first to be led here. Furthermore, where did those humanoids that had taken him run off to? Why didn\u2019t they come inside with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon learned the answer as Blaze shifted his gaze back toward the entrance. Right then, a row of thick iron bars snapped into place, blocking his way out. When he peered back outside, the kidnappers were already scampering back down the alleyway, turning out of sight. His hearts sank as the answer suddenly occurred to Blaze. These weren\u2019t rescue workers\u2026 They were kidnappers!! He\u2019d been duped. By the Ancestors!! He\u2019d been duped\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody!! Get me out of here!! Please help!!\u201d screamed Blaze at the top of his breath. He threw his claws against the iron bars, desperately trying to shake them loose, but the thick metal defied his efforts. He tried blowing fire on the bars, yet not even the flame of a Fire Drake did anything to soften the bars one bit. He yelled and wailed and cried and screamed, calling for Lady Ramoth, Darzhja, Kaj, the Great Ancestors Above, even his non-existent parents in hopes that they would hear him and rescue him. Yet nobody came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sunk down into the dark chamber,<i>How could I have been so stupid?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was very quiet in the cool, slightly musty stone chamber.  Blaze barely stirred on the loamy straw scattered about the floor on one side, having exhausted himself battering his body against the iron bars which confined him.  The normally regal and inflated sacs at the base of his throat were diminished, emptied of their fire.  As a result, Blaze was famished and weak.  His irregular cough was the only sounds in the small cave aside from the scurrying of rats in the straw where he lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light filtering in through the bars was crimson and wavering.  Outside somewhere, a fire still tore through New Alveri.  But no one had come!  Not a soul had the young fire drake seen since he'd been led into this accursed cave in one of the back alleys of the burning Merchant District.  Was there a slight haze to the air between the bars?  A slick film, like soap on the surface of water?  It could be that the same barrier than kept the chamber insulated against the heat outside also kept sound from escaping into the streets beyond.  It sounded plausible, but Blaze was no student of magic, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, the only thing that could be seen beyond the bars was the other side of the building which formed the back alley where the cave had been dug.  A woven refuse basket lay toppled and half broken on the cobbles just beyond where Blaze could reach by sticking his claw through the bars.  Not so much as a bird had passed since he'd been left here, his captors apparently secure in the knowledge that their prize could not go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze drowsed, he could only imagine what horrible things lay in store for him at the cruel hands of indifferent humanoids.  Would he be sent abroad to become a slave? Or would he be simply chopped up for parts?  The magician's and alchemist's guilds as they were, the latter option seemed terrifyingly plausible.  Blaze buried his snout in the odiferous straw and wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja\u2026 anyone\u2026 please come find me\u2026\"  he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the red skinned drake saw the figure approach on the cobbles outside his chamber, he soon wished that he had been more specific in his prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's first thought was it was indeed a dreaded magician.  The robed elf strode confidently beyond the bars, a pair of muscly bodyguards at his flanks.  Blaze flinched when he waved his hand in his direction, expecting to meet his end at some vile spell from those manicured fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, a light began to fill the chamber, evenly and without obvious source.  Shadows fled before the ubiquitous light.  And the elf studied him like a newly weaned colt\u2026 or a pig ready for slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mumbled and spoke to his contemporaries, but Blaze only knew this because their mouths were moving, otherwise, the chamber was as silent as it was before.  He pointed towards various features of Blaze with his delicate fingers, the wings, shoulders and teeth most especially.  The young drake didn't know what to make of it.  He was a proud citizen of New Alveri, yet he suddenly felt reduced to fodder in the eyes of the haughty, colorful elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light vanished as more humanoids approached.  It was his 'rescue team' and - Blaze wished fervently that his eyes were failing him - it almost looked like some of them were carrying round bundles, just the right size for dragon eggs.  Their leader strode confidently up to the elf and gestured to the cave where Blaze was confined, a smug look on the human's bearded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the elf did not look pleased at all.  With his left hand, the elf made a swiping motion and the man was blown to the side as if by a great wind.  The wave of force blew out the soap bubble barrier between the grates and one of them actually burst.  Suddenly, the world had sound again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-have a green dragoness twelve blocks away!  You were to collect eggs from the designated spots only!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man curled on the floor, hugging his ribs, surprisingly, he showed resilience in the face of the powerful elf wizard.  \"It\u2026 was an\u2026 and opportunity we couldn't pass up.  It was a-alone, and better, an orphan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf glanced back at Blaze.  \"An orphan?  Well, you may not have complicated the situation as much as I'd fear you had, then.\"  He sneered, \"Get yourself out of the gutter and take those eggs to the second rendezvous, we can't store them with that adolescent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormity of what Blaze was witnessing pounded on his skull.  Humanoids with dragon eggs?  It was forbidden!  Unthinkable!  <i>We're Equals!</i>  Blaze yelled inside.  And then he realized and remembered.  If sound could get in, it must surely be able to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young drake flowed forward, spreading his wings and puffing the loose skin on his chest.  Pointing his snout in the direction of the empty grate, he let loose a mighty roar.  However, it came out rather choked for his seared throat and it sent him into yet another fit of coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was plenty loud enough, however to get the humans attention.  The elf remained calm, almost amused, however, despite how Blaze called forth in roaring Draconic.  <b>\"Help!  Child in Danger!  Please come!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The orb.\"  said the elf, and a meaty orc slipped a round crystalline sphere into the elf's waiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the gate even as Blaze continued to shout.  \"Quiet you.  You'll learn respect soon enough.\"  The elf slipped the orb into the cell where it cracked on the stone floor; he backed away quickly before Blaze could think to strike through the bars.  A heavy mist flowed out of the broken sphere, stopping at the gate and soon building up throughout the small room.  It had the sickly sweet smell of a cleaner rather like the one Howard the blacksmith used around the shop.  The world began to spin despite his attempts to hold his head high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing that Blaze saw was the elf's smug smile, grinning up at him.  He didn't remember falling.</span></div></div>",

He tried to open his eyes, yet all he could see was black. The bastards had blindfolded him with a rough leather strap. Blaze tried to move about, only to find that his limbs were extremely heavy. He was chained\u2026as if he were a beast rather than a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, he could smell the foul stench of a small crowd of humanoids gathered about him. In particular, he caught a whiff of that smug, arrogant elf nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it seems as though you're awake now beast,\" said the elf's unmistakable, slithery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's hearts pumped with fear and hate at the sound of that voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay for what you did elf!!\u201d roared Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Blaze threw himself in the direction of that voice. He did not get far though, as suddenly his body was violently yanked backwards. Blaze tried again, but once again the thick iron chains defied his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that you said?\u201d taunted the elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll let me go right now!! My friends will come and get me out!! You'll see!!\" cried Blaze through the muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf responded with that irritating laugh of his. \"Is that so? Why should they or the authorities care about what happens to an orphan? If they had, would they have not rescued you by now? To them, you\u2019re probably better off dead anyhow,\" he laughed. The other thugs joined in laughter. Blaze felt both hurt and humiliated. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been out, yet the elf was right that if nobody had managed to find him by now, he wouldn\u2019t be getting free anytime soon. Yet as frightened as he was at that cruel fact, as a drake, he could not afford to show weakness to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026trying to mess with my head aren\u2019t you so that I\u2019d give up!!\u201d retorted Blaze. \u201cYou won\u2019t break me!! One day, you\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, there was a whipping noise, and a piercing pain burst against Blaze\u2019s flank. Blaze let out a high-pitched yelp, both shocked and humiliated at what they\u2019d done. They\u2019d whipped him. By the Ancestors they\u2019d whipped him as if he were a swine. Blaze cried out even louder when the whip came down the second time. Then it came again, and again, and again, until Blaze was left shivering against the cold, hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have come to understand that I will accept no defiance out of you beast\u2026\u201d cried the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not a beast\u2026 My name\u2026is Blaze,\u201d stammered the young Fire Drake. That earned him another few whips across the flank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will never refer to yourself with that name ever again. Only people have names, and that being the case you are nothing more than an animal to be used at the whim of its master,\u201d commanded the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Blaze could do at the moment was remain silent. He was a dragon, not a beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t think so?\u201d said the elf, sensing Blaze\u2019s stubbornness, \u201cThen I will prove it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, dreadful silence as Blaze prepared himself once more for the crack of the whip. There was the sound of a box opening, and with it the smell of fresh meat. Blaze\u2019s stomach instantly began to churn. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been out, but it surely had to have been quite a while considering how dreadfully hungry he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smell that don\u2019t you?\u201d taunted the elf. \u201cYes\u2026its food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf tossed a batch of meat right in front of Blaze. Yet with his jaw muzzled, he could not reach out with his tongue and snap it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you\u2019re hungry\u2026\u201d the elf continued. To Blaze\u2019s surprise, the front flap that his blocking his snout swung open, and before he could stop himself he threw himself in front of the food and gulped it down. It tasted horrible, and frankly, he didn\u2019t want to know what creature that it belonged to. Back in the orphanage, he\u2019d used to make jokes about the meat packing companies in the industrial district, how they would throw in all sorts of creatures, including the stray vermin or even a stray humanoid if rumors were to be believed, into the meat grinders, pack it all together, and then call it beef. However, if it was between that and starving\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he finished when they placed a large bowl of water in front of him. Or, at least that\u2019s what Blaze thought it was, for it had a mildewy aftertaste and thought he could feel things squirm in his tongue as the water went down his throat. Again, best not to think what was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished, the next thing he felt was a humanoid slide up from his backside and place what could only be a large bucket underneath him. \u201cNow, I want you to defecate\u2026\u201d ordered the elf with the same, neutral voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d snarled Blaze, outraged at the crude command. All around him, he could hear the kidnappers snickering under their breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me correctly, I want you to relieve yourself right now. I can\u2019t have you stinking up the cargo during the journey can I?\u201d replied the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze began to shiver. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t have to go right now\u2026\u201d he insisted with a shaky voice. That earned him a whip against the flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need me to whip you again beast?\u201d snapped the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze heaved a small breath, \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m not going to poop. Not with all you around\u2026\u201d he said with a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze prepared himself for the whip once more, yet this time they did something even more terrible. Blaze let out a high-pitched scream and his vision went white as something cold and hard was plunged into his rectum. His muscles flinched, but a moment later he felt a liquid get pumped into him. The water continued to pump in until Blaze's stomach began to cramp terribly, when unceremoniously the prod was yanked out. Suddenly, Blaze started to feel very full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re needing to relieve yourself any moment now aren\u2019t you?\u201d taunted the elf, which brought forth a chorus of laughter. He strained his jaw, trying to hold it in as long as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!! I can\u2019t!! I can\u2019t!!</i> However, he couldn't hold it in anymore. He let out a huge fart as his bowels emptied out in an explosion, snapping his eyes shut in shame mixed with exquisite relief. Blaze felt his pride break then, as he began to wail in the absolute shame and humiliation at his emasculation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how could you? What have I ever done to you to deserve this? W-why?\u201d whimpered Blaze, tears staining his leather blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf\u2019s answer was short but cruel, \u201cBecause we can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the unhinged laughter of the humanoids, the stink of his excrement, his absolute helplessness to stop them from having done such a horrific thing, that awful, throbbing pain in his rectum. And thus, Blaze cried and cried, begging for his ordeal to end, that by the mercy of the Great Ancestors that he could die and his suffering would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Blaze's ordeal had only just begun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze laid as still as a corpse as the cart that carried him continued to clank down an endless dirt road. He'd lost track of exactly how long he'd been carried in this manner, nor where it could possibly be going, yet all he knew was that since he had been tricked into following the kidnappers his life had degenerated into a grisly routine of pain and humiliation. His typical day would go like this. For most of the day, there was the endless boredom of be hauled in his cart, blindfolded and unaware of his surroundings. While the cart was rolling, Blaze never caused trouble. In a twisted sense, it had almost become his proverbial egg-shell; so long as he lay still and unmoving, he was safe from the elf and his evil henchmen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was during the times that the caravan stopped that were the most horrible. He would be whipped, slapped and degraded, while he was fed rotted meat and fetid water, and then he\u2019d be asked to defecate. After that horrific enema, he\u2019d never needed to be asked more than once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that was keeping Blaze going was the hope that one day, should Blaze ever get free, he would make sure that each one of those cruel humanoids would suffer a grisly fate. He wanted to hear them scream and suffer and have them call out for mercy, just as they had done to him throughout the duration of the death march thus far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet right now though, he was little more than a beast; cargo that had no right to protest its condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze continued to bemoan his fate, he was suddenly shaken out of his stupor by a flurry of activity. There were numerous humanoids about, but by now Blaze knew better than to scream for help. He knew that nobody was there, and it would only earn him a series of cruel lashings, which the kidnappers always eagerly looked for an excuse to administer at every possible moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caravan slowly meandered to a stop. The cage that he was in was somehow lowered onto the ground, and then dragged along what sounded like a series of creaking, wooden planks. Then, inexplicably, his blindfold was removed from his eyes. Blaze recoiled at the light, having been essentially blind for the past month, but when his vision settled he saw a giant ship moored on the docks. Patrolling the decks were a whole bunch of humanoids dressed with shoddy clothing and armed with crude weapons. Most of the humanoids though were half-clothed males hauling cargo into the giant ship, being encouraged by the whips of their overseers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then beast, I want you to look presentable for the shipmaster do you understand. Remain in an upright position and do not move\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want me to look all nice and pretty is that what you\u2019re saying? After all, I\u2019m valuable cargo and you\u2019re looking to make a nice profit from the transaction are you?\u201d sneered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned him a series of whips from the elf\u2019s cronies. Blaze decided it was best not to provoke the elf any further. The cart was rolled to the edge of a harbor, stopping before a scarred, greasy looking man with missing teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so this is the specimen you\u2019ve come to show me?\u201d said the shipmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, I present a young male Fire Drake for shipment of sound health,\u201d said the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive as always, I\u2019d expect nothing less from a Kleave. Of course, we\u2019ll need to inspect the cargo of course\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI warn you that this one may prove to be particularly fierce shipmaster. I advise your inspectors to utilize caution,\u201d said the elf, or rather Kleave. A team of humanoids began to approach with sticks, poking and prodding him with impunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze growled at the humans. He didn\u2019t care if it earned him a few more whips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA defiant one isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the shipmaster. \u201cAh yes, as you can see, Fire Drakes in particular are violent beasts by nature,\u201d said Kleave, if that was indeed his real name, \u201cIt must constantly be reminded who its master is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the powers below take you!! I\u2019m not an animal!! I\u2019m a dragon!! You have no right to do this to me!! You'll never be my master!!\u201d yelled Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze came to regret his outburst. Right in plain sight, Kleave ordered a team of his thugs to bring forward a long pole whose rounded tip was doused in a strange liquid. Instantly, images of that horrific enema played out in his mind as panic overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! Please!! Not that!! I\u2019m sorry!! I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d screamed Blaze, as the thugs rounded to his backside. He vainly tried to cover his backside and squirm his body away, yet the chains held him in place and cruelly exposed. His body instantly seized up and Blaze screamed louder than he\u2019d ever screamed in his life as the rod was shoved up in his rectum. No sooner could he catch his breath, when the rod was yanked out and then shoved back in again, even deeper, and he collapsed in a heap. The third time, he didn\u2019t even have the energy to resist, as he pissed all over the cage floor. All that came out of his throat by the fourth time was a pathetic mewling noise while shitting out blood-stained excrement, leaving him curled up and whimpering and wishing that the last one had killed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d been raped. Raped without reason, mercy or purpose. Out of the corner of his eye, Blaze could see the torturers walk away laughing, the edge of the pole stained with a combination of his excrement and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Gods, I hope you did not degrade the value of the cargo,\u201d said the shipmaster, sounding more amused than concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one, I\u2019ve found, is a particular glutton for absorbing pain. In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually enjoys pain of this particular manner\u2026\u201d sneered the evil elf. Blaze didn\u2019t follow the rest of the conversation between the evil elf and the shipmaster, he was in too much pain to care for much of anything anymore as his cage was dragged into the cargo hold. He prayed to the Ancestors, wondering what he had done to deserve such a face, and praying that in their mercy that he could simply die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cargo hold door slammed shut with a menacing click. Blaze settled into the tight, smelly cargo hold, shivering at the damp, moldy air. Yet he could not get into a comfortable position. It just hurt\u2026so\u2026so much. As he laid there, he contemplated the various ways he could commit suicide. Perhaps he could slam his head against the bars until his skull broke open\u2026 Or, he could somehow get his tail free and cut out his throat. Yet those methods seemed like they would take a long time for him to die and would be extremely painful. Furthermore, the slavers would still be able to use his parts for their nefarious schemes. Drowning seemed a cleaner death, perhaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as he was contemplating these grim possibilities, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cC-comrade\u2026\u201d said a small voice. Blaze arched his aching neck in the direction of the voice. Chained and caged on the opposite side of the cargo hold was a small, skinny drake about his age with dull brown scales. His hide was covered with lash marks and bruises, just as Blaze\u2019s hide was no doubt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it looks like they got you too\u2026\u201d sighed Blaze. At this point, he didn\u2019t care if the other dragon had seen him crying and whimpering, likely because his unfortunate companion had experienced the same kind of treatment and done his own share of crying and whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them were able to say anything to each other for a long while, but the two young drakes merely stared at one another eyes, united in their mutual misery and despair. What sort of horrors had he already experienced? After a while, the small copper dragon broke out in tears, as did Blaze a short while later. The lives they had previously lived had been shattered, and Blaze cried for the misery the dragon on the opposite side of the room had faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for however long this boat ride was, at the very least Blaze had a companion. He might as well got to know his fellow unfortunate prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that you addressed me as \u2018Comrade\u2019. Are you one of those barbarians\u2026\u201d asked Blaze. New Alveri was a cosmopolitan city, and he saw merchants come by from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a <i>Vastnyas</i>!! A proud nomadic warrior of the steppes, not a \u2018barbarian\u2019 as you Baschmachi label us as\u2026\u201d the small drake insisted with a scratchy voice and trilling accent. While the 'Vastnyas', (not barbarians) had a reputation of banditry and perhaps even cowardise, when addressing the heritage they would show as much hubris and pride of a bronze dragon, and he small dragon seemed to be no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you are\u2026 Just not so loud or the torturers will come back won't they?\u201d answered Blaze. The small dragon lowered his head. \u201cSorry,\" Blaze was nonetheless glad to see the small drake had regained his spirit, which was all the more important in times like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again\u2026um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My full name is Jinxieregouth\u2026\u201d answered the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was getting tongue-tied trying to merely pronounce the name. \u201cCan I just call you Jinx?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts improper, yet if you must I suppose that I don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d answered Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy full name is Blaz-fyrazaird\u2026 but I\u2019d rather you call me Blaze\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. That name was the only thing he remembered from his birth parents, before whatever circumstance led to him being abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then comrade Blaze. Though indeed the circumstances could be better, I'm glad to meet you nontheless\u2026\u201d cried Jinx, with an ironic smile. Blaze could only grunt with agreement, and for the first time since he'd been kidnapped, his jaw arched into a smile. Having someone to talk to did more to boost his flagging resolve than any display of pride or spontaneous outburst he had shown previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get caught?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx\u2019s gaze darkened. \u201cMy father was the Khan of the Colshek Clan, strong and feared by all. Then, without warning, we were betrayed by those who had pledged themselves as our allies. During the attack, father told me to flee while he and his host fought against them, and so I did. Yet I could not find another clan who was willing to take me in, or one that wasn\u2019t controlled by our enemies, so I wandered alone, slowly reduced to nothingness. One that does not have a clan may well be already dead. One day, a group of humans found me and offered food; I should have known better than to trust those <i>snaga</i>, yet I was desperate and hungry\u2026 Thus, I find myself trapped here in these chains\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed. The kidnappers always went after those who had nobody to look after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of you comrade?\u201d asked Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to live in New Alveri. I was an orphan, but there were those who cared about me and were my friends. One day, there was an explosion, and I panicked. I followed a group of strangers, thinking they were going to lead me to safety\u2026 Turns out I was wrong,\u201d said Blaze. He didn\u2019t feel the need to reveal any more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNichevo\u2026\u201d sighed Jinx, shaking his head back and forth. Truly, nothing more needed to be said than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you said that you lived in New Alveri?\u201d said Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard tales, about that great city built into the mountains. Our elder spoke of how there are towers made of jade that reach high up into the clouds, held up by ancient, arcane magicks. That it is a city of all peoples, races and creeds, where an individual can grow rich and live like a Great Khan solely by the strength of his ambition and cunning,\u201d said Jinx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sneered, \u201cIf New Alveri were so perfect, there wouldn\u2019t have been an attack at the center of the city and I wouldn\u2019t be here right now would I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose even a shining city like New Alveri has its dark side\u2026\u201d replied Jinx dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could only nod in agreement. \"That's the understantement of the century isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think they\u2019re going to do with us?\u201d asked Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze thought back to the hellish journey thus far. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine, but it\u2019ll likely involve something that has a lot of pain and torture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDa\u2026 yet is there anything you might know of these slavers?\u201d asked Jinx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen the kidnappers first held me in the prison, I saw them carrying a whole bunch of dragon eggs. These aren\u2019t your typical street thugs, they\u2019re really powerful and have a whole lot of money to do whatever it is they want to do. After meeting you here, I\u2019m also convinced that there\u2019s a lot of dragons like ourselves that they\u2019ve kidnapped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx let out a soft growl as his brows furrowed in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is indeed alarming. If what you say is true, that these thieves have been able to escape the authority of the Knights, then this conspiracy must be vaster than either of us have imagined. A scheme this vast must have taken many years to plan, and that they have an ultimate objective they want to achieve through this conspiracy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care what it is they\u2019re planning to do. I just want to get out of there as soon as I can\u2026\u201d growled Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet I cannot envision any method to make our escape. You know this as well as I comrade\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in his gut, he knew that the small drake was almost certainly right. That elf, Elandrias, had already demonstrated his willingness to use the most brutal means to keep him in line, and that they had already come up with a number of safeguards in mind to prevent that from happening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about committing suicide?\u201d suggested Blaze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we commit suicide, then they win. Suicide is the coward\u2019s way out. All we can do right now to defy their will is for us to survive, no matter what it is they attempt to inflict upon us and no matter how detestable the means we must take to ensure this\u2026\u201d vowed Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. We\u2019ve already endured this much, so its pointless to give up now. Besides, one day I\u2019m going to make sure they pay it all back. Mark my words\u2026\u201d growled Blaze, digging his claw into the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, the door to the cargo hold burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that noise that I hear!?\u201d came the captains voice. Behind him were a gang of pirates armed with whips, clubs, poles and other horrific looking devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze and Jinx stared at each other and nodded, knowing what was to come. Thus, knowing that there was someone else that would be sharing his suffering, for the first time, Blaze didn\u2019t quite feel as frightened anymore when the beatings began.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cold seawater splashed Blaze as a crewman ungracefully sluiced the deck using a hose  and a pump operated by another hand on the top deck.  The human's face was disgustingly marred with an enormous purple birthmark, almost a deformity and certainly the reason why he was a crew member on this renagade pirate and smuggling ship.  It was, perhaps, also the reason why he took so much pleasure in dowsing the cringing dragon helpless and caged in the ship's main hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna clean you up!  Beast!\"  laughed the man, lisping in an uneducated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze knew three languages as well as arithmetic and some algebra too.  He doubted this man could so much as count his toes.  Yet that didn't stop the frozen stream of water hitting his worn out and damaged body.  He shouldn't have minded really, but the red dragon had lost a lot of weight since being captured as well as valuable muscle tone for being chained and unable to move very much for the last brutal months.  He was half the dragon he used to be, his once mighty fire bladders hanging loose and empty at the base of his throat, his body unable to sustain itself fully on his diet of rotten meat and human castoff let alone produce fire.  Blaze shivered as the water hit him again, his bony elbows knocking against his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month at sea, Blaze were beginning to wonder if he would even make it to their cursed destination.  The beatings had stopped after Blaze and even Jinx himself lost the energy to resist or even talk very much, although brave seamen still came down on dark evenings, daring their buddies to kick the dragons.  They mostly resigned this practice to Blaze, ever since Jinx relieved one of the competing men of his foot, boot and all; of course, seeing the was Jinx was molested after the affair, Blaze entertained no such illusions for his own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the 'better' treatment, however, both dragons' health declined in the gloomy hold far from sunlight or fresh air.  Even with daily sluicing, the hold remained a clammy, stinking environment.  This was mostly due to the dragons themselves.  Blaze had been suffering from a painful, often bloody diarrhea and as far as he could tell by the smell, Jinx himself was only slightly better off.  The young red dragon suffered from headaches caused by his rampant thirst.  What fresh water they afforded him - precious on the open sea - was tainted.  Sometimes it was bubbly, likely collected deck wash or else salty like watered down sea water; once it even tasted strongly of humanoid piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on his side was painful, but not the agony that resting on his belly was, with his partially torn vent pressing against the grates of the bottom of his iron cage.  Blue bruises showed purple under his red scales, livid across his entire flank on both sides.  They were miserably slow to heal and always tender to the touch.  His coat of scaly armor remained intact save for two places, on on his left shoulder and another at the base of his tail, where the overzealous whipper had actually managed to break through the scales.  The first time it'd happened had been on the trail, less than a day out from New Alveri when Blaze had been vigorous in his resistance.  The shipmaster had lain open the dragon's skin with repeated blows from the strong leather whip.  That night he'd been tied down and flogged with his own whip until his was bloodier than Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this was because the mark would leave a permanent scar on his shoulder, corrupting the seamless overlap of the scales, forever weakening it without major intervention by healing magics and surgery.  From the affair, Blaze knew that his captors wanted him whole and as untouched as possible.  It had laid to rest his fears of being taken for butchering, though the fact that they would capture him alive should have been enough of a hint.  The second time Blaze's tough, armored skin had been broken, that elf who Blaze hadn't seen since being loaded on he ship, yet was certain was aboard somewhere, had strangled the man to death with the leather throng which had so abused the young drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only marginal satisfaction to watch.  Still, what were a few scars compared to what they were doing now?  Blaze coughed as the water hit his cage.  The youth was certain he was going to get wet lung and die at this rate.  Perhaps that would be for the best\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall man - tall for a human at least - stutted down the stairs, stepping over the canvas hose.  He stared at the laughing idiot wielding the hose for a few moments.  When the stream came back up, the midshipman decked Purple-face in the back of the skull, sending him face first into the stinking water that had been building up through his ineffective sluicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash the deck only!  You worthless cur.\"  roared the minor officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lowly seaman cowered, hands over his head in the filthy water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fear seemed only to infuriate the officer who delt him a kick to the midsection.  \"On your feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze watched with one eye, not daring to smile, as the seaman was shoved upstairs.  Later came the cries of public punishment.  Blaze numbly absorbed the fact that the humans were at least as brutal to each other as they were to him.  He looked at Jinx across from him and exchanged glances.  The muddy brown, mottled drake had been watching too.  Carefully switching to his opposite flank, Blaze thought that he could survive at least one more day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small two masted privateer continued to sail south along the coast.  Gradually, the weather got warmer, which was a relief now that Blaze was lacking an insulating layer under his skin.  However, during the midday, the hold became almost unbearable hot and humid as the sun beat down on the planks of the deck above.  One by one the livestock that were kept in the other side of the hold, separated from the dragons by a thin wooden partition - Blaze could tell by the scent - were slaughtered and eaten.  After they were gone, came the dried salted meat.  Blaze was soon dreaming about the rancid cast off and bones from the shipmen's tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they didn't talk much after that first day, mutual suffering created a bond between Blaze and the drake across from him.  The barbarian had an odd manner of speaking and had quite a high opinion of himself for an outcast of both the Empire and his own roving tribe.  However he was getting it just as bad as Blaze and despite the abuse seemed to possess an unquenchable font of strength and spirit.  Intelligently, he kept his head and voice down, but always he would nip at his captors when their backs were turned, winking at Blaze afterwards, as if this were some sort of grand game.  His indefatigable soul infused Blaze himself with a need to live, survive where he himself might have foundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, their efforts turned into something of a friendly male rivalry.  Blaze could not show how weak he really felt, not when Jinx still seemed so viable.  He'd show him that he was at least as strong as he was!  It was a poor jest, really, but it was better than dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a day, particularly warm in Blaze's opinion, when the ship stopped.  There was bustling feet overhead and the screeching of ropes and pulleys.  Through one of the open sluice ports, Blaze spied a dinghy being lowered over the side, in it he saw the elf!  The Kleave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst.\"  Blaze hissed quietly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx lifted his head were he'd been dozing.  He followed Blaze's stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing?\"  Blaze asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they are going ashore?\"  replied Jinx uncertainly.  As an inland barbarian, the mottled drake probably had even less experience with the sea than Blaze, although he had one or two decades on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they bring back a few goats...\"  muttered Blaze.  He'd gone from washing the deck with blood tinged effuse to being painfully blocked up on a diet of dried meat.  He strongly wanted to gnaw on some spindly, leafy Elf's Hair, or even just ordinary grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, Blaze lowered his head to the bottom of his cage to see out the tiny sluice port.  His vent touched the bars, but it was against the scale side and by now it'd resealed itself as well so he didn't mind so much.  Out across the water, Blaze saw a green island... so close!  if only he could fly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an island.\"  Blaze informed his companion in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx grunted an affirmation and said nothing.  They were both beyond the world of their ken and he knew it.  There was nothing to be said save useless and idle speculation that could only result in more harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship took on more supplies and sailed on further to the south.  No one bothered to inform the prisoners about the island pit stop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ship carrying the captive drakes did not travel nearly as long from the island supply stop as it had taken to get there.  In fact, less than a score of days had passed since Blaze had seen the small ship lowered into the water before there was a flurry of activity above the hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBare human feet pounded the seasoned wood as seamen hushed to and fro about their unfathomable tasks.  There were shouts from the middies as well as the bosun, whipping the men into the orderly frenzy of activity that it took to control the wooden, sail-driven ship.  It all meant little to Blaze who languished in his cage, sore and ill.  Whether this be their final destination or another pit stop, the red drake only hoped that this meant that he could finally be moved from out of his small cage; even if only to be moved to a different cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manacles at his wrists and ankles chaffed despite the protection offered by his scales.  He had not been able to open his wings in nearly two months.  It'd been over a week since he last shat; though Blaze supposed that he should be grateful, given the circumstances of his most greivous insult and injury.  Still, he was cramping so badly on his diet of dried and salted meat that he was almost tempted to turn away his meager rations... almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze was consumed by restlessness despite his general lack of energy nowadays, he took to peering out the tiny sluice port set in the floor.  Resting his jaw on the floor, he peeked out at a sliver of the world beyond his confinement and saw something other than the ubiquitous water he'd been expecting.  Oh, there was definitely water, but there were also little rocky mounds rising out of the sea.  Some were expansive, others only a few feet across, but never did they rise more than a foot out of the water.  The stone itself was odd, and below the waves, Blaze could see hints of vibrant color and movement, as if of great schools of fish.  <i>What foreign place have these mad humans taken me to?</i>  Blaze wondered in despair, though he could not help but appreciate the beauty he saw in the coral reef they were passing through, though he knew not the names for the things he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the ship banged loudly against something and Blaze was sent jarring forward until his nose collided with the bars of his cage.  There was shouting overhead and rapid nautical instructions called out that the city drake could not begin to decipher; all about \"mast-lines\" and \"port\" and \"rigs.\"  The young fire drake had lurid delusions of the ship sinking into the abyss, he, the elf and all the wretched humans with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him, Jinx lifted his head.  He drew in a big draught of air.  \"The humans stink of fear.\"  He said as if sharing a comment about how pleasant the weather is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, still dreaming of vengeance and self-destruction asked hopefully, \"Do you think the ship will go down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mottled drake flicked his tongue out and tasted the air, Blaze saw for the first time that it was indeed narrow and forked.  He titled his head this way and that.  \"Doubt it, comrade.\"  he muttered.  \"Ship still feels true.\"  He paused, \"Is good ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snorted, unwilling to abandon the image of unworthy humans being swallowed by the sea they so worshiped and feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx continued, a little more talkative than usual, perhaps sensing Blaze's mood.  \"I hope the ship does not sink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stared at him and lifted an eye ridge.  \"Why?\"  He asked.  He did not need to list the reasons why it might be nice to never reach their destination, to suffer no more pain or indignity at humanoid hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx actually mustered up a grin, though the scales creaked at the corners of his mouth through disuse.  \"I vant to eat every svoloch' human on this ship.  I cannot do this if they all die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just stared at Jinx.  Something in the drake's eyes told him that he really thought that he was going to have his revenge.  Blaze tucked his head against his arm and tried to nap, seeking escape in unconsciousness.  Ancestors grant him luck in his revenge, that was all he could think of.  Blaze was beyond feeling pity for anyone on this ship, save for perhaps himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the greater part of a day, the ship remained stranded on the coral reef.  Eventually however, the crew somehow got the boat off of the submerged obstacle it had grounded itself on and to Blaze's chagrin, it did not immediately sink into the waves.  Another day passed before they finally reached their final destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze saw little of the place which would become his new home on the approach.  It was not until the hatch was opened above and the wooden grate fetched out with hooked poles that he even was able to glimpse the sky for the first time in two months.  The tropical sun was blinding.  Blaze shut his eyes tight against the luminescence, although the sunlight on his scales felt oh-so-good, almost expunging them of some of the filth ground into his hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an hour for him to be able to blink his watery eyes open and by that time, they were lowering in a stout cable from the dock crane.  They secured his cage at four corners and lifted him out.  Despite years of flying the ungraceful rocking of the iron cage in the wind filled Blaze with rampant vertigo.  He vomited a thin stream of bile, but it fell uselessly into the water below before he could think to at least aim it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was able to look around, Blaze gasped at what he saw.  It was an entirely different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another island.  The young dragon could tell that much from the start.  The small privateer was moored in a cove about 120 dragon lengths across, the water a rich, aqua blue, as if pulled straight from a painting.  To the north, the cove was nestled against a steep rocky hill; the stone was porous and black, studded with low caves at the water's edge.  Fine yellow sand, tinged here and there with streaks of black mingled with white surf all along the cove.  Palm trees towered along the shore, the bases of their trunks littered with black detritus and fallen fruit among the sand.  Beyond, further into the island, rose a single conspicuous mountain.  Steam rose in a thin stream somewhere on its opposite slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much to take in at once.  There was a din of calling birds whose songs Blaze had never learned as well as the hoots of several animals he didn't even recognize.  There was the groaning of the crane supporting his considerable bulk and that of the heavy iron cage.  The hustle and bustle of the docks he was moving slowly towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was quite an extensive dock.  Blaze's eyes widened when he saw two large, what could only be warships, docked alongside the pathetic looking privateer.  The ships were oddly designed, with huge flat bows like paddles, almost large enough for a dragon to land on, Blaze would wager.  The docks also sported large warehouses and what could only be a drinking house.  Looking at the base of the crane, Blaze saw strange blue-skinned humanoids of an unknown type laboring at a large crank.  Looking closer, Blaze saw their wrists bound by chains to the poles they were pushing, ever around and around, providing the power to turn the crane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster, you troll dogs!\"  cried a human as he snapped a loud crack out of his whip in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trolls...\"  Blaze muttered.  He thought they'd been driven out of Nod after the Rebellions.  It seemed their kind was still destined for subjugation after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing that Blaze noticed before the sails of the ship rose to block his view were the two tall stone towers rising at either end of the cove.  One was set on the rocky prominence at the north side, and the other on a lower hill at the western side, but they were built to rise to the same height.  Grim faced elves and a couple dwarves kept watch on all that went on below as they strutted back and forth among the battlements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was clutching the bars under him tightly with his paws as his cage came finally to a stop on the dock.  Though he was weary, he stood, looking around, wanting to memorize his surroundings in case he'd never get the opportunity to see them again.  The dock workers didn't mind, secure now in the fact that escape was impossible.  The trolls were ordered to reverse direction and the crane cable rose to fetch the next passenger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There went Jinx, and with a great amount of regret, Blaze watched as the small drake\u2019s cage was lowered onto the dock opposite of the ship. Their gazes met for a brief moment, and Blaze was tempted to call out for the closest thing he had to a friend, and wish him luck in the ordeals that were to follow, but with the guards watching they contented themselves with encouraging nods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cage had lowered out of his line of sight, Blaze wondered if that was the last he would ever see of the barbarian. Blaze could say with confidence that had he not met Jinx, he may not even be alive at this point, or at the very least his spirit would have been completely broken by now. If there were any drake with the audacity, courage, spirit and intelligence to endure, survive and possibly escape the horrors that were to be in store, it would be Jinx.  The very least that Blaze could do was to do the same\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blaze had more immediate concerns now, as the Kleave had now stepped off the boat. Blaze remained silent as the Kleave delivered his customary series of whippings and insults. He kept his gaze down and miserable, hating the elf, but knowing the humiliation that awaited him if he lashed out the way Kleave was trying to provoke him into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief, Kleave's malicious rage was not reserved for him this day, but rather toward the team of twenty or so half-naked troll slaves assigned to his cage. The trolls hissed and grumbled to themselves in their guttural, trilling language as they fastened Blaze\u2019s cage with a pair of pulling chains. Perhaps as a means to further demonstrate to Blaze the consequences in store should he not remain submissive, Kleave cast a spell, and all of the sudden, their chain collars began crackling a bright red, as the trolls instantly clutched at their necks, groaning and gasping in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could only watch with held breath as they writhed and choked, until finally, mercifully, the Kleave ended the torture. However, this had been too much for one unfortunate troll as it remained thrashing on the ground while foaming at the mouth. A gang of thugs immediately surrounded the troll, whereupon it was mercilessly beaten with clubs, until nothing was left but a limp, battered body. Blaze was left aghast. He\u2019d thought that he\u2019d been treated badly, but he would have bet that any troll would love to exchange places with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet that filth out of my sight\u2026\u201d growled the Kleave. A pair of humanoids unhooked the dead troll from its chain and lifted the limp body as if it weighed nothing more than a feather and tossed it into a large bin, in which limbs from several other bodies could be seen sticking out from the side. The dead troll\u2019s space was then replaced by another unfortunate troll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t want anymore disturbances from you animals!! Get this cage moving now!!\u201d snapped the overseer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze immediately felt sorry or the trolls as they laboriously began hauling Blaze\u2019s cage inland. If they had been treated anywhere near as badly when they had been servants to Nod, it was no wonder that they had risen up into violent rebellion. Yet there was nothing he could do to help them, especially when he already had his claws full trying to keep himself alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, the cage reached its final destination. He found himself at\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cage squeaked and rattled on its wooden sled as it was pulled laboriously uphill along the narrow jungle path.  Three rows of young male trolls were needed to shift the incredible mass of the dragon, iron cage and heavy wooden cart up the hill towards the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was in pain, having been freshly beaten through the bars of his cage for the first time since starting the horrid sea journey which had nearly claimed his life; well, he had been whipped that time that Jinx had eaten the sailor's leg, but at least there had been some sort of <i>reason</i>.  Now it appeared that things were returning to the standard course he'd experienced on the trail from New Alveri.  The sight of the elf - that 'Kleave' - filled Blaze with dread now that he had deigned to depart his - undoubtedly lavish - suite aboard the ship.  He walked alongside the cage and the young drake was afraid to so much as look in his direction, as if looking upon the elf's fine features might bring about the whips of the men trundling along behind the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Kleave seemed more interested in punishing the trolls ahead of him than the cowering Blaze.  The blue skinned humanoids, their legendary ornate tusks clipped and broken just beyond their lips, sweated a smelly lavender liquor as they worked.  And yet no amount of effort seemed to be enough as the cage made but slow progress towards the base of the steaming mountain ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly scarred troll second from the rear in the row nearest the elf stumbled to his knees.  Wearing nothing but a crude loin cloth, the bedraggled humanoid gasped for breath, and struggled to rise.  But not fast enough for the Kleave.  The elvish master strode forward with the lithe effortless speed of his kin and savagely kicked the troll across the chest with a twirling, uprising leg.  The troll was lifted upward into the arms of the one behind him, wheezing.  \"No breaks!  No rest for misbegotten curs like you.  <i>H\u00c3\u00bb \u00c3\u00a0lia durth!</i>\"  The elf spat into the face of the injured troll and stalked back to his place beside the rolling cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his own situation, Blaze could not help but feel horrible for the poor creatures forced to pull the heavy weight of the cage.  If he could have, he would have gladly walked, even riddled with chains, to spare the smaller folk this task.  But Blaze was not daring enough to risk opening his mouth.  Jinx might have been, but then Jinx would probably not have cared a whit about the trolls' plight either.  So Blaze watched them pull and piled the guilt on his shoulders to endure later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some movement to the side, but Blaze was not paying attention, instead keeping his head down and trying to distract himself with the beauty of the passing jungle.  Trails of scent cross the path at intervals, wild boar - of a type strange, and yet familiar - lived on the island.  Then a sharp pain afflicted his temple accompanied by a loud crack.  Blaze let out a weak, coughing growl of pain as the elf laughed, a hand to his midsection and the whip tangling from his hand.  \"No sleep for you either dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip lashed again, this time at the thick joint where his wing met his shoulder.  \"On your feet!  That's right, nice dragon, good dragon.\"  laughed the pitiless elf as Blaze stumbled to his feet within the cage, rocking it and making the trolls' jobs harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze did not speak.  The appearance of dignity was not worth the additional pain.  The young drake was so cowed he still did not look down at the little form who so inflicted this pain on him.  He was only grateful that there was just the elf alone  - for now - and not a dozen more torturers on all sides of him.  Who had he become?   he wondered vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kleave laughed and comanded Blaze to lift one foot, then another, to cross his eyes.  All of which Blaze did without thought, though this did not seem to please the elf so much as irritate him.  \"Bah!  You are no dragon.  <i>Le a nor!</i> A worm!\"  Grimly setting his fine features, the elf lashed out through the bars of the cage repeatedly, not caring where he hit Blaze.  All the drake could do was try to keep the delicate bones of his wing out of the path of the whip.  Fresh bruises rose beneath his already mottled red scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elf tired, he wiped his brow with a white cloth, the tropical heat getting even to him.  He handed off his instrument of pain carelessly to a dirty human assistant.  He sidled closer to the cage, even daring to rest his arm on the lower rim of the shaking cart.  If Blaze could just reach out with a single claw\u2026  But no, nothing was as it seemed with an elvish mage.  This Kleave was never unarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon\u2026  Oh I do so tire of calling you that.  Dragon this, dragon that.\"  Blaze almost opened his mouth to speak his name, something not said much in the past three months, even to Jinx.  The elf saw but decided not to punish him for it.  He waved a hand.  \"Oh, I do know you think you have a name, beast.  But don't worry, they shall give you another very soon.  It should be just around the next bend here\u2026  Ah!  your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was beginning to wonder if the elf was drunk, speaking to him so; not that he much cared with the stinging bruises under his skin.  But he did turn his eyes forward and at the same times realized that the path had leveled out and they were moving faster now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark earthen mouth loomed ahead.  Dwarven make obviously, the angles of the stone-wrought arch were geometrically perfect.  A trapezoid, however, simply plain and unadorned with dwarfish runes which were so common in New Alveri.  Blackness oozed within.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze took a cowardly step back until his tail touched the rear of the 'small' cage.  His only recently healed rectum tightened.  The adjacent penile sheeth throbbed as he clasped his thighs tightly shut.  It remained unmolested so far, but Blaze had the horrible premonition that that might change within the darkness ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf laughed seeing Blaze's reaction.  \"You are afraid, beast.  As you should be!  My touch will shortly seem as light as a <i>wilwarin</i>; butterfly.  Alas, I fear we may never see each other again.\"  said the elf in mock dismay,  \"I am to return up the coast to retrieve yet more young dragons.  We seem to run through them so quickly!  Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obviously the elf's intention to frighten him\u2026 and it was working.  Blaze's spirits sank to a new low and his head nervously tossed this way and that as they entered the darkness under the mountain.  Like a rat aboard a sinking vessel, Blaze wished forlornly to be <i>anywhere</i> else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dragon eyes adjusted quickly to the subterranean light level.  Normally he would have felt at home underground - almost as much as in the air - but not now.  All Blaze felt was unbridled dread.  A dozen scenarios raced through his head.  He wanted to bash himself against his iron cage, kill anything in reach of the bars... but his long voyage had left him weak and lacking energy so there was no hope of breaking the stout bars.  Torture and whipping had brutally subdued any fight in him as well... and Blaze was aware of it.  It shamed him to know it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a right angle turn and now the way was lit with widely spaced lamps.  The elf walked briskly in the gloom, but the trolls and the humans stumbled a bit.  The cage rattled to a stop when the elf walked forward to knock on a door set in the side of the straight, high-ceilinged passage.  He and the room's dwarven occupant exchanged words in Elvish and Blaze wished he'd taken more time to learn it.  As it was, he only caught one word, or rather a number.  Seven.  The dwarf sported a fiery red and twin braided beard and wrote several notes on a large sheet of parchment at the elf's dictation.  The last addition was a single ruby scale - one of his! - attached to the paper with paste.  The elf must have plucked it early on in the journey for it was bright and unmarred.  Afterwards, the dwarf stored the file away in a rack containing many such documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the stone door closed, the elf spoke to the leader of the motley human group.  \"Take it to cell four in C-wing.\"  The human saluted and began to turn, but the elf continued.  He looked disdainfully at the troll he'd kicked earlier.  \"After you get these things back to the pens, cut off that one's ears and have them brought to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beared human did not so much as flinch at the gruesome command.  \"Yessir.\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he was wheeled off and carefully forced into a new stinking cell, the elf spoke again briefly to Blaze.  \"Well then.  Welcome to Darm\u00c3\u00bbt... <i>Flamer-7</i>.  If you are strong, and lucky, you just might be a part of history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf's departing cackle seemed to echo in the stone walls long after Blaze was shoved into his cell and left to wallow in darkness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze laid curled in the darkness of his new cell, shivering and frightened. The temptation was extremely strong to keep his head down and close himself away from the misery that surrounded him. Gingerly, he forced himself to lean his head against the bars of his cell and look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center of the chamber was a bloody, ragged mess of mangled bones, rotting excrement and ever-present flies. Fat vermin the size of a humanoid child scurried about the chamber like kings. Yet the most horrifying and heart wrenching sight beheld him when he gazed to the side. There were several other holding cells identical to his, and imprisoned within were young fire drakes like himself. They laid there dull, lifeless and broken, uncomprehending toward the world. In fact, the Fire Drake in the cell to right was a dead stinking corpse, literally nothing more than a mat of skin and bones. Yet its jaw was screwed into one of intense agony; it had died a horrific death it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight nearly made Blaze lose his mind, and probably would have in short order, when a voice broke out from the opposite side of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re 7 eh? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be just like him soon!!\u201d growled a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shocked Blaze out of his madness, as he raised his head across the dingy chamber toward a thick fire drake that had previously been asleep. His hide was filthy with dirt, grime and dried blood, more brown than red now. There was a predatory glint in the drake\u2019s eyes, one that immediately chilled him to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons like you get replaced all the time you know\u2026\u201d he said, in a matter of fact kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the uneasiness Blaze felt, the drake across from him seemed to be the only one who had his wits about him. \u201cR-replacement? What do you mean?\u201d answered Blaze, though he already suspected what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake across from him delivered a scathing laughter. \u201cThe cell you\u2019re in right now used to belong to Flamer 3 and then 5. I\u2019ve watched two losers who used to be in that same cell as you get brought here, waste away and then get replaced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear once more gnawed at Blaze\u2019s belly as he pondered how long it would take until he became a lifeless corpse like the others. \u201cI can already tell that both of them had more fight than you do. I\u2019m betting it won\u2019t take any more than two weeks for you to become the third\u2026 Everyone here knows I\u2019m the strongest dragon here, and the sooner that you accept that fact I might decide to let you live a bit longer,\u201d he taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was completely taken aback by the drake\u2019s attitude. It was one thing when it was the Kleave tormenting them, as no matter how much he could defy him, ultimately there was nothing he could do against him. Yet the fact that this dragon was openly taunting the fact that he\u2019d taken satisfaction from deliberately breaking the will and causing the deaths of his own peers, fellow prisoners like himself, caused a surge of great anger began to build within his hearts. Back at the orphanage, Blaze had faced his share of bullying from the older fledglings, but back then, Darzhja had been there to stand up to them. Though he wasn\u2019t the bravest dragon in all of Nod, somebody had to tell that bully and not let him do whatever he wanted, even in a place like this, or rather, especially in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right that I\u2019ll probably be dead before too long, and that there\u2019s nothing we can do against the slavers. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to take shit from an asshole like you!!\u201d snapped Blaze. The outburst shook all the other dragons awake, and while they weren\u2019t exactly energized with great enthusiasm, they were now at least taking an active interest in what was going on in their otherwise dreary and meaningless lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you think eh? I\u2019ve heard 4 and 5 say that you know. What makes me think you\u2019ll be different?\u201d he taunted. Blaze knew that calling him out like that would focus all of the attention of Flamer-2 onto himself, but it was clear that he wasn\u2019t out to make friends here. If Flamer-2 would become a sworn enemy, he had to do something that would force the other drake to hesitate before deciding to trifle with him again. In fact, the best way to get their respect was to do something absolutely reckless and insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d snarled Blaze, suddenly alert from his stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-2,\u201d the drake responded without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-2\u201d sniffed Blaze with disdain, \u201cI meant your real name\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden intake of breath amongst the others. Blaze hadn\u2019t realized the ruckus he\u2019d caused by asking this simple question. The bully was taken aback, \u201cDo you take me for a fool? I\u2019m not about to get suckered into getting tortured for something like that!! Especially from a dumb newbie!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Blaze didn\u2019t think he would be that stupid; speaking his name out loud would no doubt enrage the humanoids and result in him getting sodomized at best, yet that wasn\u2019t the point. He had unsettled Flamer-2, and Blaze grinned as a result, even though in his heart he was scared out of his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze pressed himself against the bars of his cell, \u201cSo, all your boasts about being the strongest dragon here are nothing but a lie. You delude yourself into thinking that you\u2019re the strongest, but in reality the fact that you accept the name Flamer-2 so easily only shows that you\u2019ve fully embraced the fact you are a tool for them. However, if you really think you\u2019re so brave and tough, that you\u2019re actually a dragon instead of a beast, and though I\u2019ve got no choice but to be called Flamer-7, I don\u2019t have to accept it. So how about it? Both of us will say our names!! Will it get us tortured, definitely, but it\u2019ll prove that we really are dragons and not slaves. Are you a drake or are you a beast?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 hesitated and looked deeply troubled, and Blaze took that opportunity to pull off his gambit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Blaz-fyraird. One day I\u2019m getting out of here and make all those bastards pay for what they did to us!!\u201d he shouted. Jinx would likely be proud of him; there was time where accepting pain was worth the point he wanted to get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet just when Blaze was about to relish in Flamer-2\u2019s uneasy scowl, the collar around Blaze\u2019s neck glowed a sinister blue color. A shattering pain encompassed every inch of his body, as he let out a horrific scream. The high-voltage electric shock had lasted only for several seconds, but it felt like centuries, leaving Blaze literally smoking in his cell and his body twitching, loosing his bowels upon the coarse, stone floor. His vision faded in and out, until moments later he fell unconscious, wondering if his outburst had been worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke...</span></div></div>",

Run a full Magicka Spectrum Analysis on the plasma and have the results on my desk by this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of footsteps departing, now quite clear.  It was about this time that Blaze realized that he was not dreaming these strange voices.  For one thing, he could <i>smell</i> the occupants of the room, five distinct scents, all elvish.  Blaze's powerful nose strangely gave no hint of the larger room around which seemed polished and sterile.  He only caught the whiff of disinfectant, clean oiled steel and one or two bottles of odiferous chemicals not stoppered properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the young dragon realized he was conscious, it was only the caution ground into him over the last few months as well as his innate wiliness that kept him from opening his scaly eyelids.  <i>Listen.  Observe.  They don't know I'm awake... yet.</i>  Blaze thought and the allure of what the elves might let slip while they thought him unable to hear was far more tantalizing than the thought of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze kept his breathing slow and even.  And through fine movements in each of his limbs, came to realize that he was strapped securely down to the floor.  Not as cruel as the sheer iron manicles he was used to, these restraints were leather padded.  However, they were all quite snug and Blaze hadn't a hope that he could break free of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blaze was coming to realize that all his legs - and his neck and tail as well - were pinned to the floor and his wings were hobbled by some leather harness fixing them to his back, someone lifted his scaly jowls and ran a palm down his filmy teeth.  \"Second set of incisors fully set...\"  The hand traveled farther down his snout towards his jaw.  \"Third set of molars just breaching the surface.  Indicates age of forty to forty-five years.\"  Another set of hands at the front of his snout pried his mouth open.  A hand gripped one of the serrated fangs in the side of his mouth.  \"Roots... firm.  No obvious signs of decay.  Gum discoloration indicates vitamin deficiency.  Liander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prescribe supplement plan A for this drake.  Make sure the feed officer doesn't short change this one.  We can't afford to cut corners in getting this one healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?  Permission to speak freely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted\" said the elder voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this one has...  <i>potential</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause and then the voice said, \"Perhaps.  He certainly made quite a show of himself activating the shock collar just an hour after containment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that, Sir.  The shock collar is going to need to be replaced.  The power supply is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead?  He hasn't even been here a day.  How can it be used up already?\"  For the first time, the elder voice, the one who was probing his teeth, sounded surprised, maybe even concerned.  \"How many seconds did it discharge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir.  It's impossible to say.  The capacitor was overloaded as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... intriguing...\"  The voice said the words like melting wax.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice cut in, higher pitched, perhaps female.  \"I wouldn't make too much of it, Doctor Moridin.  The capacitor probably just shorted out from exposure to salt water near the docks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dear, Auyandrith.  If the capacitor was indeed shorted, how do you explain this dragon surviving the entire discharge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could imagine her waving a hand in dismissal.  \"Oxidation.  The power supply was probably weak to start with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All possibilities...\"  said the doctor vaguely.  \"However, undoubtedly, this young male has surv-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, the screen reads-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a snap and then a high pitch yelp of pain.  \"How dare you interrupt me?!\" roared the doctor, whose fingers left Blaze's mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but sir...\"  mewled the assistant.  \"The n-nueral map.  It reads heightened activity in cognition areas A through D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother aide spoke from the opposite side of Blaze.  \"Heart rate has increased to 42 bpm... and is still increasing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how could Blaze keep his hearts from pounding?  They were on to him!  If only he could force himself to sink back into the safety of unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one called Auyandrith said.  \"That means he's waking up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a low chuckling from the doctor and Blaze heard footsteps approach his head while all the rest were backing away.  \"No, my dear apprentice.  It means he's been awake.  Haven't you... <i>Blaze</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his name, dripping from foreign unreverant lips snapped open the young drake's eyes.  His pupils immediately went slit in the white sterile light.  All around was white floor, white, crisply glowing ceiling, white coated elves with fair skin and fair hair.  Blaze almost thought he'd gone blind.  But his clever eyes began to adapt and he noticed the metallic surfaces of the steel tables around him, but also the unusual silver instruments lying on them, many of which were sharp or pronged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those first few moments, Blaze strained against his bonds, but soon gave it up after a few futile pulls, deciding to conserve his energy.  The elves returned now that it was proven that his restraints would hold.  Mirth lay in their eyes at his helplessness, except the eyes of the elf before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy scaled lids hooding his eyes, Blaze observed a tall, straight elf.  His face was comely with the ageless features common to his race, however the lines about his eyes betrayed a great age and even greater experience.  His white buttoned coat was flawless like his silver hair tied in a neat pony tail behind his head.  On his hands the elf wore skin-tight purple gloves of a type Blaze only ever saw at a large hospital, but above the wrists, the skin was marred, the only imperfection, scarred as if by acid burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze breathed slowly, cautiously.  Blaze relaxed into his bonds and looked up at the elf with one eye, expecting some sort of trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor spoke again.  \"Blaze.\"  The name rang in his ears, unheard for so long!  \"That was your name wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'was' 'wasn't'  past synonyms.</i>  One of the crystal screen somehow displaying Blaze's vitals betrayed his growing anxiety.  Blaze had only been punished for daring to address an elf before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this one different?  Could it possibly be?  He has spoken his name.  Not his 'real' name granted, but one he identified with just as strongly.  Somehow the elf had known it.  How?  \"H-how?\"  The word escaped him and the elf did not deliver pain.  Blaze continued with his question.  \"How did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf lifted his head nonchalantly and sniffed.  \"I know many things and it is because my job is to know them.\" said Dr. Moridin condescendingly, as if Blaze were simple, but also as if he held a great store of compassion for simple beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was almost quaking with fear of the elf, feeling as though he were entering a game which he did not know the rules and offered steep penalties for missteps.  Perhaps he did simply have a knack for getting into trouble, but he could not stop himself from asking carefully,  \"Why are you speaking to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor clasped his hands together.  \"Well, why wouldn't I speak to a fine young drake such as yourself?  My job is to collect information after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf was lying.  Blaze could smell the subtle odor in his sweat.  But it was just a partial truth.  Blaze took this to mean that the elf did more than just collect information... he probably used it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze settled his jaw on the floor, it was easier than feeling the padded brace against the back of his head.  It didn't matter if this elf had decided to speak to him.  If he were free this moment, he'd slaughter the lot of them and try to break for the main-shore.  The doctor probably knew this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another period of silence, Dr. Moridin continued, \"I would like to ask you a few questions, and it would be helpful if you could answer to the best of your ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze narrowed his eyes, sure that they were going to start torturing information out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no.  One of the aides brought forth a small ice box which rolled along the floor.  From it, the doctor removed a fat hog shank before sitting on the lid of the low chest.  He waved it in front of Blaze's wide nostrils.  \"There will be rewards for your cooperation of course.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If they had been in New Alveri just a few days after his capture, Blaze would have refused flatly.  It rankled to be forced to the level of revealing information in exchange for food.  It didn't matter what information it was, if the elves wanted it, then they should be prevented from having it.  He should have resisted their organization at any level it was possible to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then had come the long months of slow starvation, isolation and cramped, inescapable confinement.  The whips and the long, lubricated wooden poles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Blaze long for that fat, juicy hog shank.  It wasn't even fresh, but it was untainted, preserved in the ice box.  It was far more than Blaze had known for months and right now he'd have given anything to bite into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Moridin, the tall thin elf in the coat before him was dangling the generous hunk of meat from the bone in front if his eagerly sniffing nostrils.  There was no hope of resisting, he might have even thought of taking the pole again to have a proper meal at last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elvish doctor's eyes glinted at the absolute lust in Blaze's.  He snapped his fingers with his free hand.  \"Bring me the glove.  It seems our patient is willing to cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young female elf sauntered up from the side, carrying a small wooden box carefully.  She opened it and removed the tight purple glove on the doctor's right hand, replacing it with one of grey cloth.  It was a glove of unusual style, for sure.  The fingers were laced with silver fibers which wove in arcane designs on the palm and came back each finger in fairly thick wire.  It almost looked like some sort of <i>device</i>.  Blaze even imagined he heard a faint *click* when it was pulled down to the elf's wrist.  \"Now loosen the drake's neck restraint, Auyandrith.  Carefully, mind you.  We want our guest to be able to eat more comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did as she was commanded by her senior, standing behind Blaze's head and unbuckling the restraint several notches.  Blaze kept still.  Ancestors only knew what would befall him if he tried to take advantage.  Besides, all his other limbs were still firmly held in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the padded restraint was adjusted, Dr. Moridin tossed Blaze the shank with an easy underhand throw.  He snapped it up in his jaws and devoured it greedily, his teeth snapping right through the thick bone.  He decided to feel degraded later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Good...\" said the doctor in drawn out syllables.  \"That was a gift, in good faith.  Let it not be said that there is not a single good-hearted person on this gods-forsaken island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze rumbled assent, chewing and savoring fresh meat for the first time in months.  With some more decent food like this, he might even be able to pass the plug of dried jerky which had been clogging his system for the last week of the sea voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin then reached into the ice chest he was sitting on and retrieved - wonder heaped on wonder! - a long, whole beef tenderloin, still bloody and dripping on the floor.  The elf set it down, Blaze's nose snuffling in its direction.  The shank had only rekindled his former hunger with a vengeance it seemed just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one you will have to work for.\"  said the doctor, and Blaze shuddered, knowing that he would indeed answer anything the humanoid asked.  \"Tell me, have you been sexually active in the past?  and if so, with how many partners...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf proceeded not to ask about possible secrets of the inner workings of New Alveri, as Blaze had expected, but questions about Blaze himself.  He inquired about his prior sex life (non existent, but come on!  he was just entering puberty!).  He asked about past illnesses, allergies, injuries.  And then came the psychological questions which were far more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, the doctor would toss Blaze a small steak about the size of his hand, but a tidbit to the young dragon.  All the time, the long tapered tube of soft tenderloin continued to slowly leak its juices across the floor.  Dr Moridin constructed hypothetical scenarios and asked Blaze how he would react.  They ranged from finding a lost female, alone and gravid out on a distant trail to carrying out executions if he were a soldier in the military.  For the most part, Blaze did not have any problems answering the questions.  They seemed innocuous enough.  When it came to decisions between duty or authority and moral values, Blaze typically sided with his morals, even when faced with possible punishment.  When it came to punishing wrongdoers, Blaze tended to be lenient, trying to understand the others' position.  Dr. Moridin's face was a flawless mask, not revealing what sort of answers he was looking for, if indeed he was looking for a certain type of answer.  Everything Blaze said was recorded on paper by his female assistant, that Auyandrith.  Slowly, Blaze became more comfortable with the questions and the steady rewards of food, waxing more eloquent and detailed in his responses.  He was relieved to have someone to actually listen to him!  Soon the words were simply spilling out of him with hardly any thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat line of questioning seemed to end all too soon.  Dr. Moridin did not reward Blaze after the last question.  Instead he put his elbows on his knees and stared at Blaze for a long time.  His eyes were hard, calculating.  Undoubtedly, he was trying to figure out where Blaze was going to fit into his grand scheme.  \"Young Drake...\"  said the doctor who had not used Blaze's name since the first time.  \"You do like females, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" emphatically answered Blaze, affronted by the notion that there might be any possibility of the alternative.  Nasty ideas of rumors concerning how many times he'd needed 'subduing' circulating around the compound filled Blaze with illogical dread concerning the fate of his perceived masculinity.  \"Of course I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin traced his thumb down the strip of beard at the bottom of his chin.  \"And what would you do, if there was a fertile female, here.  Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze hesitated at the unusual question.  \"I'd...  I mean, I'd be interested of course... but...  I don't understand what you're asking.\"  Blaze finally gave up.  He rested his jaw on the ground, wishing the elf would just give him the tenderloin already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really quite simple.  If there were a receptive female, here.  Would you... <i>fuck her?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time Blaze saw the madness stirring behind those intelligent knowing eyes.  Something deeper even than the sadist elf who had accompanied him from New Alveri, something corrupt at the very core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....n-no.\"  Blaze stammered.  \"I-I'd want to get to know her first.\"  Honesty came more easily than expected.  The amount of time he'd been interrogated already was hard to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf stood.  \"Well that's too bad, really.  I was hoping you were a strong, virile young male.  Females like initiative, you know...\"  He walked closer to Blaze's snout.  \"But then, perhaps you aren't being fully honest with me.  Maybe you just need the right stimuli...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf fearlessly rested his hand on Blaze's nose, the one with the silver glove.  Blaze flinched at the touch, which was like an electric spark.  His left eye twitched and he felt suddenly strange, as if there was tension all along his body, under the skin.  His nose filled with a wet, hot musk.  Blaze sighed, smelling the pungent perfume of a female in heat.  It called to his bones and filled his muscles with tight, pent-up energy.  But the smell was just a little off, it <i>sparkled</i>, it had just a slightly metallic after-scent.  It wasn't real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course it wasn't, there was no female here that Blaze could see, but his body was convinced.  The reaction that doctor was looking for happened swiftly as Blaze extended out of his penile slit.  His full length throbbed hot against the cool floor, painful with his sudden, desperate need.  This was a new form of degradation, not as painful as the other, but just as harmful to his soul.  The elf sniffed.  \"A fair size, and I imagine you still have growing to do, young one.\"  laughed the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell suddenly abated, as if a switch had been pulled, but Blaze was left in his uselessly, and embarrassingly excited state.  His jaw clenched, determined to make the elf pay for his trick.  \"You...\"  Blaze started, but, quick as a thought, the muscles in Blaze's body turned to stone.  He couldn't even breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty drake.\"  chided Dr. Moridin, \"But you'll learn.  You'll learn if you want to keep that precious package of yours intact.\"  The elf leaned down and stared into Blaze's eye.  \"I can play your nervous system like a musical instrument.  I can make sweet music, or bend it out of tune... even break it.\"  His hand slid up Blaze's snout, never leaving contact with his skin.  \"Your electrical impulses call to me, Flamer-7.  They tell me your true nature.  They tell me about the beast that you really are.  The fragile intellect you cling to is just a fragile film over a monster within, easily broken.  That's why dragons need control.  You need US.\"  Blaze felt horror at what the elf was saying, at the fact that it could possibly be true.  \"We're here to give your kind desperately needed order.  We're here to save you from yourselves.  Never forget that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gasped as his diaphragm was allowed to relax.  However, he was still filled with mortal dread at the elf whose hand rested lightly on his brow and yet could probably kill him with a thought.</span></div></div>",

It would seem that our meeting has come to an end,\" said Dr. Moridin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze did not dare respond, too deeply humiliated to even look at the elf's face. The next moment, a gray tube descended near Blaze's jaw. It smelled foul and made him woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink the contents that come from the spout...\" ordered Auyundrith with no expression whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" cried Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet before he knew what was happening the metal tube was forced into his jaw and a foul tasting liquid, like a combination of aged piss and other unimaginable chemicals was dumped down his throat. His vision immediately began to glaze in and out, and before he could even think about fighting to stay awake, Blaze fell unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome undetermined time later, Blaze awoke groggily in his cell. His mouth still had the bitter aftertaste of that sleeping drug they had given him (or at least that's what he hoped it was all it was), and futhermore, a brand-new inhibitor was clamped around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed around. All the other dragons were deep asleep, as well as Flamer-2. Otherwise, he had no way of knowing whether it was day or night. Blaze shook his head; he could not know what type of horrible ordeals he would be forced to endure, but it seemed prudent to get sleep when he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blaze\u2019s thoughts were consumed by what Dr. Moridin had just done to him. That also brought back the deep disgust that he had so easily allowed himself to be manipulated in that fashion. They\u2019d tossed him food as if he were a rat or a monkey, but then again compared to the other outrages he\u2019d already faced that was rather tame. However, he wondered why he had been so intent about asking him questions about females. He was interested, of course, yet Lady Ramoth had suppressed any possibility of sexual affections; and besides, it never really occurred to him to think too hard on the subject anyhow until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to him. If they had young drakes imprisoned within their stronghold, who was to say that they hadn\u2019t kidnapped young drakka as well for some nefarious purpose? Maybe they intended to have the males breed with them? If so, that wouldn\u2019t be quite so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sniffed. That was pretty unlikely. Besides, why would the Kleaves do anything that would allow the drakes anything desirable like that? Probably it had only been a means of humiliation to bring them up like that. Yet Blaze couldn\u2019t help but reflect upon the awkward questions that Dr. Moridin had brought up about young drakka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing he did know was that if there were any young drakka on this island, they were probably sad and lonely like he was. In a way, it was oddly comforting to think of this, and he was filled with a sudden longing that he could be there with one of them and tell her everything was going to be all right. He imagined her thanking him, and Blaze wrapping his body around her and keeping her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shameful, but it also made him feel aroused to think of that\u2026 maybe there might be a mistake and he\u2019d end up in the same cell with another female\u2026 He let out a soft snort, feeling desperately irritable. The smell from the Dr. Moridin lingered on in his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out a sigh as he ground his nether regions against the stone floor.  He peered out through the bars nervously, making sure that all the other drakes were still asleep, before retreating to fondle himself again. He never would have done something like this back in New Alveri, but after the last few months of constant humiliation, squalid conditions and suffocating boredom he was desperate for anything reprieve. Besides, there wasn't much to be self-conscious of anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he felt his body quiver, and Blaze had to make a concentrated effort to suppress his cry. He took a few seconds to catch his breath, and slowly and somewhat mortifyingly looked for a way to hide the mess he\u2019d made. Over in the corner of his cell was a pile of sand that served as a litter box, similar to the ones felines used. He scooped his mess into the sand, and right when Blaze thought nobody had seen or heard him do it, he heard a slight laugh emerge from the cell next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze instantly tensed, hoping that whoever that was hadn\u2019t heard him. Whatever small reputation he had gained from his outburst against Flamer-2 could fizzle out right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed Flamer-7, everyone here does it once and a while\u2026\u201d said a voice to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blaze flashed a disdainful look at the dragon from the cell to his left, too enraged and mortified to answer the voice. The fire drakes eyes were open and vapid, as if he had snorted an entire barrel of cinnabar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Flamer-4. Anyhow, best to enjoy what you have for the time being. You do know what I heard what\u2019s going to happen to us males after a while right?\u201d he whispered, that indolent grin on the drake\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Blaze could imagine all sorts of horrid possibilities, but he really did not want to be dragged into this incredibly awkward conversation right now. Still, he thought it best to give an answer, if only to make sure that the weird dragon wouldn't decide to hold this over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's going to happen to us then?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I heard that they cut off our balls after a while\u2026\u201d he said, his gazed tilted up toward the ceiling. Blaze instantly squeezed his legs together, which once again made Flamer-4 giggle. The reaction instantly made him outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to screw with my mind, then go bother somebody else\u2026\u201d Blaze hissed. There was a chance that it could be a bluff, yet Blaze did remember Dr. Moridin hinting about something about him keeping \u2018that precious package of his\u2019. If that was to be his fate, then Blaze would definitely start looking for the first possible way to escape, no matter how suicidal the odds, or more likely, find a way to quickly commit suicide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought you\u2019d like to know Flamer-7. In anycase, I thought it was very brave of you to stand up to Flamer-2 like that. He always makes things harder for everyone else\u2026\u201d he said in a tone that Blaze wished didn\u2019t sound so fond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2026\u201d sighed Blaze, curving his head away and back toward the ground. Perhaps he was gay, which stood reason why he might have been listening in like that and not minding as much of having his balls cut off. Or perhaps it was the fact that in a place like this, young drakes were slowly and irreversibly losing their minds in this period of desperate boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Blaze settled in to daze some more, the ceiling torch instantly turned bright, and Blaze had to cover his gaze for the time being. Everyone who wasn\u2019t already close to death rose awoke with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA team of ragged humanoids burst into the rooms, brandishing their usual array of whips and clubs. They began shouting at the top of their breaths, announcing that<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The party consisted of as many dwarfs as humans, all dirty and soot-flaked.  The leader of the bunch, a beady eyed dwarf with a wild brown mane, walked down the aisle with a clip board in hand.  He gestured to select cages as his underlings banged their clubs against the bars, the walls, anything within reach.  They obviously wanted to startle and intimidate with the racket.  They certainly succeeded with the first part, but so soon after his experience with the dread doctor, it was going to take more than apes with sticks to frighten him; even if they had earned his grudging respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head dwarf only walked partway down the wing which terminated just beyond cells seven and eight, both currently unoccupied.  He looked down at his clipboard and then again at a young drake in the wall opposite Blaze's cell, to the left of the one opposite his.  Flamer-2's cell.  The Fire-lord scowled as he was selected.  He was made to place his paws through the bars of his cell so that he could be manacled.  It was rather laborious since they insisted on shackling the forepaws to the rear, the chain spanning them left with only enough give to allow one step at a time.  This was done under the threat of spears an a single glistening pole, though Blaze was fairly sure these were just for show.  They all had around their necks all the disabling power their captors really needed.  But Blaze mused that perhaps wooden poles were still cheaper than inhibitor power supplies;  he didn't really care to find out which method was prefered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, Flamer-2's cell door was slid aside and the dragon was led out down the hallway out of Blaze's wing to the main passage.  Blaze's heart sank when the hairy dwarf looked his way.  With a nod and a lazy point of the hand, Blaze was soon coerced to put his paws through the bars.  He desperately wanted to know where he was going, but he didn't dare open his mouth, not with the pole glistening wetly just half a dragon-length away.  <i>Besides, I'm probably going to find out in just a few moments\u2026</i>  He thought resignedly as he was led away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy weight of the inhibitor collar slid down the length of his neck as he paced slowly down a descending stone passage.  It stopped just below his neck heart where the leather padded iron ring was just tight enough to be uncomfortable, the iron plated cube which housed the collar's machinery was a clumsy necklace that he had to bear for he could not lift a forepaw high enough to adjust it and keep walking at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the humans cajoling each other in an undisciplined manner at his flanks, Blaze had already gathered their general destination.  He was heading towards the bottom of the facility, to aid in further excavation and expansion.  Flamer-2's scent trail hung heavily in the air, his unwashed spoor tickling his nostrils with its unpleasantness.  All in all, it did not sound unbearable.  Blaze was tired of being cooped up and constantly restrained, if he could vent some of his frustration on the unfeeling rock of the mountain\u2026 that might be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually the tunnels lost the straight edged dwarven precision of the levels above, the floor and walls growing uneven, the passage more constricted.  The air was denser and warmer, the ventilation poor.  The sounds of scraping and the almost musical ping of picks against rock grew in Blaze's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rounded a bend and Blaze was startled to see a large dragon ahead.  Most definitely not a Fire-lord, this tall drake looked like cross between a Sky-swallower and a Bronze.  He was digging with a slow, but steady rhythm against a sheer stone wall.  As he scratched at the stone, trolls, and sometimes chained humans, shoveled away the debris and carried it away in wheelbarrows back up the way they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze tried to meet the dragon's eyes, but he did not look up from his work as he bent his broad back into the task.  That was when Blaze noticed his scent.  It was altered somehow.  If smell were light, it would be as if the normal brazier of another healthy male had been toned down to the level of a single candle.  His scent was watered down, inoffensive, but strange, neither male nor female to repertoire of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blaze guessed the truth.  <i>They do neuter drakes here\u2026</i>  he thought with dismay.  His internal testicles seemed to slid up into the cavity of his abdomen.  The thought of being maimed in that way, of becoming half a dragon, was enough to send hot tears sliding down his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the human escorts jabbed Blaze's shoulder with the butt of his spear.  \"This way.\" he barked and Blaze dragged his chains down a side passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pads crushed rocks which were strewn all over the floor here.  He coughed once, the air filled with dust.  The picks and claws banging against he stone echoed around in a crushing din.  Perhaps Blaze might have preferred to stay in his cell after all\u2026  And he was beginning to feel a little nauseous, undoubtedly some after effect of the brew Dr. Moridin had slid down his throat.  Also, as the fresh meat was making its way down his system, Blaze was hit with the urge to shit for the first time in over a week.  It was a relief from the torture of cramping, yet it couldn't have come at a more inopportune time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the end of the branching, growing tunnels.  Blaze groaned in a complaint unrelated to the choked rumbling in his lower abdomen.  There ahead of him was Flamer-2.  He was having his manacles taken off in preparation for digging work.  Blaze found it hard to believe that Flamer-2 would not try to reassert his dominance over him while they were working together.  The younger, more inexperienced drake did not feel confident in testing their relative strengths.  Blaze bent down in pain, trying to contain himself.  Especially not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he mention his pressing need to the guards?  The hairy dwarf was still following behind, walking beside the man wielding the hated pole.  Surely they had some provision for this if they kept drakes working down here for long periods of time?  Maybe he could even get assigned a different tunnel to work on or a different partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again\u2026  Something in Blaze <i>did</i> desire confrontation.  To have their conflict solidified in honorable combat, even if that combat had to be reduced to shoves and nips when the guards' backs were turned.  He wanted to show Flamer-2 that he was not someone who he could push around.  With all of the threats around here to his masculinity, Blaze thought that it might even be an opportunity to be relished.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze felt his pride rankle as he turned to face the dwarf, \"Is there anywhere I can relieve myself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" snapped the dwarf. \"An...why should eye let ye do that eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw Flamer-2 grin, as if anticipating the beating. A pair of the dwarves thugs brandished their whips, while the dwarfs hand fingered a rune that he figured would activate the collar around his neck. Blaze strained, desperately trying to think of some way to avoid a messy and humiliating outcome, and at that moment came an unexpected stroke of genius. He remembered that the guards weren\u2019t treated much better than the prisoners, nor were they particularly smart, nor were they inherently cruel by nature and without either the mad doctor or the cruel transit carriers keeping watch to stir up fear, he was confident he could negotiate some sort of deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....I really have to go... I don\u2019t want to end up having to stink the place up and make things miserable for you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I'll work an extra hour in the mines if you let me go!!\" growled Blaze. He even meant his last pledge. He'd become skilled at this sort of negotiation when he was helping out in the merchant district, and there was no reason why this couldn't work here.  Plus, dwarves in particular appreciated those offering to shoulder extra work voluntarily, and he thought it would be a good idea to get on the handler\u2019s good side quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then... I'll take you tae relieve yourself, but its back to work right after that!! I'm holding you to your word dragon!!\" the dwarf growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d answered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled Blaze away toward another tunnel where an wretched stink drifted forth. It was a giant, hastily made cesspool, which was so overwhelming in its stench that it nearly made Blaze vomit. Even though his standards of cleanliness had degenerated greatly since New Alveri, this was a new low in terms of sheer squalor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drifted toward a relatively cleaner section of the cesspool, (which currently was being cleaned up by an unfortunate troll slave) squatted down and violently expelled a weeks worth of clogged up sewage, sighing with an almost exquisite relief. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNo sooner was he finished did he immediately rush out, whereupon the dwarf handler quickly escorted him back to the edge of the tunnel. Flamer-2 glared at him with a combination of rage and disbelief that Blaze was able to get what he wanted virtually scott free. He\u2019d gotten another leg up upon Flamer-2, but the thinly consumed rage in the rivals eye worried him. No doubt that he was planning some way to get him back for his stunt, so it was best to keep prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for the first couple of hours or so, the two young drakes worked in stony silence. Blaze had done this kind of work every so often in one of the various jobs that Lady Ramoth had assigned to him at the orphanage so after a few initial missteps he got the hang of this work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen guards attention began to drift, Flamer-2 began his retaliation. It started very subtly at first. As he dug, he would do so in such a way that dirt and pebbles would shower over Blaze with each strike of the claw. It would get in his eyes and into his nostrils. Blaze tried to ignore it at first; he knew in his gut that if drawn into direct physical confrontation with Flamer-2 he\u2019d probably lose. Blaze curved his gaze over toward Flamer-2, yet the other drake gave him an impassive expression, as if he weren\u2019t doing anything wrong. After an hour of this, it got to the point where Blaze felt he had to retaliate or else he\u2019d never stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to catch the larger dragon by surprise, Blaze snatched a particularly large chunk of dirt and rock with his tail and flung it in the direction of Flamer-2. A lot of it caught Flamer-2, as he\u2019d hoped, but unfortunately a large cloud of dust also drifted over toward the guards standing watch. They coughed and gagged, before focusing their gazes toward Blaze. Right then Blaze knew he\u2019d made a mistake and had played right into Flamer-2\u2019s trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-7!! I\u2019ll have you know that I will not tolerate mischief at this time!!\u201d snarled the dwarf in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut sir\u2026 Flamer-2 was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze briefly switched his gaze toward Flamer-2, who gazed as if daring him to tattle on him. No, that would be a bad idea. A hatchling would tattle, not a drake, and thus like a drake Blaze had to accept that Flamer-2 had gotten the better of him this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize sir, it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d answered Blaze, lowering his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf handler grunted, but nonetheless seemed satisfied he decided just to accept whatever punishment he got. One of the human guards strode over and administered a sharp, painful whack across Blaze\u2019s back with a whip. Blaze bit back the pain, conscious not to cry out in front of Flamer-2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe lucky it ain\u2019t worse than that!! Get back to work!!\u201d growled the dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze turned to resume his work, he could not help but catch a glimpse of that hideous grin of triumph on Flamer-2\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSucker\u2026\u201d he whispered, giving Blaze a poke on the wing joint before getting back to work. Blaze could only steam in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Blaze was more careful in his retaliations. The rest of the shift, Flamer-2 contented himself with shoving and nipping at Blaze. He gave it back as best he could, yet when he responded he did so while still worried about the guards seeing him do it. However, Flamer-2 seemed to have an uncanny knack for bumping, shoving and poking without drawing the attention of any of the guards. It also prevented him from getting as much work done as he could have. For all of his constant harassment of Blaze, Flamer-2 excavated a far larger quantity of rock and mineral than Blaze could, a testament to his superior physical strength and his experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, Blaze was both physically and mentally exhausted. His claws were raw and bleeding, and every muscle of his body ached, accentuating the small bruises received from Flamer-2\u2019s constant badgering. Yet he couldn\u2019t afford to show how exhausted he was in front of Flamer-2, who didn\u2019t seem to grow tired at all from what he could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what really rankled was when a guard (the dwarf handler had ended his shift hours before) congratulated Flamer-2 on a job well done, and promptly having one of his guards bring down a large, juicy slab of meat, which Flamer-2 savored in an exaggerated fashion specifically to torment Blaze. Afterwards, Flamer-2 was manacled and escorted back up toward the cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was left to labor on for the next hour that he had agreed to, in which every minute of that hour felt like an hour in and of itself. By then, he wanted nothing more than to simply collapse into a heap and hopefully never wake up ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his ordeal was finished, and like a zombie, allowed the guards to escort Blaze back to his cell. Compared to the long day at the mines, being back in his rough, dusty cell was almost like being back in the egg. As he sprawled himself on the ground, his last thought before falling asleep was whether he had successfully held his own against Flamer-2. </span></div></div>",

It was Flamer-2. \u201cIf you won\u2019t, I certainly will!!\u201d he growled, and instantly began raping her in the most brutal way imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! Stop!!\u201d shouted Blaze. Yet the doctor blocked off the scene with that deadly gaze of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have disappointed me Flamer-7\u2026 I thought you a drake, but it seems you are but a cowardly hatchling\u2026\u201d said Dr. Moridin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThus, I see no reason for you to keep your package\u2026\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze squirmed against his restraints. \u201cPlease!! No!! Not that!! Give me another chance!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze went delirious with fear as Dr. Moridin\u2019s gloved hand transformed into what could only be described as a long, flexible metallic tentacle with a serrated edge, aimed right at his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! No!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Blaze\u2019s eyes snapped open, panting at the top of his breath. He was back in his cell, as he quickly discovered. It had only been a bad dream, of which he\u2019d had many of since his imprisonment. Yet it was only after he\u2019d checked between his legs and discovered that everything was where it was supposed to be did he finally breath a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get a hold of myself\u2026\u201d Blaze panted to himself. He remembered Darzhja telling him that the worst possible thing to do in the heat of battle wasn\u2019t necessarily being scared. It was panicking. He\u2019d panicked on the day New Alveri was attacked, and that was the reason why he was languishing in a stinking, clammy, vermin-riddled prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much time for him to reflect, as right then, the central torch came on. Whether or not it truly signaled the coming of morning or not was irrelevant at this point; there was no way to tell what time of day it was inside this clammy cave, but what he did know was that he had to be alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarven handler and his usual team of thugs came forth, but this time they had a team of trolls hauling a large pot. The smell that came from the pot was extremely foul, as if twenty different varieties of meat had deliberately been left to rot, and then injected with fifty different chemicals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtruding from the end of the pot was a spigot, which was placed in between the bars, after which a strange, gray substance oozed out and splattered into a deformed ball at his feet. Blaze nearly retched, even considering his low standards nowadays. For a while, he just stared at the mixture, wondering if this was really food or if it was a sick joke from the jailors. Then, each of the other drakes were allotted a large portion of this sticky gray stuff as well, all of whom seemed equally surprised to see this new substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell is this shit?\u201d groaned Flamer-2, almost sidling away from the strange gray ooze when it splattered in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Blaze expected that he would be immediately whipped, yet apparently the substance was so unpalatable that the dwarven handler didn't seem to have the heart to administer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019 ask me. All eye heard was that its some strange new concoction devised by them doctors. Said it was supposed to make ye strong or something like that. All dat matters is that all of ye are to eat the whole bloody thing, even if we gotta force ye to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just me, or did this stuff just move on its own\u2026\u201d said Flamer-6, the only drake Blaze still hadn\u2019t talked to up until this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and eat the damn shit you beasts!!\" snapped the handler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets just eat it and get it done with!!\u201d growled Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and lowered his jaw into the gruel, trying hard not to think of what exactly was contained within this saturated, wet-cement-like mixture. If anything, it tasted even worse than it looked, so much so that it made his knees grow weak and his eyes tear up. It took every bit of his will power to force himself to swallow, and no sooner did the mixture hit his belly did his vision start to fade in an out. All he could do was to lie upon his side with a horribly severe stomachache, as did Flamer-2 and Flamer-6. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet poor Flamer-4 showed a particularly poor reaction to the meal, if it could be called that. Even approaching his portion caused him to immediately make a cogested, choking noise, so the guards had been forced to shove the spigot directly into his jaw and literally pump it down his throat. No sooner had he finished swallowing did the vapid drake begin to spasm uncontrollably while foaming at the jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet the nutritionist over here now!!\u201d shouted the dwarf handler in panic. If Flamer-4 took a turn for the worse, as it increasingly looked like he would, then it would not only cost the dwarf his job, but also possibly his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the elven nutritionist, Liander, rushed into the center of the room. He gave one look at the writhing Flamer-4 and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that this one had an extreme allergic reaction to one of the substances contained within the growth mixture. There is nothing that can be done with this one\u2026\u201d he said indifferently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, as poor Flamer-4 was left to chke and drown in his own bile, tthe turned his rage toward  the dwarven handler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much of the augmenting mix did you give each of the drakes Dorcas?\u201d he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe told me to distribute it to all the drakes and make them eat it!!\u201d insisted the dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Did I not also specifically mention that this batch was to last for the entire week, and that it is to be mixed in with their regular meals rather than administered in its unaltered form?\u201d retorted the elf. The dwarf shrunk before the nutritionist, the look of dismay all too evident on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-former handler suddenly tried to make a break for the exit. He did not get far before he began to scream a horrifying scream. The dwarf clutched at his head, which grew a shade of red that was equivalent to the hide of a healthy fire drake, before his head literally exploded with a gory fountain of blood. Just to further make his point, the elf also decided to slice off the heads of three random trolls, before addressing the remainder of the petrified guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Order of Kleave will not tolerate incompetence of any sort, and the penalty of which is death. The lives of these valuable specimens are worth far more than all of your lives put together. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026my lord\u2026\u201d stammered the remaining guards. Blaze hazily watched as Flamer-4\u2019s stiff body was dumped into the pot where the fire drakes had been fed from, as were the bodies of the former handler and the unfortunate trolls and unceremoniously rolled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that day went by in a foggy daze. When he was not lying on his side like a drugged up cinnabar addict, he was crawling over to his litter box and building a small mountains worth of shit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blaze\u2019s thoughts on the deceased Flamer-4, all he could feel was an alarming indifference. It was one of those unfortunate things that happened; Flamer-4 would not be the last death Blaze would witness, and it was more than certainly possible that the next one may very well be Blaze. After all that he\u2019d already seen, perhaps it just wasn\u2019t worth losing his mind over. Besides, Flamer-4 could even be considered fortunate, for his suffering was now over and his spirit now rested with the Ancestors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another day at the prison\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was still suffering the effects of the undiluted 'nutritional supplement' the day after it had been administered by the incometant - now thoroughly deceased - fire drake handler.  The dwarf had been replaced by a younger, black maned human within the day.  Blaze watched, sick and groaning like the rest of the drakes, as the man oversaw three trolls whom he forced to clean up the blood and gore of his predecessor from the stone floor.  His style of encouragement included techniques such as stepping on fingers and toes with his heavy boots, kicks to the back or behind and just a constant stream of seaman-worthy cursing.  When he turned his eyes on the captive dragons, however, his ambitious eyes gleamed with a sort of lust.  Blaze did not imagine for a moment that he would be satisfied with his current job slopping out gruel and cleaning up dragon shit.  Between the shouts and cursing, he learned the human's name: Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, nothing much happened.  They were left in their cells to recover while lanterns burning slowly down and having to be refilled every so often by a troll slave were the only indicator of the passage of time.  When Blaze was not thoroughly occupied with the pain in his abdomen or busy utilizing the sand box, he went to the bars and looked out across the hall.  With Flamer-4 gone, that left just Flamer-6 across from him and Flamer-2 across and to the left.  Of the former five fire drakes, there was now only four.  Half of the eight cell wing was now vacant.  <i>Would more die before any were brought to this miserable place?</i>  Blaze asked himself and then scoffed.  Almost certainly.  <i>And any who didn't die might just wish they had...</i>  Not once when Blaze was able to get up were the other two dragons in any state to talk or, in Flamer-2's case, scowl and cast suggestive gestures at him.  In time, when the pain began to ease that evening, Blaze was able to consider the words of the nutritionist, one of Dr. Moridin's exalted staff.  <i>\"Growth mixture\"  he'd said.</i>  Blaze mulled, curling his tail around so that it draped over the back of his neck.  <i>What could that possibly mean?</i>  The young drake wasn't sure, but he felt sure that it was tied somehow to Dr. Moridin's grand design and his obsession with dragon breeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate that evening, Blaze's belly was growling after passing the last of the poison which had killed Flamer-4.  The squeak of a cart and the grunting of troll laborers alerted the fire drake to the coming of the food cart.  Wolf walked at the head of the team of trolls and a pair of dwarven distributers sat at the back of the creaking wagon as it crawled slowly by.  It paused in front of Flamer-2's cell.  Wolf checked and double checked his clipboard parchment, unwilling to make the slightest error; Blaze could hardly blame the human his caution and allowed himself a slight sneer while the humanoids backs were turned.  \"Forty-five kilograms... damn these elvish measurements...\"  muttered the human still loudly enough for Blaze to hear.  \"Thats about...\"  Then the human spoke up, \"One albacore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dwarves grunted affirmation and reached into the back of the cart, which Blaze's nose alerted him was heaped with fish, but also other types of meat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart crawled ahead to the next cell.  \"One and a half albacore!\"  shouted Wolf and a huge blade came down with stout dwarven strength, cleaving the mighty fish in twain with one stroke.  One and a half fish was tossed into Flamer-6's cell through the small food port as well.  By the time it clanged shut, Flamer-2 was already mostly done, chewing on the spine and skull of the huge fish. He slurped it into his mouth with a disgusting lack of manners and crushed down on the bones with a loud *crack.*  Flamer-2 stuck his snout through the bars as the cart made a wide turn, coming down Blaze's side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-master Human...\"  drawled Flamer-2  - bravely in Blaze's opinion - \"Might you possibly spare just another small fish?  I am still feeling weak after the old dwarf poisoned us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snorted, his prison mate was laying it on thick, perhaps taking advantage of a new caretaker's leniency.  Blaze only wished he'd thought of it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf looked up from his feeding regiment.  \"Still hungry eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master Human, Wise Human...\"  Flamer-2 groveled, his head low.  Blaze turned his nose in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf held up a smallish fish; at least compared to the tuna.  \"Hm, how about this?  Do you think this Striped Snapper will tide you over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze read in the subtle shifts of his wings an in the minute tang of his odor that Flamer-2 really wanted something bigger, really, another whole tuna.  But he said, \"Oh yes!  That would just be great!\"  He even pressed his face against the bars in mock excitement.  As the human moved his arm holding the 20 lb fish, Blaze couldn't believe that Flamer-2 was going to get away with it.  But as the human turned, his <i>other</i> arm came up from behind the wall of the cart as well.  Wolf hung onto his fish and instead chucked a large smooth black stone at Flamer-2's snout.  The drake emitted a quite undragon-like yelp and started back, holding a paw to his nose where a few ruby drops gathered.  The dwarves erupted in guffaw and banged their helmets together.  Wolf allowed himself a chuckle and moved on as Flamer-2 moved back to the shadowy interior of his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's meal turned out to be quite different than the others'.  Blaze's eyesight for fine letters was not the best, but he could clearly see that when the human's finger stopped at his name, it was highlighted in red.  \"Underweight...\"  Wolf muttered.  \"Looks like your lucky day fella.\"  They sloped several heavy buckets of ground meat into the trough below the cell's feeding door.  It was a generous amount of red meat, but immediately, Blaze could tell that it had been treated in the lab prior to being served to him.  As he sniffed cautiously, Wolf tried to reassure him.  \"It's just vitamins and supplements, not that other supplement from the day before.  It's not dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human sounded sincere, but then humans were famed liars.  \"Couldn't...\"  started Blaze, the words rough in his throat from disuse, \"Couldn't I have a tuna instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hefted another stone from the side of the cart and tossed it casually into the air, catching it again and again with one hand.  \"You're not going to make my job more difficult too are you?\"  Blaze shook his head hurriedly.  \"Then eat it and be glad, red meat is scarce enough on this island.  You'll soon tire of fish and be longing for this stuff again.\"  The cart moved on.  \"Half an albacore for fatty here!\"  said Wolf referring to Flamer-1 in the next cell.  There was some low growling, but the adjacent, unseen dragon said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze began to lap up the soft, paste-like meat, Flamer-2 stared at him from the shadows of his cell, eyes gleaming as his tongue snapped up now and again to lick the blood away from his nose.  Blaze stared right back and began to eat with a false gusto, pretending to savor the slightly metallic tinged meat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was, in fact heavy and left Blaze sleepy and turgid afterwards.  He'd even licked the trough clean and despite the lack of bones or texture to the meat, he was full and about as happy as he could be considering the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain that night he had the horrid dream, strapped down and watching Flamer-2 rape an innocent, attractive female with devilish glee.  Dr. Moridin egged him on, even whacking the drake's behind with  wooden paddle as he approached climax and the drakka shrieked in dismay.  Blaze stuggled, but couldn't move.  Then the dragons were gone and Dr. Moridin was looming over him, half his face covered with a quicksilver mask.  He seems deformed, yet still elegant and terrible in the elfin way, half elf, half well polished machine.  Then he was sticking needles and tubes into his veins.  Blaze watched with horror as his flesh swelled monstrously.  \"A strong male we'll make out of you yet, you pansy, ball-less, pussy!\"  His arm grew to the size of a sky-swallower's, rippling with bulky, inflexible muscle.  The growth traveled up his shoulder, cracking the bones out of position and sliding up his neck.  The elf's silver glove - or was it a silver hand? - rested on his brow.  \"We'll make a real drake out of you...\"  Blaze screamed in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he awoke screaming, to the chagrin of the other fire drakes.  Flamer-2 chided, lifting his head from where it had previously curled, \"Having bad dreams again are we, newbie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 was more considerate.  \"Just go back to sleep, you'll get used to the dreams after a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Blaze did try, though he lay awake for long hours, listening to his stomach churn complacently, trying to get back into a healthy rhythm after being starved, clogged and subsequently poisoned.  But Dr. Moridin's slim terrifying visage seemed to lurk behind his eyes whenever he shut them.  Imagine his dismay when the lamps were lit again the following morning and the lab crew came to collect him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next couple of weeks settled into one of monotony. Every morning, Blaze would be woken up and taken to perform work. Much of the time, it was excavation in the mines, where he would usually be paired up with Flamers 1, 2 or 6. Other times was the horrifically gross duty of cleaning up the cesspools in the mines, of which the only mercy was that they would spray him off with cold water if only to make sure he didn't catch disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking with Flamer-1 was depressingly dull. The large drake hardly spoke, nor did he ever flash a gaze toward Blaze. Not that Blaze particularly cared about becoming friends with Flamer-1, but Blaze couldn\u2019t help but be somewhat annoyed at the way Flamer-1 always seemed to be perpetually sleepy and completely ambivalent about his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long have you been here?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo long\u2026\u201d said Flamer-1 dully his eyes only halfway open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I was just asking because I figured you seem to be someone who knows the most about the place,\u201d added Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the point in even thinking about it? Besides\u2026it won\u2019t help anybody to know in any case,\u201d he droned, monotonously shifting back to his work. Blaze did shift back to his work. Flamer-1 was already lost, so far as Blaze could tell. He was so apathetic that Blaze reckoned he wouldn\u2019t have even cared if they neutered him. In that instance, he was even worse than Flamer-2, as at the very least the bully was still out for his own self-preservation. Thus, as far as Blaze could tell, Flamer-1 already was neutered in mind and spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 possessed a similar cynicism as Flamer-1, but at the very least he was willing to talk to Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing all this digging for?\u201d Blaze asked him one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 shrugged, \u201cHow the hell should I know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re obviously have us do this for a purpose. That\u2019s how these elves work. They\u2019re planning on doing something with the caves we\u2019re carving out!!\u201d answered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think Flamer-7? Obviously, elves love underground tunnels for their aesthetic qualities,\" he shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough of this Flamer-7. You might think its worth getting a pole shoved up the ass but leave me out of it. I can see why Flamer-2 gets kind of annoyed with you though. You think too much, you\u2019re too self-righteous and because you do it gets everyone else in trouble. So whatever you\u2019re thinking, keep it to yourself and maybe you\u2019ll live a little bit longer,\u201d he cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. I got it\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. He didn\u2019t speak to Flamer-6 about these sort of questions again, but he was willing to give out pointers to Blaze every so often so that his existence was a little less miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while paired up with Flamer-2, Blaze always had to watch his back to ward off the thicker dragons bullying. It turned out that Blaze received the brunt of his attentions not because he was a newbie; Flamer-2 had decided that after Blaze had given back as much as he had taken, he wasn\u2019t going to simply break like 3 and 5 had, but that Flamer-2 decided he had a particular dislike toward Blaze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze actually took that as a positive development. It meant that Flamer-2 looked at him with a modicum of respect and fear, a true rival rather than a victim. In fact, more often then not, Blaze would go out of his way to knock Flamer-2 down a peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, when Flamer-8 had newly arrived with that hopeless, glazed look Blaze knew only too well, Flamer-2 immediately took to bullying the new arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!! Looks like we\u2019ve got fresh meat!!\u201d cackled Flamer-2, \u201cTell me newbie, how many times have they shoved the pole up your ass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 whimpered pitifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026you must have liked it didn\u2019t you?\u201d taunted Flamer-2, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to tell the guards you\u2019re a homo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up Flamer-2 and leave him alone,\u201d growled Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me!!\u201d retorted Flamer-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can. We can have an argument here and then the guards will wake up to shove the pole up both our assess.\u201d retorted Blaze. His heart pounded horribly, but fortunately, it seemed that Flamer-2 didn\u2019t seem up to risk calling Blaze\u2019s bluff, who snorted and went back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks\u2026\u201d said Flamer-8 softly, but not ungratefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed, \u201cShits already bad enough as it is. Now get some sleep newbie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Flamer-8 wasn\u2019t necessarily fine after that, he at least became functional enough to perform the duties that were required, which was a victory in and of itself. He hadn\u2019t been there much longer than Flamer-8, but what he did know was that once you survived the first couple of days, you\u2019d be able to endure for the long haul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-9, unfortunately, was not one of them. He\u2019d been assigned Flamer-4\u2019s old cell, and spent that entire night screaming and wailing for his mother. After a couple of days, he wouldn\u2019t stop, and Wolf the handler had had enough. Wolf ordered his thugs to drag Flamer-9 out of his cell and then had them shove the pole up his butt, which Blaze could not help but watch with a perverse, frightened fascination. Flamer-9 no longer screamed after that, reduced to a broken shivering, miserable wreck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning from the mines that evening, he found that Flamer-9\u2019s cell was empty. Blaze could only idly wonder if Flamer-9 had died, or if he\u2019d been neutered and taken wherever they stored neutered drakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he still felt somewhat nauseous from the chemical additive they spiced his food with every morning, he was nevertheless gaining weight from the dense concentrated food and muscle from his hard physical labor in the mines. His fire sacs were once again filled with oil, and could once again puff smoke out of his nostrils, though he did not think it a good idea to test whether or not he could breath fire yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular morning, the nutritionist, Liander, took notice of this and congratulated the handler as a result. The elf then turned toward Blaze\u2019s cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now, it would seem that you are not quite so skinny anymore Flamer-7, not that I imagine you would show your gratitude toward your benefactors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t care to respond to the elf. All he hoped was that the elf was not here to take him to Doctor Moridin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet what was certain was that as the guards came forward to shackle him, this day would be different from any of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They let him walk.  That in itself was something of a gift.  Sure, he was still manacled, but this time his forepaws were not attached to the rear ones, allowing him a much greater range of motion and a bigger, more comfortable stride.  The humanoids jogged at his flanks or else rode on mules as he was led along the passage; the mounted warriors were no less intimidating with their long gripping polarms and the slick wooden pole always following in the wake of his tail.  Still, Blaze was able to walk with at least a modicum of dignity, his head up and looking forward instead of down at the ground before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell almost immediately that they were not heading towards the mines.  For one thing, he - being a smaller variety of dragon - always worked in a team to compensate for his - relatively - smaller stature.  For another thing, they were headed <i>up</i>.  The path sloped steadily upward after they took as side branch from the vast curve of the main hallway.  The train then came to another level hallway, just as vast as the one that Blaze's wing branched off of.  They walked along some distance, Blaze taking the chance to smell and gawk at the passing traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fast, quiet traffic of feet and hooves and occasionally paws as well.  Unlike New Alveri, where people stopped to mingle and talk regularly, everyone here seemed to have urgent business as they walked briskly or even ran alone the echoing stone passages.  Troll drudges were uncommon on this level compared to the level below where the dragons were housed.  Instead, gangly humans ran about on business along the wide corridor, streaking in and out of holes like mice.  Then Blaze was directed into a side passage that once again spiraled lazily upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze squinted in the new light coming from the tunnel ahead.  The young fire-lord had to tuck in his elbows and knees as suddenly the armed escort pressed in close, even going so far as laying their cold steel weapons on his armored skin.  Wolf glanced back at Blaze where he rode ahead, directing the whole party.  He rattled the chain and pendant dangling from his hand, the control for his inhibitor collar.  Aparently, Blaze was expected to be extra-cautious in guarding his behavior for this next section of the sprawling island complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrid and topmost level sported - wonder of wonders! - skylights and also splashing waterfalls of cool volcanic spring water.  Greenery thrived here to either side of the concourse, tall tropical trees and small, neat plots of grass where elves and dwarves intermingled in deep discussion.  There was less frenzied movement, as the obvious patrons of this expedition walked stately from building to building, recessed in the walls of the broad passage.  Vines dripped from balconies where there was occasionally a dwarf or two taking a siesta from the warm tropical environment which filtered more readily into the uppermost level than the dank, stifled lower levels; despite obvious dwarvish engineering.  It seemed like utter luxury compared to the cramped, stinking dungeons below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste as brief as Blaze was poked and prodded quickly into another side passage.  Blaze managed to twist his head as he departed, and just before the wall blocked off his view, he could have sworn he saw a <i>dragon</i> walking free and uninhibited down that wondrous boulevard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the passage climbed up, now much more steeply.  Blaze was grateful for the newfound muscle now gracing his frame.  Blaze had lost all of his pre-adolescent body fat during his trials, reduced to a boney shadow of his former self.  Hard work in the mines had seen to it that the extra Calories he'd been supplied turned into firm, sleek muscle at his now, fairly broad shoulders.  But Blaze felt fairly lopsided with overdeveloped shoulders and chest like an Earthrender.  He's still been unable to run or fly in the dark, closed passages underground.  His firebladder rippled heavy as he walked, its thick muscular lining displaying for all to see the death which was contained within.  But Blaze remained uncertain, not daring to have used his gift since being captured.  He'd never gone so long without breathing so much as an ember.  Though his nostrils were once again stoked with pleasant smog he was able to summon at will, Fiery Death might still be beyond him, if fortune were to provide a chance to utilize his breed's famed skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passageway turned up and up.  Blaze kept up with the challenge with only minimal effort, though the mules and walking humans seemed to be getting the worst of it.  The party slowed; Blaze was signaled with a cruel tug on his hide by a hooked polarm which reached out to grab his scales.  Blaze had to trundle along beside the heavy breathing of the humanoids and their beasts until finally the tunnel ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight poured in from the end of the tunnel, so bright, it made Dr. Moridin's lab look like a feeble wax torch.  Blaze could not stifle a hiss after so long living in the dark.  Someone behind him dug their tool into Blaze's tail, lifting it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  No! I'm going!\"  Blaze shouted, stumbling forward so that his manacles caught and he almost fell.  Living in constant fear of the lubed pole was humiliating and terrible, but in a sick sort of way, Blaze felt he was getting used to it.  They'd only had to use it on him once in the past two weeks; after Flamer-2 had executed a devious ploy to get their food assignments switched and he'd had it out with the not-so-much bigger male.  By now, the mere threat of the dreaded thing was usually enough; and Blaze thought that the human poleman would rather wave the thing around rather than actually work at ramming his weapon home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering from Wolf ahead made Blaze feel a fresh surge of shame which was slowly dulling as his internment lengthened, but that did not keep him from proceeding into the terrible light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon eyes were superior to a human's in direct light - though perhaps only equal to an elf's - and better than a dwarf's in the dark.  However, dragons paid for that visual acuity with slow transition.  Despite walking up the long ramp into the sunlight, Blaze remained unable to see long after the humans obviously had adjusted.  When he emerged, all Blaze could tell as he squinted was that he was surrounded by tall dark pillars which regularly interrupted his eye sight.  The sky above looked odd as well, almost dark in places as if the sky itself had cracked, greenery was also abundant, though irregular all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose told him far more about his environment.  He was outside!  Truly outside for the first time since the ship had landed with him and his lost companion over two months ago.  The atmosphere tasted thinner.  They had indeed come a long way, either to the top of the mountain or inside it's caldera.  The refreshing smells of plants, recent rainfall and wild animal droppings was enough to warrant punishment just for the chance to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, driven by his nose, Blaze walked forward without instruction, recklessly.  To his logical mind's surprise, which was currently taking a minor backseat to his powerful nose-instinct, the humans did not immediately descend upon him.  Heady scents filling his snout and making him giddy, Blaze walked up to one of the tall, light-drenched pillars and urinated on it for the sheer pleasure of it, relishing the way his scent mingled with that of the environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next thing he wanted was to spread his wings.  But he was prevented from doing this by the leather harness which hobbled him.  Still he strained, panicky instinct threatening to drown out his rational thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smelled a rider detach itself from the light-bleached conglomerate of human and mule stink which lingered over by the carved entrance.  It was Wolf.  Blaze snarled at the pitiful figure, it smell pungently arrogant and challenging.  He'd smear nicely over the black volcanic stone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain seized Blaze's throat, like a claw gripping him, invading the muscles lining his long neck and making them seize and spasm.  But the pain radiated throughout his body as well, arching his back and loosing his bladder onto the ground as well as his leg.  Blaze fell onto his side, twitching.  Three pulses racked him, at even half-second intervals.  The brevity and abruptness of the pain and its cessation was enough to knock the young drake loose from the instinct-smells which has been arising in fumes to cloud his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf stopped his mount before Blaze as he snuffled, hurt and aching, in the glassy dust.  His vision slowly improving, Blaze could make out enough of the man's features to decipher a haughty look of superiority on the man's face as he held the triggering device for the collar around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where you are, Drake?  Has the scent-madness left you now? Do. You. Remember. Who's. In. Charge?\"  For emphasis, Wolf held aloft the magic pendant, and Blaze recoiled, cringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.  Master Wolf.  I-I'm sorry for the way I acted.\"  whimper Blaze, suffering an after spasm in his cramping back muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze saw Wolf then dismount and at the same time, decreasingly blurry human shapes came forward from the tunnels.  Though he couldn't see still, there were at least two elves among the small cround now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Wolf sniffed, \"Now let's see what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Blaze's surprise, an assistant loosened and removed the buckles holding his wings in place, allowing them to stretched to their full glory for the first time since being kidnapped in New Alveri.  To his infinite chagrin, he found there was nowhere to go...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joints popped and creaked as Blaze flexed his great wings; the human at his side literally had to jump out of the way as the folded leather unfurled (Wolf said nothing).  The only time in the last four miserable months of his life that Blaze had even been able to open his wings had been in his cell, and even there, not completely.  Thick muscles which ran smoothly over his rib cage, connecting his humerus to his breast bone which was the anchor for powerful downward thrusts.  More muscles connected along his back and in the well sculpted - in Blaze's opinion at least - complex of his shoulders, where the wings sat behind and just above his forearms which, even in their currently well developed state, were far more slender than the big flight muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze relished the feel - almost orgasmic, after so long! - of leathery skin snapping taught along the length of his torso on either side of his spine.  He pulled and stretched the durable leather, luxuriating in the tugging, slightly elastic feel of hide which was never meant to remain folded so long.  Blood vessels flared automatically, making his wings feel <i>alive</i> again, chilled slightly in the mountain air despite the tropical locale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire-lord then looked down at wolf, his wings hovering above the ground at about chest height to the tall human.  The dragon's eyes were filled with suspicion and cautious joy.  <i>How far were they going to let him go with this?</i>  But Wolf merely waved his hand in a shooing gesture, apparently unconcerned with the possibility that Blaze might try to escape.  In fact, with a display of abject apathy, the fire drake handler turned his mule around and trotted back to join the conglomerate near the side of the mountain where the entrance back into the complex was.  It was still hard to see, everything washed out in the abundant light; though every minute that passed, his vision slowly improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was too canny to think that his captors did not have some sort of security in place to prevent his escape.  He thought that perhaps they would simply zap him with the collar should he show signs of departing, undoubtedly sending him into convulsions and plummeting to his death.  Still, that did not mean that Blaze could not test the boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze began to stir the air with his wings, getting a feel for the local atmosphere, the party near the gate moved forward and Blaze could detect speech, mostly between two refined elvish voices.  He paid them no mind, however, He's been months out of practice.  Of course, flight was as simple to him as walking, but still, Blaze measured the wind carfully with the sensetive surface of his wings.  The leather, bare to the casual glance, was actually coated with thousands of fine hairs - acually modified scales - which gave him invaluable information about the air currents moving around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could <i>grip</i> the wind, feel its texture, its shape and density.  A lifetime of experience stocked him with the knowledge of how to read the air not just in his local environment but in the greater airscape as well.  By the air-pressure - how dense the air felt here - Blaze knew approximately how high they were and how hard he would have to thrust to get airborne.  By the eddies stirring the ground here, he could glean something of the bigger currents above.  Tasting the moisture in the air with his tongue, Blaze knew that the island would experience rain in no more than 18 hours.  Everything he knew at ground level would be amplified ten fold once he got into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were watching him, but right now, Blaze couldn't care.  Even if the zapped him again or shoved the pole up his ass, it would be worth it to get into the air again.  Weeds wavered in the wind of his down stroke.  The red dragon thrust down again until his chest left the ground.  But moving his wings sent an unfamiliar burning through his underused muscles.  Something told him that he'd not be able to spend as long in the sky as he might have a few months ago.  No matter, Blaze crouched and took off straight ahead, running and leaping with all four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind rushed past his face.  His chest bulged as the muscles contracted, bringing the big wings down.  Once, twice, his feet left the ground, but only for a few ecstatic seconds.  It wasn't enough.  Three, four... there!  Blaze clawed his way up, feeling as ungraceful as a Dodo, but still, there it was.  Fine details were still missing from his sight, but Blaze could still easily avoid the large pillars which dotted this region.  After gaining some precious altitude at the expense of burning wings, Blaze set them and sighed in absolute pleasure, feeling the wind caress and support his body, like a long lost lover.  Dragons might make their abodes under the ground for safety, but truely they were creatures of the air!  Dragons were mean to be free, nay, they were <i>freedom itself!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in the sensation of drifting two dragon lengths above the ground, Blaze nearly met his end when a sudden nebulous obstacle loomed out of the whitewashed background.  It appeared out of the brilliance suddenly and with deadly solidity.  A lattice of interlocking iron bars.  A huge wall stretching high from the ground, and - Blaze realized starkly - overhead as well.  That was why the sky had appeared oddly cracked, it was the shadows of the beams overhead.  He was trapped in a massive cage!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite seeing the lavishly spacious interior of the complex below in the side of the not-so-dormant volcano, it stunned Blaze to see construction on such a scale, to match even the mighty works of New Alveri itself.  What weren't these elves capable of?  Blaze wondered forlornly.  But then, if such a group had ambitions to capture and enslave dragons themselves, that alone proved their power and sheer gall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazement slowed his reaction just a portion of a second, but it was enough.  Blaze banked, turning nearly on his side in a desperate attempt to avoid the sudden wall, but his forward momentum would not be changed so suddenly.  His clawed hindfeet and tail banged against the wall.  Blaze began to fall, but not merely from having lost precious momentum in the collision with the sturdy metal.  His collar had sent a single painful jolt through his body on contact with the wall.  Fortunately, his legs extended in a jerky motion which propelled him away from the cage - and possibly more shocks - but his wings felt stiff against his back and refused to listen to commands as the ground flew up to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperation and the desire to avoid certain death turned his fall into a hasty glide.  Shaking, Blaze forced his wings to move against the pain blocking them.  Blaze landed heavily on his forelegs which buckled and then ground his chest into the grass where he was fortunate enough to skid to a halt.  Panting, the young drake watched the party of humanoids who had all been observing his blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze caught snippets from the elves as they approached his crash site.  \"...seems clumsy.\" said a female voice he recognized as none other than Auyandrith, Dr. Moridin's apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...due to confinement.  He'll get better shortly, with proper excercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better...  I don't know what the good doctor sees in this one.  He should just pick one and be done with it.  Any drake with a set of testicles will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You undervalue the male component in producing offspring, dear cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get me started, Liander!  We shouldn't be wasting time here, crafting a perfect 'Patron.'  Not when the drakka manage to smash one in ten eggs before we can collect them, not when the suicide rate is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush cousin!  Don't speak of such things here!\"  Liander admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could finally see well enough to notice a fair skinned humanoid cross her arms and turn away from her companion.  The disturbing conversation he'd overhead melted from his mind as Wolf approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't look like you have enough sense to keep from bashing int'a things in the air.\" he said sardonically.  \"You better shape up and right quick if you want to stay in the breeding program, Ha!\"  he laughed and threw a mock jab in Blaze's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze made a low grinding noise, pebbles grinding together in his crop, a sound of recognized folly and submission to another's judgement.  Blaze had no idea if the meaning translated across species, but he added.  \"It's... been a while since I last flew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"  said Wolf snidely and looked back at the observers.  \"Now no more nonsense, you're making me look bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"  Blaze asked suddenly, \"Is this some sort of trial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf scratched his beard, as if deciding how much information to share with a lowly prisoner.  \"...Not as such.  Let's just call this a preliminary, and a chance for you to stretch your wings.  As you have already experienced, there is no where to go and your collar will activate again with twice the force if you touch the bars again.\"  Pulling a long pointing stick and a whistle from his side bag, Wolf gestured to several of the pillars Blaze could now clearly see holding up the tall ceiling.  \"Now lets see you weave through some of those pillars.  Now!\"  Wolf punctuated his sentence with a shrill whistle that hurt Blaze's ears.  He moved as much to get away from the annoying sound as to comply with instruction.  When he was aloft, sadly, flight has lost some - but not all - of its former pleasure.</span></div></div>",

He always considered himself a fairly coordinated flier, about as fast and maneuverable as the other young drakes of his size and age. Still, most of his flight experience consisted of flying to and from the orphanage to the merchant district, and knowing this Blaze decided to focus on ensuring that he wouldn't hit pillars rather than on speed. He had a couple of close scrapes, but all in all, he managed to navigate through the maze of pillars without too much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he landed softly onto the grass in front of the gathered humanoids. They were furiously scribbling something down on their clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf folded his arms contemptuously, \"I've seen worse, I have to admit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than good enough for Blaze. He was happy enough that he wasn't being whipped or raped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf strode toward a hidden switch, and a large aluminum target popped out of the ground near the side of the mountain wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe may as well check to see if you can flame. If you can\u2019t, well, lets just say you\u2019re out of the breeding program\u2026\u201d he finished with a chuckle. A hot surge of anger coursed through Blaze, as he curved his way toward the sample target. As the naphtha and the hot gasses bubbled in his throat as he took in a smoldering breath, he imagined that the target having the sneering expression of Dr. Moridin, the laughter of the kidnappers, all the pain inflicted upon his body and the daily injustices visited upon him and all the others, all of which festered within him, whereupon he threw his neck forward and expelled a frightening beam of fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFWWOMP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, the metal target had been reduced to a pile of smoldering metal. The fire had in fact continued through the target and continued to eat away at the side of volcanic wall as if it were acid. A team of humanoids rushed forward to the scene and frantically began dispensing extinguishing foam upon the simmering foam to put it out. Blaze couldn\u2019t help but grunt with a deep sense of satisfaction, his nostrils smoldering vigorously. Even the elves seemed surprised at the dramatic results, as they furiously scribbled on their clipboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026it would seem that the intensity of the flame varies depending upon the beasts emotional state. Perhaps the doctor\u2019s theory is right in this regard\u2026\u201d he heard one of the elf\u2019s whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that its more to due with the fact of the shoddy material of the target than any distinguishing ability on the beasts part...\" answered Auyandrith. The two once again engaged in a furious debate, yYet Blaze did have time to wonder about what they were saying for long, as Wolf snapped him back to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it does seem you can produce a bit of fire Flamer-7,\u201d said Wolf, though Blaze could tell that he was trying to keep uneasiness out of his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire lord handler walked over to another hidden switch. When he flipped it, a series of unlit torches emerged from the each pillars at various heights. Again, Blaze could not help but wonder what kind of complex, intricate machinery the elves had constructed. If only their talents could have been directed to a more worthy cause for New Alveri than for their shady operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall fly through the course as you did before, yet this time you will attempt to light up each of the torches as you pass by,\u201d explained Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to flame them right?\u201d emphasized Blaze, ensuring that he heard correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf clenched his fists impatiently, \u201cIs that not what I just said!? How idiotic are you beast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m going\u2026\u201d replied Blaze. Despite the circumstances, Blaze couldn\u2019t help but actually be excited that he\u2019d be able to use his flaming breath in this exercise. The only time he\u2019d ever been able to use his flaming breath was to help out Mr. Ebon in the smithy, and as Blaze had so recently shown, the flaming breath of a Fire Lord was by far the most potent of all dragon kind, as not only did it burn the hottest, but it also stuck to any surface, nor could it easily be put out with water. Furthermore, while most other dragons fire breath could only be used in dramatic, but short bursts, Blaze still had quite a lot in the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naphtha bubbled in his throat as Blaze approached the first target. It was straight on with his flight pass, so despite the fact he\u2019d had absolutely no practice at midair flaming, he managed to angle his head downward and flamed as he passed by overhead. The torch burned merrily as he passed by, but as he moved on through the course, the difficulty grew harder and harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next series of targets were those that were either close to the ground or up near the ceiling, which meant that Blaze had to adjust his normal flight pattern to get to those torches. Blaze slowed up so that he would have enough time to align himself properly, but even then he missed the mark as often as he hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardest of all were those torches he had to light while he was turning. He would have only a split second to angle his head to the proper alignment, while judging wind current and g-forces. Only a few times did he manage to hit, if only because he sprayed a wide beam in order to increase his chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up paying for his profligate use of his fire breath, for near the end he was reduced to spitting out small embers as his \u2018fuel\u2019 began to run out. He landed softly in front of the group once he finished his run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem that out of a possible total of one hundred torches, you managed to light fifty-eight of them,\u201d said Wolf, gazing at his clipboard. He couldn\u2019t tell if Wolf was impressed that he\u2019d actually had gotten that many on his first time ever attempting trying to flame in mid-flight, or that he was disappointed and should have done better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Blaze did know was that after expelling that much flame, he was absolutely exhausted. His body ached all over. Furthermore, the inside of his mouth throbbed with a slight burning sensation, his tongue dry and parched. Yet despite that, Blaze felt more highly of himself than he had in quite some time. If he could master the use of his fire, then maybe he could actually get out of here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the shock went through his body again, sending him to the ground. While Blaze writhed, a pair of humans came forward with the pole and jabbed it up his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe not...</i> he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let today go to your head Flamer-7. Any freedom you have is present only because we allowed you to have them. Never forget that\u2026 We own you...\u201d snarled Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shifted his head down, \"Y-yes Master Wolf...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf then gestured to the crews. \"Chain him up...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was led away, back into the darkness of the hidden complex, but it was not the last time that Blaze would see the wondrous and terrible iron cage with veritably filled nearly half of the Volcano's wide caldera, 50 acres of flat land, interspersed with light jungle and outcroppings of black rock; and that did not include the inner walls of the mountain which supported much of the massive structure.  His rectum was sore as he walked down into the depths of the mountain, stumbling for lightblindness that did not affect humans nearly so much, but Blaze stuck by his earlier assertion.  It had been worth it.  He had had... <i>fun</i>.  No amount of pain could take that away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lorded what had happened over Flamer-2 when he got back to his cell.  In fact, the young drake felt quite gregarious in describing the beauty of the upper world and what the elves had built and what he had done there; selectively editing certain parts of course.  He only paused in his details when he heard the footsteps of Wolf or one of the man's aides coming down the hallway.  Flamer-2 only looked at him caustically and escaped to curl up in a dark corner of his cell.  Flamer-6 listened with an appreciative, though wary ear; obviously not wanting to fall into the trap of becoming too chummy with any of the other dragons.  Flamer-8 however, hung on Blaze's every word.  Hiliariously, he was older than Blaze by at least two decades, judging by the length of the horns on his head, and yet, in this place he had pretty much reverted to a younger, more vulnerable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what did it <i>Smell</i> like?  Up there?\"  he would ask frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Common Tongue, originating out of the mass of barbarian human dialects who previously occupied the area in and around New Alveri in the ages before it was founded, is and remains terrible as describing the nuances of olfactory stimulation, despite millennia of dragons intermingling with humanoids and incorporating their culture.  Not so for Modern Draconic.  I switched to our native tongue to describe the heady scents which had initially overtaken me with their vividness, the way they came together like a symphony, each part recognizable and yet part of a greater whole, a rich, consuming experience that was like reaching out to brush against, to taste, the entire mountainside with the lightest of touches.  To smell was to connect, in some basic fashion, with the world around you, to become one with it.  This and more I was able to communicate to Flamer-8, in a language of growls, jaw-snaps, guttural pops, tail movement, and some sub-sonic vibrations that a human would find impossible to hear.  The other fire drake sighed with the image in his mind of the topside world, leaning against the bars confining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while after that that Flamer-8 related his story.  Blaze listened stiffly, absorbing the information with a detached ear.  He had been meaning simply to show off with his own account, to improve his status and project the image that he was special in the eyes of their captors; mostly for Flamer-2's benefit.  Blaze had no desire for more heartache that would come with inevitable separation, either through death, castration or simple transfer.  Blaze wanted no friends here.  Nevertheless, he learned that Flamer-8 - who dared not speak his name for the collar around his neck which was still programmed to recognize certain words and phrases - was once a signal man for a tribe of 'wild' dragons outside New Alveri.  It had been his task to light signal fires in a large area in case of invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pretty sweet gig.\"  Flamer-8 related, \"All the freedom of moving around as our ancestors did, just a small tribe with you, thick as theives.  We hunted together, slept togehter on the plains, laid eggs together and then shipped them to the main city.  It was a wonderful free life...\"  He shed a tear then and was quiet for a long time.  It was only later, after ruminating on the fact revealed that Blaze gathered that there was a continuing eflux of 'defectors' from the city who migrated into the country side to live a more 'natural' life, closer to nature.  Since dragons live so long and because infant dragons are predatory pests when left to roam the countryside, these roving bands of dragons - which were highly unstable, often meeting and trading members - send the eggs they produced back to the city for often generous monetary compensation.  They knew their offspring would probably have a better life in the city - many dragon couples being infertile - and also, they could maintain their vaunted freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could see the logic.  'Wild' dragons roaming around New Alveri's outskirts would provide an invaluable buffer against the continuous barbarian skirmishes.  Flamer-8 described the give-take relationship the roaming dragons had with the farmers who lived on the vast plains that were New Alveri's breadbasket.  Small, unofficial tributes from the farmers were an incentive for a particular band to linger in the area, and in return, the dragons were expected to defend a certain area around where they were currently habitating; which was natural enough given dragons' normal territorial instincts.  Dragon tribes would move on when the hunting in the area grew sparse - forbidden from stealing livestock by the Knights - while especially rich farmers could sometimes afford to hire a dragon, or multiple dragons, as a personal guard or sentry.  The price was nearly always simply room and board, and that was enough for most rustic dragons to lead a long and happy life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a sentry for a rich human.\"  Flamer-8 said, \"I spent 25 years living on and protecting his estate.  I... loved the man.\"  His voice was cracking as he continued, \"B-but, the more I think about it.  The more time I spend here...  the more I think that he <i>sold</i> me to the men who captured and brought me here, like nothing more than a prize horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lifted his head to look at the fire drake across the hall, but Flamer-8 stopped talking and curled up on a simple matt of hay.  He refused to say more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's reign of superiority was shortlived.  Not two days had passed before Flamer-2 was taken and led up to the training area.  He returned looking smug and smelling of grass and dirt, but he did not crow about his accomplishment, instead deriding Blaze as an infant shouting about minor victories that didn't really matter.  Blaze really wanted to see how smug he would be with a face-full of the Hellfire he'd produced earlier that had eaten metal and stone as well as wool and tinder.  <i>There will be time for that later...</i>  Blaze felt assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed things seemed to be leading to a head.  Blaze became <i>busy</i>.  Only little was he sent down to the mines, now to work alone, usually when some other dragon was sent to the surface for flying and flaming practice.  His overdeveloped fire bladder pulsed continuously and was always warm to the touch as it produced oil and sulfurous hydrocarbons in response to the suddenly high demand for fire.  Blaze's appetite doubled and he was fed accordingly.  At night, he would feast on four large tunnies or sometimes a pile of snappers, once even half a strange sea mammal Wolf had called a porpoise.  He'd go to sleep - or rather was knocked out -  turgid and inert and awake hungry, his huge fire bladder once again refilled and ready scorch wood and metal to ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-1 disappeared one day.  He was simply gone and Blaze was ashamed that it was Flamer-8 who told him.  Blaze hadn't even noticed that the cell was empty.  Though he'd never admitted it, Blaze always assumed that he'd been the first one here.  It worried Blaze that the silent, stoic dragon, powerfully built and steady for a fire-lord would fail after his long internment.  All Wolf would say on the matter, after Blaze persistently asked, despite threats, was \"He wasn't what the wigs upstairs were looking for.  You better just worry about you and hope to God that you have it and the others don't.\"  Wolf had laughed and casually tossed a rock which bounced off of Blaze's hard temple.  After a second, Blaze feigned pain so Wolf would not feel obligated to try something else.  He seemed satisfied with the act and another warned to stop asking questions that'd get them both in trouble.  \"The light-skins don't like talkin' drakes.\"  He would admonish while dishing out his evening meal or else instructing a troll to sift through his sandbox for heavy packages to trundle away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, the chance to go outside made up for everything.  He was still a prisoner and littler more than an animal in the eyes of the elves and most humans and dwarves, but the sheer pleasure of flight and the chance to utilize his special skill in new and challenging ways gave him some light in a world formerly crowded with shadows of pain and torment.  Blaze quickly became as proficient at flying as he used to be, but the elves were increasingly demanding as well.  The obstacle course changed every-time and Blaze's path was modified from a simple display of aerial flaming ability to emphasize both accuracy and endurance in his flaming ability.  Blaze had to conserve his resources.  He never went at the maze half-assed for the elves were alway dropping hints about how well the other fire drakes were doing.  Whether true or not, Blaze could not take the chance, not when his Dragonhood was clearly on the line. They raped him with the pole after every session, so that he would not grow too cocky, but Blaze dourly accepted his punishment, choosing to view it as a price to pay for the chance to fly and burn things, setting his blood roaring.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze later only had a vague recollection of waking that fateful morning.  The lab crew had rolled down the stone hallway, their flatbed cart pulled by a dozen blue skinned trolls.    He knew that they'd come for him when they stopped in front of his cell.  Flamer-2 looked across at him, eyes laughing, as the elvish lab crew hopped off the cart.  They didn't even ask him to cooperate.  They simply tossed a crystalline globe into his cell.  There was, of course nowhere to hide from the pale mist which oozed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze awoke briefly in the sterile whiteness of Dr. Moridin's lab.  Consciousness came as a shock and Blaze gasped as if emerging from deep chilly water.  Voices came strong and fast as his head breached the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...course it's too soon!  I wanted to put each drake through a year long trial, to see which has the most potential.  But Ingrid will not be diverted, he wants results.  Well, I'll show him results.\"  The voice was none other than the dread doctor himself.  He continued, \"While Xiadir continues playing with his lava and fire elementals and bombs down below, I will lead the Kleaves to a new dawn of progress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one doubts your importance to the project, Doctor.\"  said Auyandrith on Blaze's opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they don't.\" said the doctor who then interrupted himself,  \"Dear, have you sterilized the spinal implants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a sound mechanical whining that flared and pitched at variable tones.  \"But Ingrid only sees my work in so far as it can help him topple New Alveri...\"  said Dr. Moridin with a sigh.  \"I don't think that even he truly comprehends what I'm trying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuyandrith said nothing for a time.  Blaze took the time to realize that he was again strapped down securely.  There were the sounds of a lot of padded feet around him.  There was some elf smell, but it was muted under the rank odor of disinfectant.  A sense of dread expectancy filled him with dread.  Only more technical murmers that Blaze couldn't hope to follow reached his ears.  Then cold metal bits were affixed to the skin on his head with some sort of resin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neural map in place Dr. Moridin...\" said Auyandrith casually.  Then, more alarmed, she added, \"Sir, he's awake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin did not sound surprised.  \"I suspected he has been.  This fire drake has a clever streak, unlike our other champions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could not help a telling facial twitch when the female assistant asked, \"Shall I put him back under?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet.\"  Footsteps.  Then a hand on his cheek and that same electric spark which told him of dire consequences should he try to snap.  \"Flamer-7.  Open your eyes.  It's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Blaze didn't want to comply simply out of casual insurgence.  But then he just didn't see the point in the farce anymore.  He lifted his scaled lids carefully, trying to avoid blindness this time.  When his vision became less blurry, he saw many elves moving around in bizzare outfit.  All of it was pure white cloth.  All of them wore tight gloves as well as netting on their hair and paper masks over their faces.  It all sent a shiver down Blaze's spine.  Something was going to happen...  They were going to do something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin crotched in the foreground, his hand on Blaze's face.  That silver glove which let him control his body resting against his skin with implicit threat.  Auyandrith stood near on the other side of his snout.  Her fair hair was bundled up in a net which still fell to the base of her neck.  Her green eyes seemed to sparkle with urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Moridin grinned at Blaze, she said, \"Dr. we need to proceed with the surgery.  He needs to be put under again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time, my eager apprentice.\"  The older elf waved off.  She seemed slightly miffed by the rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could not contain himself, fear getting the best of him.  His jaw scraping against the floor, he asked, \"What are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin stood to his full height, his hand still on Blaze's face.  \"We are going to make you into a better dragon, my young drake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTension seemed to break out across his whole body and Blaze tugged at the restraints which kept him tightly bound to the polished tile floor.  He writhed uselessly, a low moan in the back of his throat.  \"N-n-noooo....\"  But the time for escape had long past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are only upsetting the patient.\"  Auyandrith said.  She reached for a conical mask attatched to a hose, but in two long strides, Dr. Moriding reached her and snatched up her hand in his silver glove.  Auyandrith went pale as salt and sagged at the wrist, but she stuck to her guns, even as her eyelids fluttered with some deadly influence coursing through her body.  \"... think of... the recovery time.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin's face was an icy mask.  Then he threw her hand aside, letting Auyandrith collapse to the floor, cradling her breast.  \"You do not know everything yet, young apprentice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was still struggling, overcome with fear that the elves were going to manipulate his inside, make him into a monster.  The touch of the elvish scientist, however, stilled him.  \"There is value in understanding, that will aid him in the long run.\"  he said to his cringing assistant.  Then he turned to Blaze himself.  \"Flamer-7... Blaze.\"  he cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was not about to be fooled a second time.  \"Don't use that name.  You don't mean it.\"  Hot tears were flowing down his snout.  He was going to mutilate him with his knives and his 'science.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was surprised when it boldy admitted it.  \"Well of course I don't.\"  Then he said something weirder.  \"But then I don't put much stock in names in general.  They only serve to reinforce the idea that there is <i>something</i> in the body worthy of an indivdual identity.  But they do seem to offer comfort in most cases, and comfort is itself a worthy goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grunted, \"Is that why you torture dragons?  To comfort them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birthing pains, only, my fellow.  Of a new golden age of Dragons and Elves alike.  This is necessary work.  To find the cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cure for what?\"  Blaze asked, baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cure for egotism, of course.\"  said Dr. Moridin cryptically.  \"You are but the first step in a new evolutionary phase of dragon-kind!  One which will intermingle our two races as never before.  You'll come to understand this in time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moriding turned away then, but Blaze was stuck with an idea despite the insanity which had just poured out of his mouth.  \"Wait!\"  he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Dr. Moridin turned, looking expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said understanding can help, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowledge is salve which both soothes and hinders, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then help me understand what you're doing.  What is all of this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had meant the entire project, the capuring of himself and other dragons.  The island and the plot against New Alveri, his home.  But the doctor obvious took him to mean the oncoming surgery.  He gestured to a steel plate over by Auyandrith who was leaning against a wall, her eyes still distant.  In it, slender objects gleamed, looking part metallic, part organic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These torporgic plates are going to be inserted between specific vertebrae in your spine.  The fields they emit will stimulate certain aspects of your physiology over a long period of time in tandum with a series of injections over the next few weeks.  The details will no doubt baffle you and they are of no real importance.  What you should know is that soon you will feel stronger and more virile than you have ever imagined.  It is also my hope that certain illusions will be purged from your adolescent mind.  With any luck you or your offspring at least will be cured of your unhealthy egotistical natures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's fire bladder pulsed hot for the first time in months.  But only bile flowed from his fire ducts, souring his mouth with a sulfer taste.  He'd need several more good meals to begin refilling the oily fuel for his fire.  Blaze realized there was nothing he could to to prevent this from happening, but he said.  \"You're the one whose egotistical!  Who gave you the right to do this to me?  You and all the other elves here!.  You have no right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin merely clucked his tongue as if in great disappointment.  \"Believe me when I say that I know what you are talking about.  Most elves would sit around loving the smell of their own farts, if they'd admit that they do, in fact fart.  Elvish arrogance is next on my list of projects when I'm done here... and I've already had some successes...\"  He gestured to the wider room.  And Blaze did see that some of the lower level assistants had a sort of mild glazed look to their eyes.  \"Our twin societies will one day be able to cast off the burden of self-importance and foolish notions of 'the soul.'  We'll finally be able to live in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could only shake his head.  \"You're insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Moridin cocked his head.  \"You say that now\"  He reached for the gas mask and lowered it to Blaze's nostrils.  \"But in a few weeks or months?  Who knows?  I have hope that you will see the truth.\"  The surgery room faded into black, and Blaze knew nothing more.</span></div></div>",

Across from him, Flamer-2 still slept, as did Flamer-6, like usual, and for a moment he wondered whether the doctor's threat to mutilate him had been but a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Blaze noticed the dull, throbbing pain in his back. Instinctively, Blaze tried to curve his gaze back, only to find that he could not move his head at all. That's when he noticed the odd aluminum cone wrapped around his neck. He reached for the thing with his claw, but a voice held him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would advise you not to attempt to remove the cone. Its to ensure that you don't acidentally cut yourself open again\" said a voice. A young elf stopped in front of his cell, kneeling down. Blaze growled resentfully, though he figured he should have been glad that it wasn't the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" snapped Blaze, his eyes narrowing at the unfamiliar elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your temporary caregiver during your recovery period. You may call me Fang,\" answered the young elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that Fang is not your real name,\" snorted Blaze, \"Then again, using ones real name is bad for your health it seems...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young elf\u2019s gaze narrowed with intrigue. \u201cIndeed, you found that out for yourself didn't you? I take it that this means you would be Flamer-7?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, what about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe good doctor said that you were more clever than any of the other specimens here, and since none of the other subjects are awake and I\u2019ve got nothing better to do, how about we have a brief chat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze narrowed his eyes. He was so used to being treated like an animal that he wondered whether Fang was setting some sort of trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where\u2019s Wolf and his cronies?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been given some much needed time off\u2026\u201d answered Fang with a sly grin. Blaze snorted. Time off probably meant something like being \u2018re-educated\u2019 or something like that, not that Blaze felt sorry for the wretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did the doctor do to me exactly? I didn\u2019t understand all of the doctor\u2019s technical terms, so I was hoping you could tell me what\u2019s going to happen to me physically\u2026\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor has given you implants that are designed to make you grow faster than you normally would. These would include enhanced strength, speed and agility, all designed to make you the perfect fighting machine.\u201d said Fang. Blaze could tell that the young elf was being deliberately vague, and of course, there had to be side effects that would soon become apparent. He was not even half a century old, but in the span of a year he'd grow up to larger than his normal adult size? A hot surge of anger burned through Blaze as he thought about how Dr. Moridin had violated him so. What the doctor had done, it was far worse than being whipped, having the pole shoved up his butt or any like that, but to be manipulated on such a basic level with no control meant that he would never forgive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suspect that you don\u2019t care for what the doctor has done to you though, and that you wish you could flame us all to the powers below if you had the chance,\u201d said Fang, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you\u2019d rather be back where you came from and none of this had ever happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave you that idea?\" said Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t respond. He knew better than to fall for that trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet ask yourself this, was your life back then anything truly worthwhile?\u201d said Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course I\u2019d rather have never gone through this crap!!\u201d retorted Blaze. He expected Fang to immediately reach for the shocking rune, yet he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Back then, you were a nobody, no different from any other drake and probably would have lived your life in obscurity. Feel free to tell me otherwise, but back then, I suspect you were probably a coward and rather timid and would have remained so most likely had we not intervened,\u201d said Fang. Blaze was about to respond, but somehow he found himself paralyzed. Though he hated to admit it, in some ways he was right. Back at the orphanage, he\u2019d always depended on Darzhja and Lady Ramoth to protect him, and when they weren\u2019t there he\u2019d panicked. When he\u2019d been captured, he remember how much he had cried and whined and begged somebody to save him. It had actually been rather pathetic, now that he thought about it, and felt embarassed and emasculated that he'd conducted himself in that manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake, the trial you have endured has been cruel, but would you not say that you have emerged as an individual of much stronger resolve, stronger of body and able to endure so much more hardship because of it? Would you not agree that situations that you would have quailed at before you would have jumped forward to take on now?\u201d he continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could not help but gape with stunned silence. Thinking back upon it, were he the individual he was now when the attack came, he would have killed those kidnappers on the spot, or rather he would have tried to help Darzhja and Kaj rescue people from the rubble no matter what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see Flamer-7,\u201d said Fang, \u201cThis is what the Kleaves are all about. We are cruel because we want you to be strong. If you prove yourself, then you shall be the first of a master race of Dragonkind that will sweep away the decadence of New Alveri and herald in a new order\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grit his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not so easily convinced as that Fang. I\u2019m not that gullible or that stupid\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang folded his arms, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d be able to convince you of our mission so easily Flamer-7. However, the point is that I made you think about it, I made you doubt, even if for a brief moment, whereas before you didn\u2019t do so at all am I correct?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Blaze realized that he\u2019d underestimated Fang. He wasn\u2019t a madman like Moridin, or a cruel brute like Wolf, but the way he spoke was calm and logical. He could read emotions and get the sense of who they were, and could do so without seeming intimidating. Of all the Kleaves he\u2019d met so far, he was certainly\u2026 different from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, its been rather interesting speaking with you Flamer-7. I\u2019ll go check upon the other subjects, and you should probably get some rest. Once you\u2019re fully recovered you can expect that you\u2019ll be put to work straight away,\u201d said Fang. The young elf walked away to check on the others, and Blaze thought upon what he had just said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wolf was back by the beginning of the week. By then, Blaze had recovered by his initial weariness, and in fact was itching to leave his cell. He\u2019d been given a perfunctory check-up, testing his vital signs and his basic motor skills, in which Blaze was relieved to find that he didn\u2019t have any complications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The official trials are beginning today. We are going to take each of you to the obstacle course, where your overall performance will be judged based on speed, accuracy, technique and endurance,\" said Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the handlers came with their cuffs, in which Blaze grudgingly held out his claws to be cuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of the room, there was a roar. \"You think you can hold me down puny humans!! Come on then!! I dare ya to try!!\" boasted Flamer-2. Blaze found the outburst incredibly odd. Flamer-2 was the aggressive sort, but even he had better sense than to openly antagonize the handlers. Wolf was forced to use the shock collar to get Flamer-2 to grudgingly obey, yet his eyes continued to have a wild beast-like glint. Blaze narrowed his eyes; something in Flamer-2 had fundamentally changed following the surgery. He seemed more feral, aggressive, uncontrolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 was a different story. During the past week since the surgery, Flamer-6 had hardly spoken, and though he was quiet to begin with, more alarming to Blaze was the vapid expression in his eyes, lacking any sort of focus or concentrated will. Blaze could only suspect that he had come off worse from Dr. Moridin\u2019s experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flamer-6!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" he said hazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flamer-6!! Stick your claws outside the cage so you can be cuffed!!\" repeated Wolf. Flamer-6 continued to stare blankly, as if he hadn\u2019t heard a word the handler said. It took a collar shock to finally get him moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Master Wolf\u2026\u201d he stammered, \u201cI do not know what came over me. I\u2019m still not quite 100% since the surgery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you better shape up quickly then!!\u201d growled Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet, intelligent drake seemed absolutely arthritic as he raised his trembling claws to be cuffed. Once he was led out, he stumbled out of his cage, murmuring something incoherent to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dug his claws into the rock. He would never forgive the doctor for what he had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped back into focus when Flamer-8 tapped him with his tail. \u201cCome on Flamer-7. There\u2019s nothing we can do right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze merely gave a nod to Flamer-8, before numbly being led toward the obstacle course. Out of all the drakes, Flamer-8 had experienced the least amount of side-effects. Blaze wondered if the reason behind it was the fact that he was the oldest of the remaining Firedrakes, and was already close to fully-grown. Privately, Blaze was glad that Flamer-8 had remained mostly himself following the surgery. However, that wasn't going to stop Blaze to concede anything to Flamer-8. One could not afford to make friends here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the volcanic obstacle course, the usual small team of elves was gathered with clipboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho will be going first?\u201d said Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf pointed toward Blaze. \u201cFlamer-7. Come forward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stepped forward toward the start line and took off. He was surprised at just how much lift and momentum he got, and swept forward with such speed that he almost over passed the first target. Yet faster than he had ever known, Blaze snapped his gaze around and spouted out a powerful bout of flame. Blaze sped through the course, amazed at the ease in which he flew and flamed, how quickly he was able to react and the tightness of his turns. Apparently, the doctor\u2019s surgery had been an enhancement; not that he would ever thank the doctor for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that!!\u201d roared Blaze triumphantly. He didn\u2019t even feel fatigued afterwards, and could easily have had another go at it if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 merely gave a head nod, while Flamer-2 seethed. Blaze averted his gaze quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce new targets were set up, Flamer-8 took his turn. Blaze couldn\u2019t help but be impressed with the older drake as he traversed the course. He wasn\u2019t quite as quick or agile as Blaze was, nor was his flame as potent, but he hardly missed whenever he did flame. When he landed, Flamer-8 gave Blaze wink. Perhaps he\u2019d underestimated Flamer-8 as a potential rival. Blaze would really have to step it up a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Flamer-6. Blaze had almost forgotten that the quiet drake was even there as he numbly stepped forward. It was pretty sad to watch. Flamer-6 flew as if he were an old wyrm. He made only half-hearted attempts to flame the targets, and when he did, he usually missed. Blaze could only shake his head. In his gut, he knew that Flamer-6 would not last much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, came Flamer-2\u2019s turn. He took off like a beast unleashed. He rampaged through the course rather than navigated through it. He was frighteningly fast; faster than all the others, and when he flamed, he flamed as if he were trying to burn down New Alveri all by himself. Blaze did not see a conceited bully anymore; what Blaze saw was a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he cleared the course, he wouldn\u2019t stop. Flamer-2 continued to fly and thrash about, randomly flaming in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurn!! Everything must burn!!\u201d Flamer-2 exhaled. Blaze immediately scampered back toward the entrance, watching wearily as Wolf frantically slammed his fist upon the supressor, but to no avail. Flamer-2 was completely out of control. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing that Blaze was aware of was pain.  Before sight, sound or even precious smell, there was pain the infected his body.  It rose and fell like the tide, swelling like a terrible, blistering fruit and then easing, though never quite gone.  Blaze twitched his legs in response, but then tried not to, twitching caused the pain to spike like nails driven into his spine.  And he did carry most of weight of the pain on his back, although it spread icy tendrils of hurt all along his torso as well.  Blaze thought that his back had been laid open between his wings and when he was able to begin recalling things from just before the surgery, he figured that that was a fair approximation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lay in his cell on a clean pile of hay, his legs sprawled out and his wings jumbled in boney, leathery heaps to either side of him.  He didn't move his head, not yet, but with some effort he worked at opening his eyes.  They were crusty, even at the heavy scaled outer lids.  He'd been asleep already for some time.  He also realized that the ebb and flow of the pain in his back was due to his slow intake and exhale of breath.  Blaze tried not to breathe in too deeply, to lessen the aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough driven by an overwhelming need to inspect the damage the mad scientist's scapel had wrought on his body, Blaze was prevented by an odd contraption.  Though he saw it in his peripheral vision, he didn't really notice what was around his head until he lifted his neck a little and it scraped across the stone floor.  Slightly panicked, Blaze reached up with his paws to the thing which fanned out and alarmingly surrounded his head.  Feeling it, he discovered what it was:  a dragon-sized cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's empty stomach sank in humiliation.  Humans put these things on their beloved canines to prevent them from chewing at their stitches.  The red dragon snorted.  He supposed it was meant to serve the same purpose here.  He ran his forepaws along its cool surface.  It was aluminum reinforced with ribs of steel.  However, Blaze thought that he could remove the blasted thing without too much trouble\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his paws came to the base.  Blaze realized dejectedly that the cone was affixed to his inhibitor collar.  The young drake had no supposition that the two were not linked.  He was sure that if he attempted to remove or break the cone, he'd be shocked brutally.  Blaze let his head sink down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime brought added lucidity.  From the cramping in his legs and the hunger in his belly, he confirmed that he'd been asleep for a long while, though how long exactly remained unknown.  Also, he realized that the pain along his back was not that of a fresh open wound as he'd been fearing.  It was the aching soreness of a <i>healing</i> wound.  Blaze wanted to probe his back with his fingers, like a human would, but his limbs would not bend that way.  The young drake was also still weary and groggy, though he'd only just woken up and had hardly moved.  He was drugged, he realized, only just now coming out of the potion's after effects.  As sensation returned, Blaze was able to isolate five centers of pain along his back.  One each at the base of his neck and the head of his tail and three more along his long torso.  Two for his upper body, and one at the small of his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gave up trying to get anymore information about what had been done to him, Blaze suddenly had the bright notion of looking out across the aisle at his fellow inmates and potential breeder drakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three visible dragons looked to be in a similar condition as he.  Each certainly had silver cones around their heads.  Flamer-2 however happened to be resting with his back towards the hallway and Blaze gasped at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly bulkier dragon did not have five wounds along his spine as Blaze had suspected.  Instead, he had twelve!  Twelve raw, swollen wounds lined the drake's back like a string of ugly pearls.  Each little mound was stitched closed with black cord, making for a fearsome looking wound like something out of a hatchling's horror story; although more and more it seemed, Blaze's life was becoming a horror story.  Flamer-2 moaned in his sleep, he had not yet awoken.  Blaze grimaced, he did not envy Flamer-2 when he did.  From here it looked like the horrid elvish surgeons had replaced every other vertebra in the poor dragon's spine.  Blaze was only glad it wasn't him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their prior rivalry, Blaze couldn't find it in himself to feel that Flamer-2 deserved his fate.  <i>'Nobody deserves this\u2026'</i>  Blaze moaned in his mind.  Then his eyes turned to Flamer-6.  And they turned to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 was awake and had been for some time, as Blaze judged due to the face that he was resting in a normal recline on his belly, with his wings folded, rather than jumbled about and nearly filling his cell like Blaze's.  The dragon across from him stared at Blaze and likely had been for some time.  He snorted in recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze tilted his head in amiable acknowledgement.  However, as he looked at the drake, he did not think that Flamer-6 looked very well.  The first thing he noticed was that the drake's left eye was drooping while his right looked at him with his normal expression of depressed detachment.  As Blaze looked on, he realized that the drake's left wing was not closed as tightly as his right, in fact the lowermost pinion sagged down to the floor.  The same was true for his jowl on the left side.  Flamer-6 even drooled slightly out of the corner of his mouth, something that was highly unbecoming for a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 sneered unevenly at Blaze's worried expression.  He began to turn his head away, but he moved with a jerking motion more akin to a millennia old, arthritic dragon than a young drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze subvocalized, using body language and deep-deep sounds to convey simple meaning.  <i>[Inquiry]:General physical condition?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 stopped his head sidelong, but still had trouble keeping it from bobbing around slightly.  He answered in the same manner.  <i>[Agitated Reply]:  No pain.  Numbness and tingling.  Muscles sluggish.  Feel oddly ill.  [Worried Inquiry]:Enemies maybe inflicted mortal wound?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake across from him had never given Blaze much of a reason to like him.  But he had also never gone out of his way to make him miserable like Flamer-2.  He couldn't help but feel horrible that the elf's procedure had apparently gone wrong somehow and that Flamer-6 was the one who would have to deal with the consequences of their blunder.  <i>[Sympathetic Encouragement]:  Enemies did not strike you down.  This is good.  Hope for medicine from caretakers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 gently nodded his head up and down, the jerking easing somewhat.  <i>[Serious Command]:  Do not tell nearby rival of my weakness.</i>  Blaze knew that he meant Flamer-2.  Then he added directly to Blaze <i>[Intimidating Advice]:  Do not underestimate me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon across from him then slid his head under his wing, sliding into an uneasy slumber.  Blaze inclined his snout grimly.  He didn't intend on brushing Flamer-6 out of the running so easily.  However, he made a mental note of his new weakness on the left side of his body.  It might come in handy if things came to him versus Flamer-6.  He wasn't above using his opponent's weaknesses against them, even if they were unfair weaknesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf Flamer-8, the oldest of the four remaining dragons, he could not see as much.  His back was turned away and his cell was farther away from Blaze's than Flamer-2's.  The young drake could see that he was still sleeping at least.  Flamer-8 kicked his paws twice and snapped his jaws in the throws of  some dream.  If it weren't for the silver collar around his neck, one would think he hadn't even gone through major surgery.  Flamer-8 was one to be wary of as well.  Really, all of them were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed deeply and carefully gather his wings to his back.  Every movement was taxing with the drugs flowing through his veins.  Carefully, carefully, Blaze rolled himself over onto his flank, his recovering back facing the wall.  He held his tail in his forepaws and nibbled away a loose scale in a nervous habit.  Eventually he was able to slide back into dreamless oblivion, a welcome repose from the horrid reality of being a living science experiment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days went by without much incident. Thankfully, the handlers removed the cones, much to the relief of all the young drakes. They spent most of that time re-establishing eating habits and basic motor skills. Everyone, even Flamer-6, was able to handle these without too much trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn't help but be curious when one morning Flamer-8 was led away by Wolf, and then returned to his cage with an especially smug and determined expression that same afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where did they take you that made you grin like that?\" asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 winked, \"Not telling Flamer-7... I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpoilsport\u2026\u201d grunted Flamer-6, lounging upon his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpit it out you wretch!!\u201d snarled Flamer-2, rattling against his cage, his eyes red and bloodshot, \u201cSpit it out or I\u2019ll kill you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up you circus freak\u2026\u201d snapped Flamer-8. Out of all the young drakes, Flamer-8 had the least problems with his surgery; in fact he\u2019d seemed enhanced. He seemed bolder, more decisive, steadier, and now more often than not it was Blaze looking toward the older drake for advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shrugged. He would find out soon enough, when the following morning, Wolf came to fetch for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flamer-7, you will follow me...\" said Wolf coldly. Blaze nodded, not wanting to cause trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was led through a series of corridors leading away from the caldera. They arrived on an elevator, which was then slowly and painfully cranked up by a team of trolls, before arriving upon the backside of the mountain. There was a little bit of light that filtered downwards between the cracks, and overall the atmosphere wasn\u2019t quite as oppressive as down where his cells were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026where exactly are you taking me?\u201d Blaze couldn\u2019t help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough\u2026\u201d answered Wolf. Blaze had his suspicions though, based on Flamer-8\u2019s odd expression that morning. His suspicions were confirmed soon enough when Blaze suddenly overheard a male grunt of exertion from one of the passageways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you whore!! Take it!! Scream for me!! Scream for your master!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026M-master\u2026\u201d wailed a trembling female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d challenged the male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-o-oh y-yes Master!!\u201d strained the female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose seed will you take inside of you?\u201d he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yours Master!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose little ones will you lay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYours Master!! Oh Master!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Blaze\u2019s effort to keep his gaze focused forward as an animalistic roar echoed down the chamber. Privately, he wished that he was the one in that breeder males place, fucking that poor female. Yet it was apparent that some breeder males had already been chosen. That could only mean that time was getting short, and that the selection process was about to get even more urgent and rigorous. As he walked by, from one of the other corridors, a small team of humanoids and their accompanying trolls were rolling a large wagon, and Blaze caught the scent of unhatched eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s instincts told him to leap out and try and stop those crooks, but a shock from Wolf\u2019s collar told him otherwise. <i>One battle at a time Blaze\u2026</i> the young fire drake thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Blaze stopped behind a large metal door, and his hearts began to pound in a mixture of abject fear and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sophisticated metal door opened, and Blaze rounded a corner, and his eyes went wide and his jaw went slack when he saw where he had been taken. There before him within their cells were five very pretty fire drakka. Their aroma immediately hit Blaze all at once and his body trembled. He couldn\u2019t help but note they were all well-fed and healthy, not to mention the sweet curves of their figures and the smoothness of their scales. A hunger unlike he\u2019d ever known burned inside of him, and at that moment he wanted to do nothing else but to be as close as possible with each of them. His loins pulsed hot between his legs, so much so that they ached. It took all his concentration not to simply rush forward and immediately mount the closest drakka he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you\u2019ve noticed that this is where we keep the females of your species\u2026\u201d said Wolf with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDesirable aren\u2019t they?\u201d he prodded. Blaze could only nod numbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose this would give you some added motivation for you to succeed. Becoming the breeder male is not without its rewards after all. However, I will give you the chance to interact with them if you so wish, but do not touch or fondle them you understand?\u201d he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. For all that he was concerned, the handlers voice could have come from a hundred miles away. Blaze slowly made his way toward each of them, and as he did so he could not help but inhale each of their unique aromas. The females merely sat there, unmoving, too fearful to do anything but lie there and shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner, there was one that was especially beautiful. Whatever the reason, there was something about that drakka in the corner that drew Blaze in and wanted to know more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026hello\u2026\u201d cried Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka let out a high-pitched squeal and lashed at Blaze with a defensive wing-slap. Blaze hardly felt the blow, but the fact that he\u2019d been slapped by a drakka rankled. His eyes narrowed furiously and growled as his claw tensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when Blaze saw her shiver, bracing for return blow, Blaze\u2019s anger suddenly cooled like a hot iron being dumped into a vat of freezing water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, he was overwhelmed by a sense of pity and shame. He must have looked like an animal; a beast to her eyes, and indeed that\u2019s probably how each of the drakka viewed the males. They were base creatures that thought only about slaking their lusts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 are you scared of me?\u201d he asked. The drakka stared at him with those wide eyes of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026don\u2019t blame you if you are. The fact of the matter is, I\u2019m\u2026we\u2019re\u2026all just as sacred as you are.\" cried Blaze awkwardly. \u201cI know its hard, but you all can\u2019t give up...\u201d he continued. \u201cSo that one day\u2026one day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn\u2019t go on, gritting his teeth together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts all right\u2026\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try and make us feel better with false hope and other things like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn\u2019t help but hack out a laugh. \u201cGuess I probably sounded like a total sap\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit, but thanks for trying anyhow,\u201d she responded, with a slight smile. It was the sweetest thing Blaze had ever seen. Blaze couldn\u2019t help but put on his best encouraging smile of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026well\u2026 I suppose it just helps me stay sane, um\u2026\u201d answered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts Fi-\u2026\u201d she began to respond, but then paused, claws going to her slightly glowing shock collar. \u201cIts Honeysweet\u2026\u201d she sighed glumly. Blaze grunted. Apparently, the females had their own naming system designed to turn them into sexual objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but Honeysweet\u2019s a nice name,\u201d answered Blaze. That indignant frown she gave him only served to excite him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m Flamer-7\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet right then, Blaze felt a jolt against his neck. He shifted his gaze toward Wolf, who stood there holding the shock amulet. Blaze briefly shifted his gaze back toward Honeysweet, \u201cJust stay alive all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just for emphasis he extended his gaze toward all the drakka, \u201cAll of you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Flamer-7\u2026\u201d answered Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Blaze was led out of the drakka chamber, his thoughts fixated upon them. He wondered why Honeysweet had attracted him more than the others. She hadn\u2019t looked for his special attention, or for special favor. Maybe it was her scent that radiated a bit differently compared with the others. Perhaps it was the fact that the shade of red on her hide was a little bit brighter and more luminous than the others. Or, maybe it was something in her gaze. Those red eyes seemed more aware and lucid than the others. Or perhaps, there was something that reminded Blaze about home; he got the sense that she could have easily fit in with the rest of his fellow orphans. Or, it was the fact that she had almost said her real name, and that Blaze wanted to protect her so that one day he could learn her real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the real reason, the thought of her being taken by any of the other males, especially Flamer-2, immediately brought forth a surge of rage to his hearts. None of them would be able to understand or empathize with her; they\u2019d treat her like a piece of meat. Blaze\u2019s eyes furrowed; he was the only one that could protect them, to keep them alive and prevent them from falling into despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Wolf couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. It did not occur to Blaze that it was exactly this possessive, protective attitude that the Kleave\u2019s had wanted to foster within the young drake\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze<br>\r\nThe scent of the females in the locked room lingered in Blaze's nostrils even after he was escorted.  At least one of them had been receptive just now and the love-scent made his loins hurt with unfulfilled desire.  Blaze tried not to think of sleek red scales and long elegant wings\u2026 he partially succeeded.  The smelly human walking in front of him help bring keep his mind on more important matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snuffled as he walked.  Walking without an armed escort was new, however with his back still recovering, walking was as much as he could manage comfortably, he was still not in any shape to fight.  Wolf walked ahead of him and an assistant several paces to the side and behind him.  Both of them had control amulets for his collar he knew.  It wasn't safe for one human to escort a grown drgaon, Blaze figured.  But with two, they could watch each other's backs.  Wolf's second certain kept a pair of muddy brown eyes on him most of the time.  He stank of fear and aggression and was more likely to give Blaze a mild shock for stepping out of line than Wolf was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze walked slowly after the humans, their pace slow for his longer legs.  He had a lot of opportunity to reflect again on where this hive of Kleaves kept the precious females hoarded.  They were closer to the surface for starters, almost on the same level as the wonderous half ring where the elves and dwarves dwelled.  The air was better and there were even skylights on the main walkway.  The dwarves painted the walls and floor there white, so better to diffuse some of the precious sunlight into the side branches.  Blaze sighed.  He thought it was nice that the females were housed communally, though seperated by breed, rather than individually as the males where down in the pits below even the human warrens.  \"Even the small privileges should be cherished in this situation,\" Blaze thought.  He couldn't abide the thought of those beautiful, attractive... lucious, voluptuous... females being abused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ground his teeth when he heard beastial roaring echoing down the halls again.  The male in question seemed to think his job was to make as much noise as possible while performing the act.  That the females here were, in fact being abused - and brutally at that - was without question.  It filled Blaze with a deep unreasonable rage to hear the crime in progress and hear the dragoness sigh and squeal in distress, no matter if she was his own species or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze turned his head as they passed by the reinforced door leading into the harem wing off the main branch they were walking.  Through the grate, Blaze could spy black wings and a sleek, muscular back scaled in black so rich and deep it seemed to drink in the light.  He had a smaller black scaled body under him.  She writhed on her back, though whether in pleasure or pain, Blaze couldn't tell.  The red dragon sneered as the large black male grappled with the female, holding down her arms and plunging himself brutally down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Take it!\"  he roared,  \"Take it you worthless cunt!  You whore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Deathwing did not scream so much as moan and Blaze still could not tell if she was distressed or pleased.  Blaze snarled and ground his teeth silently.  Dragons were made to make love in the air or in the water as a second best choice.  The way he was doing it must had been extremely uncomfortable for the female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze wanted so badly to force his way through the door and confront the terrible breeder male.  The Deathwing was bigger than him, but he had his flame and enough anger to melt the entire chamber into slag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seething pain in his neck choked him, a medium level shock.  Blaze reluctantly turned his head to see Wolf waiting for him down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No free peep shows.\"  said the  bearded human.  Then he grinned and removed his thumb from the center glass plate of the amulet.  \"You'll have your chance later... if you're lucky.\"  The man laughed as Blaze stepped forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey almost made it out of the female dorms when another dragon was being escorted on foot through the single exit and entrance.  He came with a large entourage and even a mounted unit.  The humaniods who followed in his wake took up the entire breadth of the wide hallway.  Wolf's eyes went wide and he directed Blaze into a side passage so as to be out of the way.  The fellow was quite large and sported a gleaming hide of bronze, definitely a full blooded regal.  Blaze frowned, that breed was not one he would have suspected the Kleaves would be interested in or had as much luck converting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male snarled at Blaze as was trying to back into the little corridor.  His head rose a good four feet higher than his own and his many horns higher still.  He must have been more than double Blaze's weight, all of it muscle.  \"Out of my way, ember-baby.\"  the arrogent Bronze snapped.  In a flash like a snake-strike, he reached out his head and nipped Blaze on his haunches.  He jumped and the Bronze laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stood panting and quivering with anger in the corridor.  He'd never felt this angry before!  Only because the dragon litterally had a small army at his back was Blaze able to reign in his desire to burn the guy and rip his chared corpse asunder.  The anger made his head hurt... what was wrong with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf looked up at him, his thumb over the control for his collar.  \"We going to have a problem here, Big Guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath shuddered in Blaze's throat, all he saw was red.  He focused on the dimness of the narrow corridor ahead.  He was fortunate that it was built for humanoids, not dragons.  He would have to back out again to turn around.  \"No... I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf looked up at him suspiciously.  \"Well, for a second there it looked like you were ready to take on <i>Lord Azimoth</i> himself.\"  Wolf said the name with obvious irreverence, wiggling his fingers in the air as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Blaze looked down at the man.  \"And what if I was...?\"  he said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf snorted and palmed the control amulet.  \"Then you got bigger balls than brains and that's saying something for such a smart-ass as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked over his shoulder and snaked his tail into the hallway around his legs.  \"Master Wolf.  Do you know what they are doing?\"  Sounds were coming down from the hallway, mostly of iron doors clanging and chains rattling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf waved his arms about.  \"Transporting dragon bitches.  What else do they do these days?  You'll see.\"  The human walked up and socked Blaze hard in the chest - which was like a tap for the dragon - his oil filled fire bladder sounded like a drum when he did so.  \"Just a warning.  If Azimoth catches you even looking at his females, he'll kill you on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze thought he was kidding, but the man's voice betrayed his very real caution.  Thus the fire drake kept his head low as the procession returned, this \"Lord Azimoth\" at the head and keeping an eye on the bronze drakka who walked behind him.  From the sound of it, she walked covered in chains all over her body.  Blaze allowed himself only a small peek from between his legs.  Though she was larger than him once over, he wanted to reach out to her, to comfort and make her know that someone cared... his loins ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf gave him a mild shock, staring up at Blaze with wide eyes.  \"Stoppit, you'll get us both killed!!\" he said in a harsh whisper.  Blaze realized that his penile slit had begun to swell, the first stage of desire.  Blaze shook his head again, wondering desperately why he was feeling this way so strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzimoth was utterly disdainful of Blaze as he walked by, offering a quick warning growl in his direction and that was all.  Apparently he thought Blaze not even worth the time for a proper chastisement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out a breath when the dragon, drakka and the human guards surrounding them passed.  He asked dully and without thinking.  \"Where are they going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf sneered and looked up at the fire drake.  \"Some place you'll never see them again.  That was the last bronze left on the island.\"  The human rubbed his mouth with the side of his hand and sniffed.  \"With any luck I'll get a bigger office when they start moving things around...\"  he grumbled mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was returned to his cell and the young drake sat down limply on his bed of hay; it felt softer than usual.  He was weary, though excited still, but his excitement frightened him.  His own bodily responses were becoming different and he knew the reason why.  Blaze closed his eyes and sighed.  It almost felt as if his mind were unraveling, almost as if there was another Blaze inside of him, a different Blaze... the Blaze that the Kleaves wanted to get to know better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze rushed back up when he saw who Wolf was escorting next.  He pressed himself against the bars as Flamer-2 stepped out of his cell.  Wolf glanced at the big fire drake uneasily and selected three more assistants to join him on the trip; he made them walk between him and Flamer-2.  A vile grin hung on the drake's face.  \"I smell drakka...\"  he said lustily and didn't even bother to hide his reaction to the trace odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gripped the bars, forcing his snout through the gap.  \"Don't you touch them!\"  he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  said Flamer-2 rounding on him, setting his shoulders forward.  \"You want all of those whores to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not whores, you don't even know what you're talking about!\"  shouted Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 sniffed, \"Maybe not... But I aim to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was judging how much fire he could put out between the bars of his cell when suddenly both he and Flamer-2 were shocked so hard that their legs gave out.  Blaze lay gasping on the ground as Flamer-2 was forced to crawl back into his cell.  \"You'll go last for that.\"  decried Wolf, and selected Flamer-6 in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon limped out of his cell.  It was the first time that he'd seen Flamer-6 walk since the surgery.  Elvish medical staff had been in and out of Flamer-6's cell ten times more often than the rest of then since they'd awoken, however whatever they'd been doing seemed to have only moderate success.  The dragon's left wing still sagged, though at least it did not hang on the ground.  His face was less lopsided now, but always his expressions were uneven, the left eye never opened all the way.  When Flamer-6 lifted a paw, it shook a bit as it moved in its normal arc.  However Flamer-6 set a grim expression on his face.  Looking at that alone, one would never tell that he was unwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 spat at him when he walked by.  \"You better leave some for me-ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf shocked the dragon again, sending Flamer-2 to the floor.  The human growled.  \"Know your place, freak!  If it were up to me, you wouldn't even get to see them at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 lifted his head, outrageously against everything they'd learned so far about surviving in this place.  \"You're... next, human.\"  He yelled as Wolf zapped him again.  The human seemed ragged as he stepped long legged up the corridor.  His sweat smelled of a heightened sense of fear.  He patted Flamer-6 on the foreleg as he walked on by.  \"Come along.\"  he said briskly.  \"Not much time left for sight-seeing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lifted his head from where he lay collapsed against the bars.  He could hear Flamer-2 chuffing.  He couldn't imagine the pain the dragon must be in now, after being shocked three times; but then he'd asked for it.  \"Ack-ack-ack-ah-ah\" when the sound he was making.  It was a long time before Blaze realized that Flamer-2 was laughing, chuckling to himself in a deranged way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire drake pulled himself achingly to his feet and stuck his nose through the bars. \"Flamer-2?\"  he asked uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Fire-lord lifted his head, as if the sound of Blaze's voice had broken his trance.  He sneered at Blaze.  \"Damn humans don't know their place...\"  he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shook his head.  \"What's wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2's eyes looked momentarily distant, as if he were asking himself the same question.  \"Mind your own business, brainiac.\"  unsteadily, the muscular fire dragon got to his feet, leaning against the bars.  \"I'll see you broken or dead before this is over, mark my words, Flamer-7\"  he said dangerously, slurring just a bit.  \"Same goes for you, Oldster!\" he shouted in Flamer-8's direction.  His head bobbed almost drunkenly.  \"All them females they got back there will be mine... they <i>are</i> mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 weaved his way onto his bed of straw and did not move again until Flamer-6 had returned with Wolf.  The human dragon tender did not let Flamer-2 back out of his cell until he had several armed guards at his back.  Although Flamer-2 left with a grin on his face, he returned unconcious and being hauled on a wagon.  As they were removing his big body to his cell, Wolf sauntered over to Blaze's cell.  He nodded towards Flamer-2's limp body.  \"Told him look, but don't touch.  Bastard couldn't keep his claws to hisself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's nostrils flared and he raised his head from where he'd been curled on his straw pile.  \"Did he hurt any of th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't let him get close enough for that.\"  Wolf sniffed again and rubbed his mouth, a trifle more confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze quirked his eyebrow.  \"Why are you telling me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf looked at him shrewdly.  \"Cause you know how the system works.  Him?\"  he threw a tumb over his shoulder.  \"He's an animal.  You make my job easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze curled the corner of his mouth.  \"Are you saying you want me to be the breeder male?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf showed his teeth momentarily.  \"I ain't saying nothing.  The wigs upstairs get the final say anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something in the human's tone...  \"But you do get <i>some</i> of the say, don't you?\"  Blaze said, lowering his voice a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human scratched his beard.  Instead of answering, he said.  \"Breeder males get pretty prestigeous around here, you know.  A lot of them get real chummy with the elves and they talk about grand things.  New Alveri this... and Invasion that...  But hardly any of them remember they used to be down here in the pits with us in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snorted, \"Lord Azimoth seemed like he had a pretty big stick up his vent.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"  said Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence between them for a long moment.  The human looked up at him almost expectantly.  Blaze thought about what was being unsaid.  \"I don't think I'd be like that.\"  said Blaze.  \"I couldn't forget...\"  that much was certainly truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf rubbed his oily nose.  \"Glad to hear your the sort of person who'd remember where he came from...\"  he said vaguely and then wandered off.  Dinner was served late that night and cold, but Blaze didn't mind.  He had an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought a long time about Wolf and what he may or may not have been saying.  Was it possible that he could help him become the breeder male... in exchange for favors later down the road?  Wolf seemed like the sort to offer that to anyone who looked like a potential candidate, however.  Blaze was unfamiliar with this kind of subterfuge and the possibilities made his mind twist over on itself.  As he ate his fish, however, he was sure of one thing.  \"I remember where I came from.\"  he said under his breath and he greedily devoured the saltwater fish.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was about three weeks after Blaze's life altering surgery when the young drake awoke one night to a soft tapping on the bars of his cell.  Blearily, Blaze lifted his head, both lids slid over crusty eyes and revealed a strange sight.  It was a young elf.  A more preposterous sight, Blaze could scarcely imagine and he decided that he must be dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf was a young man.  If he were human he couldn't have been older than 16.  As he was an elf, however, he may have been as old as 25 already.  Still, it was the middle of the night and he was here alone with no torch or light source to guide his way.  He might have been some ruffian here from the upper rings to poke and prod the captive dragons, but his dress belayed that idea.  The adolescent was richly dressed in an embroidered robe of scarlet.  Dragons and flame motifs were emblazoned on his sleeves and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze sniffed and smelled the elf, he decided that he was not, in fact, dreaming. This was no illusion and from the smell of things, the elf was only a few short years away from adulthood, much as Blaze was; in a dragon's sense of time, that is.  He smelled tense and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young elf reached out and gripped the bars - which were widely spaced for him - and spoke.  His voice offered no hint of the emotions that Blaze detected.  He seemed as calm and confident as any elf Blaze had yet seen.  \"Good evening.\"  the  rich tones dropped with a surprising basso that belayed his years as well as the fact that he was an elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blaze didn't forget.  He couldn't.  Elves were dangerous, even more so when there were no other witnesses around.  Blaze watched him carefully and grunted acknowledgement to let him know he was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Fang.\"  said the elf.  His eyes lit up with expectation.  Blaze cocked his head in interest, bringing a large orb around to look at the small elf.  This was the first he had met - besides Dr. Moridin - who seemed to want a response from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze cleared his throat and spoke softly - for a dragon - mindful of the other sleeping in their cells across the wide hallway.  \"Fang?\"  he asked incredulously, both because the elf had interrupted his sleep and because he had a strong sense that this adolescent was not supposed to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man cocked his head, apparently surprised at Blaze's irreverence.  The dragon expected to pay for his slight, but instead the elf defended himself.  \"Indeed, that is my name.\"  he insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that Fang is not your <i>real</i> name,\" snorted Blaze, \"I find it odd that an elf would take a nickname so\u2026 dragony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young elf\u2019s gaze narrowed with intrigue. He grinned. \"You're actually the first dragon to ask me about that.  Let's just say that I find it easier to relate to the dragons I meet with a name that might be less alien to them.  I take it that this show of curiosity means you would be Flamer-7?  Not that that is your <i>real</i> name either.\"  he added proddingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what about it?\u201d asked Blaze, cocking his head and studying the young elf with one eye.  \"It's not like I chose to be called 'Flamer-7,' you know.  Though, I am sure that you chose 'Fang' for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, that is true, but really, who around here uses their real names?  Names are powerful you know.\"  The elf winked up at him.  \"But enough with semantics.  The good doctor said that you were more clever than any of the other specimens here.\u201d  The elf sniffed, \"He told me to be cautious around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze rumbled deep in his throat.  \"Caution around a dragon is never a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so.\" said Fang. \"Now listen, I've been offered a small opportunity to expand my skills and familiarize myself with dragons in general by Dr. Moridin.  It's time you got your stitches out and I'm the one who's to remove them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze narrowed his eyes. He was so used to being treated like an animal that he wondered whether Fang was setting some sort of trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where\u2019s Wolf and his cronies?\u201d asked Blaze.  \"Why don't they do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been given some much needed time off\u2026\u201d answered Fang with a sly grin. Blaze snorted.  \"The Fire-drake handler has been making noise about some time off to see his wife and child down at the port.  Or some silly thing like that\"  said the elf with a wave of his fair skinned hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze silently regarded the elf before him.  <i>\"Who is this kid?\"</i>  he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enter your cell now.\" said Fang.  \"You wouldn't do something stupid like try to harm me would you?\"  he asked, and his voice wavered just so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shifted and adjusted his wings a little.  \"You have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the elf was skinny enough to slip between the bars of the cell, he waved some kind of emblem or broach over the recognition plate that was connected to the small door set in the larger, dragon sized portal leading out of the cage.  It seemed that he was indeed who he claimed to be.  As he was entering, the elf said.  \"Some say the word of a dragon isn't worth its toenail clippings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sneered, showing many sharp fangs.  \"And in other places, a dragon's favor is considered more valuable than gold.\"  The door clanged shut.  \"And isn't it foolish for one so small and\u2026 flammable to say such a thing while entering a dragon's lair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted and walked with carless grace into what might have been for him a rather spacious room.  \"You aren't going to hurt me.\"  he said and proceeded to step over Blaze's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought down a strong urge to lift it and trip him.  \"And why do you say that?\" asked Blaze, still eyeing the elf as he moved around his body, orange irises almost seeming to glow in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf came around, walking on the deep straw to Blaze's back; the dragon was able to keep a close eye on him still due to his long neck.  He studied the hideous black threads which had been binding his flesh together over the mounds where the implants were buried.  They were much smaller and smoother now that the swelling had gone.  \"Because you gave me your word.\"  said the elf and then removed a small knife from his pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf dipped the knife's blade into a vial of clear, strong smelling fluid and then approached Blaze's back.  He used it to cut off one of the knots and then - after dabbing some of the fluid on his hands and rubbing them together - proceeded to draw forth the thick thread with both hands, steadily and carefully.  \"You show good scale regrowth.\"  remarked Fang when more of the wound had been exposed after the threads were gone.  \"It should be seamless with some diligent pruning of the edges here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cutting didn't hurt at all, although the drake experienced discomfort when the elf pulled the threads loose, even more when he sparkled some of his disinfectant onto the wound where it oozed a little thick ruby blood.  Blaze swallowed and said, \"What are you, some sort of dragon surgeon in training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf chuckled to himself and cut the last string on the wound at the base of his tail.  He drew out the stitch and said, \"Not really.  Although the skill set is a little similar.\"  he threw the bloody black string aside and wiped up the area with a damp cloth.  He let out a little breath now that the first implant was done.  \"Illustrations in books and moving glyphs don't do justice.  I believe that to understand dragons, you have to get down here and do the job yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what job is that?\"  Blaze persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smiled quirkily.  \"Maybe another time\u2026 if you can keep your testicles long enough.\"  Blaze's half smile immediately vanished and both were silent for a long while as the elf worked steadily up Blaze's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple task, although since Blaze was such a large creature in comparison to the elf-lad, it was still a lot of work for him.  Blaze chewed on the quandary of the elf's presence for a long while.  When Fang took a break after finishing the third wound, Blaze turned his head about and asked, \"So, do you know what the doctor did to me exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't he tell you?\"  asked Fang.  \"Dr. Moridin is famous for talking to his patients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If mad ramblings count as talking\u2026</i> thought Blaze.  He said. \"I didn't understand his technical speech.  I just know that he put something in my spine\u2026 five somethings.\"  Blaze could not hide the disgust in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang seemed to mull this over, obviously weighing what to share and how to put it in terms Blaze would understand.  \u201cThe doctor has given you implants that are designed to make you grow faster than you normally would. But not only that.  They should also increase your strength, speed, agility and even your adult size; all designed to make you the perfect fighting machine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could tell that the young elf was being deliberately vague, and of course, there had to be side effects that would soon become apparent. He was not even half a century old, but in the span of a year he'd grow up to larger than his normal adult size? A hot surge of anger burned through Blaze as he thought about how Dr. Moridin had violated him so. What the doctor had done, it was far worse than being whipped, having the pole shoved up his butt or any like that, but to be manipulated on such a basic level with no control meant that he would never forgive him.</span></div></div>",

Of course I\u2019d rather have never gone through this crap!!\u201d retorted Blaze angrily. He expected Fang to immediately reach for a shocking rune - or whatever defense he undoubtedly had with him - yet he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Back then, you were a nobody, no different from any other drake and probably would have lived your life in obscurity. Feel free to tell me otherwise, but back then, I suspect you were probably a coward and rather timid and would have remained so most likely had we not intervened,\u201d said Fang. Blaze was about to respond, but somehow he found himself paralyzed. Though he hated to admit it, in some ways he was right. Back at the orphanage, he\u2019d always depended on Darzhja and Lady Ramoth to protect him, and when they weren\u2019t there he\u2019d panicked. When he\u2019d been captured, he remember how much he had cried and whined and begged somebody to save him. It had actually been rather pathetic, now that he thought about it, and felt embarrassed and emasculated that he'd conducted himself in that manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake, the trial you have endured has been cruel, but would you not say that you have emerged as an individual of much stronger resolve, stronger of body and able to endure so much more hardship because of it? Would you not agree that situations that you would have quailed at before you would have jumped forward to take on now?\u201d he continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could not help but gape with stunned silence. Thinking back upon it, were he the individual he was now when the attack came, he would have killed those kidnappers on the spot, or rather he would have tried to help Darzhja and Kaj rescue people from the rubble no matter what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see Flamer-7,\u201d said Fang, \u201cThis is what the Kleaves are all about. We give you hardship because we want you to be strong. If you prove yourself, then you shall be the first of a master race of Dragonkind that will sweep away the decadence of New Alveri and herald in a new order\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grit his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not so easily convinced as that Fang. I\u2019m not that gullible or that stupid\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang folded his arms, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d be able to convince you of our mission so easily Flamer-7. However, the point is that I made you think about it, I made you doubt, even if for a brief moment, whereas before you didn\u2019t do so at all am I correct?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Blaze realized that he\u2019d underestimated Fang. He wasn\u2019t a madman like Moridin, or a cruel brute like Wolf, but the way he spoke was calm and logical. He could read emotions and get the sense of who they were, and could do so without seeming intimidating. Of all the Kleaves he\u2019d met so far, this one was certainly\u2026 different from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang let out a large breath.  \"Anyways, enough with that.  I still have two more of these things to fix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Fang did fix them, wielding his knife and his hands with great skill and care.  The last two were not even as painful and the previous ones.  Fang obviously learned quickly and also cared about Blaze's comfort at least enough to improve his style.  Once, he used a pair of tongs to remove an ingrown scale.  It hurt worse than a hair being plucked - the roots reaching far deeper than the mammalian counterpart - and it bled significantly.  Blaze noticed that Fang sopped up this fresh blood with a different cloth as he applied pressure.  When it stopped, he pocketed that cloth along with the removed scale.  He apologized for the discomfort, but said that it was better to take care of that now, rather than waiting.  Blaze said nothing of the tokens the elf had pocketed from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door clanged shut as the elf departed.  He had tossed the rags and old strings into Blaze's sandbox to be picked up later, so he carried nothing more with him than he came with; again aside from the scale and the cloth soaked in Blaze's blood.  \"It's been very nice speaking with you, Flamer-7.\" said Fang.  \"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze eyed the young elf.  \"Aren't you going to go see the other drakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang paused in his step and looked around them.  \"Who?  Them?\"  Then the elf got a rather devious smile on his face.  \"Let me just say that I have a special interest in you, New Alverian.\"  He winked at Blaze as the dragon's jaw dropped slightly.  \"Why do you think I'm here in the middle of the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf said nothing more as he stepped soundlessly out and down the dark passage.  As he turned the corner out into the main branch, Blaze saw a sudden illumination flicker to life down the way the elf had gone.  The drake figured he must have lit a torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire-drake had a lot of things to think about  as he rose from the straw, turned several times and resettled himself on his hay pile.  The least of which was the prospect of somehow reaching his adult size in just one year and whatever physiological side effects he might suffer for Dr. Moridin's experiment.  However, Blaze did not think about that so much as he thought about Fang and his words.  He put an interesting spin on what was happening here in this hidden mountain facility on a faraway isle.  The idea that the Kleaves were actually trying to make him into a better stronger dragon was slightly more contemplative now that he was not having a stick shoved up his vent every other day.  But still\u2026 Fang was crazy if he thought he was going to come around to their view of things\u2026 ever?  Yes, ever!  thought Blaze determinedly.  He sighed, feeling exhausted mentally as well as physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring emptily across the darkened chamber, Blaze tried to drag himself back down into peaceful sleep.  He was interrupted, however when he noticed a pair of faint glimmers.  They were in Flamer-8's cell!  One of the glimmers winked at him.  Blaze winked back.  What else could he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three days after Blaze had his stitches out - and after being serviced by medical assistants trimming the uneven scales over the healed wounds - the drake's back was as smooth as comely as it had ever been... save for the five, small smooth mounds where the implants lay instead of his natural vertebrae.  Dr. Moridin himself came down to the pens that day to perform the last physicals himself.  The silver haired elf looked at their tongues and teeth, examined them in arcane ways with his silver neural whip, and drew blood.  At the end of it all, he declared Blaze healthy and fully recovered.  \"He's ready for stage two.\"  said the elf to Auyandrith as he exited the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered his cell then as Dr. Moridin moved on.  The lithe female pacified him without even speaking to him.  As Blaze lay tormented on the ground, quivering and afraid to move for fear of eliciting more pain from the cruel assistant, they brought out the needles.  Auyandrith and four other elves used frighteningly large syringes, almost a liter in volume, on each little mound along his spine.  They injected just to the side of the hard lumps and to Blaze it felt like ice that spread first along his spine and then creeping outwards into his body.  It was over in a few moments, but Blaze was dealing with the aftereffects long after the elves left his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did the same for all of them, one injection for each implant; which meant three for Flamer-8, seven for Flamer-6 and a dozen for Flamer-2.  The muscular fire-drake was done last and he howled for hours after the elves had left, screaming that his insides were freezing, screaming for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Flamer-6, Blaze was surprised that Dr. Moridin declared him healthy and approved the next step.  He felt sure that the doctor should have noticed his issues when he was examining them with his fiendish device.  But then, as Blaze recalled, Dr.  Moridin had not used the word \"healthy\" when he dictated his status to Auyandrith for transcription.  He'd only said \"recovered from surgery.\"  Flamer-6, if he was in great pain, suffered in silence.  Blaze noticed, during the scant times when the dragon moved - that his jerky motion, which had been getting better, was now as bad as it had been right after surgery; if not worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was envious of Flamer-8 who stood at the bars apparently oblivious of what each drake was going through.  He tried several times to ask what Blaze was going through, but the younger drake ignored him.  He just wanted to lay on his mat and wait for the hurting to go away... if it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coldness crept through his veins, speading down his shoulders and huanches.  Blaze shivered and even resorted to blowing embers onto his limbs and torso to relieve the pervieced freezing.  It didn't really help, the oily fire sliding off his scales, now restored to a healthy luster with a healthy diet.  In time, the dread cold left his spine and eased in the rest of his body.  Instead rather than cold, Blaze felt a strong tingling as well as pins and needles in the muscles of his shoulders and back and his haunches as well.  Blaze shuddered and twitched his legs uncontrollably off and on through the night.  <i>it hurt.</i>  Ice turned later to heat that Blaze could feel in his muscles and bones.  Muscles rippled up and down his body, twitching of their own accord.  The drake tired and fatigued, even though he was just lying there, but the twitching would not stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst, however was the aching in his skeleton.  It felt almost as if the bones were being pulled on by some phantasmal force.  Blaze almost thought that his bones were being broken, micron by micron and that by morning, he would be a scaly sac of broken pieces and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by morning, most of the symptoms had passed.  Blaze got unsteadily to his feet afraid of broken bones, but having to confirm for himself what had happened.  His legs felt fine, they ached, but felt stable, strong.  Blaze lifted his head and wobbled a little.  The room looked strange.  It was the same... but different.  After careful analysis, Blaze realized the difference.  He was looking down on it from a slightly different vantage.  He'd grown several inches in the night!  He realized one other thing.  He was ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf came walking down the hallway, a shovel over one shoulder, the chain of a troll slave connected to the collar of another.  Despite the fact that he'd eaten last night, his pangs were so bad, Blaze was moved to speak to the handler.  \"Master Wolf, Dr. Moridin did something to us yesterday and now I am dying of hunger.  Please can you bring us some fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stopped and yanked on the chain to bring the troll to his knees.  As he was looking at Blaze, Flamer-6 spoke.  \"Please, some fish for me too, Master Wolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me some beef, human!\"  Flamer-2 commented as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf covered his ears with the dragon voices booming at him.  \"Alright!  Alright!\"  he shouted over the din.  \"The doctor told me you'd all be needing extra rations anyways.\"  The human stomped down the hall to his office, left the troll chained outside like a dog and jogged down to the main course.  It took too long, but everything seemed to get better when Blaze had a big tunny in each paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was eating and standing, Blaze was free of pain, however when he laid back down, the twitching and aching in his muscles and bones slowly resumed.  Standing and pacing helped as well as excercise.  Blaze saw Flamer-2 doing push-ups in his cell across the way and the young drake copied him.  Physical activity kept the pins and needles at bay...  However, Blaze foresaw another long night ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shuddered when Dr. Moridin returned that day to see the effects of the injections.  He had only to lay a hand on the muscles of his shoulders, which were hot to the tough, before a wide grin spread on his thin face.  \"Success!\"  he declared and gave Blaze a pat.  The dragon struggled to keep from snarling down at the dread doctor.  \"One step closer to greatness, my friend.  One step closer...\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe check-up was cursory, but there would be more to come.  That one day had one final surprise in store for the restless drakes.  A dwarvish courier came puffing along the hallway and entered Wolf's office about three hours before regular feeding time; Blaze was already getting hungry again.  Fifteen minutes later Wolf burst out of his tiny closet office with a huge grin on his face.  He rattled his regular beating club along the bars of the cells.  \"Congratulations, drakes!  We're moving out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened quickly.  Blaze not having any worldly possesions to speak of, was simply walked to his new living place.  Blaze noticed that Wolf chose him as first to go.  Walking felt better than pacing for keeping the weird effects of the drugs he'd been injected with at bay.  Despite having been moving about all day, Blaze felt energetic and restless as he walked along with Wolf down the twisting stone hallways of the complex.  His tail waved high behind him.  The prospect of a new living place - much better than his old cell, Wolf assured him - seemed almost like a grand adventure.  Blaze spoke with anticipation in his voice.  \"Master Wolf?\"  he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may speak, Flamer-7\"  said the human, continuing to lead the way through the tunnels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this place we're going?  Why are we being moved now?\"  The words tumbled out of his mouth and caused the human ahead of him to look over his shoulder back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head slightly, Wolf said, \"Well, as for where we're going, it's actually Lord Azimoth's old harem.  It'll be your temporary quarters until the final decision is made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to answer both questions.  The prospect of living in a former harem tickled oddly in the back of Blaze's mind and seemed a little funny.  However he had no real problem with it, as long as it meant more space to move around in.  Flamer-2 on the other hand...  Blaze smirked, imagining the more macho drake's reaction to being housed in former female quarters.  His thoughts still prickling in his head, Blaze was moved to ask, \"What's going to happen with our old cells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf responded more readily.  \"That space is being converted into more living space for our warrens.  It's been years coming.  The elves seem to think it fine and proper that our ring has devolved into slums through over population.  Arrogant bastards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze knew better than to comment of Wolf's irreverence.  They were both subsidiaries to the elves... some more than others, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze and Wolf entered the main course several levels higher than where they had been.  However, this passage was a little different from the level where the fire-drakka were being house.  Wolf brought Blaze to a heavy iron door much larger than what a fire-drake needed.  Wolf, in leiu of trolls slaves to assist him, commanded Blaze to open the door after he unlocked the thing with a pass-brooch.  Blaze was eager and put his back into the effort to move the heavy thing.  It was three feet thick and solid dwarvish construction.  A more effective barrier, Blaze had not yet seen.  Despite its being well balenced, it took his dragon's strength to fight the door's sheer inertia.  Once it began to move, it shifted gracefully and silently, revealing a grand chamber beyond...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze's eyes went open with wonder as he surveyed the new facility. Of course, compared to his quarters back in the orphanage it was still rather spartan, yet having been enclosed in a smelly cell this was almost heaven. The chamber was roughly circular in shape. In the center of the chamber was a flat platform, and surrounding it was a odd assortment of uneven ledges and rock formations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going back to fetch the others now... feel free to look around if you want...\" said Wolf. Wolf retreated through the thick metal doors, leaving Blaze alone. It was a very odd feeling to be by himself, without a human watching over him. Yet Blaze paused; he could not make the assumption that he was not being watched; the Kleaves were anything but stupid. Still, there was a new sense that he was more in control of his own destiny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging from the ceiling were strong metal beams, which by the looks of them were easily strong enough to support the weight of a full-grown Sky-Swallower. Blaze peered down one of the side passages, leading to latrine. Having a real bathroom with even a modest amount of privacy was a real improvement than shitting into a sand-pit, and decided to take the time to relieve himself. The large pool, though, looked very inviting. Briefly, he fantasized about jumping in with one of the females, while fucking her all the while. The slight, lingering scent of females suggested that for Lord Azimoth, this had not been but an idle fantasy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t something that he could afford to fantasize about. Yet the most distinguishing feature of the former harem was the lack of walls. There would be nothing to separate from himself and the others, in particular Flamer-2, which nobody wanted to be close to even with a moistened 15 foot long pole. They would have to share the chamber, and while he didn't expect too much trouble from Flamer-6 or 8 Flamer-2 was a different story. He needed a good spot where he could draw the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed to one of the corners. It was a raised outcropping of rock that gave him a clear view of the chamber, with relatively close access to the latrine chamber. One of the most deeply ingrained instincts for dragon-kind when searching for territory was to seize the high ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Flamer-8 entered the chamber, and like Blaze was at first taken aback by the size of the former harem chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I claim this spot!!\" Blaze declared, his body crouched down to defend all comers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 gave Blaze a strange look, but he quickly realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026whatever,\u201d he stated. He shifted his gaze toward a similar raised outcropping toward Blaze\u2019s right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get this corner then,\u201d he stated, eyes narrowing. \u201cSo long as you don\u2019t try and get into my space, we won\u2019t have any problems right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Flamer-2 burst into the chamber, smoke billowing from his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll this side is mine!!\u201d roared Flamer-2. Blaze puffed disdainfully. It was very like Flamer-2 to immediately take the rest of the territory for himself. Yet Blaze wasn\u2019t willing to fight Flamer-2 for it; he was the physically strongest after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Flamer-6 limped into the chamber. He gazed toward each of the drakes, yet Blaze could tell there were plans going through his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026get this spot then\u2026\u201d he stated. Flamer-6 made his way toward a depression in the \u2018no mans land\u2019 between Blaze and Flamer-8. Blaze was puzzled. This was not a very advantageous spot, from the look of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!! I still got the most territory out of all of you combined!!\u201d boasted Flamer-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet also the least defensible\u2026\u201d commented Flamer-6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 tensed, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing,\u201d answered Flamer-6, curving his head away submissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big drake snorted and puffed out his chest, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought cripple\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Blaze sensed that Flamer-6 had some sort of plan in mind; one that would make up for his physical handicap. Blaze could freely admit that out of all the drakes, Flamer-6 was the most intelligent among them, and now he was in an environment where he could make use of it. Blaze took another look at the spot Flamer-6 had situated himself in. Flamer-6 must have anticipated that he and Flamer-8 would array themselves in such a manner that would best be able to counter Flamer-2, and that Flamer-6 placed himself in between to be an arbiter between the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, the door opened again, revealing a huge cage filled with trolls. They looked understandably frightened, gazing up at the drakes with watery eyes. The grate opened and they wandered out dazedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrolls?\u201d growled Flamer-8 with disdain, \u201cWhy will there be trolls in our chamber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf grunted, \u201cThey\u2019re here to pick up after you. In fact, you may do what you wish with these slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess its unavoidable then\u2026\u201d snapped Blaze. He curved toward the trolls. \u201cYou can pass through my territory but I don\u2019t want you sleeping in my spot. If any of you defecate in my territory you\u2019ll pay for it got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all look so tasty\u2026\u201d snarled Flamer-2, his teeth showing. Blaze immediately expected Wolf to reach for the shocker, but instead, answered casually, \u201cYou are allowed to eat them for sustenance if you so wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bestial glint emerged in Flamer-2\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat immediately sent forth a burst of panic through the troll slaves, scattering in all directions. Flamer-2 reached forth and snatched one of them with his jaw, snapping it shut and chomping down with relish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!! Get in my belly!!\u201d he bellowed through bloody teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors!! Y-you fucking savage!!\u201d growled Blaze, both outraged and horrified. In New Alveri, eating a humanoid was a crime that resulted in centuries-long dungeon sentences at the very least and oftentimes death, not to mention a taboo amongst all civilized dragons. The thought of eating a humanoid, even trolls who had once rebelled against the dragons, was utterly abhorrent to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 looked similarly horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay Gyramond save his poor soul\u2026\u201d he muttered under his breath. Blaze wasn\u2019t sure whether Flamer-8 was talking about the poor consumed troll, or Flamer-2. Blaze and Flamer-8\u2019s gaze met and they gave each other a mutual nod. No matter what happened, Flamer-2 could not be allowed to become the breeder male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Blaze had the horrible sneaking feeling that sooner or later, a troll may one day be filling his belly. When put in that sense, perhaps the change of venue wasn\u2019t that much better at all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was especially watchful that first night for an attack by Flamer-2.  However the muscular fire-drake's bloodlust seemed satisfied - for the moment at least - by the killing of the first troll slave.  Flamer-2 was content to wander about his half of the former harem, pacing up and down the uneven ridges and curves of the natural stone.  He pissed on every prominance like a dog, his acidic reek filling the large vault and threatening to overwhelm the other subtler scents.  Blaze grimaced at the base activity - in New Alveri, dragons had learned to carve glyphs into their property and no longer used crude scent marks - however, Flamer-8 soon crawled down from his ledge and scribed his scent mark at the base.  Flamer-6 followed suit.  With a sigh of disgust, Blaze realized that his claim was in danger if not thoroughly marked as well.  Gripping the stone with his paws, he creapt down and made his liquid mark.  Flamer-2 looked on smugly and seemed to relish in the fact that this debasement hurt Blaze.  It only took about about five hours for Blaze's nose to adjust to the melange of combating smells in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other occupants in the large chamber either huddled down naked, or nearly so, in the flat tiled center of the room - which by fast instinctive consensus was now common ground - or else had crawled into the cracks in the other three dragons' small territories.  They shivered and stunk so Blaze did not want them on his ledge.  When one came crawling up, he poked it gently in the chest with the tip of his tail.  The troll got the message, although Blaze allowed the trolls free passage through the rocks at the base of his prominence.  Honestly, though, Blaze was not even certain why the trolls were here.  He'd gotten along just fine so far with no slaves, either here in captivity or back at the orphanage.  Indeed, there seemed little use for the creatures except for the one which Flamer-2 had already exercised, much to Blaze's horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 was largely indifferent to the trolls as well, though he let them up on his smaller and more uneven ledge.  However, Flamer-6 who had situated himself on the low ground between Blaze and Flamer-8 actually went out of his way to develop rapport with the poor wretches.  Blaze figured that Flamer-6 recognized his own weakness and was trying to foment strength whereever he could.  The young drake sniffed in mild pity both for the trolls and for Flamer-6.  Some of the symptoms which had been getting better with treatment came back with a relish for the maimed fire-drake.  When he moved, it was with a palsy and he had developed a stutter now as well.  At some point in time, he'd seemed to have another stroke for his left wing was always hanging a little open now and his limp was worse.  Blaze gritted his teeth every time he examined him like this.  The Kleaves had done this to him.  It could have just as easily been Blaze himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down there, chatting with four trolls in a language that Blaze did not understand.  Blaze realized that he still knew next to nothing about Flamer-6's background.  The trolls laughed then, holding their bellies.  A couple looked up from the \"safe\" ground in the center of the room and wandered over, expanding Flamer-6's crowd.  He worked fast, Blaze had to give him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the room, Flamer-2 sprawled, seeming to try to take up as much space as possible.  He'd taken all of the remaining space beyond Blaze and Flamer-8 mounts as his own, but there was nothing much in the way steep defensible ledges in his area.  He probably assumed he'd be the one attacking rather than attacked.  He'd probably be right.  The trolls kept well away from him, that is, until Wolf came back that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore in the cages, Wolf and his team of dwarf butchers had divvied up each allotment of food to each dragon.  Now, however, he rode in on a mule driven cart with just one assistant.  Using some sort of magical motor, the cart's bed tilted and dumped a pile of fish onto the floor.  The trolls there scattered and Flamer-2 immediately began snaking his way towards the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf, obnoxious as ever, rang a cow bell before turning his cart about.  \"Come and get it!\"  he shouted and then turned the cart down the straight tile path which led through Flamer-2's side of the room to the big iron door.  All of the dragons were moving before it clanged shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 was the closest, but Blaze and Flamer-8 approached him from the high ground and on opposite flanks.  He growled and showed fangs as long as a troll's forearm, eyeing them both. \"I-\" he started, but Blaze interupted with a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire drake puffed out his chest, a feeling of power coursing through his body and said.  \"You'll not claim anything, Flamer-2!  This is all our food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 sneered.  \"It's in my territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 opened his fanged mouth and snapped rudely in Flamer-2's direction.  \"This is common ground!  We agreed earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care...\"  growled the muscular drake menacingly.  He hissed.  \"It's all mine, so go back to your rocks, fags or get in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chose the later of the two.  He glanced aside at Flamer-8 and the older drake nodded slightly.  They were agreed... for just the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 snarled and snapped, and lifted his tail aggressively as the other two walked towards him on opposite sides.  <i>\"The dragon must be mad!\"</i>  thought Blaze.  <i>\"We're giving all the signals and he's still not backing down!  Does he really think he can take us both?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he did and needed to be taught a lesson.  With another glance at Flamer-8, they attacked.  Blaze when high, Flamer-8 low.  Blaze half expected to topple the dragon, but his new weight in muscle kept him grounded.  Blaze tackled Flamer-2 at his shoulder, his heavy claws banging against the surface of the dragon's armor.  Blaze didn't even try to break through, but he knew from scuffling that bruises under the scales hurt nonetheless.  Flamer-2 would have retaliated with a bite, but Flamer-8 threatened him from below with his own jaws.  Flamer-8 made to bite Flamer-2's leg, but the heavier drake whipped his tail around and gave the older one a good bash right on his shoulders.  Blaze made good use of the opening and bit down on Flamer-2's exposed haunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon yowled and elbowed Blaze in the jaw.  Blaze hissed and let go before he could recieve another blow.  Surprisingly, it didn't hurt as much as he thought it would have.  Flamer-2 retreated, threatening with jaws and tail, but it was already over, the two dragons backed away slowly to where the fish was.  Flamer-2's eyes swivled madly between the two of them.  Obviously he had expected them to follow when he backed away.  Now he realized his error.  He roared beastly at them, but neither he nor Flamer-8 paid him mind, though both kept an eye on him as he sulked in his rocky territory.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By old tradition, the fish pile now belonged evenly to Blaze and Flamer-8.  However, Blaze raised a paw as the older drake began to divide the pile with his tail.  Flamer-8 showed his teeth at him.  \"You too?  I'll teach you.  If you need teaching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shook his head. \"No.  I don't want to fight.  But we can't take all the fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?  We won it.\"  said the former feral drake.  Blaze supposed it was not uncommon to settle disputes like this out in rurals surrounding New Alveri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed, trying to find a way to explain this.  He turned an eye to Flamer-6 who had not moved during the whole affair.  Most of the trolls cowered behind his bulk.  \"If we take all the fish, it's going to be non-stop war between us.  We'll be doing this every meal... which is exactly what <i>they</i> want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 lowered his head in thought.  Blaze noted that the older drake had put on weight as well, showing in his shoulders and haunches; though his change in height was not nearly so dramatic as any of the other drake's.  when he lifted his eyes, they burned slightly.  \"Do we have to share with that animal?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out another sigh.  He pushed his head forward emphatically.  \"We have to.  Or else he's going to be even more vicious next time... and he'll probably kill more of the trolls as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just placating him...\"  said Flamer-8 with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" said Blaze more assuredly than he felt, \"We're just... working out a truce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 shook his head.  \"That's not the way he'll see it.  He'll think we're offering him tribute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snarled at the thought, but said.  \"There's no helping that.  But we're the ones with the opportunity to at least try not to live like animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 hissed and twisted his neck, agonizing over the decision.  It finally seemed that his old self won out in the end, for he spat, \"Fine!  We'll share... with everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Blaze and Flamer-8 took about 65% of the fish with three and a half tunnies for each of them.  Both of them remained overseeing the flat arena against Flamer-2 who continued to pace and eye them like a tiger in a pen.  Blaze invited Flamer-6 to eat.  \"Eat half and no more.\"  Blaze instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 limped up, walking as straight as he could over the uneven rocks.  He nosed his portion of fish, then glanced back to his hollow.  \"W-what about the t-t-trolls?\"  he asked eyes sharp despite the new stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 glared at him.  \"If you feel like sharing, go ahead.\"  Blaze did not contradict him.  So Flamer-6 ate right there, gulping down what the other two had left behind.  Blaze growled at the lame dragon when he approached his quota.  Flamer-6 scooped up the last three fish, some small saltwater bass only 2.5 feet in length, in his mouth.  surprisingly, he carried these back to his new friends and dropped them on the floor.  The trolls fell on the fish and released loud tribal howls of gratitude.  Blaze frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, Blaze and Flamer-8 climbed up to their seats of power, both of their bellies full and visibly distended.  Their pact just now was at an end, the young drake knew.  but Blaze thought that Flamer-8 and he shared a lot of the same goals, one of which being to make sure that Flamer-2 was soon parted from his testicles and left the vicinity for good.  However, that did not make Flamer-8 his friend.  Only one drake was leaving here intact, that much was impossible to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 came to the center of the room as soon as it was apparent Blaze and Flamer-8 had left.  He greedily devoured the remains of the fish, even going so far as to lick some of the slime off of the tiles.  As predicted, he showed no signs of gratitude, but rather exuded smugness that they'd left him something at all.  He eyed the trolls sitting around Flamer-6 hungrily like an animal.  However, he had the sense to see both Blaze and Flamer-8 sitting above him and so moved back out into his rocks.  Apparently even the mad dragon had had enough fighting for one evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze slept, but kept one eye open for danger.  It was an old dragon art and one that Blaze had never taken very seriously in his life.  However now, he saw its invaluableness.  Blaze doubted he'd be shutting both eyes again from now on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat!? No food!?\u201d screamed Blaze with outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrders came from higher ups Flamer-7,\u201d cried Wolf, \u201cIn fact, you\u2019re scheduled to take a trial right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ground his teeth. A couple of days before, he\u2019d been administered a new round of injections, leaving him with that horrendous, ravenous hunger. He was in no mood for a trial whatsoever. Yet he was disciplined enough to keep his cool and follow Wolf down the corridors. If Wolf didn\u2019t have food after completing the trial, then there\u2019d really be hell to pay\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was puzzled when Wolf was leading Blaze back to the old prison block. Blaze made his way inside, and a moment later he found himself in the center of the room, while Wolf and his handlers ascended from a protected viewing block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d he snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he spotted a group of trolls languishing within the prison blocks. Even considering the typically squalid condition of them, these looked in especially bad state. They groaned and trilled and hissed like rabid animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese trolls are all condemned to death for various misdemeanors. They\u2019re murderers, cannibals, rapists, thieves and outcasts even amongst their peers. Their only chance at freedom is if they kill you,\u201d explained Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dug his claws into the dirt. \u201cSo, its either I kill them or they kill me is that it? You\u2019re testing me to see how well you can fight\u2026\u201d he growled. Wolf nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was both anxious and excited. Excited, because he\u2019d finally be able to put his body to use, but also worried because of his lack of actual experience. Back at the orphanage, Darzhja would force Blaze to be her sparring partner at Markus\u2019 fighting ring if there was nobody else available at the moment. He\u2019d lost every single time against her, and rather badly at that, but he had memorized a few basic moves. Hopefully, those would do him good here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the opponents he faced weren\u2019t exactly what you would call formidable. There was a group of about ten half-naked, emaciated trolls surrounding him, armed with rather crude stone axes. Yet there was a bestial desperation in their eyes, mixed in with their obvious fear and dismay. He wouldn\u2019t take any pleasure in killing them, but it was one of those things he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but you better give me some food afterwards you hear!!\u201d snapped Blaze. His gnawing hunger really put him in the mood for killing. Wolf let out a barely suppressed chortle through the voice amplifier. Blaze then shifted his gaze back toward the trolls, not able to help but note how tasty they looked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s eyes suddenly went wide with horror. The trolls\u2026 were to be his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026so now you understand what\u2019s going on now eh?\u201d grunted Wolf with a cruel chuckle. \u201cThe higher ups have started to get worried that you might be getting a little squeamish. You don\u2019t have to eat them if you don\u2019t want to, but unless you prefer to starve that\u2019s all the food you\u2019re getting for the next week!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ground his teeth together. This wasn\u2019t a test purely to see how well he could fight, but also a test of his ruthlessness; in order to turn him a little bit more into Flamer-2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no more time to think though, as the prison door sprung open with a squeak. All ten of the trolls instantly charged at Blaze with a blind, desperate rage, axes raised over their head. Their desperate ferocity caught Blaze aback for a brief moment, and it sank in that these trolls truly did mean to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstincts kicked in. Eyes narrowed, Blaze reared back and threw his neck forward and let loose a powerful beam of fire. The unfortunate trolls in the center of the blast were instantly vaporized into charred, blackened husks. A couple others that had been on the outskirts of the flaming breath screamed and howled and writhed about as their bodies caught fire before mercifully falling still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left only three trolls left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the trolls that managed to avoid the fire blast was now within range with his axe. Even though a blow with a crude stone axe would have been pathetically futile, Blaze wasn\u2019t going to let his scales be touched if he could help it. Not by these troll scum. He swiped at the troll with his claw, and sent the troll\u2019s corpse flying across the arena and smearing against the wall of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snapped his gaze toward another troll, and it quavered under his gaze. His predatory instinct kicked in as his gaze focused on the troll prey. The humanoids often spoke of an innate draconic ability known as \u2018Dragonfear\u2019, which would render a foe into a state of panic. The dragon would emit brain waves to paralyze the nervous system of its intended prey, and this applied to the unfortunate troll victim here. Blaze leapt forward and bludgeoned its body with its tail, feeling its bones break from the blow and its skull cracking open as it hit head first against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne left\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last troll, panic seizing it, threw down its axe and tried to make a run for it. Unfortunately, there was nowhere for the troll to run. Blaze quickly caught up to the troll, and as his shadow loomed over the troll, it stared at him with fearful eyes and uttered a pitiful whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026no want to die\u2026\u201d it uttered in broken basic tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitiful response actually angered Blaze. It should have already known what type of place this was, and that it could be stupid enough to think that he\u2019d get away with it. In fact, he may well be condemning his fellows by this act of fecklessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I\u2026\u201d snapped Blaze. With that, Blaze crushed the troll under his claw with a roar, gritting his teeth. His forearm tensed as he pressed his weight down against the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then took a step back and let out a grunt, surveying the carnage around him. There was an astonishing amount of blood, not to mention the smell of burnt meat. It only just occurred to Blaze that he had killed sentient creatures for the first time in his life, even if they were condemned troll slaves. As for how he felt about having taken the lives of those trolls, he hadn\u2019t exactly felt especially proud of his grisly feat (and besides, killing trolls wasn\u2019t exactly a feat of prowess that a drake would brag to his peers about) but he wouldn\u2019t have lost sleep over that. Eating them on the other hand\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed down at the troll corpses. His mouth watered desperately. Oh Ancestors, why did he have to be forced into that sort of position? Perhaps he could just wait it out. Yet he could not make that assumption. If he starved for morality\u2019s sake, Flamer-2 would take advantage. No\u2026he had to survive, even if it meant eating trolls. Besides, they were criminals, murderers\u2026 Nobody would miss them. At least they\u2019d be put to good use by serving as sustenance. Or so Blaze told himself over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me Ancestors\u2026\u201d sighed Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped up the unburnt corpses and dragged them to the corner of the former prison block, where as little of him as possible would be seen conducting the grisly deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust put it in your mouth\u2026\u201d he whispered to himself. Shutting his eyes tight, he tossed the troll corpse into his mouth and began to chew. As the blood and guts sloshed in his jaw, he felt horrified that the taste was not bad at all. Despite all his misgivings, his hunger got the better of him and swallowed. Before the establishment of the knights, dragons eating humanoids was far from uncommon. Had they tasted awful, it wouldn\u2019t have been so widespread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating the second corpse was not nearly so hard as eating the first, and then Blaze scooped up the third, swallowing it right afterwards. He spat upon the ground, desperately trying to get the taste of troll off his tongue, yet it would not go away. Yet his stomach didn\u2019t protest the same way his mind did, as the consumed troll settled nicely in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a beast\u2026 I\u2019m not a beast\u2026\u201d Blaze whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze glared up at Wolf with hate-filled eyes.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026ever\u2026make me do that again\u2026\u201d he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the whole fuss is about. They were going to be dead anyhow nor are they little more than animals\u2026\u201d said Wolf casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you see it? When you put it that way, humanoids may well be little more than animals to us dragons. One day if you\u2019re unlucky, you might be the one who finds himself on the menu\u2026\u201d growled Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d snapped Wolf, hand upon the shocking amulet. Blaze didn\u2019t care if he did get shocked at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it. Trolls are on the lowest level of the humanoid chart. Once we get used to eating trolls, then it\u2019ll be orcs or hobbits. Who\u2019s to say that in order to make us more savage the elves will decide to use\u2026 I don\u2019t know, dwarves, or humans? You don\u2019t think someone like Flamer-2 wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf\u2019s face darkened and Blaze was answered with a sharp electric shock. His vision went white as Blaze let out a scream as he kicked and writhed upon the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shut that big mouth of yours this instant you understand Flamer-7? Be lucky that you\u2019re getting off easy!!\u201d screamed Wolf. Yet he no longer had that look of relish on his face, but one of uneasiness. Blaze had gotten his point through, which was all that mattered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze returned to the communal lair feeling numb. He\u2019d just eaten trolls. Sentient beings. The fact tormented him to no end, and the scene replayed in his mind again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019d your trial go?\u201d asked Flamer-8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not think about it right now\u2026\u201d he sighed, as he retreated to his ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 sniffed the air, and then grinned at Blaze's low spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell troll on your breath. They sure taste so good don't they?\" he taunted. Flamer-8\u2019s eyes widened with shock, and all Blaze could do was keep his head down and stew in his guilt as Flamer-2 lounged against the rocks and burst out in malicious laughter. His gaze flashed toward the trolls seeking shelter with a slumbering Flamer-6. They were murmuring and laughing with one another, like regular humanoids rather than slaves, and Blaze felt even guiltier than he did before. Thankfully, they were ignorant of draconic, so they didn\u2019t know of Blaze\u2019s grisly deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it Flamer-7,\u201d said Flamer-8, \u201cYou did what you had to do. If anyone\u2019s to blame it\u2019s the Kleaves\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d nodded Blaze. That argument felt hollow though. Though he\u2019d been starving, it had still been his conscious decision to eat the trolls. The Ancestors would definitely not look favorably on that. Their taste was still in his mouth while crusted blood still lingered on his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026need to go use the wash myself off now,\u201d stammered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean go and jack off?\u201d Flamer-2 chortled, \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you get all emotional like that. Don\u2019t deny it Flamer-7.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze eyes narrowed. When they weren\u2019t being put through trials, physical labor or exercises, it was those unspoken things that the drakes did from time to time to stave off their extreme boredom, and as usual, only Flamer-2 was the one who was an asshole about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m going to take a bath, not that you\u2019ve ever heard of concept before\u201d he snarled, before stalking off. There was a half-truth to that, as during the past few weeks they\u2019d shared the chamber now, he didn\u2019t remember Flamer-2 ever using the washing room once. The only good thing about it was that Blaze didn\u2019t have to worry about sharing the washing room with Flamer-2, so the he and Flamers 6 and 8 had been able to designate a schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived, he took a moment to pray to the Ancestor for forgiveness for his transgressions. He\u2019d never been particularly pious before, yet in a place such as this the Ancestors gave him solace. Hopefully, when, or rather, if he ever got out of here with his balls intact, he\u2019d get the chance to redeem himself of his sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed a slight plumb of fire onto the bathing pool, satisfied when it began to steam merrily. Sighing, he stepped inside and began to furiously scrub himself. Of course, one never got truly clean as the plumbing and filtration wasn\u2019t exactly up to New Alverian standards, but it was better than nothing. Besides, it was one of the few places where he could have the luxury to think idly to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about roughly half a year since the day of the attack on New Alveri. Half a year since the Kleaves had captured him. He thought about all of his friends back at the orphanage; Darzhja, Iskierka and Ophelia. Of course, this was assuming that Iskierka had survived after being crushed by the roof of the artist guild. Yet if she had, her fate was still far better than what Blaze had gone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to that day, he remembered that Darzhja was about to leave the orphanage for good and that she had gone off to challenge Kaj to a fight before going to the Temple to become a Knight for real. Darzhja was an extremely stubborn and determined individual; Blaze wouldn\u2019t have been surprised at all that she was a Knight by now. He wondered if she and everyone else all still were hoping to find him or that they had given him up for dead. Of course, if Blaze ever did reunite with his old friends, considering what he may well have become they may have very well wished that he had died during the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out a sigh. The mischievous, goody-two shoes Blaze they had known was no more, burned away by the cruelty, torture and hardship of the Kleaves. He wondered whether if he\u2019d even have a place within the civilized society of New Alveri anymore, and if he didn\u2019t, what he\u2019d do with his life. Again, he still had to survive to reach that point, so he\u2019d deal with that when the time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he once again thought back on his voyage to the island of the Kleaves, he also reminisced about his ship-borne companion Jinx. If he was still alive, the small but cunning barbarian must have been somewhere on this very same island within a communal lair very much like his own. Yet even on those horrid days in the ship, there had not only raging, vengeful fire in his eyes, but a vengeance that knew exactly who he was to direct it against, along with each step in the plan along the way. Blaze didn\u2019t have any doubts that he\u2019d become the breeder male of his species, nor that Jinx would ever get turned by the Kleaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My name, is Jinxieregoth of the Colshek Clan!! And I will have MY REVENGE!!</i> he pictured the nomad bellow with his trilling accent. The thought of a dragon that small having so much raging vengeance was oddly amusing, and he couldn\u2019t help but cough out a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the water was starting to cool down a bit. He decided he\u2019d spent enough time in the bathing pool, so he stepped out and shook himself dry. Right then, as he exited, there was a flurry of commotion out in the communal lair. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was still dripping when he emerged from the pool and walked around to one of the two opposing exits at opposite sides of the bath. When he came out from around the wall, it was to a scene of carnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the center of the room. Flamer-2 had a troll in his jaws; it hung limply, like a rag doll as the big dragon tossed his head to and fro.  Even as Blaze watched, Flamer-2's eyes seemed to glow with relish as he used his tail to fling a frail troll body to break against the stone outcropping surrounding the round tiled center of the room.  Flamer-2's ire seemed spent then, however a third troll appeared from the stones surrounding the flattened area.  As it stood, Blaze heard a dragon's voice call out,  \"V-vol'shik, No!\"  Blaze's eyes widened a little as the troll brazenly threw a bit of sharpened stone down on onto the dragon in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharpened stone throwing axe hit Flamer-2 about half a foot above his left eye.  Any lower and he might have been permanently blinded in that eye.  The fire-drake growled viciously and chomped down on the troll he had in his jaws.  The blue skinned body split in two, blood pouring out of the drake's mouth and entrails dangling from his fangs.  Flamer-2 did not bother making an aggressive display he simply turned and began flowing over the tiles towards the troll, who was already lining up a final shot with another axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned and prepared his soul for the sight of another sentient creature being brutally cut down by overwhelming force.  <i>\"Why do they have to be so small and frail?\"</i>  Blaze lamented.  However, before Flamer-2 could get his claws to bear on the offending troll, something big and heavy slammed into Flamer-2's haunches, even as he was rearing up on the raise stone surrounding the arena.  It was Flamer-6!  And the lame dragon was incensed.  Blaze began to run forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 collapsed with a roar and Flamer-6 was on him, but the dragon under him was bigger and heavier and had a brutal strength.  His initial advantage did not last long as Flamer-2 bucked and threw the crippled drake off of him.  Flamer-6 recovered slightly in midair using his wings... but his left did not open up quite enough to entirely prevent a fall.  He wasted several more moments struggling to his feet and Flamer-2 thrashed around recovering from the initial surprise attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw who it was who had assaulted him, Flamer-2 sneered, blood and guts still hanging from his teeth like an animal.  He stepped deliberately on half a troll, smashing it under his scaled paw as he sauntered forward.  \"Looks like the cripple has come to be taught a lesson...\" he drawled.  As Flamer-6 got up, Blaze could see the weakness and unsteadiness in his left side.  Flamer-2 continued.  \"But why?  For these animals?\"  the brute tossed his muscular neck towards the blue skinned humanoid who was even then racing around the wide arena, trying to get in position for another futile strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 growled.  \"Y-you're the only animal around h-here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 didn't respond.  He just rushed forward, going directly for Flamer-6's left side.  However the lame drake seemed to anticipate this.  He feinted and moved out of the way just in time.  His outstretched wing revealed a stone wall where the tile ended.  Flamer-2 drove into it like a runaway locomotive.  He hit it so hard that his horns became lodged in the stone.  He grunted and pulled, stone cracking and crumbling where he set his terrible strength to work.  He wouldn't remain trapped long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Blaze had reached the arena.  He stood with his front paws braced on the stone overlooking where the floor was flat and tiled.  He wasn't sure if he should intervene.  He wasn't the police here.  Looking above, Blaze saw Flamer-8 looking down on the conflict with a mild grin.  Obviously this was little more than entertainment for him.  And really, either way things went, one rival was simply weakening another.  Still, Blaze ground his teeth together.  This wasn't right matching a lame dragon against a bull like Flamer-2.  However things seemed to be going in the cripple's favor so far.  Blaze decided to wait to intervene.  Mildly he noted another bare skinned troll running along the raised perimeter of the center arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of making the most of the seconds that Flamer-2 was trapped, Flamer-6 surprised Blaze by speaking.  The young fire drake winced as the injured dragon seemed to egg Flamer-2 on still further. \"They've g-gotten to you, Flamer-2!  They've t-t-turned you into n-nothing more than a beast.  A raging d-d-dog of war!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 strained against the stone where his horns were lodged.  \"Shut up, you stuttering freak!\"  More stone crumbled around his head as his twisted and pulled his thick neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you even r-r-remember?\"  Do you st-st-\"  Flamer-6 started, but was interupted when Flamer-2 jerked his head free.  The bigger drake whipped his head around, snapping at Flamer-6's throat.  The lame drake's reaction speed left much to be desired.  Flamer-6 was soon overwhelmed by strength and sheer vigor.  The drake with the drooping left eye tried deflecting Flamer-2's snout with his tail at first, but then his attacker's own tail came to bear, striking Flamer-6's left foreleg.  What might have merely inconvenienced Blaze or Flamer-8 knocked Flamer-6 to the ground.  His foreleg seemed to tense up, going still and outstretched.  Blaze wondered if Flamer-2 had hit a fragile nerve or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 did not seem to be in a lot of pain but his foreleg was useless now.  He scrabbled across the ground pitifully, barely warding off lazy, but still overwhelming blows from Flamer-2's tail and claws.  Finally the big drake planted his heavy claws on Flamer-6's chest.  The lame drake hissed and flailed with his hind legs.  Flamer-2, grinning cruelly bashed Flamer-6 with his tail across the hips until the kicking stopped; he pressed down with more weight on the prone dragon's chest.  \"This'll teach you your place, you defect, you crippled freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 hissed in pain.  \"I f-f-f-feel s-s-sorry f-f-for y-you.\"  he stammered, his stuttering worse than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 bared his teeth and then slapped Flamer-6 across the face with his wing.  \"I told you to shut the hell up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, Blaze saw Flamer-2 rear his head up and convulse his chest, a sucking noise emerging from his throat as his flame ducts filled up his long neck.  The beast was about to break yet another taboo among fire-drakes, he was going to breathe fire on Flamer-6!  Blaze ran forward, knowing he would not get there in time, his claws scrabbling across the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to unleash his payload, however, several stone axes bashed into the dragon's face with surprising accuracy.  One of them clipped the side of his nostril, cutting through the skin and causing Flamer-2 to bleed.  Flamer-2 choked on the liquid fire in his throat;  When the fire ducts were full, they swelled and briefly closed off the trachea, normally it didn't matter.  However, the strike had been timed just perfectly and Flamer-2 couldn't breathe, even as his eyes darted, looking for new targets.  He quickly found the two trolls.  With bloodshot eyes and a grimacing expression, Flamer-2 redirected his fire and coated the area with burning liquid flame which spewed from his mouth and caught fire in the air.  Needless to say, the trolls were reduced to cinders for their insolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 cried out as if he had lost a dear friend;  Blaze supposed that he had.  Before Flamer-2 could do anymore damage, however, Blaze jumped onto his back.  His claws gripped the base of the dragon's wings and before Flamer-2 could turn, he had his jaws around the base of his neck.  He growled, pinching the dragon's spine with his large fangs.  Blaze eyed Flamer-6 who rose unsteadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing left to protect, Flamer-6 hobbled off.  Slowly he seemed to regain the use of his left foreleg.  He allowed trolls to crawl all over him when he returned to his little hollow.  Flamer-2 was carefully still under Blaze.  \"Well, well.  The Smart-ass has come for his lesson now eh?\"  asked Flamer-2 even as he continued to bleed from the torn nostril.  It was a rather big cut actually, he was going to have that cleft there for the rest of his life; barring magical intervention of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an answer, Blaze bit down some more on the dragon's neck.  He could actually feel one of the implants between his teeth.  However, there was so much muscle here that Blaze doubted he could actually bite through.  The young drake considered.  How the hell was he going to get out of this one?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze knew he had to change his tactics if he wanted to live through this. At that moment he thought back to the orphanage, thought back to one of Lady Ramoth's little chats with Darhjza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, while walking through the hallways of the rundown building, heard the voice of their caretaker in a nearby room. Curious, he quietly went up to the crack in the door and peeked through. He saw Ramoth pacing about and Darzhja in the middle of one of her elder\u2019s strives. Darzhja had a pair of swords lodged in her chest, one on her forearm, another in her claw and she had cuts and slices all over her front. She showed Blaze a big smile on her face when she saw him spying on the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean what is it with you Darzhja?\" Ramoth had asked that day. \u201cYou\u2019re not only too reckless, you could have been killed!! What would\u2019ve happen if one of these things hit your hearts?\u201d Ramoth continued as Blaze heard the sounds of metal hitting a stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Lady Ramoth\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope! I\u2019m not hearing another excuse!\u201d Ramoth interrupted.  \u201cDarzhja\u2026 You\u2019re going to be the death of me one day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Blaze heard Darzhja reply stubbornly. Lady Ramoth sighed. \u201cLook Darzhja. Not all battles can be won with tooth and claw. Not anymore.\u201d In these times, words can be just as painful. Sometimes even more-so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Darzhja asked. Ramoth sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, listen to me well. What a single word can do is very little\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee. Then why talk?\u201d Darhjza interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarhjza!\u201d Ramoth growled scaring even Blaze a little. \u201cWhat a single word can do is very little or quite massive. A single word is capable of either putting a smile on someone's face, or when used in the right context, a single word can even topple Empires\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly realizing where he was, Blaze came to and let go of Flamer-2\u2019s neck. Blaze was quickly flung off but landed safely on his feet. If he was going to end this fight with Flamer-2, he\u2019d have to use more than brute force against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right then. You want a fight!! I\u2019ll give you a fight!! Come on you idiot.\u201d Blaze shouted to get Flamer-2\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 let out a roar and charged forward. Blaze was ready for it though and dodged to the side at the last possible moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?! I thought you were better than that!!\u201d Blaze taunted. Of course, in his right mind, provoking Flamer-2 into further rage wasn\u2019t exactly the smartest idea, but remembering the words exchanged during his fight with Flamer-6, Blaze had an inkling that this was the only way to get past Flamer-2's thick-headed mental guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you care about what happens to that cripple? It didn\u2019t involve you\u2026\u201d Flamer-2 spat out as he recovered and turned to face Blaze again. The two started circling each other, Flamer-2 thumped the tile floor with his tail and snorted smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Blaze took the initiative and rushed forward. However, instead of dodging, Flamer-2 deflected his claw with his tail with surprising agility, while all in one motion delivered a punishing counterblow across his flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze staggered back a ways, biting back the pain. There would definitely be a bruise, but he was far from being done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with that!! The fact of the matter is that nobody here likes you. All you ever do is piss everyone off and make life in this shitty hellhole even shittier!!\u201d Blaze decried, shaking out his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph!! All you ever do is piss me off with your fancy words and your whining. If anyone here needs to be knocked down a peg it's you!!\u201d Roared Flamer-2.  Blaze was surprised when he didn't come charging, but it seemed that the bigger dragon was waiting to perform another counter-attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying fancy words huh? That\u2019s the problem with you. You never think beyond your own personal satisfaction. Or it because you just don\u2019t want to think about things and that you\u2019re fine with being the Kleave\u2019s dog?\u201d Blaze asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Flamer-2 roared back. The two continued to tussle. Despite Flamer-2\u2019s obvious strength advantage, Blaze was able to hold his own by striking quickly before Flamer-2 could deliver one of his powerful counterblows. Yet though he landed more blows upon Flamer-2, the ones that Flamer-2 landed hurt far more. After a while of jostling, the two were left with a series of bruises, showing maroon under their red scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-2\u2026 Didn\u2019t you once have a home? A family? A real name?\u201d Flamer-8 crept closer to the edge of his ledge and even Flamer-6 lifted his head from his recuperation at Blaze for asking such a question. Flamer-2 frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m dumb enough to fall for that trick again?! I\u2019m not gonna shock myself like that.\" said Flamer-2, referring to the inhibitor collar around his neck,  \"Besides, you\u2019re a fool if you think the past mean anything here!! In here, there\u2019s only winners and losers. Flamer-6\u2026he\u2019s a loser. The weak die and the strong survive!! You\u2019re a little prick that needs to be put in his place!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 roared as he lurched forward toward Blaze. However, right before he was going to strike, he quickly changed direction to swing at Blaze's legs. Blaze stumbled over and fell. Lashing out, he was able to swung out with his tail to ward off the larger dragon long enough for him to roll back on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you think its all about? If you win this fight, what will you have gained? Nothing!! The reality is that all of us are the losers, no matter which one of us wins this little fight we\u2019re having and who ends up becoming the breeder male. Ultimately we\u2019ll still be puppets of the Kleaves no matter what. In fact, they\u2019re probably watching our little pointless fight right now and laughing at what losers we are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only for a second. Just for a second Flamer-2 stopped and seemed to hesitate. In fact, he actually turned toward the small glass-viewing window located near the top of the chamber. Indeed, both Dr. Moridin and Fang were watching with keen interest, and the sight of those two was enough to defuse all the rage Blaze had felt previously. Dr. Moridin looking very unhappy and Fang still had that same intrigued expression from the first time the two met. The Doctor then turned and stormed off, obviously mad about something, while Fang on the other hand merely gave a slight grin before following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 retreated, \u201cFuck you Flamer-7. Fuck you to the powers below.\u201d It must have really rankled the big fire drake to realize that he found himself agreeing with Blaze\u2019s point. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll pay for being a smart-ass. When we fight next time, it\u2019ll be on our terms. I also expect it will be rather soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze nodded. That was the first and probably the last time he\u2019d ever agree with Flamer-2. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s laughing in the end\u2026\u201d grunted Flamer-2 before retreating back toward his territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out a sigh of relief. He didn\u2019t know how he was able to pull himself out of this one. Flamer-8 also shook his head in exasperated disbelief, while Blaze shrugged in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the Doctor is mad then I did good\u2026 I think.\u201d he thought as he perched himself back upon his ledge and laid down. Furthermore, he\u2019d gotten Flamer-2 to back off, and for the first time, seemed to be in deep contemplation, However, Blaze expected that all he\u2019d really done was make Flamer-2 hate him more than he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you where right Lady Ramoth.\u201d Blaze thought. However, Lady Ramoth had likely never been to a cruel place like the island of the Kleaves, where using ones words alone was not enough\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze looked down from his ledge the day following the incident with Flamer-2 and Flamer-6.  Blaze kept imagining pain in his ribs where Flamer-2 had bashed him good.  He had to imagine it because it wasn't there, the pain at least.  The absence was especially odd because Blaze could tell that he had indeed several bruised ribs; all he had to do was press down on them with a claw and the tenderness would return.  However the pain never lingered and soon faded.  What might have been taken as a blessing, instead Blaze chose to view as evidence of yet more tampering by the mad scientist of the Kleaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was wondering how easy it might be to injure himself in the future if his sense of pain was dulled when he gave a ragged sigh.  The restlessness - by now familiar - was reawakening in his muscles.  After several weeks of this, Blaze had adjusted to the fact that his body never seemed to rest, but it ingrained in him an almost constant weariness along with a contradictory impulse to move.  Blaze stood so he would not have to feel his muscles twitch by themselves where he rested; he had enough of that all night long, every night.  He did some push-ups to help relieve the impulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had grown remarkably in the last weeks and put on a dozen stone in muscle around his chest, shoulders and haunches.  If the growth continued, he would break his second ton in another couple months.  His legs, wings and tail were all much longer than he was familiar with and Blaze had developed a slight clumsiness that seemed to increase the more he grew.  The drake lamented the fact that, just looking at him now, most dragons would probably mistake him for a young adult rather than the adolescent that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the change itself was remarkable, locked in a room with three other dragons who were going through the same experience, the experience was robbed of even its uniqueness.  Blaze extended his wings and mock-flapped them slowly, stretching the muscles to work the spasming out of them.  Over on his ledge, the young drake saw Flamer-8 rise and begin some calisthenics as well.  The older drake seemed more proficient and controlled with his movements, as if he were working through a familiar routine.  Blaze didn't bother asking him about it.  The stirring which infected them all was a problem which each dragon seemed to be solving in their own fashion.  Blaze liked stretching, for instance while apparently Flamer-2 liked carrying and breaking rocks.  The sad part was that Blaze still did not enjoy the exercise, he did it only out of a need to avoid the disconcertion of muscles spasming randomly across his body when he sat still.  Although...  when Blaze looked at the sleek new muscle lining his formerly scrawny frame, he could not argue that it was an improvement in masculine aestheticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking below, Blaze saw that Flamer-6 was busy as well, however, he did not appear to be excercising so much as <i>building</i> something.  His trolls - and indeed, all of the remaining trolls had formed something of a tribe around the lame dragon - had scavenged the vault for bits and pieces of metal, wood and stone.  Raw resources were rare in the stone cave, but the trolls seemed to be remarkably resourceful.  Blaze detected the presence of fish spines which the trolls seemed to be using as makeshift lashings for delicate parts of the apparatus; Flamer-6 himself welded together many of the stronger metal parts.  Blaze shook his head and snorted.  He had no idea what Flamer-6 was up to, but all it would take was one tail slam from Flamer-2 to wreck what the dragon had been laboring on for days now.  Blaze hoped he would not be too disappointed when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came in the morning on the second day after Blaze's fight with Flamer-2.  Wolf strode in, leading a party of elves which included the dread Dr. Moridin himself.  His eyes immediately caught onto a pair of green eyes in a young face which met his directly.  Fang winked at him.  Blaze frowned and pawed the edge of his platform cautiously, for some reason, he thought he felt a small burning sensation at the place on his back from which Fang had removed his ingrown scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf stepped forward and spoke into a copper cone which greatly amplified his voice.  He pointed right up at Blaze.  \"You!  get down here.\"  Blaze had no choice but to obey the summons.  Before he even alighted on the wide tiled circle, Wolf turned and searched the room.  \"You too!  Get over here.\"  To Blaze's chagrin, Wolf had selected Flamer-2.  He smuggled slinked across the stones, taking his time to approach.  Blaze immediately heard elvish whispers concerning the breadth of Flamer-2's shoulders and the deepness of his chest.  He had to stifle a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf set his loudspeaker aside when both dragons were present.  \"You two have been selected for a new trial.  We're going outside so you better be on your best behavior if you want to keep your balls and necks intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the elves snickered and Blaze could tell that Wolf had meant to sound threatening, however, all the young drake felt was elation.  <i>We're going... outside?!</i>  It seemed too good to be true.  Blaze hadn't been outside in months, not counting the time he'd spent exercising and being tested in the vast dome in the caldera of the volcano.  As the party turned to depart through the grand iron door, Flamer-2 rudely shoved Blaze aside without a word, leaving him to bring up the rear of the procession... but not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately outside the door, both dragons were ambushed by four more drakes who took positions on either side of them.  Flamer-2 hissed threateningly for space, and his two partners obliged.  That washed over Blaze however, for he recognized one of the new dragons.  It was Flamer-1!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-1 walked on Blaze's right side, his eyes as dour and uninterested as ever.  He hulked alongside Blaze, even more muscular and large now than Flamer-2, however, his flame sacs also appeared much diminished.  What tortures had he endured since he'd been kicked from the breeding program?  He had more of the stocky build of a mountain drake than the slim specialized lankiness of a fire-drake now, though his face was still the same as were the dull red scales that covered his body.  One thing was sure, however, as Blaze gave the bigger dragon a few cursory sniffs, his scent had markedly changed.  He was a drake no longer, he was a eunuch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn't have to peer down at the dragon's crotch to note the change - besides, there was little exposed of the male genitalia unless aroused - the drake's smell was no longer that of a male; it was watered down to inoffensive levels, and yet also not female.  The not-quite-either smell disturbed Blaze still despite having met eunuchs down in the mines previously.  \"Flamer-1?\"  tried Blaze as the elves and dragons made their way to the main concourse and began to walk down the levels.  Blaze had to repeat himself before the dragon would answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former fire-drake swiveled an eye to look down at Blaze.  \"I don't go by that anymore.\" he said in a gravely voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, who was still amazed to see the dragon alive, had little patience for semantics.  \"Well, what's your name now, then?\"  he asked briskly, tossing his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon grunted as he moved his thickly muscled legs and as usual, he took his time in answering.  When he finally deigned to speak, he spoke with an expression that seemed to hurt even the big dragon,  \"I'm now called... Chimera-8.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmmm....\" sighed Blaze, \"But you'll always be Flamer-1 to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe intended it as encouragement, yet the big dragon formerly known as Flamer-1 only sighed, \"Call me whatever you want. It really doesn't matter at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze switched his gaze to the other neutered drake. He was of similar size to Flamer-1, except he was a silver drake. Like Flamer-1, he had a disinterested, depressed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get your name?\" asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chimera-12...\" he uttered blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" answered Blaze. It was utterly depressing being around those two, and made Blaze more determined than ever to avoid their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elf ventured onto the ledge. He was clad in a thick leather outfit, and more prominently, he wore a pair of clear goggles over his eyes. In his hand, he wielded a short leather whip, which at the end of it held a small steel ball. Alongside the elf, a team of human laborers dragged forth a large leather saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf gave one look at Blaze and sneered, \u201cTypical that I get the weaker one\u2026\u201d He said it as if Blaze couldn\u2019t hear and that he was nothing but a beast. Flamer-2 also heard the insult from the opposite side of the ledge and gave Blaze a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I take it that you\u2019re going to be riding me?\u201d snapped Blaze, with equal disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so. I am Melchoir. Now then, you will obey my every command without question. Consider it a privilege that you get a worthy individual such as myself as your test rider.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze narrowed his eyes. Apparently, this individual was one of the more run-of-the-mill arrogant elves who believed that their piss smelled like honey. Then again, if there were any distinctive qualities about the rider, then he probably wouldn\u2019t be a trial pilot. Furthermore, Blaze got the impression that Melchoir was dissatisfied with his current position and felt himself qualified for more worthy endeavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then dragon, bend down so they can put the harness on you,\u201d he snapped disdainfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes master\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. No need for the ignoramus to know what Blaze really thought of him, so he bent down. The contraption wound around the base of his neck. The material felt rough and abrasive, scratching uncomfortably against his scales. Part of his harness was wrapped around his shock collar, and Blaze did not think for a moment that there was not a device within the harness that could activate it at a moments notice. More harnesses were wrapped around his face. All in all, the harness was not only itchy, but also quite degrading, especially when the elf took his position upon the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, I am only going to say this once,\u201d snapped Melchoir impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d cried Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I hit you with my whip, that means I want you to start moving forward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider slapped him against his flank with the whip, eliciting a snort of displeasure from Blaze as he started moving forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I pull on the left reins, that means go left. When I pull on the right, you will go right. When I pull back on both reins, I would like you to stop. When I pull down on the reins, you will go up, and alternately, when I pull up I want you to go down. Even a beast such as yourself should be able to understand simple commands such as these\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!!\u201d said Blaze, with as servile a tone he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze felt the rider tense against his back and deliver a mighty pull. The breath caught in his throat as he found himself short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and play the flattery game with me beast!! I know you do not mean your obedience in that animal heart of yours. Know that your only purpose in life is to serve us elves,\u201d he harangued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master Melchoir\u2026\u201d answered Blaze with a neutral tone.  Frankly, he\u2019d already seen far worse to let something like that fluster him. Besides, there was no point in starting an incident with such a small-time, petty individual anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not fail me then beast\u2026\u201d he warned. \u201cNow!! Forward!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Blaze made his way off toward the ledge. Flamer-1 and Chimera-12 flanked him on the side, each of whom were now harnessed and were directed by riders of their own now. On the opposite side of the ledge, Flamer-2 took off with his own rider in tow, along with his accompanying escort, heading in the opposite direction as Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze emerged from the mountain, and despite the sneering commands of the parasitic rider, he could not help but roar with glee when he found himself truly outside for the first time in months. He found himself on the opposite side of the harbor, where down below, a series of tiny islands branched off from the main island. Part of him was tempted to fly away from the island and make his way toward freedom, yet he knew full well that he was being watched. If he was ever going to escape, he\u2019d have to survive and cooperate for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first part of the trial was simple enough. His test rider ordered him to obey simple aerial commands. When he pulled left, Blaze angled left. When he pulled right on the reins, Blaze angled right. When he pulled up, Blaze lowered his altitude, and conversely when he pulled down Blaze angled his way up. Blaze found that a little strange, how the elves favored inverting up and down. Finally, when he pulled back, Blaze slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenge, however, was to match his speed with his escort. Both Flamer-1 and Chimera-12 were inherently slower and clumsier than Blaze, and every so often he found himself angling to sharply or emerging out in front of the formation. Neither of the neutered drakes shared Blaze\u2019s excitement or exuberance in being outside; to them it was just another drill, another day in their dull, dreary lives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, out of the corner of his eye, there was a blur. Before Blaze knew it, a small dragon stopped right in front of him. Blaze\u2019s eyes went wide. It was Jinx!! It took all of his will-power not to call out for him right then and there. The way that Blaze could tell it was Jinx rather than any other copper dragon was his eyes; they burned with a smoldering, cunning vengeance. Like Blaze, Jinx had grown quickly during his captivity. He was still rather scrawny, but he didn\u2019t look emaciated anymore. Blaze wasn\u2019t surprised to see that Jinx had managed to survive the Kleaves up until now. They hadn\u2019t broken him yet, so Blaze resolved that he would not be broken himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Blaze\u2019s test rider was in conversation with Jinx\u2019s test rider, concerning the trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so it appears our paths have crossed again Comrade!!\u201d called Jinx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go by Flamer-7 now, how about you?\u201d asked Blaze. He briefly wondered whether it was wise of Jinx to reveal that he had a prior acquaintence, but he\u2019d managed to get away with it. The riders weren\u2019t paying attention to what the drakes were communicating, as they were busy in conversation themselves as the drakes circled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaider-6\u2026\u201d answered Jinx. Blaze grunted, by the looks of it they\u2019d designated Jinx in a reconnaissance role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve spotted a tribe of runaway trolls taking refuge on a small triangular island exactly 1.27 miles to east-south-east. Furthermore, the svotch have commandeered a number of old shipwrecks and are attempting to make them operational,\u201d explained Jinx. He further elaborated in dragon-tongue the particular smell, the wind conditions and other details that could only be communicated in that speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they armed?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have managed to procure a small arsenal of crude weapons. Beware that they are also concealing an improvised ballista upon one of the ships. While I doubt these will be effective, you should definitely keep this in mind,\u201d continued Jinx. Blaze grunted in acknowledgment. He switched his gaze toward Flamer-1 and Chimera-12, \u201cDid both of you hear what\u2026Raider-6 described?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d replied Flamer-1 dully, \u201cWe go in and we take out some bothersome trolls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but do you think this could this have been set up or are they really trying to escape?\u201d asked Blaze. Obviously, by the blank stares of Flamer-1 and Chimera-12, neither of them cared, nor had the possibility seemed to occur to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Blaze received a whip across the flank. \u201cYour only duty is to flame!! Not think!! You understand!?\u201d screeched his rider. Blaze grumbled, before switching his gaze back toward Jinx. The small drake had a severe expression for a moment, before flashing back to one of pretend obedience, \u201cI must be going now comrade!! I bid you good luck on your hunt!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jinx bolted off like a meteor. Blaze thus took off toward the direction that Jinx had indicated, wondering about those trolls. Obviously, Blaze was definitely going to have to flame them down; there was no helping that, but had they truly been trying to escape? It could have easily been a set-up by the Kleaves so that Blaze would have live target practice. Or perhaps the trolls really had attempted to organize an escape, and that the Kleaves had allowed it to unfurl so that Blaze could take care of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The water of the sea rippled and crested far below and all around them, a blue sky beckoned, parted here and there by banks of clouds, fellow air denizens.  The clouds were not merely figments to Blaze, his wings could take him to them, if he had half a mind.  And he did have a mind, but the elf on his back and the two dragons at his side were a strong deterrent against trying to make a break for it.  Still, even the brutality of the Kleaves could not rob the world of its beauty.  He would taste it again and with the freedom to soar where he would, this Blaze swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx was directed away when the elves up top finished their conversation.  The barbarian gave an odd salute with his paw from his head to his neck heart and Blaze attempted to copy him, though he felt a little foolish doing so.  The sun was warm, the air cool and heavy with a mild breeze coming in from the west over the great ocean.  More storms would approach in the next week or so.  Even the thought of the conditions made his proud fire-sacs tingle with the prospect of flaming.  The powerful organophosphate factories therein were adjusting the formula to fit the situation.  Blaze was sure that Flamer-2 was getting ready as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the other formation with his powerful eyes, more to the north and east than his own.  Although to Blaze this seemed like a mock battle, he could feel the battle-rage working up from his bones, filling his strong muscles with tension for the coming fight.  His fire-sacs pulsed where they sat at the base of his throat.  He wanted to burn things.  <i>\"Even if those things are sentient creatures?\"</i> thought Blaze uncertainly.  He shook his head in midair, feeling the wind press against his cheeks.  He couldn't afford to think like that.  This wasn't about burning or not burning helpless trolls - who did not sound so helpless from Jinx's survey - it was about being better than Flamer-2 and not having his ball cut off and turned into\u2026  well, turned into Flamer-1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at the dragon with his scientifically expanded frame.  He subvocalized to the big \"male.\"  [Inquiry:  Plan of attack?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-1 rumbled his response.  [Reply: Ally drakes fly in first.  Damage resistance.  We two fly interference.  You destroy target.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grunted, it seemed simple enough.  And there, the island was in view below.  The other formation was already dropping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelchior pulled up on his reins.  \"Down beast\u2026\" he muttered despite the rush of the wind.  \"You better empty your belly on those trolls, Flamer-7.  We're only getting one pass.\"  Melchoir revealed his ignorance concerning the origin of a drakes fire to Blaze's dry amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf must have had some sort of magical assistance to his voice so he could be heard over the wind.  Blaze replied in his own naturally deeper and stronger voice.  \"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's formation raced along the isle's coast northward.  They were on the east side of the island, the mainland a tantalizing smear of green on the horizon.  Blaze could not help but think how simple it might be to duck out of formation and make a run for it.  But it couldn't happen.  Blaze was sure that he had even more safeguards on him here than in his new lair.  At last he saw the trolls ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was indeed an honest escape attempt, it was a very shabby one.  Their \"camp\" looked like nothing so much as heaped driftwood and stretched canvas.  At the center, however, there did appear to be several ships hauled up onto the sand.  Logs were placed under them and ran down to the water's edge.  They was ready to be launched as soon as the repairs were made, it looked like.  Too bad they weren't going to happen now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2's formation approached then from the east, cutting in from across the sea.  Flamer-2's wingmen took the lead and swooped down, roaring dread and spreading their own limited streams of flame around the outside edges of the camp, drawing the counter-fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was counter-fire, Blaze was mildly surprised to see.  The trolls were armed mostly with longbows fashioned from island wood, it seemed.  Really that type of weapon only posed a real threat at close range and the big dragons were not landing and were moving quite rapidly.  The most they could do, really was puncture a wing membrane.  Blaze saw one of Flamer-2's wingmen assaulted by a sudden volley of arrows.  He took it in his armored chest where one seemed to get stuck in his scales.  Three hit his wings with two puncturing clear through and one getting lodged in the thick leather.  Blaze snorted.  Given what the trolls were attacking them with, it seemed more hilarious than threatening.  That is, until Flamer-2 swooped in on the nest of archers on the south side of the complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiquid flame dumped from the dragon's mouth as Flamer-2 angled his head down.  Oily and greasy, it fell on the trolls and latched onto their bodies.  They ran and screamed, many unwittingly spreading the flames about the dry wooden encampment.  The crude palisade went up marvelously, a bonfire reaching 20, no, 30 feet into the air.  Flamer-2 let out a terrific roar as some flaming balls with legs ran blindly to throw their charred corpses into the sea.  He came around over the island to repeat the scene on the north side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was still approaching the complex when they launched the ships.  Flamer-2 ignored them, instead torching the remaining camp.  It seemed as if the elves were not interested in recapturing any of these blue-skinned escapees.  Of the five ships the trolls had reclaimed, two immediately sank.  Trolls climbed the tilted masts as their bottoms ground to a halt on the sandy shallows.  They had literally no where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelchior yanked on the reins and kicked him in the neck.  \"The ships!  The ships, you fool dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze bared his teeth, but suppressed a growl the elf could hear.  He dipped his wings and prepared the fire swelling the proud sacs on his chest.  Adrenaline pulsed in his veins when he dived towards the little wooden things bobbing in a vast sea.  With the fire heavy and barely contained in the back of his throat, Blaze was blissfully unaware of his previous ethical concerns.  He just wanted to see these wooden things burn down to the water's surface.  The prospect filled him with an animal glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more archers on the boats.  Blaze angled his wings against the wind and let Flamer-1 and Chimera-12 take the lead.  Althought Blaze could probably have destroyed all of the boats in one pass on land, they had already spread too far apart in the water for that.  In fact, the boats were actively sailing away from each other.  With the two dragons forming a wall of wings and scales ahead of him, Blaze was free to note Flamer-2 approaching the ship on the far northern side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snorted, determined to burn down this ship quickly and get to the middle one before Flamer-2 claimed all the glory for himself.  Melchior kicked him again.  \"Hurry beast, or there'll be nothing left!\"  It was the first thing that Blaze actually agree with the elf on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two big dragons parted simultaneously and opened the way for Blaze to come screaming down.  He blasted hellfire on them.  Blaze held nothing back and doused the entire ship with nearly half of his full volume of fire.  His mouth burned and tasted of sulfur for spewing that much fire.  The young fire drake licked his chops and angled towards the middle ship, his two wingmen struggling to catch up.  Blaze didn't even bother looking back at the destruction he had wrought.  The ship disappeared in under four minutes below the waves.  Needless to say, there were no survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze watched Flamer-2 destroy the northernmost ship, although his stream was getting thin for all the flaming.  He set the sails and the deck on fire and while that was certainly enough to eventually destroy the ship, it'd probably take the better part of an hour for it to sink completely.  Trolls jumped overboard and floundered in the water like rats all around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a race for the middle ship.  The fire pulsed in Blaze's chest, but he grinned smugly.  He had more than enough lead to get to the ship in time.  Flamer-2 would not have all the glory this day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze flew far ahead of his slower wingmen.  Even Melchoir didn't disparage him for the break.  The elf seemed to sense that they were just mopping things up now and that lack of speed could only cost them now.  Blaze thought nothing of the drums he could hear playing primitive music from the ship's bow and stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elf could hear them, however, he pulled down on the reins.  \"Abort!  Abort!  The exercise is over!  Go up you stupid drake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ignored him, the battle rage blasting its heat behind his eyes.  The young drake opened his jaws to deliver death to the last ship\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was utterly shocked when the fire washed right over the ship and fell to steam and burn at the surface of the water.  The greasy smoke outlined an intangible barrier mere inches from the surface of the boat.  Blaze was utterly amazed.  Melchior kicked him with both booted feet.  \"Up! Up!\"  he cried with desperation in his voice.  \"They're repelling the fire!  Up, damn you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, Blaze saw the troll crew bring the large ballista on the deck to bear\u2026 right on him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Desperately, he tried to swerve to the side, but then it fired. A moment later, Blaze let out a roar as a sharp pain exploded against his thigh. The weight of the ballista bolt dug down upon his leg as he struggled to maintain altitude. Blaze gasped, he wasn't going to be able to get clear away before it could fire again. He landed belly first into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt more angry and embarrassed than physical pain; he'd been hit because he'd made a mistake. Thankfully, because the bolt was crude, rather than military grade, Blaze was able to drag himself back up to the surface without too much trouble. He\u2019d also lucked out that the bolt hadn't hit any of the vital arteries in his leg, or at least that\u2019s what it felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasted idiot Flamer-7!! Did I not tell you to abort the mission?\" snarled a understandably enraged Melchoir as he emerged on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floated about in the water, shifting his gaze this way and that. Up above, he spotted Flamer-2 and his squad heading back, as were Flamer-1 and Chimera-12. They'd given him up for dead, it seemed. And why not? He'd disobeyed orders and allowed his battle rage to get the better of him, and leaving Blaze by himself. He'd have to pay for the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Flamer-7? Why did you not obey? I knew my luck was cursed today when I was placed with you\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. What a stupid way to die. Even if the Kleaves came back to bail him out, a mistake this bad might have already cost him his balls. Damn Flamer-2 for baiting him. Damn those trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!! You\u2019re right!! I made a mistake!! Yet I\u2019m not going to die or get gelded here!! Not to these troll scum!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, he\u2019d been treating this like a contest with Flamer-2, letting his emotions get the better of him, and that\u2019s exactly what led to this sitation. He remembered what Darzhja had told him; that in the heat of a big fight, being able to think clearly and rationally meant you\u2019d already won half the fight. Now that he was faced with the very real possibility of being killed, with his mind free from any other thoughts than surviving, Blaze was suddenly able to focus with surprising clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only way the situation can be salvaged is if we find some way of sinking that troll ship!!\u201d he bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about sinking the ship!! You\u2019ve got to somehow get out of range!!\u201d growled Melchoir. Blaze growled. He\u2019d have to think fast. Arrows were flying all around him, while more ominously, the ballista crew was preparing for a second shot. There would be no way for him to get out of range to avoid a second, and likely crippling shot, even if he already didn\u2019t have a ballista bolt dragging him down like a dead weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a ballista bolt puncturing my leg?\u201d snorted Blaze. No, his only option was to somehow sink the ship, yet he had to do it without using his fire. However, the ship was still made out of wood, and wood was not exactly the strongest material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get in close\u2026\u201d shouted Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot!! Did you not see that the ship is fireproof?\u201d snapped Melchoir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can still tear it apart at the base can\u2019t I? It might be on the outside, but there\u2019s a chance that we could still light it up from within. If I can stick my head through an opening, I can flame it from within.\u201d reasoned Blaze. Of course, that was gambling on the notion that the troll shaman hadn\u2019t foreseen such an eventuality, but it was the best Blaze had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of his strength, he swam toward the exposed side of the ship, avoiding arrow fire all the while. He aimed his horns directly at the stern of the ship, using it as a battering ram. Blaze felt his head spin at the impact, yet he could feel the wood give way. The trolls on deck swayed from the impact, knocking a few into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Blaze enough time to implement the second part of his plan. He began to feverishly tear away at the wood with his claws. The hole quickly began to expand, and Blaze stuck his head through the hole he\u2019d made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself staring at the crew decks, which were a smelly mess of bunks and hammocks. The troll crew, however, had descended down the stairwell, armed with axes and the like. With his body stuck halfway inside the ship, he didn\u2019t exactly have room to maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking around for!! Flame!!\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did flame. While it did roast the trolls to a crisp, unfortunately the inside was as fireproof as the outside. Worse yet, Blaze was pretty much out of fire now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what!! Any other bright ideas!?\u201d snorted Melchoir with alarm and dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had to think fast. \u201cWe\u2026can still make it capsize!! If we can fill the chamber with water, eventually it\u2019ll tip over!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for discussion, as he began to violently rock the ship. Water began to fill into the chamber, and the ship began to lilt upon its side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!! Its actually working!!\u201d cried Melchoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed that Blaze had spoken too soon. The troll shaman himself now descended the stairway to the remainder of his crew to rectify the situation. He bellowed at his crew violently to begin to scoop the water out.  Regardless of what happened, Blaze couldn\u2019t help but admit that the shaman was a sharp and decisive individual, never panicking and ensuring that every troll was assigned to an essential task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll shaman then shifted his attention toward Blaze. He raised his staff almost comically, and then, bits of wood, metal and other flotsam swirled around Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy god, that\u2019s no regular troll shaman we\u2019re dealing with!! That\u2019s a true witch-doctor!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze hadn\u2019t necessarily studied the history of the Troll Rebellions, but what he did know was that the witch-doctors were supposedly the equivalent of an elite shaman. Apparently, nobody in the Kleave\u2019s had truly known what they\u2019d been up against. Yet Blaze saw what the witch doctor was trying to do. He was going to plug the hole with the assorted flotsam, while at the same time wedging Blaze in so that he could not move, which would allow the rest of the crew to get in close and hack him to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of anyway to get out of this situation. It was time to do something desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the shocker amulet don\u2019t you?\u201d bellowed Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? How\u2019s that\u2019s going to help!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater conducts electricity doesn\u2019t it? Get on something wooden and dry before pressing it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelchoir leapt off the saddle onto one of the shifting cargo boxes and pressed down. His shock collar lit up, and a moment later, pain exploded through his body. The shock had only been for a couple of seconds, yet it had felt like forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Blaze found himself able to refocus and gain control of his body again without, hopefully, too much permanent damage. The same could not be said of the trolls, who were now a pile of floating corpses. The troll shaman in particular was floating face up, his expression still in the middle of chanting a spell, while his eyes had exploded within their sockets. Meanwhile, Melchoir was standing there upon one of the shifting boxes, not knowing whether to be angry, impressed or afraid of what Blaze had done despite all the odds. It then occurred to Blaze just what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d made a nearly fatal mistake, but then, whether because he was crazy, scared out of his mind, deluded, etc. he\u2019d openly disobeyed his rider but managed to kill off that last ship along with a troll shaman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what you just did you...you wretched beast!! Aye...there will be hell to pay for that.... In the meantime, lets get out of this stinking rathole and swim back to shore before you have the chance to pull off any more shenanegins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master Melchoir, \"answered Blaze obediently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe swam back to shore, he briefly shifted his gaze toward the now capsizing ship. <br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026heh\u2026I\u2019d love to see the look on Flamer-2\u2019s face after he learns I pulled this off\u2026\u201d he chuckled. It was a very odd thought to have at that moment, but considering the absurdity of it all, he couldn\u2019t help himself. The Kleaves would certainly take note of this event as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other five dragons reappeared quickly as the boat began to list drunkenly as it took on water.  Only when the trolls began sliding off the main deck and the ballista there was unfirable did Blaze feel a measure of safety.  With a little help from his wingmates, Blaze managed to extricate himself from the water and fly back to Helburd Island.  Fortunately the bolt peircing his thigh was made of wood and so it's weight was not much of a burden, however, Blaze handled it gently so as not to jostle it.  Really, though, the young drake was more surprised at the lack of pain than what pain was actually there.  The flight back was silent.  Even Melchior did not feel entitled to comment on Blaze's failures and triumphs that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze parted from Melchior as soon as they alighted on a conveniant shelf built into the mountain.  For his part, Blaze would remember little of his first rider save the the elf's scent and the feel of his boots on his neck.  The elf left Blaze unattended and stomped with soggy boots up to the Elvish circle.  The young fire-drake had his saddle taken off by a couple humans hanging about the landing and was immediately directed down a side corridor when they caught a look at the wooden bold piercing his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left, though, he noticed Flamer-1 departing with his rider holding his reins down a different direction.  \"Where are you going?\"  Blaze called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-1 looked up only dimly and shrugged, not bothering to break his step.  \"Wherever he needs me.\"  he said as if he didn't care one way or another.  Blaze shuddered.  He hoped someone would kill him if he ever became as broken and dejected as Flamer-1.  As he hopped down the side passage, however, Blaze reflected that such an impassive attitude towards one's place in life had at least helped the big dragon survive obviously arduous trials and tortures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clean tiled room served as an emergency care ward.  The Kleaves were certainly prepared to accept wounded dragons fresh from the air, if nothing else.  There was only one human assistant on duty at the time, but at the sight of Blaze's wound, there were quickly dozens of the three main races filling the spacious, though low ceilinged chamber.  Blaze laid himself on the ground and kept still.  Medicine was best left to the humanoids.  That much Blaze had retained from his life in New Alveri.  He would have been much more anxious with another dragon there attempting to removed the bolt from his leg with huge, unwieldy claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolt was big for them despite its lack of metal sheath, chain or dragging weight.  Saws were brought out to cut it down into manageable pieces.  Then an elf magician appeared to coax the remaining bolt from the wound.  Blaze would have preferred a stout orc or even a distasteful dragonborn to do the job with one good pull.  However the elf drew a rune circle of separation under Blaze's leg which caused his own flesh to expel the bolt and any splinters which may have been caught in it.  The muscle was good and thick and resealed the wound as soon as the bloody thing was out, fortunately.  It was then a simple matter of stitching him back up on both sides of his thigh.  Blaze would have two new scars on his leg as trophies of this day.  He grinned crookedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScars were considered beatific on male dragons back in New Alveri where sometimes a dragon could pass through even their species' long lifespan without accumulating many;  there were, in fact, parlors where dragons could pay for scarring.  Now Blaze seemed to be accumulating a small fortune's worth quite naturally the old fashioned way.  What he had now would have set him apart in the orphanage... and there seemed much opportunity for more such \"enhancement\" in the future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was smiling at the thought when he realized that the medics had left quite suddenly.  Seeing as Blaze was hardly ever left alone, he was actually quite unsure of what to do now that the chamber really was empty.  Blaze lifted his head.  It surprised him that it actually took more than a minute before the thought of escape entered his head.  The landing was right back out the way he'd come after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze drooped his scaly eyelids at the sound of boots coming up the opposite passage into the first-aid room, the small hope passing. Grudging dispassion gave way to intrigue, however, when Blaze identified the newcomer as none other than the young elf self-identified as Fang.  He clapped his hands as he entered the wide clean room.  \"Marvelous show today, Flamer-7!\" he cheered almost believably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snorted.  He knew sarcasm when he heard it.  \"If you call getting shot through the leg by a sharpened tree trunk marvelous.\"  rumbled Blaze, taking advantage of the liberty Fang had shown him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young elf stepped lightly over the tiles and towards Blaze.  Even though his fire bladder was empty - and he had the hunger pangs to prove it1! - he remained a very dangerous creature.  The fact that Fang apparently felt so safe around him was disconcerting.  Not that Blaze really wanted to kill the elf despite his alignment with the Kleaves, he couldn't see how it might benefit him for one, and it was easy to see possible repercussions for two.  However, it made Blaze wonder how much Fang really knew about him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang put his hands behind his back and leaned back and forth on his toes.  \"Don't be modest.  You managed to take down a fully trained troll wtich-doctor despite the fact that you'd never encountered the like before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze scowled, \"Yeah, but only by practically electrocuting myself in the process...\"  Blaze snaked his head around towards Fang suspiciously, giving him a few cursory sniffs.  \"Wait... how do you know of the troll magician?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang did not falter.  \"Melchior has already given his report.  And to be honest, it was quite scathing.\"  Blaze frowned, but Fang continued,  \"Fortunately for you and your testicles, the other riders were rather impressed with what you did.  They'd given you up for dead when you hit the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze opened and closed his jaws a couple times.  What was Fang up to telling him this?  What was his game?  Who <i>was</i> Fang?  The young fire-drake shook his head on his long neck.  \"I just did what I could.  It was because of me that we ended up in the water in the first place.\"  It hurt to admit it, but it was the truth.  Blaze didn't want to be neutered for a single mistake, naturally, but neither could he pretend that what had happened was largely due to his own arrogance and recklessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just smiled and took a few steps closer.  Fearlessly, he put a hand on Blaze's paw and looked up at the big dragon.  \"You did well out there and I think you surprised more than a couple of your critics today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze raised an eyebrow as Fang continued on, walking around his length towards his injured leg.  \"I have critics?\"  he asked in a low voice; a few stones ground together in the dragon's crop as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang chuckled as he approached the raw stitched wound on his haunch.  He threw back his head and said, \"Everyone has critics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just snorted.  When Fang removed a vial of red potion from his sleeve, however, the fire-drake became much more alert. \"What is that?\"  he said with a slight growl in his voice as he partially shifted his weight on the tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This?\"  asked Fang innocently.  \"Why, it's just a basic healing potion.  Granted it's not something we would normally waste on dragons, but I managed to sneak this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze eyed the red tinged fluid in the large beaker.  He could smell the residue remained around the stopper.  \"Healing potions are usually clear.\"  he said from experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Fang seemed surprised.  \"Ah... so you spotted that.  Well... this one's been juiced up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze moved his paw to a few feet behind Fang.  It was subtle, but the effect was now that Fang was surrounded by red-scaled dragonflesh.  \"Juiced up with what?\"  asked Blaze ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang swirled the contents of the beaker carelessly, \"Oh you know... A little of this, a little of that, it's really rather compl-\"  the comment choked off in the elf's throat as Blaze moved in his face closer, letting his fangs hang out from his thin scaly jowls.  Fang pushed Blaze's nose and dripping chops away with a firm hand.  \"Alright!\"  he cried, \"I added a little of your blood.  It ought to attune the potion to your system so it works better.  That's all, I swear!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze relaxed.  He let out a moist breath which rustled the elf's robes.  After a few moments, he sighed, \"Fine, just do it.  Can't be worse that what Moridin's already done to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang opened his mouth, but whatever he was about to say seemed to die in his throat.  A strangely mixed expression played over Fang's youthful face as he climbed up on Blaze's haunch.  The elf sat on his knees at Blaze's knee and leaned over where the bolt had penetrated his flesh.  Carefully, he spread the potion, which felt cool and adhered to the wound more like a powder than a fluid.  The coolness dulled what pain there was and spread down into the muscle below.  Fang asked that Blaze lift his leg so he could do the other side.  The dragon complied, however noticed that the elf took several moments to examine his sex when he did so.  Fortunately, after spending so long on this island, Blaze was beyond feeling indecent.  A man didn't think twice about examining a stallion in such a matter right?  Blaze supposed it was natural for the young elf, just as it was natural <i>not</i> to look in New Alveri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang applied the potion to the other side of Blaze's haunch and left soon after.  Naturally, his visit was not to be discussed with anyone else.  Before he left, however, Blaze had one thing to ask the elf.  \"Do you know when I'll be able to see Honeysweet again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"  asked Fang, turning from the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the drakka in the fire-drake harem...\"  mumbled Blaze, rubbing his forepaws together uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new expression bloomed on Fang's face: Mutual understanding.  \"I don't.  But I'll see what I can do. Good-bye Flamer-7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good-bye, Fang.\"  rumbled Blaze after the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the first aid and Fang's subsequent administrations, Blaze did not escape reproach for his misdeeds during training.  Not long after Fang departed, a dozen men in armor crowded into the chamber, Melchior at the head of them.  \"Don't think you're getting off so easily for disobeying orders, Flamer-7!\"  he shrieked.  \"Gloin!  You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloin\" was a stout dwarf who armed himself with a smooth, lubricated pole of alarming thickness.  Blaze tried futily to scramble away - mostly by instinct - at the sight of it, but Melchior shocked him.  The dwarf with arms as thick as a horse's leg, rammed the dread thing home.  He knew what he was doing and didn't waggle it like some of the men did, but pushed it down hard and painfully deep.  The men laughed as Blaze took it with sharp hisses of pain.  \"I think he likes it, don't you?\"  they would say and jostle the man next to him.  The comments hurt almost as much as the pole did and Blaze remained stock still for fear of tearing himself on its girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes felt like twenty days and finally the stinking tip of the pole was removed from him.  Some blood oozed onto the ground where Blaze lay paralyzed with pain, but he'd escaped having his vent torn.  A shiver of disgust crept down Blaze's spine thinking that the Kleaves had gotten him the \"best\" to work over their candidate breeder male.  Melchior at least seemed pleased with his catatonic state.  He walked over and kicked Blaze in the teeth with his booted foot.  \"On your feet drake!\"  he shouted and before Blaze could even move, he shocked him.  Twitching almost as badly as Flamer-6, Blaze staggered to his feet.  As he did, the elf added.  \"That's the last time you'll make me look like a fool, dragon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze thought he might be led to yet more tortures, but miraculously, he was only led back to his vault with the other prospect males.  Once inside and free of the elf, humans and dwarf, Blaze climbed through the air to his ledge.  At the first opportunity, he ducked into the back to have a good long soak in the pool to ease himself and try to forget the look on Gloin's face as he'd thrust again and again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a mighty splash Honeysweet emerged from the fishing cove with her largest catch yet; a young porpoise weighing at least three hundred pounds. She was careful not to ruin the carcass by pressing down too hard, and waded back toward the dock with a sense of genuine pride. Gathering fish was usually a tedious affair, but she had a rare opportunity and a chance with this one, for her prey had been fast and agile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deposited the porpoise onto the large net where the rations for the day had been collected. Waiting for her at the deck was one of the handlers, a female elf by the name of Allorah. In terms of stature, she was far huskier than a typical elf female, and with a darker shade of hair than the typical gold color, which may have been a reason why she was a handler and not placed in a position of employment where she would be more visible. Given all the handlers she had witnessed thus far, Allorah was harsh, but at least she was fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be all for today Honeysweet,\u201d said the handler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so early today?\u201d asked Honeysweet curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWords just come down that we\u2019re going to have a visits from the males again,\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she replied, her hearts skipping a beat and instinctively she closed her legs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!! Now go hurry up and wash up so you\u2019re not smelling of salt and fish!!\u201d answered Allorah. Honestly, if a male was indeed coming to visit, it was probably best not to wash up so that she\u2019d be as anonymous as possible. Yet she knew better than to argue at this stage, and she made her way to the washroom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles was already busy showering herself when Honeysweet entered the washroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles sniffed a couple of times and retched exaggeratingly, \u201cEwww\u2026you smell like beached whale!!\u201d she squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet snorted. \u201cObviously yeah.\u201d She found it rather odd that anyone would be complaining about smell nowadays, and she\u2019d come in smelling of things far worse than raw fish and salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did your hunt go?\u201d asked Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree wild boars, eight dire foxes, two baby water buffalos and I just about had a prized bull when my collar activated!! Do you have any idea how frustrating that is!?\u201d wailed Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d shrugged Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome next hunt though, that bull will be the first one I kill!! I\u2019ll make sure of it!!\u201d she squealed.<br>\r\nHoneysweet smiled cooperatively, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will Sparkles!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Honeysweet knew that Sparkles\u2019 ditzy, annoyingly optimistic persona was but a coping measure for her, yet the alternative was giving in to despair and committing suicide as Lily and Rosepetal had done.<br>\r\nHoneysweet remembered how much she\u2019d cried when she found out that was to be her fate from her kidnappers, and that there was no chance of escape. Ironically enough, she had fled her clan to escape an arranged mating. He had been a rather dull individual that was more than twice her age, but not for the first time she wished she\u2019d accept their wishes, rather than end up in this harem. Oh, the elder had warned her endlessly of what would happen to her if she defied the wishes of her clan!! Yet not even in his most dire imaginations could he have imagined that she would be faced with the Kleaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, do you know why they called us back from our chores so early today?\u201d asked Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t one of the handlers tell you on your way back?\u201d cried Honeysweet. Sparkles gave Honeysweet a blank look. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing in one of the fire drakes to come\u2026visit us,\u201d answered Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right\u2026I suppose I did hear something like that on my way back,\u201d unfurling her wings slightly with a sheepish smile. Honeysweet couldn\u2019t help but snort. Sparkles wasn\u2019t necessarily stupid, but she was habitually absent minded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you know who they might be bringing?\u201d inquired Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know? Personally, I hope its not that brute Flamer-2\u2026\u201d she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was awful\u2026\u201d sighed Sparkles. The big drake had barged into the harem as if he were Gyramond himself, bellowing that \u2018all these whores belong to me\u2019, and was about to jump on top of Sparkles before the drake handler had shocked him into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026he\u2019s the type of stereotypical male that all the old matrons back in male clan always warned that young drakka should stay away from,\u201d cringed Honeysweet. Sparkles nodded in agreement. However, it wasn\u2019t as if either of them would get a say in the matter. If it did turn out to be him, Honeysweet resolved to slash her neck open, even if it meant leaving poor Sparkles alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if its that other one? The cute one?\u201d teased Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet wasn\u2019t able to stop herself from uttering a startled yelp, before she attempted to cover it up with an averted gaze. \u201cWhich other one? There were at least three others that came to visit us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Honeysweet!! You know, the one that talked only to you!!\u201d she re-emphasized, nudging her again.<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026Flamer-7\u2026 or whoever he was\u2026\u201d replied Honeysweet, trying to feign ignorance. There\u2019d been something uncanny about him, though she still could not put a claw as to why that was. She couldn\u2019t help but think back on how foolish, but at the same time, endearing he was, almost as if he really cared about what happened to all of them. Of course, there was the chance that it could all be an act; males were known to do anything to get what they wanted after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you two!! Hurry up in there!!\u201d cried the voice of one of the drakka out in the larger chamber.<br>\r\n\u201cAll right!! We\u2019ll be right out!!\u201d answered Honeysweet. She closed tighty the water chute above her, shook herself dry, before exiting toward the harem. The three other drakka were already chattering amongst themselves.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but listen in on you two,\u201d said Starry. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can be so excited about a candidate male coming to see us. I mean, I\u2019m sure you know full well how the breeder males treat the drakka around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet shuddered, \u201cYeah\u2026I know.\u201d The first time she\u2019d peeked in on it, she\u2019d been utterly terrified. Nowadays though, after months of being here, she was just hoping that they\u2019d pick one of the fire drakes other than the brute, so she could just be done with it instead of having to wait and wait and live with the uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoneysweet\u2019s hoping that its cute one!!\u201d giggled Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet tried to keep her expression neutral, \u201cI-I did not ever say that now did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-7 right? He did seem earnest, but males like that are unpredictable,\u201d said Starry, \u201cI hope its that more mature one, Flamer-8.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought he was boring\u2026\u201d whined Sparkles. \u201cYet maybe because he\u2019s closer to your age you see something we don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarry shrugged, \u201cActually, I thought he was kind of boring too. Yet he\u2019d know what he\u2019s doing, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he\u2019s more stable right? Less likely to go on power trips.\u201d replied Honeysweet. She supposed it wouldn\u2019t have been too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can hope all you want,\u201d growled Cherry, \u201cIt might make you feel better for the moment, and even if the one you hope for gets chosen as the breeder male, don\u2019t be too disappointed if it turns out he\u2019s not quite the white knight you envisioned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll they really care about is sticking their dick inside of you. They\u2019re all such simple and base creatures. So long as you make them think they\u2019re giving you a soul-shattering orgasm they\u2019ll think they\u2019re Gyramond\u2019s reincarnation and that\u2019ll make life more tolerable for all of us,\u201d added Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMating shouldn\u2019t be like that\u2026\u201d insisted Sparkles with a soft whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d snorted Rocket, rolling her eyes. \u201cBut of course you\u2019d say that. You\u2019d never had a hulking brute stick it up you before. Trust me, the first time is the worst. You\u2019ll wish that you died, and you\u2019ll realize you aren\u2019t worth a shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so blunt about it\u201d sighed Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlunt am I? You can wish for the sky if you want,\u201d snorted Rocket, \u201cIn fact, I hope that Flamer-7 that you\u2019ve been pining for gets chosen and that he turns out to be a brute like the rest of them. Hopefully, after you\u2019ve cried and left you bleeding, you\u2019ll still be aware long enough for me to say I told you so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough you two, this isn\u2019t helping things,\u201d growled Starry sternly. Rocket rolled her eyes, but backed away with a huff, settling down to her corner of the harem and restarting her conversation with Cherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook you two,\u201d said Starry in a very big sisterly way to the two younger drakka, in which in many ways she was, despite not being very much older than the two of them, \u201cI know its not what any of us intended, but compared to the place I was before, honestly I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019ll only have to deal with one breeder male rather than have to serve many. Besides, we have solid rock over our head and a full meal a day, and that\u2019s better than dying isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d answered Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it bother you so much Honeysweet,\u201d answered Starry, pressing her head against Honeysweet\u2019s comfortingly, \u201cWe\u2019ll all get through this. You\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their conversation died just then as male scent wafted into the chamber. Honeysweet\u2019s breath caught in her through as her gaze was focused upon the doorway, and a large shadow appeared.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honeysweet moved away from Starry after the heated argument with the other drakka. She reclined on some of the rough stone surrounding the central exit at the bottom of the chamber. The stone vault in which she lived was feeling especially cramped today.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe sound of water filled the background. One of the wash chutes didn't close tightly enough and so trickled water constantly. The streamlet at least fell into the long \"sex-pool\" as Honeysweet thought of the dwarfish style straightedged pond and so did not flood the chamber. The sound of it had been maddening when she was first incarcerated here, but now it was actually a little soothing as the dragoness laid her scaly form across the unforgiving stone and awaited a possibly unforgiving suitor. \"Please let it be anyone save Flamer-2. Anyone else...\" she found herself praying in the tribal dialect of Draconic she'd been raised speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet remembered the tribe where she'd grown up.  It had all seemed so quaint and primitive back then, but right now, with the benefit of hindsight and having seen the depths a drakka could be driven to, it seemed like paradise in memory.  Back then she'd had a family and she'd had a name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember!  Ember, there you are!  What in heaven are you doing way out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber lifted her head slowly, communicating through body language that she was only reluctantly found.  Her clutch-mate and sister was intent on bringing her lonesome stargazing to an early end it seemed.  Ember spoke in a bitter tone.  \"What does it matter to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister, whose given name was <i>Tawa'hesia</i> but went by the nickname \"Tessa,\" alighted on the ledge where Ember was perched.  Her claws crunched some gravel under her weight and she folded her wings, walking as far up as the narrow prominence would allow.  \"It matters to everyone where you are, especially your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber snorted.  Right now, her two sisters, mother, and range of aunts and cousins who made up three-quarters of the small tribe did not feel like much of a \"family.\"  Ember looked her sister in the eye.  \"Oh, you mean just so you can make sure I don't escape before the ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa seemed taken aback, she ruffled her wings uncomfortably.  \"Of course not!  This is a high honor.  You should be proud to accept the responsibility of the trade.  You represent the best of what our tribe has to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber rolled her eyes.  \"The best of what our tribe has to sell you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Tessa reached out her neck and gave the perched dragon a sharp jab to the base of her neck with her snout.  Ember let out a \"Hey!\" in complaint.  Tessa said, \"I don't know why you're choosing to think about it like that.  Imagine, a new life with people who aren't related to you and a strong leader who isn't your father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber bared her fangs and looked sidelong at her sister pressing close to her flank on the narrow ledge.  \"No one asked me if I wanted a new life!\"  Again, Tessa looked stunned.  Ember got to her feet and rounded on her sister.  Though they were hatched at the same time, Ember had the advantage in size, speed, and muscle mass.  \"My <i>mother</i>\" she spat the word, \"and the two other matrons and my father just got together one evening and decided that it should be me who is given to the other tribe.  Do you have any idea what that means for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa backed away, clumsily moving her tail out of the way of her hindfeet.  She stepped into long grass which reached to her knees and stopped when she bumped into a pine tree.  \"It's a t-time honored tradition.  Every hundred years we trade with one of the other tribes.  It keeps the blood fresh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smirked, happy that she could still intimidate her sister like this.  Tessa knew that she was more than a match for her, on land or in the sky.  \"That and trading up on males.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa gaped and then set her teeth.  Growling more than a little she spoke, \"How can you speak of father like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Ember rolled her eyes.  Tessa was remarkably naive about certain things.  The tribe - which was not even a particularly large one - roamed well beyond the reaches of the New Alverian State which occupied large treks in the north and west of the country of Nod.  It consisted almost exclusively of females and exactly one breeding male; currently there were two young males still hanging around, one still a juvenile and the other one seemingly uninterested in trying his luck out among the rocks and plains with the other rogue males.  Father watched and lorded over the latter especially lest he ever get the thought into his head to challenge the old man for leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a thin leadership it was!  Any drakka in the tribe was larger and more muscular than the stringy, light-built male.  His strength lay in maneuvering during flight, but a good tail swipe would send him flying, undoubtedly.  In addition to his seed, the females of the tribe required little else of him.  And everyone knew this!  And yet they all bowed and scraped to him, as if deposing the last male somehow endowed him with the wisdom to make decisions.  To Ember, the whole system was sickening; to the females, and even more so to the males.  She still lay awake sometimes at night, wondering what ever happened to her brother, Nie'andre.  Tessa would never understand.  All she dreamed about was becoming a matron in the tribe and having lots of eggs with a strong leader who would whoo her and make life more bearable.  Ember had different dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber huffed and turned away.  \"You don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of the anger she'd shown her, Tessa sidled up to her sister, rubbing her flank against hers like a large scaly cat.  \"What don't I understand?   You're frightening me, Ember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sighed.  Tessa deserved better than to have her anger taken out on her.  \"I'm sorry.\" she attempted to ameliorate and moved her head to rub her chin against her sister's neck.  \"But don't you ever think... of leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving?\"  asked Tessa quizzically, \"Leaving where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber frowned and took her head away.  She looked again up to the star-filled heavens.  \"The City perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa moved away.  Her jaw hanging widely, she added in revulsion, \"Ugh... you want to live... with humanoids?\"  she shook her head.  \"They live in tiny little stick piles... and they smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the city they don't.\"  Ember remarked.  \"And they say that dragons and humanoids live as equals side by side and no one tries to kill one another or break their eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly Tessa wasn't convinced.  And who could blame her really.  The towns and villages which dotted the landscape were largely separate from the roving dragon tribes.  Whenever a tribe came to settle in an area to tend to ground-bound eggs, the locals either tried to bribe us to stop the thieving of livestock or they came with weapons in twilight - when our eyes were weak - to try to drive us off if they were bold enough.  There was never very much conversation either way and tongues other than Draconic were rare in the tribe anyways.  They hated us ubiquitously as pests at the least, as vandals and raiders at the worst. And for our part, we were largely disdainful of them and their brief little lives.  It seemed hardly worth getting to know a humanoid, they shriveled up and died soon enough.  Only the advent of steel weapons and magics which could bring down an unwary dragon forced us to live in tribes in the first place.  Tales were still told of the long gone \"good days\" when a single dragon could roam the heavens and earth without fear of thieves or assassins.  When we lived as intelligent beasts and gods of the sky and earth.  There were no tribes then, each dragon was a force of nature unto him or herself, and our spawn could be released into the wild with moderate expectations of surviving to unveil their wings and ascend to godhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we carried our young on our backs to keep them safe from poachers with steel tipped arrows and sorcerers looking for ingredients for their witchery.  We lived with a fear that none of us dared name and would openly laugh at, but had changed our lives nonetheless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa shook her head, a little loose skin rippling under her jaw, \"And I'm sure that the streets are paved with gold as well... more likely broken eggshells!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber hissed at the image.  \"Tessa!  You have no idea do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister back up a little, leaning her rump against the tree and causing it to groan in the thin soil.  She seemed a little ashamed of what she'd just said as well.  \"So go then!  After the ceremony, you can take off and live in your Alverian paradise or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa was angry, though because she thought Ember was being foolish or because she was jealous was uncertain.  \"But I <i>can't,</i>\"  rumbled Ember, grinding the rocks in her crop.  \"Do you really think they'll let me leave once I'm traded?  I'm sure lots of girls try to leave.  They'll keep me prisoner.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not safe out there, Ember. Someone will kill you or rape you or worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ember's blood felt hot again. She shook out her wings and flapped them against her sister, sending dust and pebbles flying into her face. \"Yeah, well maybe I think that freedom is worth a little risk. It's better than waiting around here, getting screwed by some macho little drake twice my age! It's got to be better than being traded away from everyone I know like I'm a goddamned horse! Or are you happy I'm being married away to another clan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa seemed on the verge of tears now and Ember felt remarkably un-proud of herself. She blinked away the dust from her eyes with her water lids and said, sniveling, \"I'm not happy you're leaving!\" her voice cracked, \"You're my sister! I don't know what I'm going to do without you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber felt like she was falling through space. Then hot tears leaked onto her own cheeks, leaving clean tracks in the dust, which coated them. When she moved forward, Tessa flinched and that hurt all the more, but she drew her into an unresisting embrace with her wings. \"Don't cry Tessa. It's going to be alright.\" said Ember, but the words were hollow. She wasn't sure yet what she was going to do, but she was pretty sure it wasn't going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, both sisters wound up hugging and apologizing for harsh words on both sides.  The tribe was small and you learned how to get along with each other when your world essentially consisted of 30-odd dragons.  Familial bonds would ride out any tension... or so it seemed at least.  Forbidden thoughts were running through Ember's head and for her, the situation was from from resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe had settled on some ledges on the step side of a rocky valley.  Some digging had expanded the habitable regions on the various shelves which would support a dragon's weight while the tribe stopped so that Ember's first cousin Ysal'sul could tend to her eggs.  It was before midday on Ember's last day of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had not slept.  Instead she had lain awake on her shelf between the comforting warmth of her mother and sister while they rested.  It had been very hard not to be listless or to toss and turn.  She'd lain still despite the discomfort and listened to the sounds of her family breathing.  She was aware that this might be the last opportunity to do so.  Inside, her thoughts raged in a dark storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKesir'ria, Ember's mother, awoke first, which meant it was time for everyone to get up on the small shelf of bare stone and loose dirt.  Kesir'ria was 350 years old, fading out of her breeding years, but not yet old enough to be a matron.  Still, she'd undoubtedly been consulted before Ember had been chosen for the trade to take place tomorrow at dawn with the other tribe.  Ember wondered what she'd said when they told her they wanted to take her daughter.  Feeling a darkness grow a little inside of her, Ember imagined that her mother thought it a great privilege and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKesir'ria stretched, working the kinks out of her spine and then turned to Ember as if she knew she'd been awake.  She smiled down at her daughter and despite her dark mood, Ember could not help smiling back.  \"Embre'ailie, you have not eaten in two days.  Would you like me to catch you something?  The cows in the village below looked especially fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older drakka's voice was sharp and Ember's mother tended not to waste words.  But simply by the offer, Ember knew that she was being buttered up.  \"No, you don't need to do that.  There's no sense in getting the humanoids all riled up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother ground the stones in her crop and hissed a little over them, a disarming sound.  \"Psshh, it's worth treating my daughter one last time.  This is a special occasion.  Besides, my niece's eggs are due to hatch within a fortnight.  These shelves will be cold before they can do much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Kesir'ria had already made up her mind.  Ember smiled up at her and touched her with her wing, her mother seemed only a little surprised at the contact.  \"Go then.  I'm sure we'll have a fine feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka beamed down at her daughter like only a mother can and leaped off the side of the shelf to drift down the length of the valley to raid the village.  Ember watched the wind carry her away until her large body seemed as insignificant as a gnat's.  It was the last time that she saw her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa had gone back to sleep.  The sun had already dawned by the time they'd made the flight back to the valley where the tribe currently resided.  Wild dragons were most active in full day and deep night, skipping mornings and evenings, so Tessa was correct in trying to make up lost sleep.  Ember stood.  She was tired too and hungry to boot.  But there wasn't any time left.  She knelt her head down and nuzzled the top of Tessa's head.  \"Goodbye dear sister.  I'll never forget where I came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber flinched when Tessa stirred, but it was only to curl up tighter and hug her tail to her chest like a juvenile.  Before the tears could come, Ember threw herself off the ledge.  For a second, she contemplated another form of escape, but then decided to unfurl her wings.  She flew away, dead east, directly towards the jewel that was New Alveri beyond the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet flashed back to the present, sighing. She wondered if she would have made the same decision again, knowing what awaited her with the Kleaves. All that she\u2019d really done was to condemn her sister to marry that wretch back home instead. Indeed, she\u2019d been horribly selfish. In fact, she\u2019d been out of her mind when she\u2019d said she would make it big. The only thing she'd made big, was the big mistake she'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber stared up at the huge walls of New Alveri. Just beyond she could see its gleaming towers, its hustle and bustle, all its fabulous wealth and riches. The sights still left her with a great sense of awe since she had arrived at its outskirts about a couple weeks prior. However, the big problem now was getting int. Of course, that was easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic dragon clad in full armor guarded the main gate, whose wings seemed to swallow the sky when fully unfurled. Alongside the behemoth were several humanoid guards with weapons. Of course, it had occurred to her to fly over the wall and into the city, yet several guard towers, not to mention dragons, also patrolled the perimeter 24 hours a day to keep out dragons exactly like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than willing to work to try and get into the city. Yet the sort of \u2018employers\u2019 she\u2019d been approached by were shifty eyed drakes telling her how smooth her body was and how they\u2019d pay big money for her services. Ember had hissed at them each time. If she\u2019d intended to be ravaged in such a fashion, she\u2019d have stayed behind in the clan. Furthermore, when searching for work, she\u2019d been at a horrible disadvantage as the requirements were that she know how to read and write in standard draconic, which was something that her clan had deemed unnecessary. In contrast, even the poorest of the draconic locals she'd seen passing by not only knew how to read and write, but also they spoke a vareity of the humanoid tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was running out of options. Hard reality had set in, as she still needed to find somewhere to sleep, something to eat and to drink. The first shocking reality was that in the area right outside the city, there were next to no wild animals that could be freely hunted. They all belonged to humanoid farmers, merchants or whatnot, so she had been forced to eat thin strays and carcasses. She would spend her nights in a dinky, exposed clearance on the edge of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should just go back. Hopefully the clan will accept me back and won\u2019t be too harsh\u2026\u201d she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you? Looking to find a way into the city?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shifted her gaze toward the direction of the sound. It was a small little humanoid. Honestly, it had been the first time that she\u2019d been directly approached by one of them, and Ember had to admit it was very brave of him to say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d snarled Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humanoid, Ember wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a human or an elf- it might have been a mix, grinned, \u201cI\u2019ve been observing you watching up at the wall for quite a while now. You seem the ambitious sort that wants to make it big\u2026 I know a secret passageway through the mountains that leads directly into the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I know that this isn\u2019t some sort of trick?\u201d growled Ember. He reeked of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t actually,\u201d he flat out admitted, \u201cYet besides, if I end up lying to you, I end up dead don\u2019t I? Plus, what do you have to lose by doing so?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honeysweet wanted to hit something when she recalled that encounter. Of course that humanoid hadn\u2019t been faithful to his promise, yet she\u2019d been too daring, too desperate and also too trusting that there wasn\u2019t anything the lone humanoid could do to her physically. That humanoid; whom she\u2019d never learned the name of, had indeed led her into a secret passageway through the caves. The last thing she had remembered was emerging into this warehouse and a blue mist. When she\u2019d awakened, she\u2019d found herself blindfolded and in chains, and on her way to sexual slavery under the Kleaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted when an unmistakably male scent hit her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came Flamer-7, his handler at his side, hand on the shocker. He was much larger than the last time Honeysweet had saw him, about her size now. She'd been one of the larger females in her clan, and the transformation was admittedly astonishing. While he was about the size of father now, he certainly wasn't as thick and muscular. When the now buff drake switched his gaze in her direction, Honeysweet couldn't help but gasp. There was that hunger in his eyes now, far more apparent than last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Honeysweet,\" said the drake with a fond smile and a deep masculine voice that made her stomach flutter. More ominously, his complete attention was focused upon her, not seeming interested at all in giving a glance toward the others. Honeysweet shifted her gaze toward the others for support, not finding any. The others understandably wanted as little to do with the potential breeder male as possible, and were basically placing all the burden on Honeysweet until the male handler decided he\u2019d had enough time. She decided that perhaps it would be best to keep the potential breeder male engaged; so he wouldn\u2019t try something violent, even if he didn\u2019t seem the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026would be Flamer-7 right?\u201d answered Honeysweet, trying not to sound too interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he answered, almost hurt that she'd seemingly needed a moment to recognize him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026just wanted to make sure\u2026 You\u2019ve grown quite a lot since the last I saw you, how did you grow so quickly?\" she couldn't help but ask. She'd heard of males getting rapid growth spurts, yet this was ridiculous. He\u2019d been rather skinny and even runtish before, but now he was pure rippling muscle. Flamer-7's gaze grew surprised for a moment, as if just realizing it himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNutritious food and lots of exercise of course, along with some additional\u2026 supplements\u201d he answered, with a contrite grin that could not hide a distinct sense of discomfort. She\u2019d heard of nasty rumors about how the males were experimented on and broken psychologically in order to turn them into sex-crazed beasts. Whatever the Kleaves had done to him, at least on one point she couldn\u2019t help but note the substantial improvement of his figure, nor would she have to worry about her male lacking physical vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expect I\u2019ll still grow a bit more. Why a year from now, I might be the same size as a Sky-Swallower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d she retorted with a measure of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-7 puffed a plumb of smoke out of his nostrils, \u201cI hope I am joking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet couldn\u2019t help but cough out a sound that was a mix between humor and uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, has everything been all right for you and the other drakka? Are you all getting along?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe you could introduce me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet gave a quick rundown of the others, whom while they allowed her to reveal their names, none of them seemed willing to include themselves into the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she could see both Cherry and Rocket roll their eyes. They knew better than to openly display their disdain toward Flamer-7, lest on the off chance he actually become the breeder male and make them pay for it. Still, they didn't need to always act so...stereotypically whorish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026don\u2019t mind us\u2026\u201d said Rocket, \u201cYou two just continue acting all friendly now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet could almost see the venom dripping out of her jaw as she said that. She couldn\u2019t help but feel satisfied that Flamer-7 didn\u2019t appear to want to have anything to do with them either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles, on the other claw, merely watched with wide eyes, curious yet scared at the same time. Whenever the males had come to visit, her normally ditzy self dissolved into frightened silence.  Starry perched herself next to Sparkles protectively, just in case Flamer-7 attempted to jump her like Flamer-2 had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSparkles isn\u2019t usually like this, she\u2019s normally a lot more talkative,\u201d appeased Starry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo doubt because she\u2019s too much in awe at how handsome I am\u2026\u201d he answered with an amused snort. Honeysweet wasn\u2019t sure whether it was genuine self-flattery, or self-deprecation. Yet she did want to shift Flamer-7\u2019s attention away from Sparkles, so she decided to ask another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow well do you get along with the other males?\u201d she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering only one of us can be the breeder male, we aren\u2019t exactly making friends with one another. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Flamer-8 and Flamer-6, aren\u2019t the worst drakes in the world. We have this mutual understanding when the time comes for us to screw each other over, its nothing personal. In the meantime, we try to work things out so life isn\u2019t quite so shitty,\u201d he answered almost casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Flamer-2?\u201d inquired Honeysweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLets just say we\u2019re not particularly enamored of each other\u2026\u201d he answered. Though he tried to keep his expression casual, there was no hiding the disdain and hate on Flamer-7\u2019s face, the tensing of his muscles, the low growl that came out of his throat, but most of all, the way his eyes suddenly lit up was frightening. She was not surprised at this at all; in fact, there could be no two drakes that could be more different personality wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets switch the subject before I start slamming my tail against the wall. Anyhow, mind telling me where you came from?\u201d he asked. Honeysweet wondered if Flamer-7 was completely out of his mind, but for a moment she couldn\u2019t help but think of her old clan, of Tessa, mother, her cousins and even father. She sniffled, doing her best to stifle a tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSorry, I probably shouldn\u2019t have asked you that. You must miss them a lot.\u201d Said Flamer-7 with genuine regret. The fact that it was not a superficial question only made her feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you ask me that? You knew that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to answer that.\u201d she snapped, with more violence than she had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-7 sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t know really. You strike me as the kind of dragon who values that sort of thing, especially in this kind of place. I\u2019d just been thinking about you ever since that first time we met,\u201d admitted Flamer-7. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why me?\u201d Honeysweet\u2019s hearts began to pound, but she managed to catch herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why really,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cWhen I saw you, you just seemed like someone who needed encouragement, that\u2019s all. You remind me of many of the things I lost when I got kidnapped.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr perhaps, less glamorously, it\u2019s a way that I\u2019d be able to make you more open to being fucked,\u201d he finished with an offhand smirk. \u201cCan\u2019t say you\u2019re entirely wrong on that. You are very beautiful. Not just on the outside though, but also on the inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet blushed deeply, despite herself and the corniness of the statement. Of course, Flamer-2 had roared about how smoking hot all the drakka were and how he wanted to be inside of them, but hearing it from Flamer-7 was somehow different, almost as if he actually saw her as something beyond a fuck-toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-7 snorted, \u201cI guess its just a way for me to fool myself into thinking that I won\u2019t be like the other breeder males, if I survive that long, nor a tool of the Kleaves, and that there\u2019s something to really fight for besides not getting my balls cut off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarry had warned her of males that would put on a sympathetic act in order to fool the drakka, and served as a particularly sinister way to get them to roll over. However, his spiel had already suckered in Honeysweet, and she prayed to the Ancestors that he really meant those words. Like Flamer-7 had said, it was a way for her to pretend that things weren\u2019t quite as awful as they really were, and not everybody here was out to hurt her.  For the first time since she\u2019d left her clan, she genuinely felt warm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly... \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough loverboy?\u201d growled the voice of the drake handler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026sorry,\u201d apologized Flamer-7, \u201cYou said look but don\u2019t touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, its been nice talking to you Honeysweet,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be able to see each other again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said that in such a way as if they were on the streets of New Alveri or something like that, as if the only things they had to worry about were disgruntled fathers, gossiping clansmates and other \u2018normal\u2019 things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Flamer-7. Take care of yourself until then\u2026\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-7 answered with a nod, before he turned away. Honeysweet watched him every step of the way, wishing he could stay longer. Her brain told her that she shouldn\u2019t invest her heart in hoping that Flamer-7 would get chosen, but she didn\u2019t care any more. She needed something that she could keep fighting for, to be able to see beyond this horrible place and that there was the possibility of a new life, of a light at the end of the tunnel. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nBlaze walked back into the large vault where he was confined with the other male fire-drakes with something of a spring in his step.  Wolf, who trotted beside him noticed and said as much  when he pushed the door closed behind the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" asked Blaze.  \"Well, who wouldn't be happy after seeing and smelling all those horny drakka!\"  Blaze feigned machismo, but Wolf was too insightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\"  he said crossing his arms.  \"I saw you in there.  You went right for the tall one.\"  He chortled.  \"I can't tell that much, but she has a smooth set of scales, and they tell me that counts.  Curvy too I might add...\"  Wolf made a clicking noise with his cheek which disturbed the young drake, but not as much as the red scaled face with peered down at the two of them from over the ledge leading down to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so the hot-shot has got a girlfriend, eh?\"  remarked Flamer-2.  He was probably trying to be sarcastic, but he came across as just angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze hissed and showed his teeth.  \"I have no such thing.  They're just... they're just whores.  That's all.\"  Blaze figured that a lie would protect Honeysweet better than admitting to his love for her - and her body - but he was dismayed to have bungled his cover-up so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf just shrugged and walked out the smaller exit set in the big door.  Blaze and Flamer-2 stared at each other for a long time. Finally Flamer-2 rose and paced away.  As he went, though he muttered audibly.  \"They all belong to me...  Even if they don't know it yet.\"  Blaze did nothing in response, though the testosterone surging in his veins demanded satisfaction in the form of Flamer-2 face ground into the floor.  But Blaze didn't want to fight unless he had to.  He had to hang onto to that part of his old self, he just had to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days after Blaze went to see Honeysweet, Blaze found himself in an unusual situation.  His clawed hands gripped a rough steel bar and he pulled it towards his chest while lying carefully on his back.  The heavy weights to the side lifted and the welded frame supporting it and the chains connecting them to the bar dangling overhead groaned, but was steady.  Blaze felt the strain and burning in his chest... and, unbelievably,  he liked it.  Not just because it eased the spasming in his muscles either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze pulled down hard on the bar, barely budging the connected weights.  Blaze had asked for all of them, and there were even a couple trolls sitting on the mass of iron until Flamer-6 shooed them away for their own safety.  Blaze thought of Flamer-2, hoping to get himself angry enough to move the weight... but it wasn't enough.  They fell with a clang against the floor.  Dragons don't sweat, but to either side of him, the veins stretching through the leather of his wings were livid as they tried to cool his body.  Blaze rested his head against the floor, or rather on the stilt that his horns provided.  He knew Flamer-6 was watching, but the lame dragon didn't say anything.  Blaze would have shouted at him if he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew in several deep breaths, trying to concentrate.  He knew he could do this...  When the idea came it was startlingly simple.  With a grin, Blaze tensed his shoulders and pulled down.  As he did, he imagined Honeysweet's face.  He remembered the way she'd spread her long body out on the stone...  He didn't need to imagine her in danger (he did that enough on his own though), just the simple memory of her from that day was enough to break through the wall.  He pulled the mass of iron and rock high and then lowered it until it was just above the ground, then raised it again.  He repeated this five times and then let it down softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snaked his way out of Flamer-6's hollow.  Panting lightly, he nodded to the other dragon.  \"That's some machine you built.\"  Blaze lifted a foreleg and flexed it, feeling the bad-good ache.  \"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 grinned.  \"It wasn't all me.  Yayo'jin did the tension math for me and Bal'lal improved on my initial design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ventured a grin himself.  He'd been using the machine now for the last couple days and it seemed easier to like Flamer-6 now.  It helped that Blaze just assumed that Flamer-6 was going to be dropped out of the program at one point or another; it was sort of obvious, though you couldn't tell by the way the twitchy dragon carried himself or how he spoke alone.  Although he couldn't afford to let his guard down entirely, the less Blaze chose to view Flamer-6 as a computer, the less there was to dislike about the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd really, all Flamer-6 seemed intent on nowadays was pissing off Flamer-2 as much as possible.  Granted, it honestly didn't seem intentional - at least most of the time - but at every turn Flamer-2 was the one being snubbed.  It had really started before Flamer-6 had completed his weight-training machine, but its construction just brought things to a head that much faster.  The day it was built, Flamer-2 openly derided it and its makeshift appearance.  However as soon as both Blaze and Flamer-8 seemed to be enjoying it, of course he demanded a turn at it.  It almost exploded right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn exchange for its use, Flamer-6 wanted certain favors; an extra fish perhaps - the lame drake was still having to make due on the smallest cut of the daily fish pile - but what he really wanted was protection.  From Flamer-2, however, he demanded that he stop eating the trolls that venture out of the safety of his tiny hollow.  From Flamer-2's expression at the very idea that he could \"owe\" Flamer-6 anything, Blaze had thought that there was going to be a fight right then and there.  Blaze was ambivalent about stepping in, but then Flamer-2 threatened to destroy the machine if he couldn't use it.  That caused Blaze to jump down, followed shortly by Flamer-8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it.  You're all ganging up on me huh?  Why don't you fight me fair for once, you coward?!\"  The last was directed right at Blaze for a reason Blaze still did not fully understand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze hated having Flamer-2's attention turned on him, but for some reason, the bigger dragon had gotten into his head that Blaze was his biggest rival.  Something about the young fire-drake just seemed to put Flamer-2 on edge, even more so than Flamer-6.  However Flamer-2 knew that he couldn't take on all three of them simultaneously.  \"Just get out of here.\"  Blaze had said then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\"  Flamer-2 had spat,  \"Why don't you all just chew on this then.\"  Then the vile drake had just emptied his bowls right then and there, not even bothering to squat.  Revulsion had coursed through Blaze at the display and he had to retreat to his ledge to escape the smell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Flamer-8 had alighted on his own perch, he'd remarked, \"That dragon is insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had watched some trolls emerge from Flamer-6's hollow and begin to clean up the mess with makeshift shovels.  Flamer-2, for his part paced back and forth along his half of the room.  The young drake had shook his head sadly \"I know he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze had finished his morning workout on the machine, three days after that first incident with Flamer-2, Flamer-8 stepped down to have his turn at it.  The machine was re-giged so that the older drake could pull from opposite directions towards his chest.  Blaze thought he was just showing off.  However, this was interrupted by the opening of the vault door.  Dr. Moridin appeared, so Blaze knew it couldn't be any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, it was time for another series of injections.  The only upside was that they did not inject directly into Blaze's spinal implants.  Rather, he received just two, one to the neck and another in his rump.  It was far more tolerable and Blaze hoped that it was a sign that they were beginning to wean him off the mix of unknown drugs he was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves had left as quickly and unannounced as they'd come and the dragons were left to deal with the side-effect by themselves.  As always, Blaze felt hot, over-stimulated and hungry.  Flamer-6's palsy worsened significantly and Flamer-8 was annoyingly blithe and unaffected as usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Blaze would always think it was the drugs that provoked Flamer-2's decision to reassert himself with Flamer-6.  However, even without the steroids coursing through his veins, something like this was bound to happen eventually.  Flamer-2 had been uneasy and unsettlingly quiet for the last couple days, ever since having been turned back yet again by the united front of the other three.  It was clear that something was building to a head inside that dragon.  Being locked in here with nothing else to do was just making it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very evening, Blaze found out just how far Flamer-2 had fallen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air in the vault cavern was still tense when the fish cart was pulled into the flattened center of the room. Blaze was actually hoping that Wolf would arrive with news of some new trial or such, anything to break the turbulent undercurrents between the various dragons. But it was not to be. Wolf left without saying a word and again the dragons were left to divide the fish among themselves. Despite the fact that the weeks had ground into them something of a routine, the actual dividing was still something of a free-for-all. Blaze and Flamer-8 went at the pile dumped out of the cart simultanenously, followed shortly by Flamer-2. As long as the hated drake didn't try something stupid like claiming the lot for himself, his presence was tolerated. Flamer-6 got what was left when they'd eaten their fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grabbed at a rather handsome looking porpoise and after just a few growls and hisses at Flamer-8, eventually got his way. He dragged the heavy fish into the air and up to his ledge to eat in peace. It was all he would eat today, but Blaze felt that the added privacy was worth a slight reduction in the total volume of meat. Besides, he'd grown to like the taste of dolphin blubber, very different from albacore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, Blaze watched the feasting below with a cautious eye towards Flamer-2. He should have known something was wrong when he noticed Flamer-2 hanging back, eating more slowly. Although, slow for Flamer-2 still involved swallowing medium sized fish whole and biting full grown tuna in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cripple!!\" snorted Flamer-2 suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" growled Flamer-6, eyes narrowing from the sidelines as he waited for the two larger dragons to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to use the exercise machine...\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you do, do you?\" answered Flamer-6 with mild surprise, \"Again, my terms are that you won't harm any of the trolls ever again, and furthermore because you decided to shit on my territory you\u2019ll owe me a full portion of albacore every time you want to use it,\u201d he outlined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 dug his claws into the stone at the increased cost. \u201cHow about I take a shit down your throat cripple?\u201d snarled Flamer-2, his jaws still dripping with fish guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 grunted at Flamer-2 from across the already decreased fish pile and Blaze also stretched his wings from where he say on his perch. Both dragons weren't going to allow Flamer-2 to start this up again with the lame drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Flamer-2 did something completely inexplicable. He turned his nose down to the fish at his feet. Then he grabbed one of the few remaining whole tuna in his jaws and with a powerful jerk of his neck tossed it to land before Flamer-6. Then he grabbed another, the last which was not already claimed by Flamer-8 and chucked it after the first. Blaze was honestly shocked by Flamer-2's acquiescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your fish\u2026\u201d growled Flamer-2. Flamer-6 gasped with understandable surprise. He sniffed the fish, checking for any taint, yet apparently there was none. He set into a finer meal than he could have expected otherwise with obvious relish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine... you can use it for this evening...\" said Flamer-6 with obvious reluctance when he lifted his head from a half-finished tuna. Blaze had a very bad feeling about this. Flamer-2 willingly giving Flamer-6 a portion of his ration was very unlike the vile drake's usual behavior. Yet there was nothing he could do at the moment, save for hope that Flamer-2 would work off his steam lifting those weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably, the trolls were reluctant to place themselves within the weights. They knew full well of Flamer-2\u2019s appetite for their kind and looked to Flamer-6 uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 strode smugly over the remaining fish on the tiled center of the room. Flamer-6 watched the larger dragon carefully as he mounted the contraption, setting himself inside, but barely fitting due to his sheer bulk of muscle. Without question, the troll operating the assembly set the weight load at maximum. However, Flamer-2 paused before rolling over to grasp the dangling bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze watched helplessly from above as Flamer-2 reached out with his forepaws ahead of him and wings behind. He grasped the stout bars of crudely shaped iron with claw and wing talon and pulled with tremendous and terrible strength. He tore the contraption asunder over his back. Three trolls fell from a crippling height to the unforgiving stone below and a broken chain whipped sending two more broken trolls flying and tearing another asunder completely. Another chain struck Flamer-2's flank, but his scales withstood the blow without breaking. Flamer-2 let out a roar of pain and bestial delight as the iron fell around him and Flamer-6 could only stand and watch, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lose!! Now nobody can use that stupid contraption of yours!! Nobody do you hear me?\u201d roared Flamer-2 stepping over the ruin, heedless of the troll bodies under him. To add insult to injury and to prevent the remaining trolls from helping their fellows, Flamer-2 turned his head over his shoulder and belched forth a torrent of flame to engulf the ruin of the device. The shrieking of burning trolls filled the chamber then... but only briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Flamer-6 merely stared at the destruction that Flamer-2 had wrought with a blank stare. The only sound that filled the room for about a minute was the squeal of a twisted metal beam as it burned, dangling from a former support beam. When the heat had sufficiently changed its shape and texture, it snapped off and landed on the cave floor with an echoing clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how does it feel cripple? Not so smart after all, huh? Maybe if you cry and beg, I might let some of your precious little trolls live\u2026\u201d he bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll regret saying that, bastard!!\u201d roared Blaze, wings unfurling. His claws gripped the edge of his perch so hard the stone crumbled under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, are you about to come save your fuck buddy now?\u201d growled Flamer-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze bent down to leap into the fray, yet Flamer-6 snapped his gaze back up at Blaze, signaling with a grunt that he wanted to stand up to Flamer-2 alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it F-flamer-2?\u201d said Flamer-6 emotionlessly. \u201cWas this your juvenile idea of g-getting revenge and p-proving you\u2019re better than everyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHA!! I am better than you cripple!! Bigger, stronger, faster and more powerful!! I don\u2019t need to follow your stupid rules!! The only rules that matter here is that I\u2019m Flamer-2 and I am King!!\u201d he roared and even launched a gout of flame up into the air for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that what you think? A king? A k-king is able to make rational judgment, a king can control his emotions, a king can control his will. What you\u2019ve shown me is that you\u2019re not a king, nor are you even a slave. These are the actions of an animal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn animal you say?\u201d sneered Flamer-2, yet his voice didn\u2019t carry its usual edge. He strutted forward and forced Flamer-6 to give way. \"Well, I got the better of you. You're stupid machine is burning now and it's because of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. It's not worth g-getting upset over the actions of an animal. S-sure, in your case it can occasionally talk and boast, but it doesn\u2019t really have any self control, identity, nor question its purpose. So long as you are allowed to eat, kill and fuck, you will be completely compliant, never questioning your purpose. That's why you're so perfect for the Kleaves...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-just shut the fuck up!! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about cripple!!\u201d Flamer-2 bellowed. The big dragon forced his way forward again, trying to impose with his weight and size, but Flamer-6 just kept moving away, hopping over his limp at times. He led Flamer-2 in a big circle around the middle of the vast chamber, and just kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 tilted his head sideways, his expression still impassive. Yet Blaze could see a glint in Flamer-6\u2019s eyes, like he\u2019d been wanting to do this to Flamer-2 for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Prove me that I\u2019m wrong.\" The lame dragon cleared his throat and then did something completely unexpected. \"My name is Ral\u2019pherinox\u2026\u201d The moment he spoke announced name, a small red light appeared on his inhibitor collar and the dragon went stiff and fell over as a powerful current coursed through his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 trembled on the ground, his eyes rolling back in his head. He bit his tongue and pissed himself. But after two seconds it was over and the dragon's body relaxed; though still he twitched a bit. Though it was plain that he was still in pain, Flamer-6 wobbled back to his feet and looked up at a flabbergasted Flamer-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes\u2026that is my n-name. I\u2019d studied as an elemental engineer under my f-father in Damescara. Every y-year, during my apprenticeship we would design a complex machine, and after we were finished, we would destroy it. He taught me that its not the machines themselves that make us great engineers, but r-rather the drive to keep imagining and never letting old designs hinder the new. S-so no matter how many times you destroy my machine, no m-matter how many trolls you k-kill, I can always make a new machine. Its what makes us dragons, rather than animals,\u201d continued Flamer-6. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about you Flamer-2? You never did say what your real name was\u2026\u201d growled Flamer-6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flamer-2 snorted amusedly, but the snort was hollow, \u201cYou still think I\u2019d fall for that old trick? I\u2019m not about to be shocked to prove I\u2019m stronger than you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026yes\u2026the same old excuse as before isn\u2019t it? Aren\u2019t you the biggest and strongest dragon there is? The self-proclaimed King of this miserable hovel? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re afraid of that puny little human with his shocker now\u2026 Its your turn now Flamer-2\u2026\u201d Flamer-6 prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon looked visibly shaken, alarmed that Flamer-6 had actually gone through with it. While he tried to maintain his arrogant sneer, Blaze could see the uncertainty and fear in his eyes. Flamer-2 actually seemed to shrink in Blaze's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you cripple\u2026\u201d answered Flamer-2. It must have sounded lame, even to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 smiled, \u201cOh? You\u2019re letting a cripple like me get the better of you? What is your name? Yet if you are so scared of being shocked, perhaps only the first letter will do. Wait\u2026you don\u2019t know how to read draconic do you?\" Flamer-2 growled and forced his claws through the thick tiles under him, but he stood as if rooted to the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the first sound of your real name? That shouldn't be enough to activate the collar if you're frightened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 visibly strained, his breathing growing heavy. The large dragon tossed his head and his eyes seemed distant, not even looking at Flamer-6 now. He let out a ragged breath, obviously struggling with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026I understand now\u2026 You don\u2019t even know what your name is anymore do you? Its not your fault if you can\u2019t remember who you are no name\u2026\u201d said Flamer-6 with mock sympathy, \u201cPoor\u2026poor animal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had never seen Flamer-2 so distressed and frightened and confused. The lame yet intelligent drake had just landed a blow far more devastating than any claw swipe, tail swoop or fire breath. In fact, Blaze even contemplated telling Flamer-6 to stop what he was doing, yet found that he could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no-name! No-name! No-name! No-name!\u201d chanted Flamer-6. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2's head snapped forward and he let out a horrific roar. Before Blaze or Flamer-8 could react, the no-name drake charged forward and skewered Flamer-6 with his horns. Flamer-6 let out a choking noise as his body careened against the rock surrounding the lowered center of the room. Before the lame drake could resist further, Flamer-2 was on top of him and began raking him with his claws while also beating him repeatedly with his heavy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let out a roar, and then bent down to leap off his perch. Yet his assault was short lived as his shock collar activated, sending him crashing to the floor in agony. It took a monumental effort on his part just to avoid breaking one of his wings as he landed, stiff and writhing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay where you are!!\u201d bellowed Wolf. He'd pressed all three symbols on the control talisman at once, and all three able drakes had fallen to the ground. He then gestured toward Flamer-8 and Blaze. \u201cIf either you move until this mess is sorted out, consider yourselves out of the breeding program!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t know of any other male fire-drakes on the island, yet he couldn\u2019t afford to see this as an empty assertion. Plus, the thought of Honeysweet getting raped by any other male\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that bas-\u201c said Blaze still, lurching forward. Flamer-2 needed to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-8, restrain Flamer-7, so he doesn\u2019t go rushing off for a fight\u2026\u201d ordered Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes Master Wolf\u2026\u201d obeyed Flamer-8. Blaze merely gritted his teeth as the older drake deftly slid his tail around his neck while Wolf strode up to the insane drake. He surveyed the scene with anger and dismay. A growing puddle of blood was forming around Flamer-6, his gasps coming ragged and hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026looks like I won\u2019t be in the breeding program anymore,\u201d gasped Flamer-6. Wolf shook his head with something that almost looked like genuine regret, before focusing his attention on Flamer-2. In all honestly, Wolf had quite a lot of guts to confront an insane drake out for blood; or perhaps he was just lacking perspective of what had truly happened just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019d finally gone and done it have you beast?\u201d snarled Wolf. \u201cIn truth, I\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to get your balls off, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not satisfied to find that you\u2019ll get what you deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2\u2019s eyes focused predatorily on Wolf, and Blaze feared that the human had just signed his own death warrant. Flamer-2 didn't speak, but turned away from the bloody ruin of Flamer-6's body and took large steps towards the miniscule human. His jaws hung open and he salivated generously from them. An almost dead, detached film had infiltrated the big dragon's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf backed away, while frantically slamming his finger on the shocking amulet. Flamer-2 grimaced somewhat, yet the animal seemed beyond pain, beyond fear. Flamer-6 had stripped away the last threads of Flamer-2's fragile sanity. Panic overtook Wolf when he saw that the collar was having little effect. With Flamer-2 looking angrier and more demented than ever, he then desperately tried to scamper back toward the door. Yet it was in vain, as Flamer-2 surged forward on longer legs and scooped Wolf up with his claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 breathed heavily as he spoke, as if words came with effort now \u201cI've almost forgotten... the taste of human...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, you don\u2019t want to eat me\u2026 I taste terrible. Oh God\u2026please not like that!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 dangled Wolf over his mouth like the morsel that he was and then deliberately bit off the human from the pelvis down. The man screamed horribly as his bowels began to fall from the upper half of him, bloodying Flamer-2's nose as he chewed twice then swallowed. With another snap of his jaws, he finished what he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Flamer-8 had let go of Blaze as both dragons looked with horror at what Flamer-2 had become. Let it be said, that while none of the drakes would have shed a tear if Wolf had met an untimely demise, he hadn't deserved this. A moment passed and then red flashing Elvish runes appeared overhead on the ceiling. Blaze read the symbols for \"Danger\" as well as a call for arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze braced himself for battle as Flamer-2 turned his gore stained face to look at him. The dragon's eyes were buggy with delierium and an absolute loss of a sense of self. He looked directly at Blaze and then said. \"I'm going to have her...\" he breathed. Then he repeated, much louder, flaring his great wings. \"That whore is mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 looked on in confusion, but Blaze knew exactly what Flamer-2 was talking about and his heart fell down into a dark pit. Before anything else could be said, Flamer-2 turned and dashed down into the overhang in the center of the room, towards the big iron doors. He reached his claw through the little door Wolf had entered and then pulled the bolt securing the larger set. Roaring without care, the hulking dragon burst through the portal and dashed down the hall. The breath rattled in Blaze's throat and his legs felt like jelly. He knew exactly where Flamer-2 was going.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The older drake was alternating between looking at his claws and staring listlessly off into the distance. Blaze shuffled his wings agitatedly. \"You heard what he said, he's going right for the drakka!\" he tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gaped, aghast. \"Don't you care?\" he asked but inside, Blaze was already suspecting Flamer-8\u2019s true motivations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do care,\" said Flamer-8 rising to his feet and taking a few languid steps forward. \"But the thing you need to understand is that Flamer-2 has already signed his death warrant. He broke out of here and even ate the dragon handler. The Kleaves are going to put him down ruthlessly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze danced on his paws, so eager was he to end this conversation and take off after the rogue dragon. \"But not before he gets to the harem!\" shouted Blaze. \"We're almost next door to it now! He'll... He'll... before they get him...\" He couldn't bring himself to say it, but the images forming in his mind were like a burning toxin. He imagined Flamer-2 with dear Honeysweet being crushed under his bulk. The big dragon huffing and grunting, the drakka crying and moaning under him. It made Blaze want to tear at his own skull!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know what that brute is going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why won't you help me?!\" Blaze shouted at his older lairmate. Spittle flew from his jowls; he was so incensed. Flamer-8's indifference at this moment made him seem almost as horrible as Flamer-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause its not worth getting yourself killed over some whore\u2026\u201d he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!!\u201d snarled Blaze, nearly launching himself at Flamer-8 right then and there. \"She's not a whore!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Flamer-8 seemed to understand, as he let out a huff, \u201cShe\u2019s a whore like the rest of them. I know I sound like an asshole, but you get yourself attached to people too easily. Its not worth making friends here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said it calmly and with nary a trace of emotion, save perhaps a twinge at the corners of his eyes. Blaze looked at him levelly, though uncomprehending. \"So\u2026that means\u2026\" he uttered, jaws agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 sighed raggedly. \"Do I have to spell it out?\" He shook his head. \"You and I are still competing here. Now that Flamer-6 is dead and Flamer-2 is as good as dead, you\u2019re the last obstacle to my becoming the breeder male for the fire-drakes.\" Blaze's eyes traveled unwillingly to the broken body of Flamer-6 where it lay almost forgotten against the wall, blood still spreading across the broken tiles. Flamer-8 continued. \"To be honest, I would like to win fairly against you, to show myself as the superior dragon through my merit alone. You're honorable enough to deserve that, yet since I don\u2019t think I will be able to convince you to stay, I might as well be the last dragon standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ground his teeth together. How could this be happening? He and Flamer-8 had almost seemed close - certainly closer than he and Flamer-6 had ever been - but then, all those times they had been united against the prodigious physical might of Flamer-2. Now that Flamer-2 was done for in the long term, it seemed Flamer-8 didn't need him anymore... It made logical sense, but it hurt emotionally nevertheless and Blaze found himself having to hold back tears at the betrayal he had known must happen eventually. \"You're a heartless bastard, Flamer-8, may the Ancestors curse you to the powers below,\" said Blaze, but without much feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 sniffed and rubbed his snout with a paw. \"Don\u2019t take it personally Flamer-7, I'm just trying to win. So if you want to go save your \u2018girlfriend\u2019 like you\u2019re some fucking New Alveri Holy Knight, then go ahead and get yourself killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething then struck within Blaze. He flashed back to how scared he\u2019d been during the attack in New Alveri, how he\u2019d fled like a coward when he should have helped. All this time, perhaps he still saw himself as the idealistic young drake who believed there was a clear line between right and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this is even about winning or losing anymore?\u201d snarled Blaze. \u201cThe life of somebody I care about is at stake and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to protect her. If that means I end up getting castrated or killed as a result, whether by Flamer-2 or the Kleaves, so be it. But I\u2019d never get over it if I let her get hurt when there was a chance that I could have done something to stop him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a breath. It wasn\u2019t necessarily Flamer-8\u2019s fault. Even now, he wasn\u2019t a bad dragon; he was just doing all he could to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise me one thing though. If the worst happens to me, and you become breeder male, then I\u2019m counting on you to take care of Honeysweet and the others, and that you all will try to get out one day\u2026\u201d finished Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze turned without another word, as Flamer-8 stood there frozen, conflicted, watching him stride away. At the open iron doorway, he heaved a great sigh. In the hallway, as in the main chamber, red flashed from previously invisible runes on the ceiling. \"Danger-Danger-Danger\" They flashed in Elvish. There were shouts and the sounds of armored feet approaching, though given the way sound echoes underground they may have been around the corner or clear across the complex. Stealing a glance back at the reluctant drake, Blaze dashed down the empty hallway, following Flamer-2's pungent odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if his sense of smell had been completely blocked, or he had not known the way to the harem there would be no mistaking the path Flamer-2 had taken. All he had to do was to follow the trail of blood. Blaze passed by several mutilated corpses along the way, mostly dwarf and human. Armed with only poles, clubs and other weaponry designed to torment rather than to fight, they hardly had a chance against the huge, insane fire drake. Flamer-2 had not paused to eat the unfortunate guards, but rather\u00c2\u00a0tore\u00c2\u00a0into them as he passed. At a T-intersection, Blaze passed the remains of a small column of warriors. He could tell they\u2019d been armed because they had armor on, but beyond that, he couldn't say. They were reduced to ash from a blast of fire which had filled the side tunnel. A few steps further, Blaze encountered a similar scenario and was slightly heartened that Flamer-2 was being forced to use up his flame, and which hopefully meant it had delayed him somewhat in his dash to the harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever after that, there were only a few corpses. The Kleaves, it seemed were done throwing small contingents of prison guards at the rogue dragon, and had decided to wait until they could marshal a sizable squad their elite warriors and likely other dragons besides. When they came for Flamer-2 next, it would be with overwhelming force. Blaze forced his claws on faster with a growing sense of dread despite the lack of bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze took a passage off the main avenue he knew led to the harem. He did not even pause to glance at the slaughtered humans who lay in bloody pieces outside the forced open iron doors. Beyond, Blaze heard sounds, which stopped his hearts cold. A high keening which turned his blood to ice, but also filled his shoulders and back with a sudden flush of strength and tension. Flamer-2 was groaning with feral anticipation, already preparing to make the most of his last few minutes of life, and indeed the keen of fear and dismay belonged to Honeysweet's! He prayed to the Ancestors he was not too late\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlind rage took over then as Blaze rushed through the doors, heedless of his own safety, nor the prospect of facing a bigger, more powerful drake in single combat. Flamer-2 would die by his claw.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The inside of the harem was filled with movement and the flapping and rustling of great leathery wings. The drakka obviously knew something was wrong and yet fear or habit kept them trapped inside this room despite the fact that the doors were pried wide open. Nevertheless, Blaze had to give them some credit. They were avoiding the hulking mass of Flamer-2 like the plague. If they had been truly broken, they might have simply thrown themselves down before the huge male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was already subdivided, though. At one end, the four drakka cowered, there wings spread and ready for flight. They had space between them and were ready to scatter, however, Flamer-2 was occupied at the other end of the room. He had cornered one of the drakka... Honeysweet. He had knocked her down onto her side; dragons could only copulate belly to belly. The mad-eyed drake was even now trying to get her to roll over, heedless of her wings pinned against the ground. Never-mind that sex on the ground was a mockery of how it was supposed to be done, the sight of Flamer-2 with his oversized claws on Honeysweet was enough to send Blaze into a heedless rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2, occupied as he was, never knew what hit him. Blaze took to the air and drove himself forward with all the strength in his wings. He slammed into Flamer-2's side like a battering ram and even the big dragon's bulk could not stop him from flying off his feet and tumbling over the course, unworked stone at the sides of the harem; almost identical to the one in which he and the other drakes were housed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze held onto Flamer-2, roaring at the top of his breath, and they rolled once then twice. Flamer-2 yelled as one of his wings got pinned under him; it was a pity that Blaze heard nothing break. The heavier drake wound up on the bottom and Blaze scrambled forward over his belly, clawing at the drake along the way. He tried to estimate where Flamer-2's neck heart was. If he could get his jaws around it and end this quickly, he might have a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blaze hesitated too long. Flamer-2 reached up with his hindclaw and laid them against Blaze's abdomen. With a mighty kick, he sent the lighter drake into the air. Blaze managed to catch himself with his wings. He dove right back at Flamer-2 as soon as he'd corrected his flight, but by then, the big male had already righted himself. He set his claws in the stone and braced for another impact. Blaze let out a roaring war-cry as he fell on Flamer-2 again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time the results were not so satisfactory. Flamer-2 swung up with his tail and caught Blaze right in the belly, sending the lighter drake sprawling to the ground with a mighty crash. A vibrating pain coursed through his body, his breath coming short and wheezy. Yet Blaze bit back the pain through his teeth and pushed himself back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the huge frame of Flamer-2 suddenly came into his vision. Letting out a yelp, Blaze tucked his wings against his back and frantically rolled to the side, barely avoiding what would have been a crippling blow. Blaze had barely managed to recover when Flamer-2 swung completely around and slashed at him. Blaze managed to get his own claw up in time to stop it from cutting open his neck, yet the force and momentum from the blow knocked him backwards again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Blaze leapt clear of Flamer-2\u2019s range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 was already charging forward like the berserk animal he was. Blaze hopped out of the way, onto one of the small ledges to his left, yet Flamer-2 was able to quickly change direction and re-routed himself toward Blaze. Frantic, Blaze looked for anything that would stop Flamer-2\u2019s momentum. He scooped up a loose stalagmite unhinged from one of Flamer-2\u2019s earlier charges and hurled it at Flamer-2. The awkwardly spinning object flew end over end and somehow managing to catch Flamer-2 through the wing membrane. The big drake howled, momentarily staggering in shock from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to take advantage, Blaze surged forward. He knocked the bigger dragon back a few steps, then connected with another blow right underneath the chin. Now, he was set up for the knockout blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to hell Flamer-2!!\u201d screamed Blaze. He did a 360 turn in a mighty circle, gathering all his momentum and swung his tail as hard as he could right at Flamer-2\u2019s neck. Yet instead of the sound of his tailbone connecting against scale, Blaze instead met Flamer-2\u2019s swinging foreclaw directly in the face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze vaguely remembered hearing a sickening yet all too audible clunk, similar to the sound of a solid block of concrete dropped into a field of mud. For a moment, Blaze forgot who he was and why he was here, consumed by the ringing pain in his head. He swayed on his feet drunkedly, Flamer-2\u2019s visage blurring in and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get up you idiot\u2026 get up!!</i> Blaze thought desperately to himself. Flamer-2, rage and hate in his eyes, stomped forward to grapple him. Blaze shakingly slapped at him with an aimless claw, yet he found himself knocked off his feet back first on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d snarled Flamer-2, his jaw open, \u201cI\u2019m gonna ravage you. I\u2019m gonna kill you and eat you!! Because all pricks like you gotta die!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is that all you have to say animal?\u201d panted Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-2 lowered his face in close, and his eyes bulged nearly out of his sockets. Those eyes, they were now deeper than a mere animal rage, but it was a hate that ate at ones spirit, a hate that warped the mind. \u201cYou\u2026I hate you so much. From the moment I saw you, you\u2019ve been conspiring against me. You kept cripple alive so he could laugh at me, oldie so they could go 3 on one. Yes, just like that prick used to do; always smiling, always so smart, getting away with stuff, crying so momma loved him more,\u201d he rambled. \u201cEverything\u2026 it was all that pricks fault. So I tell him how much I truly hate him, how he doesn\u2019t deserve to live. Then, the prick cries like he always does, and tells me that he loves me, so I tell him to go jump off a cliff. He does and I watch him splatter below. Then, they all blame me; and cast me out, but I\u2019m glad that fuckers dead; dead like he deserves. And you\u2026every time I look at you I see that prick, laughing at me. Well, who\u2019s the one laughing now prick!? I\u2019ll kill you again!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could only stare frozen as Flamer-2 tilted his jaw and aimed for his neck. Yet right at that moment, Flamer-2 let out a roar of pain. Honeysweet had snuck up from behind and managed to bite him right on the tail, hanging on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucking bitch!!\u201d snarled Flamer-2, shaking her off with a violent swing, yet not before managing to bite off a sizable chunk of flesh. Blearily, Blaze staggered back to his feet. His left eye was closing rapidly, but it frankly could have been much worse. Yet to Blaze\u2019s alarm and dismay, Flamer-2 had switched his attention toward Honeysweet, aiming his horns at her flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!!!\u201d yelled Blaze. He charged forward blindly at Flamer-2. Yet he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it in time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flamer-2, bleeding heavily from where the flesh on his tail was torn away ran after the drakka where she lay after he'd tossed her. Honeysweet was getting to her feet when the big dragon connected. She let out a shriek as his sheer mass bowled her over completely. The big drake got his teeth around her throat in a flash, but before he could end her, Blaze was there, leaping onto Flamer-2's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon's wings flared, but Blaze was already on his back, he bite his large wing muscles brutally and clawed at the many hard nodules lining Flamer-2's spine. Flamer-2 roared out in pain and backhanded Honeysweet who was still under him and struggling as well. The drakka went limp, then the big dragon bucked like a horse and twisted his head like a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven dragon scale would not defy Blaze. Before he was forced away by Flamer-2's snapping jaws, he tore off a large piece of the larger drake\u2019s thick flight muscle. He roared with pain and rage, yet as Blaze jumped off his back, though, Flamer-2 decked him with his tail, sending him once more to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze landed on his belly, but although his body was aching from the fight, forced himself up with a bounce, he was still far too close to Flamer-2. The larger drake then swept his tail at Blaze\u2019s feet, yet Blaze leapt up into the air to dodge it, and before he could swing his tail around and follow through with another swipe, Blaze frantically flapped his wings as hard as he could and floated away from his rival. Coasting on the air, Blaze swept away, trying to gain a new perspective on the fight, hoping that he\u2019d be able to use his height advantage to find an opening. Flamer-2 tried to jump up and swipe at Blaze a few times, yet Blaze managed to nip at him before flapping away. Every time that Flamer-2 tried to follow him in the air, he\u2019d slap down at Flamer-2, keeping him trapped on the ground. Hopefully, he\u2019d be able to keep this up long enough to wear down the larger drake. Frustrated that he couldn\u2019t follow, Flamer-2 then committed the most unbreakable of taboos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had seen Flamer-2 about to break the taboo before, the hellish gout of flame nonetheless caught him by surprise. Blaze desperately tried to bank away, yet in the tight chamber, there was little room to maneuver, and thus he still found himself singed by the outer margins. Somewhere, he heard a drakka shriek in dismay. Yet Blaze\u2019s more dire concern was the throbbing pain on his left wing, which had taken the brunt of the fire. The wing twitched with agony as Blaze held it from his body, the leather was charred on the outside, burned all the way through in places. And the holes widened as he remained in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wing unable to take his weight, Blaze tumbled to the ground, using one wing to break his fall. He let out a cry as he fell. Though it pained him to move it, he folded his injured wing to his side, the better to protect it. Flamer-2 strutted towards him. Blaze growled, defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\u2019s nowhere to run!! I'm going to eat your dick first.\" said Flamer-2 as he approached. \"And then your hearts and then shit on your corpse. Then once I\u2019m breeder male, I\u2019m gonna sire an army of slaves and then take over the fucking world!! All will bow down to me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up!\" shouted Blaze, but his voice lacked spirit. He was really hurting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his tail and stumbled a bit, realizing that his left foreleg was pretty badly burned as well. The scales there were dry and curled away from the skin at the edges; fire-drakes had a natural resistance to fire, but even they were not completely fire-proof. Sensing weakness, Flamer-2 charged forward again, yet Blaze, biting back the pain, managed to swing with his claw and catch the side of his head. Yet to Blaze\u2019s dismay, the brute paid it no heed. He tackled Blaze and he went down. He struggled a bit, but Flamer-2 put down his claw on his neck. Blaze couldn't breathe! There was no sound besides the big drake roaring in hateful triumph and drakka crying in the background. Flamer-2 reared up, claws flashing in the torchlight. His jaws were open wide and dripped a foamy mixture of blood and saliva, ready to deliver on his promise. All Blaze could do was wait for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a new cry broke the relative quiet. A shape came flying out of the doorway just as Flamer-2 was falling upon Blaze. It was Flamer-8! The two dragons collided chest to chest and Flamer-2 was knocked back. Without the mad drake's oppressive bulk on him, Blaze slowly staggered back to his feer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Flamer-8 had ended up in an extremely vulnerable position in his all out leap to save Blaze. Before Blaze could do anything, Flamer-2 quickly whirled around and gripped Flamer-8 firmly around the neck, tearing through the scales and arteries in the process, and threw him to the ground. Then Flamer-2 reared back and slashed him across the neck, and an obscene amount of blood filled the chamber, and Flamer-8 gurgled, clutching at his throat. \"Shit!\" thought Blaze. \"He must have got him around the neck heart.\" While the neck heart was more a muscular valve than a true heart, injury to it could result in unconsciousness, paralysis, coma or outright death. Flamer-8 wasn't going to be able to fight again for weeks at the very least, most probably ending up castrated, and perhaps even dead. It dismayed Blaze that Flamer-2 had managed to defeat Flamer-8 so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking dragon stepped over the limp body of Flamer-8. His shoulder was streaming blood from where Blaze had bitten him as was his tail. From the look on his face, Flamer-2 was delirious, but no less deadly. \"Ha!! That\u2019s what you get with messing with the King!!\u201d snarled Flamer-2. \u201cGot anymore... Fuck buddies? Eh?\" He breathed. He stumbled a bit over his own claws, yet his vile arrogance had returned, and Blaze was still in worse shape than he. The young drake backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, in his peripheral vision that Blaze saw the watchers. There were a number of Elves, mages and warriors alike, standing in the doorway, with two hulking bronzes behind them. Blaze's mouth dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How long have they been there?!\"</i> his mind shrieked. But they made no move to either assist or hinder. The Kleaves were waiting for this drama to play itself out. He then realized that this entire life and death struggle had possibly been staged from the start, and Blaze\u2019s rage at having been used by the elves in this manner made his fire bladder pulse like never before. It felt hot and overfilled, in fact.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In that moment, looking back at Flamer-2, Blaze realized that he really had to use everything he had to win, even if it meant violating one of the deepest ingrained restrictions that he'd lived with since the time he'd hatched. To a human, the feeling might have been similar flinging off one's clothes in public or punching someone in a fine restaurant, or mutilating a young child and feeding on their flesh; but really it was all of those combined into a vile sense of <i>wrongness</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze felt his neck swell with the liquids being squeezed from the sacks in his chest, he felt a new surge of rampant emotion. Pain, there was in abundance, but there was much more than pain. Flamer-2 needed to pay for making not just his and everyone else's lives miserable. He needed to pay for Flamer-6's life and possibly Flamer-8's now as well. He needed to pay for his macho assertion of dominance over the frightened drakka, <i>he needed to pay for touching Honeysweet!</i> But even more than vengeance, Blaze knew that Flamer-2 had to be put down now or many lives would suffer, not just these drakka and not just the eggs he would sire into slavery. Flamer-2 was a slave to his instincts now; the perfect servant for the Kleaves. Now that the competition was reduced to just he and Flamer-2, would the elves really put down their last fire-drake? The very thought was intolerable. Blaze had to give everything he had to prevent that future. He had to make the Kleaves realize just who they were dealing with, and that they would pause before trying to use him like a tool. If that meant that the Ancestors would forever curse his spirit, so be it! So be it!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze opened his mouth, a raging fire burst forth as he'd never seen before. The flames were dark, beyond the ultraviolet. The tongues licked forth, heavy and thick like snakes and the flame followed behind like water, or rather a tidal wave. The flames raged out of control and seemed to grow a life of their own the moment they left his mouth, scalding his tongue and making Blaze's eyes water. Flamer-2, now truly fearing for his life, tried to make a run for it, but a moment later was completely engulfed behind the expanding torrent of black flames. There was yelling, like Blaze had never heard before, but didn't pity him in the slightest. In fact, he deserved to suffer even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes quite literally glowing red, Blaze directed the terrible black flames toward the ground, because he just couldn't stop it. However, even there the stone shortly began not only to flow, but actually melt into the ground. It was a devouring flame, a terrible, magic inferno and Blaze spent himself utterly, emptying even his prodigious fire-sacs. Blaze collapsed to his knees, struggling to remain conscious. Sometime during that last little while, Flamer-2 had stopped screaming and struggling, but Blaze couldn't concern himself with the drake. He emptied his dinner into the hot magma pit he had just created and then fell over onto his side, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he saw Flamer-2, or what was left of him. The huge dragon\u2019s remains lay not far away, still wreathed in black flames, eating at it like acid. Although at this point there was little left to gnaw on other than his blackened skeleton and the stone on which he rested. The stone under Blaze cracked and the young drake looked in alarm to see the dimly glowing pit he'd made slowly growing, gaining a life of its own. In its center, there were two spots of bright light, like hideous eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone shouted from the doorway. \"Dear Gods! He's created a fire elemental!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a commotion, but Blaze could hardly pay attention. The ground cracked again where he lay and the tiles shifted, angling towards the glowing pit. Blaze looked at the eyes in the center. They were filled with wrath and they filled Blaze with fear, but also a sense of terrible familiarity. They were <i>his</i> eyes, distorted by heat and anger, yes, but his eyes nevertheless. Blaze watched as Flamer-2's skeleton fell in and quickly evaporated in an ugly fume of black smoke. Somehow, the sight of it instantly drained all the anger and rage he\u2019d felt, replaced by emptiness and despair. Blaze slid a little towards a death of his own fabrication, he supposed it was right and proper to be destroyed by something he created, especially when this something was so terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there were claws around him, firm, yet gentle, and a sweet scent in the air. \"Honeysweet?\" Blaze asked blearily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only grinned down at him and dragged him further away from the magma pit. \u201cPlease, I need you\u2026Flame. Let go of your anger, let go of your hate\u2026\u201d she whispered. Her melodic voice was like the song of a siren, easing him away from the abyss. Blaze gave a few shuddering breaths, returning to himself. The fire elemental began to waver, the ground underneath cooling back into rock, the fire being silently re-absorbed into Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision flashed as Blaze staggered, desperately trying to catch his breath. Slowly, heavily, Blaze lifted his head. Honeysweet was at his side, now equally covered in blood and gore as he was. Off to the side, the other drakka pressed themselves against the wall, sidling away from the growing puddle of blood, and from Blaze as well. Oh Ancestors, there was so much blood. Then, he switched his gaze toward the source of the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere lying on the ground was Flamer-8. He was not in good shape to say the least. His neck had been flayed open, and was pouring out an obscene amount of blood. Nonetheless, Blaze staggered to the striken dragons side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like...you\u2019re back to normal eh wonderboy?\" gasped Flamer-8 with wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze coughed out a hollow laugh at the label, before shifting his gaze back toward the wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ancestors\u2026\u201d sighed Blaze with dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess\u2026guess this is it for me isn\u2019t it? Y-you\u2019re the winner now\u2026 You\u2019d\u2026you\u2019d be Lord Flame now, not Flamer-7 anymore,\u201d he commented almost off-handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t say things like that!! Y-you're going to be all right Flamer-8...\" stammered Blaze, \"You're not going to die...you're...you're...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-8 gave him a regretful look, and Blaze realized that there was nothing that could possibly be done to save him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy 8? Why did you do it? You didn\u2019t have to save me. I never asked for you to die on my account. So why?\" he cried quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older drake hacked out a clod of blood. He laboriously shifted his weary gaze, first toward Blaze, and then toward Honeysweet, and grinned contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...it was\u2026 the right thing to do...\" he whispered. With that, Flamer-8 drew his last breath, and quietly died. Blaze shook his head and gently closed Flamer-8s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze silently formed a prayer with his claw, \u201cMay the Ancestors protect your spirit Flamer-8, my friend. May they\u2026may they protect us all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then, that Blaze realized that he had never learned Flamer-8\u2019s real name, and likely never would. Now, all the others were dead, and he was the only one left. He supposed that he should be glad that he\u2019d get to be the breeder male now, but there was only regret. Regret because, had he been able to meet these same dragons, in another place, Flamer-6 and Flamer-8 might have been friends, just like he had been with the other dragons back in the orphanage and Flamer-2 merely a rival instead of a beast that had to be killed. Yet regardless of what he thought of the others, the fact was, their suffering was over, while Blaze had to continue to endure at the wretched hands of the Kleves.. He wished that he could simply curl up and cry to his hearts content, yet found that he could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kleaves and their bronze drake auxiliaries were still standing there, watching with both a sense of fear and awe, yet ready to strike should Blaze get any belligerent ideas. Warily, Blaze gazed at them. He\u2019d given everything he had in defeating Flamer-2, and frankly, he had nothing left to give, physically or emotionally or spiritually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlame!!\u201d shrieked Honeysweet, holding him up with concern. Blaze felt her stagger under his weight, panting, his vision growing dizzier and dizzier. He felt dreadfully weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, he spotted Fang step forward from the crowd of Kleaves, and Blaze watched him approach almost sleepily. Their eyes met, and Blaze felt as if he were being drawn in. For a moment, he thought he felt Fang speak to him through his eyes, promising to save him from himself, to help harness that power he\u2019d unleashed, yet he couldn\u2019t be sure; it might have been a dream. A moment later, Blaze slumped to the ground, spent.</span></div></div>",

He did not find himself surprised to see Fang seated on a stool right in front of the bed of leaves and hay that Blaze was laid upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026so it would seem you are awake, Flamer-7, or should I say\u2026Lord Flame\u2026\u201d he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in the medical ward aren\u2019t I?\u201d said Blaze hazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 In fact you\u2019ve got a whole chamber for your exclusive use,\u201d answered Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026still got my balls right?\u201d he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang tilted his gaze sideways. \u201cObviously.\u201d Blaze ground his groin against the floor, relieved to find that everything was indeed where it was supposed to be. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly got the devils luck. The rest of you seems to have recovered quite adequately as well. You\u2019re all set to undergo all physical activities again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and flexed his wing, the one that had been partially caught by Flamer-2\u2019s flame. It still felt raw, but it was well on its way to a full recovery. Frankly, the only body part he would have even thought about trading for his balls was his wings, for a dragon who could not fly was not truly a dragon anymore. He also had gained a small collection of scars from the fight with Flamer-2, including two furrow marks right underneath his left eyes, but those were the type that drakes and New Alveri would pay many gems for, rather than disfiguring. He supposed that he should feel lucky that he\u2019d come off as likely as he did; one wrong move and he could have easily ended up like Flamer-8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid the doctor do anything to me while I was asleep?\u201d asked Blaze, worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he dropped by every now and again to monitor my treatment of you, but you\u2019d be feeling quite a bit worse and probably be lacking your balls at this moment if he had right?\u201d answered Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point\u2026\u201d replied Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, he won\u2019t be accompanying us when we travel to our new facility\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026that\u2019s too bad\u2026\u201d answered Blaze, not bothering to hide the irony in his voice, \u201cThat also we\u2019ll be moving to another island like they did with the other breeder males right?\u201d answered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d answered Fang, \u201cIts one of the more volcanically active ones, if I\u2019m not mistaken\u2026 Its not as big as the one we\u2019re at nor does it have the same facilities, but you\u2019ll certainly have more room to move around for yourself, and the quarters you and the drakka will be staying in far more accommodating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze huffed, \u201cThey way you say it, one would think we were headed for a vacation on a tropical paradise rather than the next step in the Kleaves mad quest for world domination\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, Fang took the almost defiant statement in stride, \u201cCome now, surely we\u2019re not all just insane caricature\u2019s are we? Besides, there are surely worse arrangements then I\u2019ve described, as you probably know all too well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to let the matter rest, \u201cDon\u2019t need to remind me. Now that Wolf is dead, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to be my handler from now on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct. I might not look like it, but I\u2019m a very competent fire adept, and needless to say I\u2019ve become very intrigued with the level of elemental energy that you\u2019ve displayed, particularly in your fight against Flamer-2. With my help, I\u2019d like to understand more about the ability you possess, and we\u2019ll both learn how to control and harness that power at will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft unsaid, of course, was the likely fact that Fang would most probably want to use that ability in taking over New Alveri. However, since Fang had personally seen it to become Blaze\u2019s handler, he was even more constrained in his ability to attempt escape than he\u2019d been under Wolf. Fang, seemed to fully understand Blaze\u2019s psychology and his thought patterns, plus he was far more competent and cunning than Wolf had been. While Wolf had been boastful and blunt with his discipline, Fang was very unassuming, and it was difficult to fathom exactly what he could be thinking. Thus, if Blaze truly had began to contemplate a serious escape attempt, Fang would definitely be the first to learn of it. However, Blaze didn\u2019t really feel the desire to harm Fang, because the truth was, he had been the only Kleave to actually treat him like a dragon rather than an animal, which counted for a great deal. He also liked to think that Fang was staking a lot of his position within the Kleaves on Blaze and whatever abilities he might have, so there was the potential of using that fact as leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026when exactly are we leaving?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d answered Fang, \u201cMost of the supplies and cargo are already packed. It was mostly waiting for you to come to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, um, before that happens, would it be all right if I could see Honeysweet before we leave?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll certainly have plenty of time to spend with not only her but also all the other drakka when you get to the island, but she\u2019s been really worried about you since your fight. We nearly had to shock her once to keep her away from you so you could get treatment\u201d said Fang, wryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to her right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAside from making her desperate with worry, she\u2019s perfectly fine. Truthfully, I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d ever see an instance where a breeder male managed to gain the genuine affection of one of the harem females, and vice versa. In fact, if you\u2019d like, I can have her called in for you right now,\u201d said Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould\u2026would that be all right?\u201d asked Blaze, his body perking up all too evidently.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, it might be your best chance to get some\u2026practice in before you begin siring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the chamber with a wink, and Blaze felt his hearts pound faster against his chest and neck. A few minutes later, he caught Honeysweet\u2019s unmistakable scent, as she entered the room gracefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoneysweet\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across her jaw, as she strode forward and placed her head against the base of his neck. \u201cFlame\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was\u2026I was really worried\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze felt himself shudder as he held her close. \u201cYup, I\u2019m still in one piece apparently\u2026\u201d he said a bit bashfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you? How have you and the others been holding up?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the fight, our handlers moved us to the fire drake\u2019s quarters. Not to be rude, but it really smells awful in there. Frankly, we\u2019re all looking forward to moving to the island\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot because they can\u2019t wait to want to be with me? I'm hurt!\u201d answered Blaze facetiously. Honeysweet snorted, \u201cWell, Starry admitted that she\u2019d seen far worse, as have Rocket and Cherry. I\u2019m a little bit concerned about Sparkles though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026the shy one right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe got really scared when she saw you fight Flamer-2. I know you wouldn\u2019t have a choice really, when the time comes, but if she gets frightened, at least try to understand\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of worried about that too actually,\u201d sighed Blaze, \u201cBut with the Ancestors as my witnessed, I\u2019ll do whatever I can so that life isn\u2019t quite so miserable and we all have something to look forward to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Honeysweet\u2026 once we get onto that island, and I\u2019m going to have to\u2026you know\u2026with the other drakka\u2026 I\u2026don\u2019t know how things are going to be like between us then. There\u2019s something about you that\u2019s\u2026different from all the others, but before that happens\u2026 I just want it to be about us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoneysweet gave Blaze a rather odd sideways glance. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean to say, \u2018I want to have sex with you before we go to the island?\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat did occur to me more than once, but since you brought the subject up, it doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea does it?\u201d said Blaze, grinning more than a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to agree with the sentiment, yet Blaze sensed that she still wasn\u2019t emotionally comfortable with having to switch to that subject so abruptly. Mating was a very delicate thing, one that required a great deal of trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere I back home in New Alveri, you probably would have slapped me by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019re from New Alveri?\u201d answered Honeysweet. Blaze took a deep breath, staring right into her eyes, \u201cBack then my name\u2026my name was Blaze\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blaze was caught by the shock collar, sending him to the ground. Honeysweet let out a yelp of surprise, lowering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shakily pushed himself back to his feet, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026all right\u2026 I\u2019m fine. Yeah\u2026 that\u2026that\u2019s my name, my real name. I\u2026 lived my life in an orphanage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn orphanage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where hatchlings without clans or parents are cared for, so they don\u2019t have to live on their own. Lady Ramoth, our caregiver, had me do various odd jobs to help the humanoids in the merchant district. Life\u2026wasn\u2019t easy, but I had friends, people who cared about me\u2026 Then, I got captured, and you know the story from there. What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I lived with my clan, with mother, father my sisters and cousins, my name was Ember\u2026\u201d A moment later, she too was seized by her shock collar. Yet Blaze rushed forward to catch her, holding her close so she wouldn\u2019t collapse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all right\u2026Ember?\u201d asked Blaze. He\u2019d said her name before he could contemplate whether saying her real name might shock him, and was pleasantly surprised to find it did not. Ember nodded shakily, and Blaze held her close and protectively, wanting to make her feel safe. He felt much better now that he had shared his story with her, and vice-versa, and seemed much more willing to share now that she knew his real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAncestors you are so beautiful,\u201d he groaned fondly. Honeysweet purred, her tail swaying slightly back and forth. Blaze couldn\u2019t help but inhale her scent, making his entire body shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh babe, I want you so badly...\u201d Ember let out a slight and extremely cute yelp of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all right with you of course\u2026\u201d amended Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to think about it for a moment, before twining her tail with him, purring, \u201cYes, I\u2019d\u2026I\u2019d like that very much Blaze\u2026\u201d    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could hardly believe his ears, and could not help but feel very worthy of himself. Despite all the cruelty and the pain, the humiliation and experimentation, having the adoration of this beautiful young drakka, ready and willing to mate with him, made all that suffering worth it. Though this was but the fourth time he\u2019d ever seen her, Blaze already felt that if he ever managed to escape the Kleaves, that he would be content to spend the rest of his life with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now was the time of the moment of truth. She stared back at him with wide eyes, struggling to keep her breath under control as she gingerly lifted her tail. Blaze lowered his head and sniffed at her wet, open pussy, the scent driving him crazy. Ancient instincts arose within Blaze. He\u2019d defeated his male rival, and now he would take his rightful prize, mounting her from behind. It wasn\u2019t quite taking her to the sky, but it nonetheless was a surprisingly comfortable position, and he was also quite surprised at just how flexible the tail joints of drakka were. For a good long moment, Blaze gazed down to admire her body, and the bright desire in her eyes as she gazed back at him. Blaze grinned back devilishly at her as he aimed his penis at her entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAre you ready Ember?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake me Blaze. Take me as your own\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze took a deep breath, and then pushed his length forward into her, and Ember let out a gasp of surprise. Given that it was the first time for both of them, their lovemaking was rather awkward at first. It took a bit of fumbling, but eventually they were able to find a rhythm they both found comfortable, and things really took off from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze felt his confidence surge as Ember\u2019s moans intensified, her slender body moving in time with. Together, they ascended higher and higher, until finally Blaze unfurled his wings and let out a triumphant roar as he thrust forward as far as he could and exploded within her with several powerful bursts, Ember singing in tune beneath him. At that moment, Blaze felt like the King of all of Nod, no, greater than Gyramond himself!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he consciously remembered was that he was laying upon his belly with a huge smile on his jaw. He shifted his gaze toward Ember, holding heragainst him possessively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did I meet your expectations?\u201d asked Blaze with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber only purred contentedly in response, and Blaze felt like Gyramond himself. Yet in the back of his mind, he knew that some of his pride was illusory. He and Ember were both prisoners of the Kleaves, subject to their every whim. Tomorrow, he might find Ember gone; never to be seen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeday\u2026Ember, we\u2019ll get out of this place, and we\u2019ll take off together in the sky. You can meet all my old friends in New Alveri, and I can meet all yours\u2026\u201d Blaze vowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled longingly, \u201cYes\u2026that would be very wonderful\u2026Blaze. Won\u2019t father, mother and my dear sister be surprised when I return with you by my side hmmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully, he won\u2019t try to flame my balls off. Or maybe he\u2019ll be so impressed that he\u2019ll ask me to court all the other females in your clan as well\u2026 I heard polygamy was legal amongst the clans\u2026\u201d he teased, unable to help but tease her with a lick in the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber stuck out her tongue. \u201cSorry,\u201d Blaze apologized, not really sounding sorry at all, \u201cThat came out wrong\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be angrier if not for the fact he probably would ask such a thing\u2026\u201d snorted Ember.  \u201cStrange how these things work hmmm? I actually left my clan because he wanted to pair me up with a thin male twice my age, and he warned me that if I did, I could end up being kidnapped or raped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to say it, but\u2026he certainly was right on one account\u2026 Yet think of it this way, if we hadn\u2019t been caught, then we probably would never have met each other. I\u2019d probably still be a frightened runt, not really amounting to anything and living a dull life. Not that I think its fun getting tortured or having the pole shoved up your ass, but its more like seeing the positives that came out of this whole mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young drakes continued to gaze at each other, absorbed in each others presence. \u201cYou know\u2026Ember, I still don\u2019t think we should use our real names unless we\u2019re by ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right about that\u2026Lord Flame\u2026\u201d answered Ember, her voice much more business like now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlame would be all right. Besides, I\u2019ve got to honestly admit that Honeysweet is a cute name\u2026\u201d teased Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber/Honeysweet sniffed, playfully smacking Blaze with his wing. They spent the rest of that day together, in that little room, talking and joking with one another. Had it not been for the guards watching from outside the room, the rows of chained trolls marching just outside, and the faint screams of pain from Dr. Moridin\u2019s room just down the hall, one would have almost thought they were talking on the streets of New Alveri again, like a regular young adolescent couple.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yesterday had been, quite frankly and more than a little ironically, Blaze\u2019s best day ever. Losing ones virginity was a giant milestone for any male drake, and he\u2019d done it with the drakka he dreamed of doing it with. Not just once. After that first time, they\u2019d talked for a while longer, learning about each other and sharing secrets and when night came both had found that they still had quite a bit of energy to burn, so they\u2019d licked and moaned and groped and fucked non-stop until they had almost quite literally collapsed from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Fang came to fetch for him that morning, he\u2019d found the two young dragons sprawled against each other. Blaze didn\u2019t bother to conceal himself from the handler, who couldn\u2019t help but be also stare at Blaze\u2019s groin for a moment. Perhaps he was jealous at the comparative size difference? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Fang. As it turns out, I seemed to have taken your advice\u2026\u201d said Blaze, not bother to conceal his wide grin, while at the same time, rubbing his wing along Ember\u2019s form, who purred in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can definitely see that for myself. Anyhow, I hate to be a third wheel, but I\u2019m going to have to ask you put your nethers back where they belong, step away from the female and follow me to the docks,\u201d cried Fang with an amused grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill we be coming on the same boat?\u201d asked Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a boat large enough for you two lovebirds while also carrying a full load of supplies. Even if we did, we\u2019d rather not have two horny dragons shaking up the boat while its sailing,\u201d answered Fang. Blaze shifted his gaze, while Ember swished her tail slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right then, I\u2019m coming\u2026\u201d said Blaze, allowing himself to be harnessed. Fang took a seat upon Blaze\u2019s withers, seemingly making himself at home. He shifted his gaze back to Ember and gave her an encouraging nod. Ember\u2019s handler came into the room right afterwards. She was a female elf, Blaze observed, and was harnessed in a similar way as Blaze had been, and was glad to see that the staff that handled her was considerably much gentler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a dragon would never express pride in having a humanoid ride them like a beast of burden, it sure beat being dragged in a cage. As he headed down from the mountain, Blaze didn\u2019t even bother to hide the confident spring in his step, nor that smug grin on his face, puffing his chest outwards and holding his head up a bit higher than he usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, her handler led Ember, who while not strutting like Blaze was, nonetheless was in high spirits. He remembered how the bronze drakka had looked when Lord Azimoth had led them away, with heads down and lifeless eyes; nothing of the sort with Ember, and hopefully, the other fire drakka as well. Blaze could feel her eyes upon him the entire way, and every so often, he would shift his gaze backwards to try and catch her gazing at him. She blushed, very deeply, clearing remembering that night, not so subtly hinting that she\u2019d like to do it again sometime, and ideally sometime soon. His only concern was that he\u2019d gone at it so hard and passionately with Ember, when the time came that he had to mate with the rest of the harem, he\u2019d feel like he was cheating on her. Then again, there were an untold number of former drakes who would have loved to have Blaze\u2019s dilemma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then switched his gaze back toward Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me asking Fang, but what exactly were you doing while we were\u2026um going at it?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little of this, and a little of that. Mostly administrative stuff\u2026\u201d answered Fang, vaguely as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit more specific?\u201d wondered Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled his enigmatic grin of his, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, in exchange for you telling me more details about what went on between the two of you yesterday\u2026\u201d Blaze realized he was asking for more than just the juicy details, but rather the personal nature of the conversation that he and Ember had shared. While Fang was not bad as far as Kleaves went, Blaze didn\u2019t feel the need to give Fang any personal information that could be used as leverage against not only him but also Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze arrived at the docks, three large state of the art sailing ships were moored. The crew, both human sailors and troll slaves, were busy stacking supplies onto the ship. As Blaze was walking the plank, he passed by a large cage, and within it laid a dragon he did not expect to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlamer-6? You\u2019re alive!!\u201d said Blaze, his wings nearly unfurling in surprise. His body was heavily bandaged, and looked even thinner and more feeble than ever. More dismayingly but not surprisingly, Flamer-6\u2019s scent had weakened to an inoffensive odor, which meant they had neutered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026that\u2026does seem to be the case doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Flamer-6, sounding far from happy that he still was. Blaze curved his gaze back toward Fang, \u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a minute to speak with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 you might as well catch up\u2026\u201d answered Fang. Frankly, Blaze suspected that Fang wanted to observe so that he could learn more about the dragon he held ownership over. Ember\u2019s handler seemed to share that sentiment as well, and in fact appeared to take up a light conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 then took a sniff. \u201cIt would seem you have really enjoyed your first day as breeder male\u2026Lord Flame\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dWell, it wasn\u2019t bad\u2026\u201d shrugged Blaze, trying to make a conscious effort not to make Flamer-6 feel too bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 snorted, \u201cB-bet you fucked her all night\u2026 Can see why you\u2019d have the hots for a drakka like her, it was\u2026Sweet\u2026sweet something?\u201d inquired Flamer-6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoneysweet,\u201d corrected Ember, trying to be encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026I always thought you were a bit on the tall side for me. Personally, I liked the shy, tittering one\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d cried Ember, surprised, \u201cYou should have said something to Sparkles while you were there then. She probably wouldn\u2019t have been as afraid of males otherwise\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but not that it matters now,\u201d he sighed. \u201cStill, better she ended up with you\u2026 Lord Flame. I\u2019m guessing that means Flamer-2 got what he deserved right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you still call me Flamer-7, or Flame is fine. As for Flamer-2, the powers below are taking him up the ass with a thorny, flaming pole really slow and agonizingly,\u201d growled Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201d agreed Flamer-6. While Blaze was glad Flamer-2 was suffering in hell where he belonged, it didn\u2019t gain favor with the Ancestors to gloat too much on misfortune of even the most evil, condemned souls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lucked out actually. Flamer-8 took a blow that would have killed me. He\u2019s\u2026with the Ancestors now. Never learned his real name,\u201d Blaze said with genuine regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts just as well for Flamer-8. He died a drake\u2026and not\u2026\u201d Flamer-6 averted his gaze downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on 6, don\u2019t say things like that!! I know it\u2019s easy for me to say because it didn\u2019t happen to me, but I don\u2019t want you thinking \u2018woe is me\u2019. I don\u2019t want you to become all dull and lifeless like Flamer-1 is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 puffed. \u201cI\u2019m not that far gone, not yet anyhow. Apparently, the Kleaves still have a marginal use for me. I am designated to be a \u2018harem guard\u2019 it would seem, since I\u2019m physically incapable of performing any combat duties anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t know what to feel at that. It would feel very awkward to have Flamer-6 outside the room while he was fucking Ember.  Still it was reassuring to have another drake, well, he wasn\u2019t quite one now, that he knew and could reasonably hope to trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I think about it, that works out pretty well. You\u2019re a really smart drake six and you know how to get stuff done, to keep track of things. I\u2019d love to have an exercise machine like the one you built back in our old lair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I suppose that beats being cut up for parts\u2026\u201d he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Fang tugged on Blaze\u2019s reins. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be boarding ship now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026catch you later Flamer-6,\u201d said Blaze, looking over his shoulder with a friendly nod. He then switched his gaze toward Ember and gave her a fond growl, and she answered back with a purr of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the cargo hold, it wasn\u2019t as smelly or dirty as it was like last time. In fact, they didn\u2019t even chain him up as expected. The ship did have an anti-fire spell upon it, but other than that he felt more like a passenger than cargo. Fang was up on deck, directing the sailor crews. Blaze grunted; the most trying portion of his time with the Kleaves had passed, and things actually were turning out for the better now.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This ship ride was not nearly so terrible as the months long journey Blaze had nearly died on coming from the main port city of the Alverian Empire. However, Blaze still found the ship's hold uncomfortably cramped. The close quarters only served to remind Blaze of his great size. It was hard to believe that at roughly a half-century-old, he was already at his full adult size... and absolutely ripped to boot. He already weighed perhaps half again as much as he would have in adulthood without modification, if Blaze's memory of his old stringy self were anything to go on. \"And I'm not done yet...\" thought Blaze unsurely as he rested, coiled in the gently rocking bowls of the large flagship. \"Soon I'll be as large as Honeysweet... perhaps larger still. Ancestors, I hope it stops...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, after all his trials had only a small portion of hope left, but Dr. Moridin had said that the process would take roughly a year and in just 60 days or so, that time will have passed. \"Ancestors, has it been that long already?\" He wondered dejectedly. Despite being a dragon and thus having a millennial lifespan (if he was lucky), and having a dragon's sense of time, his stint with the Kleaves had seemed both tortuously long and incredibly brief. Blaze was content only that he was on his way from the place of his torment, even if he was simply passing from one jail cell to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had few visitors, other than to give him food and water. The sailors seemed to recognize that Blaze, despite being a dragon under the Kleaves control, had earned some status in the ranks as breeder male and thus might be less inhibited from eating low ranking tormentors. Blaze was more than fine with that; and in fact he actually contemplated relieving one of the sailors of their foot like Jinx had done (briefly, he wondered what had become of Jinx, if he was now a breeder male like himself now, or was one of the many eunuchs) if one got too uppity. At the same time, Blaze already had too many bad memories of having the pole shoved up his butt, and he didn't feel the need to get a reminder of that horrible feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Blaze occupied himself with thoughts of New Alveri and the orphanage, lest the memories fail him and he fall into darkness. One scene from Blaze's past that he went over time and again, replaying the sequence of events in his mind, was that day of the attack. Darzhja had been there, her face fearful and yet bold and serious at the same time. She'd known what she was doing, almost more than Kaj who himself was a member of the city guard. She hadn't hesitated to leap into danger when Blaze had reported what had happened to Iskeirka. He'd seen the building collapse on her himself and yet she didn't hesitate... He used to be such a pussy, a useless coward that would sooner leave one of his close friends to die than try and do anything to help. He\u2019d instead tried to save his own hide, and in the end, he hadn't even accomplished that. Perhaps getting captured was a just reward for his cowardice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze rested his chin on his paws and sighed, his tail curling up around his jaw. His fire bladder pulsed. For amusement, Blaze coughed a small fireball out onto the wood. The fire played on the surface of the wood, which was protected by a rather complicated enchantment. Blaze watched the tort burn and sizzle on the wood, skimming along its surface like a water droplet on a hot pan until it used up its fuel and went out. After that he occupied himself with picking the dried blood out from under his claws, and after that, he scoured his teeth with sand and water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a three-day journey, all told and by the end of it, Blaze was eager to be out. He hadn't once been able to stretch his wings during the trip. In fact, the upper decks had to be disassembled just to let him out. Blaze groaned when the sunlight finally stabbed down to meet him. There was one thing on his mind: Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast young drake\" came a cool collected voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill squinting in the light, as the sailors labored to move the planks constituting the decks above, Blaze couldn't see Fang at all until he stepped into a patch of sunlight. He was wearing a rather ostentatious crimson robe with gold dragons emblazoned on his shoulders and chest. The young elf smelled quite content with himself. \"What? Are you afraid that I'll burst through this planks and make a run for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Fang, Blaze had already considered the ploy in his head and rejected it for one simple reason: Blaze was not going to leave the Kleaves without Ember. But Fang just chortled. \"Nothing of the sort. However,\" and now the elf stepped forward and placed a cool hand on Blaze's foreleg. \"There is a sense of propriety which must be maintained here. This is the first time the inhabitants of the colony will see you, the reason why they are all here. There will be appearances to maintain. You are not Flamer-7 anymore. You are Lord Flame now, the perfect Fire-drake...\" he paused, ever so slightly and added, \"And I am your master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked down at the young elf and snorted. \"So your true colors are finally coming out then? I'm to be your slave, after all of that help you gave me back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grinned and crossed his arms, leaning his hip on Blaze's leg as he did so. \"How can you be sure these are my true colors? Or that those were my true colors, for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large dragon shook his head slightly. More beams of light pierced the gloom in the hold of the ship from above. \"I'm not sure about anything with you, to be quite honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just smirked affably, like always. \"Maybe that's how I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" said Blaze dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf waved a loose-sleeved arm. \"Enough posturing. I just came down here to tell you about what to expect from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" said Blaze, tilting his massive head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place... It's little more than a fort at the moment and my father is expecting us to turn it into a self-sufficient colony within three years. In addition, he'll be expecting clutches of fire drakes in the next five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze clutched his forepaws and shifted his wings, causing Fang to back away a few steps. \"Five years?! That's impossible! They won't have even left the nest yet, never mind have their wings emerge... Not that you'll ever set your filthy hands on them!\" Blaze growled. Of course, Blaze should have seen this coming, but he nonetheless his instincts drove him to irrational rage. It was one thing to torture him, or even to hurt Honeysweet, but for the Kleaves to unleash their diabolical plan on his little ones, unforgivable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tight space, but Blaze snaked his head forward towards Fang, prepared to end him right then and there. Fang, however, seemed well prepared for a violent reaction. Without even flinching, he reached into his sleeve and withdrew some powder. Quick as a flash, he spread it on the ground before him and there sprang a wall of fire, which towered in front of Blaze's nose. The fire drake recoiled, the wall was radiating heat, though his scales were coping; he was forced to turn his face away where the scales were thinnest, however. The flames seemed weird, much more solid looking than usual. It was obviously enchanted fire and Blaze had no fancy to try sticking his claws through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the heat the Blaze felt, Fang seemed quite comfortable behind his wall. His right hand was twisted in an arcane gesture as he maintained the spell. \"Blaze of New Alveri!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe madness of Blaze's first reaction faded quickly, especially with that horrible fire right in his face. Yet more than that there was the fact that Fang had spoken Blaze\u2019s real name; and him having that knowledge was a greater deterrent than any spell or restraining device the Kleaves could devise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that this is hard for you, and your instincts would drive you to protect your young. Yet you must understand your position in all of this. Will resisting now get you any closer to freedom? Will resisting now, protect Honeysweet or anybody else you care about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted a claw to better shield himself from the heat as his face grew uncomfortably warm. However, Blaze was sharper than most and he recognized the play in Fang's words. \"Resisting now? So you\u2019re saying that I\u2019d have to wait for the right moment might be better?\" Blaze asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled, or whatever it is that elves and humans call \"growling,\" \"I said nothing of the sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blaze wasn't through. \"You also mentioned your father... Who is he? He must pretty high up if he really organized all of this...\" Blaze hesitated and decided to follow through on his train of thought, \"Might he even be the leader of the Kleave Order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang relaxed his hand and the tall flames immediately vanished. Blaze lowered his paw and made no action to resume aggressions. Oblivious to the small confrontation occurring below, sailors were calling to each other as they began lifting the last segment of deck from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026why yes he is,\u201d said Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze couldn\u2019t tell if he said that in a way to threaten him, or if it hinted some sort of conflict between the two. Like all things, perhaps it was both. There was a chance that he could be bluffing just to unsettle Blaze, yet the narrowing of his gaze and the sharp, dangerous conviction in which he spoke said otherwise. \u201cFunny that you should mention that...Blaze... you are too clever by half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment,\" answered Blaze, trying to maintain composure, yet the young drake couldn\u2019t help but feel the chill down his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t get too clever drake. You know the old saying, what excessive curiosity killed. I\u2019d like to imagine that I\u2019ve been quite lenient and generous with you, Flame, and to be honest I\u2019d like to keep things that way. Yet if that\u2019s not getting the necessary results; that can change\u2026\u201d he finished with a low growl, and that conversation instantly died right then and there. Now, Blaze saw the reflection of the father, of the man who had started this operation and had imprisoned so many young dragons and the ruthless ambition to see his will be done. It explained in one sense why Fang was so talented, so clever, able to read people so easily, if he\u2019d gotten his tutelage from the man himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf who ran this, Lord Ingrid, was an undeniably evil humanoid, yet to have run such an operation required unparalleled intelligence and will, and perhaps more ominously, and if the Fang was indeed a reflection of the father, then the leaders most potent ability was not necessarily being adept with magic, of which he undoubtedly was, but an ability to convince a mass following of people into his order, to make the irrational and immoral sound like the most perfectly natural thing in the world. Regardless, Blaze would have to re-evaluate how he approached Fang, and for better and for worse, he felt in his hearts that he was stuck with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if they\u2019d never had this hostile conversation, the young elf grabbed the heavy leather saddle from where it hung on the wall. He handled it with surprising grace despite its obvious weight. Too intrigued to resist, Blaze lowered his head so that Fang could throw the padded thing over the base of his neck. As Fang was fastening the straps, he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to have a long conversation about how things are going to be handled on the island.\" He yanked a belt until it was snug around Blaze's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" grunted Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... We are going to have to get bigger saddle, you are already too thick for this one it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that some subtle way of saying that I have to lose weight?\" Blaze mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by half. Dr. Moridin will be pleased when he sees your full size... as will my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned but didn't speak. He knew Fang well enough now to see that the young elf was done answering questions. Then, once again, he quickly switched from his menacing tone to his usual upbeat one, \"Once we get off the ship, the first thing you will have to do is unload her hold. Then you can assist with unloading the other two ships and carrying the supplies to Fort Carmile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was about to say, \"Lovely, I get to be ship crane and draft horse in one day.\" but what actually came out of his mouth was: \"Is Honeysweet going to be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have known that he already knew the answer, but Fang obliged the longing drake. \"Yes, she will be here, as well as your new harem guard, that 'Six' if I recall. Though, honestly, I don't know how much use such a dragon is going to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned, and grunted, \"You'd be surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be at that, I will judge his usefulness by his actions\" admitted Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the last section of deck was lifted away and Blaze crawled stiffly out of the hold of the ship. He used forepaws and wing talons to grip the decks and placed his feet carefully to minimize the rocking of the vessel. He crawled out into the sunlight and beheld a marvelous vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were anchored about half a dragon-length off from the shore of the island. A tall craggy mountain rose in the distance, all covered with green. White vapor rose from its peak. The ship was nestled in a narrow cove surrounded by tall rocky cliffs. Just ahead there was a small pier serviced by a simple wooden elevator supported by the cliff above. Blaze could see why now he was expected to assist in unloading the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still building the dragon tower, or so I'm told,\" said Fang in Blaze's ear as he stood up in the gently rocking boat. \"We'll be receiving most of our supplies by air in the future, God willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God?\" thought Blaze confusedly, but had little time to dwell on the odd thing Fang had said, nor did he think it the appropriate time to emphasize his reverence for the Ancestors. The elf immediately had Blaze arrange himself in the hold so that some of the sailors could hitch some big leather satchels to the dragon's underbelly. They were quite afraid to get near Blaze at first, especially since now he was spread through all the decks in the middle of the ship, but after the Bosun whipped a man into a bloody heap, the rest fell in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a burden, but Blaze managed to extricate himself from the ship, he bent his knees in preparation to lift himself into the air. \"Careful with the pier,\" said Fang, \"It won't support your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze absorbed the fact silently as he spread his wings. The phalanges of his limbs gripping the heavy, moist air of the cove, Blaze lifted himself as gently into the air as he could. The boat made big ripples in the water, inadvertently causing a few of the workers to lose their balance and fall into the water, as he flew up and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the heavy weight dragging on his belly could not damage the natural splendor of the island when Blaze crested the sea cliffs. The place was certainly volcanic! Blaze could feel in the air currents that there were some major hotspots around here. The greenery spread out below, as he gained altitude, flapping tirelessly up into the atmosphere, was dense and tropical. Unlike the main island, there were neither fields nor pastures... not yet anyways. In fact, if Blaze was not sure otherwise, the place almost looked uninhabited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang bewitched his hand and spoke into it so Blaze could hear his little voice over the wind. \"If you want a den, you are going to have to dig for it. You'll be sleeping outside or under a pavilion until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just grinned. \"Sleeping outside!\" The idea sounded like wish come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang directed Blaze to the fort. Even from a distance, Blaze wasn't impressed. The place looked like it hadn't existed for more than a year. A wooden palisade penned in a few buildings and a small winding trail was cut through the jungle down to the small pier and that was about it. Blaze grunted and spoke back to Fang. \"This is it?\" he scoffed. \"What exactly is supposed to keep me and Honeysweet from just flying away from this pile of sticks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn't see it, but he sensed Fang grinning behind him. \"All is not that meets the eye.\" said the elf. \"Your collar still works, remember and they have the means for recharging and maintaining them down there. In addition to that, there are many other safeguards in place for keeping dragons around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Blaze shrewdly over the wind. \"And what means might those be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I told you what those were, that would rather defeat the purpose now would it?\u201d answered Fang. Blaze did not pretend for a moment that Fang did not have the means to make good on his threat. \u201cRight now, though, we are going to meet the colonists and your subjects- under me as well.\" Blaze felt Fang's hand on his neck, rubbing the scales fondly, \"Do try to look regal won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to imagine there's as large a stick up my butt as Lord Azimoth.\" said Blaze. That one actually earned a chuckle from Fang as they circled lower over the small settlement. When they landed...</span></div></div>",

There did not appear to be too much development as of yet.  Most of the buildings inside the palisade were wooden and crude at that.  They were so ramshackle, in fact that Blaze feared that the breeze of his passage might be enough to collapse some of them.  But there were already the foundations for a larger settlement in place\u2026 literally.  Not one of the stone buildings were complete, but there were several spread out around the village.  The most conspicuous of these was the large circular foundation located just outside the village.  Cranes hovered over that one and it looked like a lot of construction had already gone into it.  Blaze assumed this was the dragon tower Fang had mentioned.  The young drake tried to imagine most of the trade of the island one day passing through that pile of square stones, but failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, a gaggle of humans gawked up at him, actually pointing at him and many with open mouthed wonder\u2026 or was it terror?  Their wide-eyed stares annoyed Blaze.  In New Alveri, one did not bat an eye at a dragon coming in for a landing and yet these wretches were gathering as if for a freakshow.  Blaze felt dreadfully conspicuous, but also angry that these unlearned Kleaves should gape at him so.  Especially when their unwashed stink rose even to Blaze\u2019s considerable height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only place suitable in the village for landing was the very center which was empty save for a single tall obelisk of unknown purpose.  Blaze angled himself as steeply as he thought was safe.  He wanted to reach the square before it became too clogged with unwitting bystanders.  The design of the village already irked the large drake.  None of the streets were wide enough for a dragon to pass save the main one leading to the southern gate.  That was one of the first things that Blaze intended on mentioning to Fang when they had some time alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlighting a little heavily, Blaze bounced a bit and wound up accidently crushing part of a wagon with his right hindfoot.  He paid it about as much mind as a human would stepping on a stray branch; if anything, it was their fault for forcing him to land in such cramped conditions.  Blaze glanced at the pale stone obelisk which was the sole decoration of the sparten village.  Fang straightened himself up in his saddle at the base of Blaze\u2019s neck.  Remembering Fang\u2019s words, Blaze lifted his head and tried to imagine himself \u201cregal.\u201d  It wasn\u2019t too difficult, really, considering the surroundings.  When Blaze lifted his head, he realized that he could see over most of the single story buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s very first coherant thought about the settlement after taking it all in was, <i>\u201cWhat a dump.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang seemed on an almost identical wavelength.  Despite being behind him, he could sense Fang\u2019s obvious dismay. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to make a city in five years with this?\u201d he whispered in Blaze\u2019s ear as the people gathered.  Blaze said nothing.  Unlike the elf, it was difficult making his voice inconspicuous and already the square was filling with the town\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes, what seemed to be the entire population of the settlement had been gathered, only about a few hundred at the most; though it was always a little hard to tell with humanoids.  Some of the colonists were dressed differently and some had armor on, indicative of the guards Blaze remembered from the main island.  Most, however, were dressed in simple linens and hemp; perhaps woven right here on the island.  Now that he was on the ground with them, though still towering over their small formed with his many horned head, the staring was even more intense.  A hushed silence pervaded the square where the colonists stood just beyond the obelisk at the center.  The entire crowd flinched when he moved towards them; many seemed on the verge of panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned disdainfully as the colonists fixed upon him with fear and awe in their ignorant eyes.   One would think they\u2019d never seen a dragon before!  And yet\u2026 as the moments lengthened and Fang did not speak - Surely no one expected Blaze to speak - Blaze began to wonder if indeed any of these backward humanoids had indeed seen a dragon before.  The young drake tasted the air with his tongue, the crowd reeked of ignorance and rural superstition, and for a young drake used to interacting with the confident citizenry of New Alveri, he felt more than a little contempt. Where they had come from, Blaze couldn\u2019t know, but he thought they were refugees, vagabonds, bumpkins and perhaps other dregs of society.  Did they know about the shining jewel that was New Alveri?  Did they even know who it was they were working for?  From the looks on their dull, dirty faces, Blaze doubted it.  Whatever circumstances had led them here, these people had no idea of what they were caught in the middle of, surely if the mere sight of a dragon could inspire such terrible, openmouthed awe. These people were prisoners in the truest sense of the word, so much so that they weren\u2019t even aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the tension broke on their side.  In the rabble, a man rose a walking stick over his head and cried in barely coherent Common, \u201cItsa winged Demon!  Ye Gods protect us from it!!\u201d Blaze heard Fang let out an audible sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlame, if you would please, give them a roar to get their attention\u2026\u201d commanded Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young drake could see the wisdom in such an order.  Before his slit eyes, the panic seemed to spread outward from the first addled man.  Blaze raised his head into the air and let out a roar that sent birds flying from beyond the palisade. Immediately, the panicking townsfolk froze to a shocked silence.  Somewhere a child began sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated upon Blaze, Fang finally began to deliver his speech. The adolescent dragon turned slightly so that the small elf on his back was more visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, colonists of Fort Carmile. I am Lord Fang, and from henceforth I am the ruler of this island.  For those who decide to support me and heed the commands of their new ruler, I promise prosperity and wealth. For those who decide to oppose me or subvert my rule in any way:\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering directly, Fang conjured up a ball of fire in his hands and launched it straight up into the air whereupon it burst into a great many burning stars.  Seeing the effect, Blaze decided to snort some smoke from his nostrils and sink his claws into the earth for a bit of extra emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing more really needed to be said after that.  Even the arms-men in Kleave-garb seemed impressed by Fang\u2019s mastery of fire.  As for the townsfolk, a man appearing out of the sky on the back of a fire-breathing dragon seemed a qualification for godhood really.  With disgust, Blaze watched those nearest him get on their knees and bow before Fang in a most servile manner, lowering their heads all the way to the dirt.  Worse, they made their children practice the kowtow as well!  Any respect Blaze might have had for these people was dead before they\u2019d spoken a word.  Citizens from New Alveri would have never behaved in such a degrading manner.  Blaze was also a little frightened at the way Fang seemed to glow in the light of their submission as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Fang\u2019s little speech, the settlers drifted back to their chores, and those that lingered were helped along by men with swords.  Fang descended from Blaze\u2019s saddle with usual elvish grace and met with a man, who unlike the other armed guards had a red handprint on his left shoulder.  The man saluted Fang and waited to be addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf spoke while keeping his hands clasped inside his overlarge sleeves.  \u201cAm I speaking to Cheif Armsman Seymor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man deeply inclined his head and placed his closed fist on his heart again.  \u201cYou are, Master Fang.  We\u2019ve been expecting you.  Granted, we thought we would have a little more time before you arrived with the fire dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were some unexpected\u2026 developments on the mainland, Sergent, that need not concern you.\u201d  The man looking at the elf swallowed, but bravely held his pose.  Fang continued, \u201cI need to be briefed on the status of the colony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have our book of records and our head masons on standby, my lord.  It will only take a few minutes to gather them.\u201d  Said Seymor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a slippery voice, Fang said, \u201cSee that you do.\u201d  The man frowned and bowed again taking his leave.  Quickly, he sent out half a dozen men to different locations before returning to the young elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you will follow me, Master Fang, we can hold conference in your new temporary quarters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang said nothing, but headed inside a small wooden building that smelled of lantern oil and pig grease, much like the other shacks.  While the townspeople had been easily impressed with Blaze, the Kleave guards eyed him warily,  and he noticed that the two white shouldered corporals kept special pendants close at hand; Blaze was not at all sure what they would do, but he had no interest in finding out.  He curled up in the square, resting his head on the ground but tilted towards the building into which Fang had dissapeared in hopes of listening in on what Fang had to say with the local town prefecture.  The details quickly bored the young dragon, however as the humans started off with over a half hour of niceties and gratifying remarks about their new lord and master, Fang.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During this time, Blaze was interrupted in his eavesdropping when a couple of armed men poked him in the shoulder with the tips of their long pikes. Blaze lifted his head and growled softly, but a corporal waved his pendant threatening. \u201cMove, beast. We need\u2019ta get them bags offa yer gut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other corporal punched his comrade in the arm. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking to it for? Just zap it. That oughta get\u2019it roll over quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming very aware of the inhibitor collar around his neck again, Blaze rolled over onto his flank before another word could be spoken. In truth, he\u2019d forgotten about the heavy bundles affixed to his underbelly. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t be blamed if anything were slightly squashed. Predictably, the guards didn\u2019t lift a finger, but instead got some frightened villagers to undo the straps and haul off the burden. Everything about the way they did it was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, the men were almost pissing their trousers getting this close to Blaze; He knew because he could smell it. Only sharpened steel could motivate them to get near. Then, instead of opening the vast leather satchels and unloading them, they seemed intent on unbuckling the whole thing from Blaze; which they hadn\u2019t the least idea how to do. They just started undoing buckles every which way, and of course, that led to something pulling or pinching the large dragon. Twice all of the men scattered when Blaze shifted his weight due to the bungling and twice the townsfolk were re-gathered at sword point to continue. But Blaze remained still and placid and escaped getting shocked and that was all that really mattered. The village idiots would up dragging the entire mess of leather, belts and buckles a short distance away before they began to unload it right in front of Blaze. The dragon let out an excruciating sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the house, Blaze was only mildly consoled with finally listening in on what Fang was talking about. Rather than some grand, dragon related schemes, however, the adolescent drake was met only with a long list of proposals and locations on maps he obviously couldn\u2019t see. Basically, Fang had inquired about the progress of the landing platform, mineral surveys for potential mining operations, land clearance proposals, and other projects aimed at expanding the settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, a rather weary Fang exited the small house and re-mounted Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to keep you waiting Flame\u2026\u201d apologized Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze merely harrumphed. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t have me standing watch like this too often. This place is quite claustrophobic\u2026\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, were you expecting this to be New Alveri?\u201d snorted Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019d rather be hanging out with trolls than with these ignorant colonists. Frankly, the less I have to do with them, the happier I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d replied Blaze. He lifted his head and smelled the breeze \u201cSo where are we off to now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first day on the island was both busy and rather lonely for Blaze. It was simply the first time in his life that he didn\u2019t have any other dragons around; even in the ships hold, there had been Jinx. The lack of familiar dragon-smell in the environment was slightly disconcerting, but Fang kept his charge busy, as if sensing his malaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could unload supplies from the ship ten times faster than the sailors could using the dinky little elevator. However, hauling supplies up fifty-foot cliffs with nothing more substantial to grab onto than the air itself was back breaking labor in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the late afternoon, Blaze found himself famished. He hadn\u2019t eaten anything since he had arrived upon the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a break Flame?\u201d said Fang, noticing Blaze\u2019s weariness. Left unsaid was the fact that Fang looked as if he could use a break as well. Despite riding upon Blaze, Fang hadn\u2019t been idle, using his magic to lift boxes out of the boat, while having to yell profusely at the workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please!!\u201d answered Blaze, almost desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for you, there\u2019s no shortage of wild animals to be found. According to my map, there should be a small stream about a half mile north from here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang proved to be correct in his assertion, as Blaze spotted a gathering of water buffalo around a small pond. Mouth watering, Blaze quickly descended and pounced on a tasty looking water buffalo - Fang still attached to his back -and then setting down next to the stream. Back when he\u2019d lived in New Alveri, where one bought meat at the market, Blaze had very few opportunities to actually hunt for the first half-century of life, much less hunt for animals roaming free in the wild. He nearly sucked the small stream dry, such was his thirst, so much so that Fang commented upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, fresh water supplies aren\u2019t exactly ample around here\u2026\u201d commented Fang wryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well you try lifting up a thousand pounds of supplies up and down fifty foot cliffs with nothing but the air to grab\u2026\u201d answered Blaze wearily. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a Sky-Swallower here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang responded, \u201cEven so, I might remind you that size is relative as well. A boulder for me is rather like a pebble for you\u2026 In the same way that the 200 volt charge in your collar is an inconvenient sting for you, but would easily kill an elf or a human.\u201d The young elf\u2019s voice was solidly smooth the entire time he said that, though Blaze winced all the same. \u201cSo really, you are capable of much more than what you give yourself credit for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks\u2026\u201d Blaze had replied with a grimacing smile. With that Blaze finished off the last of his meal, and he found his stomach bloating nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find a place to bury the bones somewhere... would that be all right?\" said Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted, \"Go right ahead. Oh, but if you're going to need to take a shit, just don't do it anywhere near the river... Might be detrimental to the health of the colonists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it...\"  Blaze rolled his eyes, walking a short ways before digging a hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze returned to the stream, he found Fang busy dipping a few tropical herbs into a pot, adding water from the stream and then placed a small fire spell underneath, making a improvised soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find herbs like these back on the main island,\u201d commented Fang, putting a spoonful of the soup into mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo meat?\u201d cried Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d answered Fang, almost violated at the suggestion, \u201cWould you even think of eating plants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze made a face, \u201cGood point\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, had Blaze been starving and in the middle of a cornfield, it wouldn\u2019t have even occurred to him that the corn was edible. Dragons didn\u2019t eat plants, and elves didn\u2019t eat meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang continued to enjoy his surroundings for a while longer, \u201cPity that this meadow will have to be cleared for farmland. Many Kleave\u2019s don\u2019t appreciate beauty of nature anymore\u2026\u201d said Fang with a small but genuine measure of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter enjoy it while it lasts then right?\u201d answered Blaze, not that he disagreed with Fang\u2019s point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his soup, Fang then checked his pocket watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem that we should get back to the settlement and help direct the night shift. We wouldn\u2019t want the laborers to forget whose in charge now would we?\u201d he cried, leaping back onto Blaze. Blaze let out an understanding growl, before taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning, Blaze continued to transport supplies up until the village. All in all, Blaze wound up transporting two and a half tons of supplies into the village before nightfall put an end to the effort, for him at least. The sailors continued working all through the night by lamplight. Of the cargo which had been able to be stuffed aboard, besides Blaze, barely a tenth had been unloaded so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Blaze\u2019s keen eyesight might have allowed him to work in the dark, the humans who had to load and unload his belly harness were not and no one really trusted Blaze to land on the ship in the pitch dark, including, surprisingly, Fang. Granted, his elf patron Fang had other uses for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter delivering a small speech to the night workers, about the good of the colony and building their future, and whatnot, Blaze had the lovely opportunity to work as a makeshift crane as some of the settlers put up a small lumber mill using parts he had already unloaded from the ship. Obviously, there was some sort of mechanical saw in the structure, which was powered by the same small stream that Blaze had hunted further upstream. As Blaze did not have the slightest aptitude for machines, unlike Flamer-6, he could hardly begin to understand how it worked, but he hefted the heavier metal parts for the small humans so they could be assembled into the mill, which had already been constructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as all that was required for the lumber mill to begin functioning was the missing machinery, the dawn brought a ghastly thrumming noise as the circular saw wound up for the first time. When Blaze peered into the unassuming shack and saw a spinning blade neatly sever a whole tree trunk the settlers fed into it as a test, the dragon could not help but shudder a little at the ingenuity of the smaller species. In addition to feeling slightly humbled, Blaze lamented the fact that he was currently working for people who were working to increase the divide between their species as equals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was up again, so Blaze reported back to Fang in the small town. There he was met with yet more news. The second ship had arrived!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he spotted the second ship arrive in the backdrop of the rising sun, all of Blaze\u2019s weariness vanished, as his attention was directed toward that ship. A wide grin rose on his jaw as he sniffed the air. It was Ember\u2019s scent, sweet and spicy, as Blaze imagined her smooth body curled up against him, purring affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped back to reality by a low-intensity shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now Lord Flame\u2026 there will certainly be time for that later,\u201d cried Fang, clearly sensing Blaze\u2019s mood, \u201cI hope that your affection for her will not distract your work duties\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!!\u201d answered Blaze. Whatever wariness he\u2019d felt from working the entire day and night he\u2019d felt had vanished.  He could not afford to show himself as idle or lazy with Ember watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, there is the necessity of bringing Allorah up to speed on the progress of the work thus far, so I suppose you'll get a chance to catch up\u2026\u201d added Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's great!! But who's Allorah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the handler of the drakka. Though I thoroughly appreciate spending time together, there will be moments when I\u2019ll be called away for other duties. Thus, she\u2019ll be the one you answer to when I\u2019m not around\u2026\u201d answered Fang. Blaze nodded briskly, as he hovered toward the pier. He did not pretend for a moment that she wouldn\u2019t be up for the task, nor could he afford to make the assumption that he could hope to get away with things because she was female. Lady Ramoth and Darzhja were two prime examples of females not to cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze waited anxiously as the workers removed the cargo hold plank by plank. Finally, after what seemed like forever, Ember emerged onto the pier. Blaze was glad to find that she\u2019d been treated well on her voyage; if she hadn\u2019t then he\u2019d surely have had a word or maybe a spark of fire with the crewmembers. She stepped carefully onto the docks; despite being a rather large female, she was graceful to the point that the planks didn\u2019t even seem to budge with her weight. Nonetheless, the dock workers, who had already been on edge with having to work in close proximity with one dragon, were seized by a fresh wave of panic when they realized there would be two and possibly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Flame while I restore order alright?\u201d sighed Fang with exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze nodded, not trying hard to conceal his amusement at the impression that Ember made on them, while Fang and an elven female who Blaze guessed could only be the drakka handler cursed, threatened and overawed the laborers back to compliance. Ember also seemed quite satisfied with the humanoids response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like you\u2019ve made quite the first impression Honeysweet\u2026\u201d growled Blaze softly, leaning forward to place his head alongside hers. For some reason, he liked the ring that \u2018Honeysweet\u2019 made, even if it was a harem name given to her by the Kleaves. Ember growled with satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts just as well to see the two-legged ones wary of us again,\u201d she puffed with a slight but satisfied plumb of smoke. Her jaw then curved into that wonderful smile of hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you again Flame\u2026\u201d Blaze wholeheartedly agreed. With Ember, one could almost rationalize that everything the Kleaves had made him endure was worth it. Already, he could not imagine what life would be life without her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blaze and Ember caught up, and after Fang had managed to restore order, he gave the drakka handler a run-down of the progress that had been made at the island thus far, and what her duties would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix will be arriving on the next boat at around noon-time to help out\u2026\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s good to hear. He was still in pretty rough shape the last I saw him, so that can only mean he\u2019s been healing well\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. Indeed, he\u2019d feared that Flamer-6 had been surely dead after taking that grievous blow from the late, unlamented Flamer-2, and that he was fit enough to work now was great news indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the other drakka?\u201d asked Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shifted her gaze uneasily, \u201cThey won\u2019t be arriving for another week at least. I don\u2019t know exactly what was going on, but Allorah said that they each needed to be given an additional evaluation before being transported.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze had long since learned, vagueness was a terrifying concept when being a prisoner of the Kleaves. It was a stark reminder of exactly what this place was, despite the apparent appearance of paradise. He remembered how hysterically frightened they\u2019d been during his fight with Flamer-2. He doubted it was because they were weak-willed; any dragon who had been weak-willed was probably long dead, but what had happened that fateful day would shake up anybody. It also made him wonder what exactly happened to the drakka while they were in captivity on the main island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing that he was wondering about that grim subject, right then, both he and Ember were hit by a light shock, and Blaze grunted in annoyance when he saw the female elf holding a pendant. It was Ember\u2019s handler, Allorah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be enough chit-chatting Honeysweet. Those sailors require your help in transporting the goods to the settlement\u2026\u201d she said strictly. She did not show a trace a fear around the two drakes, when even Wolf had been wary from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand mistress\u2026\u201d answered Ember, lowering her head. Now, Blaze had a chance to appraise the drakka handler. For an elf, she was not especially pretty, as her face was rough and there was a long scar that covered her cheek. She was also far more muscular, almost dwarf-like, in comparison to other female elves, who were invariably lithe and graceful. Some of the low-ranking elven Kleave guards noticed as such, and gave the female handler a disgusted look, but a swift glance from her was all that was needed to make them pretend as if they\u2019d never given her a disdainful look in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Allorah I presume?\u201d cried Blaze. Having lived under Lady Ramoth in the orphanage, it was habit for him to address any female of authority with \u2018Lady\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said tersely, hand close on the pendant. As Flamer-2 had eaten the old drake handler, Wolf, Blaze couldn\u2019t blame her for her caution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith your permission, I can show her how to better transport the cargo. I\u2019ve been doing it all day yesterday and I figured we could get the job done faster that way\u2026\u201d answered Blaze. The female elf didn\u2019t seem to expect for Blaze to address her so politely and formally and relented. He figured it was a good idea to get on her good side quickly, as with any and all people in positions of authority. Well, maybe not with Dr. Moridin or the Kleave transporter, both of whom were quite insane and cruel to a fault, but Allorah, like Fang, struck Blaze as a rather rational individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, quite the gentleman you are\u2026 I see that your reputation as a smooth talker is by no means exaggerated\u2026\u201d answered Allorah, in a very Lady Ramoth-like way. \u201cYet if you must\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze made his way toward a large pile of crates, where the still nervous humans watched him warily, while Ember watched intently. \u201cNow then, you want to attach the cargo like so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly showed Ember the most efficient way to attach the cargo along with lifting it into the air. Blaze was glad to see that Ember learned quickly, and indeed after only about half an hour was performing her job nearly as well as Blaze was, the difference only being that Blaze could carry a larger load capacity than she could. Even with the weight of the cargo holding her down, Blaze couldn\u2019t help but note that she was very graceful in flight. He was glad to see that despite the people she was working for, Ember nonetheless took pride in seeing that the job was done properly, and indeed Blaze could sense that she was trying to prove as much to him as to the Kleaves that anything Blaze could do, she could more than hold her own as well. Blaze grunted with a grin. Well, there was no way he was going to allow himself to be outdone by a female. Was he not a breeder male? The strongest male fire drake on the island?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze scoffed. It was rather ironic to take pride in that. After all, it served to remind him that he was still a prisoner, and that whatever freedom he had only extended as far as Fang allowed him to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNontheless, the hours seemed to fly by quickly, and the large pile of cargo dwindled quickly. Then, at around noon-time, the third ship arrived. Blaze sniffed the air. The scent that reached his nostrils belonged to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with Ember\u2019s newfound help and sheer exuberance speeding along the disemboweling of the ships, the stout galleons were still emptied but slowly.  Each of their cargo holds had been reduced by roughly half to accomodate one dragon, however, that still remarkably left over 100 tons of tightly packed supplies left in each ship.  It would be a while yet before the supplies could be unloaded, even with the help of multiple dragons.  As Blaze hefted heavy crates and sacs up the cliffs endlessly, all he could think was that Flamer-6 better be in good enough shape to help.  There wasn\u2019t going to be any time for slacking, at least any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship rolled into the cove just past noon.  Blaze watched while he was having a series of small crates hitched to his under belly where he sat in the hold of the ship.  Scenting the air, he could just make out the mild inoffensive - and yet unnaturally mild - flavor of the neutered drake.  Blaze frowned slightly.  Flamer-6 had suffered a lot of hardship only just recently.  Been maimed twice - first by Dr. Moridin, and then by Flamer-2 - and then had his dragonhood taken away carelessly before his wounds had even closed.  And yet, he was still around wasn\u2019t he?  Blaze felt a strange mix of pity and esteem towards him.  He hoped he could be as strong as him if things came down to it\u2026 and yet Blaze hoped that he would  not have to be so tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber touched down lightly on the ship she had come on as the sailors were finishing up on Blaze.  She rocked her ship less than half the amount Blaze did when he landed, doing an odd little movement with her wings just before she alighted.  The movement of her luscious wings as she folded them was entrancing.  Ember cocked her head as she sniffed the breeze.  Turning her head, she saw the ship.  \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d she asked over the barking of the sailors below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Flamer-6.\u201d Said Blaze.  Below someone kicked his haunch so he\u2019d know that the loading was finished.  Blaze began to extricate himself from the ship\u2019s hold, being mindful of the boxes strapped to his underside.  Although he took his time, looking at Ember across from him on the other side of the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA worried expression passed over the drakka\u2019s strong, and yet finely chiseled features.  \u201cHe looked terrible the last time I saw him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze understood Ember\u2019s unspoken worries.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him.  Four days rest inside the ship will have done him some good.\u201d  Blaze planted his hindfeet carefully on the upper deck and crouched below the rigging, making ready to leap.  \u201cHe\u2019s quite tough\u2026 smart too.  You\u2019ll see when you get a chance to get to know him better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ember didn\u2019t look very assuaged.  Perhaps she didn\u2019t like being reminded of the depths of cruelty the Kleaves were capable of, or perhaps it was something else entirely.  At any rate, Blaze lifted himself carefully up into the air, his shoulders burning as he carried himself and his cargo up and away, over the cliffs and down to the town of Fort Carmile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Ember, it took a while for the decks to be disassembled and Flamer-6 to emerge.  The eunuch creapt out of the hold slowly and stretched his wings with the same jerky motion that Blaze had gotten used to seeing from Six.  Still, it was something of a shock when the dragon emerged fully from the ship and displayed his collection of scars.  Blaze was taking a brief break at the top of the cliffs when he saw him, and he hissed a sharp intake of breath.  Flamer-6 was so badly scarred, he was almost ugly.  Bright red knotted tissue and terrible black stitches lined gouges in his shoulder and neck where Flamer-2 had mauled him and on his opposite side, he could see deeper indents in the flesh of his abdomen where he\u2019d been impaled on the same dragon\u2019s horns.  Indeed it was a miracle that he was alive.  When Six flew upwards, Blaze could even make out the fresher scar cut horizontally just below his penile slit.  Unlike mammals with indecently exposed glands, dragons kept their equipment hidden.  However this turned the neutering process into rather invasive surgery and made Blaze wonder momentarily if they were indeed better off after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still there were obvious signs of neurological damage.  Flamer-6\u2019s left eye still slumped and he had a tendency to pull to the left while flying, one side of his body less responsive than the other.  However, despite all his hurts and irreparable damage to his body, a casual grin spread unevenly on his face when he angled up and saw Blaze sitting on the cliffs above him.  It was only a few seconds before the dragon landed beside him, bouncing off the stone slightly as he did.  Blaze noticed his sunken-in belly.  Six looked like he\u2019d lost four or five stone since he\u2019d las saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze coughed slightly then spoke, \u201cStill holding together, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix looked at him sidelong as he folded his wings; the left one rather awkwardly.  \u201cBarely\u2026\u201d  breathed Flamer-6.  \u201cAlthough, I suppose I must be happy they didn\u2019t cull me on the spot back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t want to talk about their last great trial on the main island.  \u201cHow was the voyage, Six?\u201d  Again he glanced at the dragon\u2019s sharp abdominal tuck up.  \u201cYou look famished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix snorted, \u201cThey fed me\u2026 enough.\u201d  However, his eyes betrayed the hunger he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stretched out his wing and bumped Six\u2019s flank.  \u201cLet me assure you that there is excellent hunting on the island, real hunting!\u201d  Blaze stepped around in front of Six and inclined his head for emphasis.  \u201cThey obviously haven\u2019t been hunted by dragons before.  They don\u2019t even look up when you\u2019re circling.  It\u2019s easy pickings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a grin out of the banged up dragon.  Six rotated his right shoulder and Blaze noticed another deep gouge.  However, unlike the rest of Six\u2019s injuries, it looked like the surgeons had taken a substantial amount a muscle along with it, possibly due to infection.  The movement seemed to pain him, but Six kept at it several more times as he spoke,  \u201cThey better be.  I\u2019m not exactly in the best shape of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned and couldn\u2019t think of how to reply.  Six saved him the effort though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stretching his back and hindlegs like a cat and turning his head side to side so that Blaze could hear the crackling in his vertebrae, Six said, \u201cWell, as much as I\u2019d like to elope for a bit of lunch.  I was told that I was supposed to report to an elf called Claw or some-such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang.\u201d  Blaze corrected.  \u201cAnd I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d  However, Blaze glanced back at the nightmare patchwork of stitches lining Six\u2019s flank and felt suddenly uncomfortable.  \u201cHowever, I\u2019m still intent on getting a decent meal into you before putting you to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix snorted with disbelief.  \u201cAnd you think you can tell this elf what to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shrugged with his wings, \u201cI have some sway with him.  And I am Lord Flame now after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, new name, new title.  I almost forgot\u2026\u201d  Six\u2019s good eye went a little hazy for a moment and then he commented with a flare of his own wings.  \u201cYou know, I remember when you were just a scared little wimp back when they tossed you into that cell, vent bleeding and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s nostrils flared and he might have gotten angry if Six had still smelled like a male.  As it was, however, he took the comment in stride.  \u201cI\u2019m not that dragon anymore.  I\u2019m stronger now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix frowned and creased his head eye ridges.  He spoke quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  asked Blaze, leaning in closer to the other dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix reached out with his wing and laid it across Blaze\u2019s back.  \u201cDon\u2019t forget who you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blaze could think of what to say, the moment was over.  Six spread his wings and turned around, ready to leap off the cliff and into the air.  \u201cCome, let\u2019s meet this elf chum of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 all right\u2026\u201d  Blaze muttered numbly, but Six was already gone.  Suddenly Blaze felt less like Lord Flame than an ignorant child.  And he didn\u2019t like the way it felt.  Rather than cheating by leaping off the cliff, Blaze sprang into the air using the strength in his haunches and angled his way towards Fort Carmile.  He swung in line just ahead of Six and led the way, the tropical forest passing below them like a warm felt carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze passed right over Ember, who was being unloaded right outside the town's gates and landed in the square.  When Six landed on the other side of the obelisk, nearly all of the free space was used up.  A man with a painted shoulder came sprinting up.  Blaze recognized Sergeant Seymor.  \"Lord Flame...\"  said the human at once giving a slight bow and gripping a control pendant which dangled from his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Master Fang?\"  asked Blaze simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human replied...</span></div></div>",

Apparently the landing of two massive dragons in the town square had not escaped his notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you would be Flamer-6? Flame\u2019s told me a lot of good things about you\u2026\u201d said Fang in a very affable manner, looking up at the scared dragon. Flamer-6, who was no doubt used to the more brutish variety of Kleave, initially didn\u2019t know how to react to Fang\u2019s apparently friendly greetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely, he is exaggerating about my worth. I can only hope that I may be of some marginal use here\u2026\u201d answered Six, keeping his head lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Six, don\u2019t sell yourself short. You made a complex pulley system with nothing more than scrap metal and troll laborers,\u201d encouraged Blaze. Truthfully, with Flamer-6 being the way he was, he didn\u2019t think that employing him as another physical laborer would be getting the optimal use out of him, and wanted to emphasize these traits so that he could be put in a position to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil Flamer-2 destroyed it and led to me being\u2026\u201d Flamer-6 let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short awkward moment, but Fang was quick to break the silence, \u201cThat being said, I\u2019m very curious in hearing how you managed to accomplish that in detail\u2026 Such a feat would require uncommon knowledge of engineering and physics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamer-6 shifted his gaze. After seeming to mull over it, he evidently couldn\u2019t resist any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it wasn\u2019t terribly complicated.\u201d Started Six. \u201cThe only metal available was slag, metal shavings and broken tools. I began with heating and folding the metal to squeeze out the impurities\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix then delved into a long detailed analysis of how he\u2019d built the machine, the materials he\u2019d used, how he utilized the trolls to perform the more delicate labor, and other aspects using engineering terms that Blaze could only vaguely understand. Nonetheless, once he began talking about a subject that interested him, Six\u2019s prior anemic attitude vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did all that without any blueprint or precise measuring tools? You\u2019ve really got talent Flamer-6! Once we get the ships unloaded, I\u2019d actually like to have your expertise in designing some of our infrastructure. As it turns out, we\u2019re sadly lacking in architects and engineers on this island, and I could use the expertise of someone who really knows what they\u2019re doing\u2026\u201d said Fang, deeply impressed. However, Blaze could not help but notice the gleam in the elf\u2019s eyes, already calculating the best way to use Flamer-6 in his machinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice in this do I?\u201d cried Six. He seemed understandably wary of the offer, but also hopeful, though Blaze could not help but notice how his eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d rather, I can use you as a draft animal\u2026\u201d replied Fang off-handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 I mean I\u2019d be honored to fulfill this task! Thank you Master Fang!!\u201d answered Six, swinging around a bit too slavishly in Blaze\u2019s opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!!\u201d answered Fang with a grin, as if he\u2019d expected that he\u2019d accept all along. \u201cAnyhow Flame, before you return to your duties, would you be so kind as to show Six a decent meal? He really looks as if he could use one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was obvious, the fact that the elf both noticed and cared enough to mention feeding Six surprised Blaze. he replied with a grunt, \u201cVery well Master Fang\u2026. You mind if I grabbed something to eat as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you\u2019ve been working since we landed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to Six. \u201cCome on Six. I\u2019ll show you where those water buffalo are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drakes then took back off to the sky. A moment later, Blaze arrived at the small stream where the water buffalo were, upstream of the new lumbermill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals again were stupid and slow to react, although they did at least manage to look up this time. Six dived down like a falling arrow and landed with his forepaws crushing the life out of a large bull. Blaze followed down a few moments later at the animals started to flee; he\u2019d actually been taken off guard by the speed at which the injured dragon had fallen. Even with the warning, it was too little, too late for the buffalo, Blaze snagged his while it was floundering in the stream. He carried it a short way over to where Six was already digging in and broke its neck with his teeth. Across from him, Six bit into one of the buffalo with violent gusto, quickly devouring it to stripped bones. He ate his meal so quickly that he actually had to catch his breath after his effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors!! Have you eaten anything at all since we were back at the lair?\u201d gasped Blaze. He almost felt ashamed to eat his own meal after seeing how hungry Six had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter now\u2026\u201d Six quickly dismissed, \u201cGot to admit though, I haven\u2019t had anything this good since I got kidnapped\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then lifted his head and began to gaze around. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ve just noticed that there aren\u2019t any humans currently watching us right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked startled. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u201d he said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not stupid enough to think this is a chance to escape, not that a eunuch would have a place in civilized society anymore, but that means either Fang is negligent or he\u2019s smarter and more dangerous than I imagined\u2026\u201d replied Six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d cried Blaze. He\u2019d already understood in his guts just how formidable Fang was, but he did want to know what Six thought of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not like the other Kleaves, Seven,\u201d answered Six, inadvertently calling Blaze by his previous moniker. \u201cFang, that elf\u2019s a master of manipulation. I mean, he had me wagging my tail like an enthusiastic dog when he started talking about architectural projects. Worse, I\u2019m actually looking forward to doing it; to helping the Kleave\u2019s with their nefarious goals.\u201d His voice was gravely and strained with a real mix of emotions. Blaze wasn\u2019t sure if Six had ever opened up this much to him before, but he was glad that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grunted, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that Six? I know full well just how dangerous Fang is. He knows my name and where I come from and don\u2019t think for a moment he doesn\u2019t know yours. Now that I think about it, he probably figured that the two of us would be having this conversation right now and probably set up some spell so he could listen in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix took a couple even breaths, he was still a little worked up from his gorge and his belly was bulging with buffalo. \u201cHe may have\u2026\u201d Six said slowly, \u201cBut we have to remember that realizing that he can do something like that is different from assuming that he did do something like that. We\u2019ll never escape if we assume he\u2019s omnipotent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze blinked. For him Six\u2019s words were a bit of a shock. He hadn\u2019t realized how much Fang\u2019s machinations had gotten to him recently. He had to take a deep breath to steady himself. In fact, he twisted his head and lapped from the cool stream for a few seconds before he spoke. \u201cYou are right.\u201d He said finally. \u201cBut the elf is as smart as sin and just as calculating. I still have no doubt that the illusion of freedom is just that: an illusion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix cocked his head. \u201cUnless he\u2019s bluffing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, another thought that hadn\u2019t occured to Blaze. Although the young drake was glad that Six was here, suddenly he didn\u2019t like so much the demonstration of their own gap in intelligence. Blaze frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Fang wouldn\u2019t risk us dragons to something so flimsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix nodded, \u201cI agree, but it does well to remember that keeping your opponents cowed by apparent strength is an excellent way to prevent them from seeing their own power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gnawed on that bit of wisdom, but not knowing what to do with it, set it aside for later use. He spoke, \u201cAnyways, he knows that even if I were to think about escaping, I wouldn\u2019t because I\u2019m a caring sap; because he knows that I\u2019d never leave Honeysweet behind and risk her being raped by another drake. \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really got the hots for her don\u2019t you?\u201d replied Six, looking at Blaze askance. His tail lifted a little higher as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than that\u2026\u201d answered Blaze, more defensively than he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix back up a step, then sighed, \u201cIts not like it matters to me anymore\u2026 For obvious reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze realized his instinctual reaction just reminded Six of what he was no longer capable. The young drake wondered for a moment how it felt. <i>Is his desire gone? Do drakka look the same as drakes to him now? Is he incapable of seeing feminine beauty anymore?</i> Admittedly, the last was something of a potential relief, especially in regards to Ember. Still, Six didn\u2019t deserve what he was doing to himself. <br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it does matter.\u201d answered Blaze, \u201cRegardless of what you think of yourself, I\u2019m still going to treat you like a drake. You deserve that type of respect and Fang sees that as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix didn\u2019t reply right away, but nonetheless seemed to appreciate that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow Seven, why don\u2019t we just get back to the docks? Its ungentlemanly to leave Honeysweet laboring all on her own\u2026\u201d said Six with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn\u2019t help but feel a thrill of the old male rivalry, despite Six\u2019s mild odor. To his surprise, he liked it. Blaze grunted, \u201cYou\u2019ve really got a point there\u2026\" They left the stained bones and gore where it lay and took to the air. Six followed Blaze back down to the ships. There was another hundred tons of cargo to unload after all\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Work continued the rest of that afternoon, went straight through the night, and throughout the following day as well. No matter how many packages of supplies he hauled up to the settlement, the pile of supplies did not seem to grow any smaller.  As the sun began to slowly sink below the horizon, Blaze was lying upon his belly as the humans unloaded yet another load of supplies from the twin leather straps along his flanks.  His shoulders ached from all the heavy lifting and he rested his head on the hard pan earth under him, his wings akimbo on the ground to either side.  He heaved a sigh and let his heavy scaled eyelids sag as the humans labored to extract his cargo. It\u2019d been three days since he\u2019d last slept.  He\u2019d needed to conserve what stamina he could when he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy fortunate coincidence, Blaze found himself accompanied by both Ember and Flamer-6, both of whom were also being unloaded. The flattened dirt plateau that was to become the landing platform of the dragon tower was just large enough to hold the three young dragons and the team of humanoid laborers which surrounded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up you slack-jawed wretches!!\u201d screeched Allorah, the current taskmaster with an almost witch-like voice.  The whip she carried cracked like an explosion at the feet of a peasant leaning against Blaze\u2019s shoulder, causing him to all but leap several feet into the air.  Unfortunately for the dragon, the noise was enough to start him from his half doze and he wearily opened the eye facing the humanoids to watch the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither this peasant had not been here long or he\u2019d never met Allorah.  Landing on his feet with a mild stagger, he looked at the woman holding the whip and apparently decided to play the pity card.  After a full second of conspicuous hesitation, he fell to his knees and said, \u201cBu\u2019 ma\u2019m, we\u2019ve a\u2019been working since dawn. Can\u2019t ye give this poor sinner a break?\u201d Though the human drama hardly interested the dragon\u2019s tastes, Blaze could not help a small inward smile at this human\u2019s blatant stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllorah\u2019s eyes lit up with an inner fire and for a moment, Blaze thought she might open her mouth and breath flames all over the kneeling man.  Then her hate-filled quivering stilled and with powerful self control she sauntered up to the man beside the large red scaled dragon.  Despite the fact that the taskmaster was wearing baggy leggings and an open leather vest - neither of which accentuated the human female\u2019s natural figure in the slightest - the man developed a devious grin at the sight of her approaching; Blaze could have sighed in exasperation had he energy to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms draping to the ground before him, the worker lifted his head to Allorah as she stopped before him.  She reached down a gloved hand to touch the man\u2019s greasy, unshaven face with the back of a hand, shortly after pressing her coiled loop of a whip firmly to his shoulder.  As she pulled her hand back and the quite horny man - Blaze could smell it coming off of him in waves from the sweat on his brow - melted in her grasp, Allorah said, \u201cAw, So you\u2019re tired are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point in time, the labor of the surrounding humans had crawled to a standstill.  Everyone was staring to where Allorah had this man backed against the towering flank of a dragon.  They all seemed to know what was coming; all except one, however.  \u201cI am\u2026  But not so tired I can\u2019t warm up a lil\u2019lady like your-\u201c  That was as far as he got before Allorah lifted her arm, coiling her whip around the man\u2019s neck with careless ease and choking off his lusty words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith leverage and a simple motion of her shoulder, the taskmaster flipped her captive down onto his belly.  She began to walk away, dragging him by the neck across the packed dirt as he squirmed, flailing and groping at the whip, at pebbles, at anything at all.  His face turned red and then purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were in the middle of a stage, Allorah sauntered with almost as much grace and power as any drakka.  It was actually quite remarkable in Blaze\u2019s opinion.  When she stopped, the man was flat on his back and wheezing pathetically through the reduced constriction.  Allorah turned and put her boot down on the man\u2019s cheek, grinding his face into the earth.  \u201cStill tired?\u201d  she asked, looking down at him as if he were nothing more than a bug under her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gasping, the man shook his head feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026\u201d  said Allorah and then with a twist of her whip, sent the man rolling across the dirt like an unleashed top.  Then she shouted at the on-lookers, \u201cWork is over when I say it is, and not a moment before!!\u201d  She punctuated her roar with another thunder-blast crack from her whip that sent the laborers cowering and then moving double-time.  Blaze wondered if Allorah\u2019s length of braided leather was enchanted or whether she was simply that skilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost feel sorry for the poor wretches...\" commented Six on the other side of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost...\" emphasized Blaze, then he turned his head to look at his beloved since there was no more hope of resting his eyes. \"Hey Honeysweet\u2026\u201d spoke Blaze, switching to Drakine to hopefully befuddle the many potential eavesdroppers surrounding them, \u201cIs Allorah always like this?\u201d Given her performance just now and the fact that Allorah seemed to be swiftly becoming Fang\u2019s second on the island, Blaze could not keep himself from asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber curved her gaze sideways. \u201cI suppose she is\u2026\u201d she said, answering in the same, though quite differently accented tongue,  \u201cAt least around other \u2018umans.\u201d  The drakka snaked her head back around towards Blaze and shifted her wings a little uncomfortably before adding, \u201cShe is firm with her drakka as vell, but she \u2018ardly goes out of her vay to \u2018umiliate us.\u201d  Then Ember got a funny look in her eye as she looked at the elf stomping down the flattened earth of the foundation of the future tower.  \u201cSometimes, I get the feeling that she is proud of us\u2026 in \u2018er own vay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, looking at the same female, cocked an eyebrow.  To him, Allorah seemed far more an unpleasant handler than even the conniving Wolf had been.  That Ember had any soft feelings towards her struck him as odd and perhaps even a little unbalanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he daren\u2019t say such thoughts aloud to his lover, Flamer-6 apparently lacked any such reticence.  He did a double-take, looking at the taskmaster and snorted, \u201cI think I\u2019d rather deal with a grumpy orc with a crossbow bolt in his ass than that particular elf.\u201d  Six lifted his snout in the air and commented to Ember, \u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t suffering a touch of disambiguation with this particular taskmaster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber ruffled her wings, causing the human workers around her to start and retreat for a few moments.  \u201cAnd vhat, pray tell is zat supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way her tail tip was lashing back and forth, Blaze could tell that she was agitated.  She probably didn\u2019t understand what Six had meant\u2026 Blaze certainly did not himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d said Six, scratching the underside of his jaw with a heavy claw which caught sometimes on the scars marring the smooth surface of dark red scale.  He did not seem like he was very interested in an explanation, but at the same time apparently could not resist the temptation to reveal his cleverness in using a term unknown to the other two dragons.  \u201cDisambiguation simply refers to the phenomenon wherein a person, typically a prisoner or young hatchling, can - after a period of usually prolonged suffering - begin to mistake a mere lack of torment for acts of kindness and thereby develop empathy for their captor or antagonist.  It\u2019s far more common among humanoids, humans and elves especially.  Almost unheard of in any fully fledged dragon, really, but then, whoever heard of taking dragons prisoner, eh?  Heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix gave something of a weak chuckle, though it seemed to pain the injury to his abdomen.  Neither other dragon joined in.  In fact, Ember looked at Six crossly down the length of her snout.  \u201cThat sounds like a silly and frankly implausible situation to me, Six.\u201d  She hissed, slipping back into the common tongue.  She lifted her head a little more and the humans around her paused in their movements to looked uneasily towards her; the fear-stink that usually pervaded the platform in any case seemed to reach a peak from the workers.  Shifting her body a little on her elbows to more directly face Flamer-6, she said, \u201cAnd if you think I\u2019m that foolish-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn\u2019t let the situation escalate.  He interrupted Ember\u2019s growing tirade, though he felt quite uncomfortable while doing it.  In fact, he felt more like the inexperienced young drake he\u2019d thought he\u2019d left behind in New Alveri.  \u201cHoneysweet, I\u2026 uh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rounded on the large, muscular drake before he could collect his thoughts; though for all his newfound mass, he could have been hardly more than a mouse in her eyes.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?  Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re taking <i>his</i> side.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was sure that Ember wasn\u2019t meaning to be bitchy, but they were all tired and on edge for all the work unloading the ships of their many tons of supplies, so he was willing to forgive her on that account.  However, presently, the way to diffuse the situation escaped him.  He was sure that only the presence of the fragile humans surrounding them and the watchful taskmaster was the only thing stopping the powerful drakka from springing over and clouting either himself or Flamer-6.  \u201cN-no,\u201d stammered Blaze, instinctively lowering his head. \u201cAll\u2026 all I meant was that, that\u2026 you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d  asked Ember impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how to say what he simply meant in the right words!  Why was this so hard?!  Blaze was filled momentarily with the thought that this would be so much easier if Ember were another drake; they\u2019d simply scuffle for a bit and that would be the end of it.  But a drakka\u2019s ire was known to smolder long after the fire seemed quenched and dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn\u2019t letting him off the hook.  To the side, Six\u2019s good eye leered at him, offering no help at all and Blaze regretted saving him a few moments earlier.  \u201cI meant to say\u2026 That is\u2026  oh\u2026 Look! There\u2019s Fang!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was the elf and master of the island coming around the bend in the dirt road leading to the walled town.  Blaze\u2019s shoulders slumped with relief as the heated words were soon forgotten.  Today, he was dressed less lavishly, though still quite fine in the makings of a young noble.  His silk leggings and shirt were red of course and of such vibrance that a robin would be jealous.  His quilted jacket was less colorful and left open at the center, though still clasped with three thick golden laces down the middle.  Blaze wasn\u2019t sure why he was paying so much attention to Fang\u2019s appearance, however, he thought privately that he\u2019d seen other elves cut far less sharp a figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf bounced lightly on the sturdy horse he was astride.  The creature was black all over and Blaze was almost expecting red glowing eyes.  However the eyes of this large beast were merely dark.  To the young drake\u2019s eye, the stallion merely looked like a hearty supper and immediately disliked it.  It nickered and strayed as it approached the foundation of the dragon tower and Fang had to rein it into line to get it to approach the strong reek of dragon which pervaded the area.  As he became aware that he was in danger of traumatizing the animal, Fang dismounted a short distance up the road and tied it to a low hanging branch; unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t enough give in the reins to allow it to feed on the rich tropical undergrowth.  Blaze snorted a thick plume of white smoke.<br>\r\nAt about the time that Fang arrived onto the foundation proper, Six had finished his unloading and the dragon looked uneasily down at the elf, clearly unsure whether he was expected to stay or go.  With a wave of his palm, Fang put Six at ease.  Relieved of his burden, Six raised himself to his haunches and stretched his wings.  Everyone had to wait for the elf to initiate conversation; including Allorah and the rest of the humanoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the elvish taskmaster had stepped forward promptly and even stamped her booted feet in attention, Fang began by speaking openly to Blaze.  \u201cGood Evening, Lord Flame.  It looks like the debarkment is proceeding well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze\u2019s eyes wandered about the scattered boxes and carts already half full and ready to take the crates and lengths of seasoned timber or metal ingots and tools up the road to Fort Carmile.  \u201cWhat brings you here, Master Fang?\u201d  asked Blaze, aware of the fact that of the dragons, he had the be the first to speak as well.  \u201cEspecially so late in the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang did not answer immediately.  Blaze was conscious of the many eyes surrounding them, though most were directed at Fang\u2019s boots as they should be or averted entirely.  With some of the peons even falling to their knees or hiding their faces, the young muscular drake wondered if this was more a description of the power of Fang\u2019s presence or the sheer wretchedness of his subjects.  Face warmed by the golden glow of the sunset over the distant waves, Fang finally deigned to answer, \u201cI think I have the authority to be wherever I wish on the island when I choose to be there.\u201d  The elf\u2019s voice was not hostile or condescending, but rather simply aloof.  \u201cAt any rate, the town has been simply flooded with new supplies since you three have been working.  We\u2019re at the point where more boxes and crates and materials will simply be in the way until we can get what we have now sorted away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their unusual relationship, Blaze was not so presumptuous to attempt to take credit for his and his compatriots\u2019 hard work in front of the elf.  \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 excellent news.\u201d  Said Blaze, not entirely sure what Fang was building towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix apparently did, however and took his chances in speaking.  \u201cThen I take it that this means we\u2019re done unloading the ships presently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf turned his head to the large scarred dragon.  There was a slight pause and then a small smile spread itself across his thin lips.  \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sniffed in Six\u2019s direction, feeling a bit miffed that the lame dragon had jumped to what Fang had implied.  Before anyone else could speak, Blaze blurted, \u201cSo where are we going to be staying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, Blaze was mildly surprised, seemed to take the question quite seriously.  He rubbed the smooth skin of his chin.  \u201cI\u2019ve been giving that a great deal of thought.  There are presently no dragon-friendly facilities on the island and of course, you can\u2019t stay in the town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked around momentarily and then planted his claws and tail down firmly on the ground.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just camp outside.  I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll be perfectly comfortable in this climate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was expecting some sort of rebuttal, but rather than Fang, it was Six who spoke, \u201cIn the short term maybe, but what about in a storm?  The tropics are known for bad storms, I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ember cut in with a comment which caused the words to die in Blaze\u2019s throat.  \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need someplace more secure for laying eggs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs\u2026  The word echoed around in Blaze\u2019s skull for a few moments, choking out his wits.  Then Fang nodded his head up to each dragon.  \u201cYes.  We are going to need proper facilities and fairly soon as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was still wondering how the conversation had taken the turn that it had, considering that it had merely started with Fang announcing a pause in their labors, when Six again proved himself capable of following the undercurrents of the elf\u2019s tongue far better than Blaze himself.  \u201cI suppose that with the lull heavy labor needs, now would be a good time to survey the island for a good place to dig out some shelter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grin spread on Fang\u2019s face as he turned to face the damaged drake.  \u201cAnd you have surveying experience as well I suppose?\u201d  he asked and the large red scaled drake nodded.  \u201cThat\u2019s quite a resume you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that you already know as much about my background as I do.\u201d  Said Six adventurously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted and surprised them all with an admission of sorts,  \u201cWe do have an extensive dossier, however, nothing is ever perfect, and I\u2019m not so arrogant as to believe that it can\u2019t be improved.\u201d  He paused a little to let that sink in and then asked directly, \u201cSo, Flamer-6, are you telling me that you can effectively scout out and survey a location for a dragon den?  It will have to house the entire colony\u2019s dragon population, you know.  I\u2019m not interested in riddling the mountain with dragon-sized holes cookie cut out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked at Six who raised a claw and rubbed thoughtfully at the scales on the underside of his chin again.  His right eye seemed to glow with curiosity, and perhaps opportunity.  \u201cI have done the type of work before.\u201d  He said, \u201cBut I lack any of my old tools and I\u2019m afraid my vision has gotten weak in my left eye\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a credit to either his composure or his indifference that Fang did not react to the reminder that the Kleaves had left Six with permanent nerve damage across the left side of his body.  \u201cI have tools available for survey work, however, I seriously doubt that they would be useful at all for a dragon.  Which is a shame, because finding a suitable site for excavation would be many times faster by dragon wing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, wanting to get back into the conversation, racked his brain for a solution to the quandary.  However, the only thing he had ever built before were mud forts in the dirt outside New Alveri as a hatchling.  </span></div></div>",

It definitely wasn\u2019t the deeper, rumbling voice of a dragon and Blaze had to look down and around for a few moments before he spotted the tall, straight form of Allorah stepping out from behind Ember\u2019s bulk.  She walked briskly up to Fang and bowed low, waiting for him to release her.  When he did, she continued.  \u201cI can accompany Flamer-6 and operate the instruments for him if he\u2019ll tell me what to do, Master Fang.  Besides, it is your humble servant\u2019s opinion that the beast shouldn\u2019t be allowed to roam freely about without supervision.  I\u2019ll be able to keep an eye on him as I help him with the scouting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know how he hadn\u2019t noticed before, but as he glanced down at the two humanoids, Blaze noticed that Allorah was actually significantly taller than Fang, though it didn\u2019t help that she was standing ramrod straight at attention before him.  Still, it struck Blaze that Fang was still actually quite young for a member of his species.  It was odd that he had forgotten, but then Fang seemed to harbor airs about him that projected experience, even veiled wisdom despite his years.  And now, he was sizing up Allorah as if there was no size difference between them, but then again, if this was an elf that could stare down a dragon with ease\u2026  \u201cI appreciate your concern in the matter, Allorah, but rest assured that there are measures in place that will not allow ready escape from this island.\u201d  Although he did not look up, Blaze was sure that comment was meant more for the three dragons than the elvish female.  He continued,  \u201cHowever, if you could function as an aide for Flamer-6 to perform his survey, it would save us perhaps weeks of time and resources.\u201d  Now he turned back and looked up at Six. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw away any resources I have at my disposal.  You all can be assured of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sent Allorah to run up the road to Fort Carmile to fetch a list of instruments with odd sounding names that Six rattled off easily.  The elf ran with the speed and grace renowned of her kind and soon vanished around the bend in the road behind the lush green foliage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was likely that Six would be leaving with Allorah as soon as the elf returned from the nearby town, Blaze did not waste any time in speaking.  \u201cWhat are Ember and I supposed to do while Six is out searching for a place to dig out a new den?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang raised an eyebrow when he looked up at Blaze and the drake thought for a moment that a lewd light crept into the elf\u2019s eyes.  However, he said,  \u201cWell, I assumed that you would be going with him.  You all are companions now aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze blustered silently with an awkward rearranging of his wings.  He had been thinking of attending Six with his work, since he thought that the injured might need some assistance at some point, no matter how determined he\u2019d been during the last couple days\u2019 work; or as a result of it.  However, just at that moment, he realized that he\u2019d actually been hopeful for some time alone with Ember.  Real time alone with her, for really the first time.  The remarkably smooth set of her scales just seemed to cry for his clawed fingers to probe them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course we\u2019re going to join him, aren\u2019t we Blaze?\u201d  Ember spoke and her voice dispelled any lingering hopes as to a romantic - though illusory - escape, although this came as a relief to Blaze\u2019s conflicting thoughts.  \u201cAfter all, I haven\u2019t even had the chance to see the island yet save between the town and the pier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ll join Six and we\u2019ll help out any way that we can.\u201d  Said Blaze, though in his mind\u2019s eye, all he was able to see was Ember winging her way beside him on a clear cloudless night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d  proclaimed Fang.  \u201cI\u2019ll give you all two days to complete the survey.  You don\u2019t all need to return, but I\u2019ll expect Allorah and those tools back by then.  If you could break first ground  while you\u2019re at it as well, that would help tremendously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of breaking ground,\u201d  spoke Flamer-6 once more, \u201cdepending on the type of stone we encounter, there may be need for a humanoid labor force, especially if we\u2019re to construct more delicate features such as running water or air shafts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze licked his chops when Fang crossed his arms.  Uh-oh.  \u201cWe have only two dwarf engineers on the island and both are being worked to capacity, particularly on this very tower.  I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m not going be able to offer very much help, especially if the place you find is very far from Fort Carmile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix mantled his wings.  \u201cI just felt I ought to mention that difficulty before we get started in earnest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang waved off the big dragon, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it more in detail if it becomes absolutely necessary.  But try to make do with what you can do yourselves.  It\u2019s to be your quarters, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood\u2026 Master Fang.\u201d  Punctuated Six for good measure and Blaze felt a corner of his lip move up in a momentary half snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Six\u2019s head was turned in the direction of the road, down which Allorah ran as though unburdened with the overlarge knapsack she had strapped across her shoulders.  She snapped her booted feet together before Fang.  \u201cI\u2019m ready to leave immediately, Master Fang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen grab onto one of these dragon\u2019s harnesses and get going.  We don\u2019t have any time to waste in constructing this facility!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a minute after that, Allorah had attached herself via a bronze ring in Six\u2019s harness and all three red dragons were up in the air and soaring away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the days and nights of non-stop labor since arriving on the island, being up in the air with Ember and Six felt like liberation.  It would have been easy enough to pretend that the three of them were simply soaring free across the lush green volcanic landscape save that there was an elf female straddling the neck of Blaze's former rival.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix flew high with Allorah, performing some sort of survey work between the two of them and that was fine with Blaze; It left room for him and Ember to flap more closely near each other.  Frequently, Blaze shot amorous looks in her direction as he plowed ahead, forming the slip stream into which she settled; usually she caught them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island was preternaturally lush; every surface was covered with green, save for the ocean on the horizon which was such a dark and rich shade of blue that Blaze was still in awe of it.  Open plains would have made for easier hunting, but it was apparent that there was room for the large game here as well.  Closer to the central mountain, where the ground was rockier, trees gave way to large rolling fields of tall grass as high as the shoulders of the buffalo and other grazers wandering in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the lushness of the jungle, there was not a terrible abundance of water, or so it appeared from the air.  When Six directed the dragons to fly up and over the caldera of the volcano, inside they found a rain water lake of some size; large enough for Blaze to get a few laps in before anyone could tell him otherwise!  Other than that, however, there just seemed to be a few streams rolling down the sides of the mountain and that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix brought up the issue when they touched down on the sides of the caldera water reservoir.  Blaze was climbing out of the water into which he'd dived, prompting the stop.  Ember laughed and slapped him with his wing and then Blaze growled playfully, having half a mind to throw her into the water next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-considering that this is the only r-reliable source of drinkable water on the island, I wouldn't recommend f-f-fouling it, Flame.\" said Six while Blaze was shaking himself down.  The dip had felt delightful on his sore muscles despite its brevity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to-\" started Blaze but halted himself when he decided what he was about to say was childish.  \"Anyways, one dip won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" grimaced Six, scratching the scars under his chin, \"R-relative size has to be taken into account in c-cases like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Allorah squawked from the base of Six's shoulders.  \"Is there a point to this landing or can we continue the survey?  I still haven't verified the accuracy of our maps of the island yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was resentful of the elf woman breaking the illusion that they three of them were on their own.  In fact, he could picture clearly himself walking over and relieving Six of his burden... in the very easiest way possible.  \"Well, I just assumed we were stopping when I saw Lord Flame dive.\"  said Six innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stared at Six, annoyed that he would put this on him.  But then the water had just seemed so cool and inviting, and it had been.  Blaze coughed.  \"Well, I just thought that building our den near fresh water might be a good idea, and we'd have a higher vantage up here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Six began to dismantle his idea at once.  \"I'm not sure that's a great idea.  While some water is good, a lot can be terrible for digs.  Building down next to a lake is a sure way to guarantee flooding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber decided to come to the rescue when Blaze's mind seemed to freeze up on him.  Walking beside him and brushing him suggestively with a wing, she said, \"What about digging into the sides of the caldera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out over the trees, the rim of the caldera was barely visible from lake side. \"Hmm...\"  rumbled Six, \"There doesn't look like there's a lot of space on this side of the rim, however.  Really, digging into the side of the mountain would be the best choice, preferably if there was already a natural cave system that we could expand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Let's see if we can find one of those.\"  said Blaze, a little irritated that Six hadn't simply said as much before they'd head out.  As he was bracing himself for a leap into the air, however, Ember touched him again with her wing.  \"Hm...?\"  he grunted.  \"What is it, Honeysweet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" she admitted and then she walked off a few paces, sniffing the air and then the ground.  \"There's an odd flavor in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honeysweet, I don't-\" Blaze started, but as he moved after her, he caught it as well.  It was a metallic, spicy and intriguing odor, one which Blaze was unsure of and yet seemed oddly familiar.  It went right to his head, in fact.  \"Woah, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber lead the way a few steps down the shore and then turning up a rocky crest cutting through the jungle.  Ember walked on the rocks while Blaze pushed his way through the springy plants and pseudo-trees beside her.  As the scent grew stronger, the more heady Blaze felt and the more he wanted to discover the source.  \"Guys!\"  shouted Six from behind them, but Blaze wasn't about to abandoning the interesting scent now.  It didn't take long to find the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the highest point in the outcropping, Ember stopped and sniffed and clawed at an upwelling of stone which was threaded thickly with a crimson metallic rock of some sort. \"What on earth is this?\"  Asked Ember as her claws racked across the stone, the grit liberated from the stone found its way into Blaze's nostrils.  Blaze sneezed, but the instant that he did, he <i>felt</i> quite different.  It was as if the crimson powder had settled onto the top of his skull, leaving a tingly sensation that quickly spread through the rest of his body, turning his muscles to warm butter. The scent seemed to fill him with its warm biting essence, a spirit of the earth settling casually over his consciousness, numbing worrisome thoughts and leaving only pleasant feelings behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple seconds later, Blaze found himself sitting before Ember, a foolish grin spread on his face.  He knew it'd only been a couple seconds he'd lost touch with himself because he could see Six still catching up with them, struggling somewhat with the rough terrain.  \"Ember?\"  asked Blaze quietly, but she didn't respond, apparently having gotten a larger dose than Blaze.  However, she did suddenly decide to lean against him and Blaze caught his breath when she decided to wrap her tail around his thigh; <i>all the way around.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Six finally caught up, he was slightly winded, but he was also wearing a smug grin.  He walked up the outcropping and eyed the red threads in the stone below him.  \"I see you two are discovering the effects of cinnibar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinnibar? Really?\"  asked Blaze dumbly, part of him was still drifting along easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber raised her head slightly, eyes soft and distant, \"Cinni-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinnibar.\"  said Six.  \"It's a drug that's fairly common here in the south-eastern sea.  For dragons, anyways.  For humanoids, its poisonous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  Is it dangerous?\"  asked Ember, noticeably reacting more than she was wont to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.  I mean, yes it's subject to abuse, but in Damnescara, it's usually prescribed to stressed dragons to help them relax.  It's also known as an aphrodisiac.\"  said Six, adding a knowing look as he said the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze spoke up, feeling more like himself as the rest mist drained from his heedy conciousness.  \"Yeah, It's around in New Alveri as well.  It's the swinger's drug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber took a few deep breaths and to Blaze's disappointment removed her tail and seemed to compose herself a little.  \"Well...  my curiosity seems to have gotten the better of me.  I apologize for leading us down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comment was mostly directed towards Allorah, however, the elf woman didn't seem very displeased at the delay.  In fact, she asked.  \"Might this be a resource that would be worth harvesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix spun his head around.  \"Well, if there's surgery that must be done, cinnibar can be substituted as a weak anesthetic for dragons...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf stood up taller in her saddle.  \"Actually, I was speaking of the aphrodisiac qualities.  I saw what the drakka was doing with her tail just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber closed her wings more tightly about herself in embarrassment, and Blaze felt a renewed surge of impotent anger towards the elf.  Six choked.  \"Well... um, er.  Really, that would depend on each individual dragon.  I could speak about the effects of cinnibar in... ahem, that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  said Allorah, settling back into the saddle.  However, she made it quite clear that the issue was not resolved as she withdrew a small notebook and began to jot down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze coughed,  \"Well, lets see if we can't scout around the rest of the mountain.  Maybe we'll find a natural cave like Six was saying.\"  Suddenly, Blaze had no more desire to think about the uncanny red rock that had such a powerful effect on him.  However, he could not forget the feel of Ember's tail against him either.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze led the way back down the mountain, cutting the wind for both dragons behind him.  The rejuvenating effect of the cinnibar turned out to be fleeting, for it was not long back up in the air before the tired ache began to creep back into Blaze's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour into the flight, however, Six roared over the wind and turned about towards the west.  It was a classic cue to follow and Blaze did.  Some feature of the terrain must have caught the maimed dragon's eye, for he seemed to be following a shallow trough cut into the side of the mountain, perhaps a stream, but then with the jungle, it was hard to tell.  Without warning, however the land suddenly gave way to empty space.  Water charged out into air, falling easily twenty dragon-lengths to a steaming pool at the base of a rugged cliff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cliff itself was composed of black stone and was pockmarked with holes small and large.  Blaze felt the air under his wings stir, a current rising from below the cliff.  It felt like this was another of the island\u2019s hotspots.  The dragons circled down, Six leading the way.  Blaze wondered if this was the sort of place the engineer was looking for.  It was certainly a place he could imagine digging out a suitable lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blaze was shocked when he saw Six veer towards the cliff face.  The maimed drake seemed to have trouble braking and before Blaze could do anything about it, he landed hard against the rocky surface of the cliff, scrambling with his claws and wing talons for purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\"Six!\"\u201d  Blaze shouted as he dived in for a landing below his companion so fast that the membranes of his wings ached with the effort to stop.  Above, Six\u2019's efforts to cling to the Cliffside began showering him with black pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Blaze was fearful of his friend falling, Six gained purchase in the time it took to respond.  \"\u201cL-look here!\"\u201d  said Six excitedly.  \"\u201cI b-believe this place has p-potential.\"\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shook his head as Ember landed lightly next to him.  \u201c\"Are you trying to get yourself killed?\"\u201d  His feet were getting wet standing so close to the pool of water at the base of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix only waggled his stiff tail down at them and then lifted himself up a few claw-holds.  \u201c\"The stone here is m-mostly basalt.  Strong, but very w-workable.\"\u201d  The red dragon fell to muttering.  He cocked his head as Allorah on his back said something, but Blaze didn\u2019\u2019t catch her comparatively small voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with the appearance that Six was not about to fall and injure himself - probably killing Allorah in the process, but that was less of a concern - \u2013 Blaze turned to Ember at his side.  Breathing in a deep breath of the misty air at the base of the waterfall, he said, \u201c\"This certainly looks like a nice cliff side.\u201d\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked away, perhaps still embarrassed by her earlier behavior.  \"\u201cIt\u2019s better than the side of the mountain or digging down into jungle turf.\"\u201d  She said noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned slightly.  What was wrong with this drakka?  Back at the fort she\u2019d been almost as enthusiastic about constructing a lair as Six.  Blaze, who honestly still wouldn\u2019\u2019t have minded simply sleeping in the open, found himself in the uncomfortable position of defending this location.  \"\u201cI like this pool.\"\u201d  Said Blaze lamely, \u201c\"And the clearing is nice.  I\u2019m sure we could make improvements here and there.  Plus this waterfall\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sighed and looked back at Blaze.  The way that her eyes reflected the light in the shimmering mist that landed on her was almost enough to make Blaze groan with desire for her.  She smiled a little, but it seemed forced.  \"\u201cI'\u2019m sure we can make something here.  It\u2019s a better spot than any we'\u2019ve come across so far and we'\u2019ve flown over nearly the whole island already.\u201d\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\"I don\u2019t fancy settling into some smelly sea caves.\"\u201d Said Blaze giving a small shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber trilled a laugh \u201c\"Nor do I.  I just...  Well, one spot on this island has to be pretty much the same as any other, doesn\u2019\u2019t it?\u201d\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was one of resignation rather than a question and Blaze suddenly had an understanding of what had soured her mood suddenly.  He struggled for a way to ease her worries.  \u201c\"Well... maybe that\u2019s true.  But we have an opportunity here to make ourselves comfortable.  Even if we can\u2019t be free, yet.\"\u201d  Blaze made sure to emphasize the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber agreed that there was at least some value in comfort after all that both of them had been through.  Before she could say more, however, Six crowed from above.  Blaze looked up to see that Six had climbed up about half a dragon length from where he\u2019d been, but more, his upper torso was out of sight.  \u201c\"Six?\"\u201d cried Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\"Climb up here, you t-two.  You must see this!  M-mind the l-ledge.\"\u201d  Called Six from above who promptly began to disappear into the cliff side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shared a look with Ember and then reared up to scale the cliff.  It was an easy climb, especially with some help from his wing talons.  In fact, with his increased musculature, Blaze felt like he could have run up the side of the cliff if he'\u2019d really wanted to.  When he got to where Six had vanished, Blaze found a large circular hole opening into the  cliff side, adjacent to the waterfall.  It hadn\u2019\u2019t been apparent with the black stone composing the cliff and the darkness within.  The ledge was slippery with moss and wet that had accumulated there due to the falling water.  A step inside, however was cool and dry; however, Blaze noted that it was not as cool as the outside temperature should have made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself up easily, Blaze turned back immediately to check on Ember\u2019's progress.  She was right behind him and easily bushed off Blaze'\u2019s proffered claw.  Turning towards the interior darkness of the cave, Blaze made out at once its strangeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening was circular and so was the interior, which did not bubble out or constrict, rather continuing straight and linear until even the power of dragon eyes petered out into darkness.  The floor was curved and smooth, though a bit crumbly under a dragon\u2019's weight.  Here and there, the stone rippled and pooled as if it were black water, frozen in place.  The cylinder of the cave seemed to go on forever, ascending ever so slightly into the blackness.  Six had already traveled a considerable distance down the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze and Ember were able to walk abreast if they didn\u2019\u2019t mind their wings touching \u2013 which they didn\u2019\u2019t \u2013 and when they caught up with Six, he greeted them excitedly.  \"My friends, I believe what w-we have here is an ext-tinct lava tube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, although he could see plainly that this place was some sort of tube, did not immediately catch Six's meaning.  Ember was faster.  She said, \"So liquid rock once flowed through this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just like a r-river.\"  Six agreed, stepping forward into the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze reached up and scratch his head against the side of the passage.  \"If it was a river, then why's it underground?\"  Blaze was also wondering why the place was hollow instead of solid rock if magma had once moved through here and then cooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...  As I've been told, the lava is so hot that it actually melts the ground over which it's flowing, causing it to slowly sink into the rock.  When the flow begins to lessen, the lava on top cools and forms a shell, sealing the river of rock into a underground tube.\"  Six rattled off, his usual stutter strangely absent while reciting scientific details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze still had difficulty imagining how the place could have formed, but he did know what he could see and feel now.  He ran a claw up a smooth wall to his left.  \"We could easily make branching chambers off the main tube...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's just what I was t-thinking.\"  said Six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber spoke again, \"But what are the chances of lava once again flowing through here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very small, I'd say.\"  said Six.  \"I've smelled rodent and b-bats about.  G-generations of waste.  There's been n-no lava here for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sniffed, he was as ready to move in here as any other place.  \"Sounds fine with me.  Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix began to wax on about various possibilities for lair design, including places to break through the ceiling to let in light and air as well as running water from the adjacent stream.  It quickly became more complicated than Blaze could follow.  Ember remained relatively quiet and Blaze sensed that this may be becoming too real for her too quickly.  Thus it fell largely to Allorah to not so much fuel Six's imaginings so much as reign them in.  Blaze could tell the eunuch was having fun with this; not that he didn't deserve it of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Allorah who piped up over Six's elegant design.  \"And how exactly are you going to construct all of this?\"</span></div></div>",

The effect on Six was repugnant.  The maimed dragon stalled for once in his constant stream of musings and lifted a claw to observe its obvious trembling.  \"And really, even if you could,\"  Allorah continued, sitting straight in the leather saddle.  \"You're only one dragon.  You're going to need an entire work force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn't stand to see Six being treated this way.  It was all too familiar.  Recklessly, Blaze walked up to where Six was sitting.  He addressed the elf on his back.  \"Allorah, stop.  You don't need to badger him like that-ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze convulsed, his tail slapping so had against a wall that it stripped a large section clean of brittle volcanic stone.  The large, muscular red dragon fell to his knees as the current flowed through him.  Allorah removed her thumb from the control talisman.  \"Master Fang has been far too lenient on you if you think you have the right to speak to me as if you could tell me what to do <i>Lord Flame</i>.\"  said the elf derisively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze growled softly from the ground, feeling nauseous and certain that he'd pissed himself more than a little.  Six, however, barked sharply. \"Stop it, Seven.  Allorah is right.  This p-place isn't going to be anything more than a h-hole in the g-ground without a proper workforce.

The sun was going down, the three dragons had spent the entire day out and about and then hanging around the lava tube and the pool at the base of the waterfall.  Six volenteered to ferry the elf away while Blaze and Ember could remain behind and begin some initial excavation.

It was nice to close his eyes and let the cold water run over him.  \"I'll r-request that Fang accompany me when I ret-turn.\"  Six said as he prepared to take off from the ledge of the lava tube.  \"Maybe I'll even have one or two more drakka when I get b-back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-hum.\"  Blaze grunted without opening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dig straight into the walls of the tube where I marked, Lord Flame.  There'll be enough w-work to occupy both of you until I r-r-r... get back.\"  Six finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just nodded, but he heard Ember reply, \"We'll be able to manage on our own.\"  This was followed by the sound of leather tightenning as Six flapped away.  Then there was silence.  At least until someone put their claw on Blaze's tail, about halfway up the thick part.  Blaze released a grunt and opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber was climbing in with him.  With their two volumes together, the small pool began to overflow and spill its banks, but neither dragon particularly cared.  Blaze said nothing, letting the drakka do as she would.  When she slid in alongside him, he did think that she fit against him rather nicely, though it was a bit odd that he was the bulkier of the two of them now.  \"Ember...\"  he whispered, still a little cautious of the restraining collar on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he wasn't zapped.  Emboldened, Ember said, \"Blaze...\"  seeming to relish in the freedom of at least being able to say each other's names, even if they couldn't say their own aloud.  She move her claw to Blaze's breast, running down the slick scales there.  At her touch, Blaze was filled with passion so that it was an effort to restrain himself, or even think of a reason to restrain himself.  But it just didn't feel like the proper moment for that.  Blaze sighed and relaxed more into the pool. Due to its size, his tail was left beached on the far end of the rocky cistern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky overhead was deeping into a rich lavender.  Blaze could have drifted off to sleep right there.  Ember broke the quiet between them.  \"What's going to happen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked at her out of a corner of his eye.  His active hormones sensed an oppertunity, so he said, \"Whatever you'd like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed his snout away gently.  \"I mean with us, on this island...  We still need to think about a way to escape...  don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was strangely stressed on the question.  Blaze, however answered mellowly, \"Of course we'll get out of here.  We just need to play along and wait until the right moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when is that moment?\"  asked Ember, adjusting herself against Blaze's heavier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shrugged in the water. \"I don't know.  But we'll know when we see it.\"  Ember still seemed distant, so he added, \"But the point is that the worst is over.  We survived!  We'll have time to settle in and think about things later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if the best time to escape is now?\"  Ember persisted to Blaze's mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze huffed.  \"I think they'll be expecting that.  We ought to wait until their guard is down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when will that be?\" said Ember, he voice slightly strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked at her again.  \"Ember, how could I possibly know that?\"  He wanted to ask what was with her all of a sudden, but bit his tongue because he didn't want to ruin the mood they'd had just a few moments ago. \"We just need to hold out until the right time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blaze's efforts seemed in vain, Ember looked to be on the verge of tears as she said, \"Blaze, do you understand what you're saying?  Don't you remember what they brought us here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right.  Blaze had almost forgotten that they were here specifically so that they could be bred. He swallowed a sip from the water pouring over then and then said, \"It's a hard thing, sweet Ember.  I don't have an answer except that we're not in cages anymore, and I think that has to count for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber said nothing.  Instead she clung tighter to Blaze, wrapping her forpaws around his chest and entwining her tail with his.  After a little while, she said quietly, \"I just want to be away from this place...  I miss my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the only home he'd ever known was an orphanage in New Alveri, Blaze said, \"I do too.\"  Then he placed his claws around her as well, the water supporting them both.  It felt so nice to hold her that Blaze never wanted to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze found himself awakening unexpectedly, not having realized he'd drifted off.  Ember was still in his arms, the water still pouring over them both, boucing off their scales obliviously.  Despite the tropical climate, Blaze was a little cold.  Despite the cold, Blaze felt familiar longings with his drakka companion so close at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze found himself adjusting his hips before he half understood what he was doing.  But when the large slit on his abdomen pressed against Ember's belly, the heat of passion built up a pressure in the drake's head that ached to followthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber stirred at Blaze's touch.  At first she was responsive, even reaching out her wing to enfold Blaze and pull him closer.  Blaze would have grinned, but there was little happiness in him just now, but rather a single minded, animalistic need.  In just a few moments, Blaze had escaped his sheathe and with his claws around Ember's shoulders, began to beg entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could, however, Ember became fully awake.  \"Blaze... what... Oh! hey, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze almost didn't.  It would have been easy enough, despite the fact that Ember was only slightly smaller than himself.  However when Ember pushed him away and his desire strongly fought to pursue anyways, the image of Dr. Moriden came back to mind.  A memory from over a year ago and a question.  \"What would you do? If there were a horny drakka, right in front of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory repulsed him utterly and he let go.  Ember discreetly exited the pool and shook herself off, but more quickly than was really needed.  She took a breath to steady herself.  The sight of her lean frame and her extended wings, dripping with water was not helping Blaze pull himself back together.  \"Sorry.  I thought you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber cut him off.  \"It's alright, it's...\"  She let out a breath, turned back to Blaze still sitting stupidly in the water and put a small smile on her face.  \"Really, it's alright.  It's just me, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze took a couple breaths as well, waiting until he was alright to stand.  He clamored out over the edge of the pool and shook like a dog.  \"S'fine.\"  Blaze said, though his body still ached with the anticipation of moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them said anything for a few moments, so the tension was palpable.  Blaze just wanted to forget this as soon as possible, but couldn't so long as there was hope...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber took a deep breath, looking up she said, \"The sky's lightening.  We ought be be able to start some excavation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes!  Let's get to work building our new den.\"  said Blaze.  With hope dead for now, he felt relieved, ambiguity was torturous.  Blaze took the lead in scaling up the cliff to the hole.  Really, it was a relief to vent his energy into the dark stone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Six was gone for three days. It was so long, in fact, that Blaze was strongly considering flying back to Fort Carmile to see what was happening. He didn't mostly because he was enjoying the \"freedom\" away from Fang and the rest of the Kleaves too much. That and the time he was able to spend alone with Ember.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter the incident in the waterfall pool, Blaze made sure to reign in his passion, however, it was a constant challenge. Blaze could not help but fantasize endlessly of caressing Ember, grasping her, and much much more. He was sure that the lust and cravings for Ember's body that he felt whenever she was near was far more extreme than was normally called for, thanks to the diabolical tampering of Dr. Moridin. In all honesty these frenzied desires that were increasing day by day scared him. Dr. Mordin words rang in his head again and again, that he was no better than an animal and that day by day he was turning into what Flamer-2 had been, a prisoner of his own bestial lusts. The work on the tunnel was a godsend rather than a chore. The menial labor helped relieve Blaze of the constant temptation of his partner and so he would throw himself into the work when he was feeling particularly frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber chatted about the domicile they were crafting. She seemed soothed by the idea-work in opening the closed spaces rather than the actual work. As a result, she did less work than Blaze and had a tendency to stand by and instruct him, but honestly, Blaze didn't mind. With his great strength, the basalt gave way under his claws as if it were clay. While she did not have the same mind for the specifics of ducts and troughs for running water as Flamer-6 did, Blaze nonetheless found himself deeply impressed with her ideas for the layout of the lair, utilizing the long straight passage of the lava tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep the floor flat here, but about two wing-lengths away, we can include a ledge for sleeping on.\" Ember would say and Blaze would be left trying to visualize distances into solid rock; usually with only marginal success. When the first chamber was opened up, Ember found more enthusiasm for smoothing the floor and walls and ensuring that there was a proper shelf for sleeping on. As for the excess stone and debris created from the excavation, Blaze just threw this down at the base of the lava tube, not knowing what else to do with it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe time that was not spent inside the lava tube was typically spent out and about the island. Blaze followed more than led during their flights about the island (besides, the view of Ember was good from behind). They circled the place more than twice, soaring on coastal breezes and climbing on warm thermals. They didn't talk much in the air. Ember often seemed lost in thoughts and emotions that were mysterious to Blaze. He was treading carefully around her, but ever his own feelings and impulses drove him to get closer. They hunted twice in the time that Six was gone. The first time, Blaze snagged another buffalo and Ember chowed down on a sow that she'd found some place. The second time they went fishing for dolphin along the shores on Ember's suggestion that they be more careful in harvesting the island's supply of meat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn the mornings and the evenings, they found time to talk. In all honesty, they didn't really know each other all that well. Ember was shocked to hear that Blaze was an orphan and also somewhat disappointed to learn that he remembered nothing of his parents and that his life had been pretty unremarkable before being captured by Kleaves. However, Blaze was surprised to find how fascinated Ember was about the city of New Alveri, it being a wondrous and exotic realm of endless wealth and opportunity. Blaze, having lived there all his life, frankly he saw many of these things as mundane and also as a struggle. All the same, Blaze told her not only of the city, but all the different dragons, like his friend Darzhja who he\u2019d always looked up to and who had aspirations of joining the Holy Knights, Iskierka and her artistic talents, Lady Ramoth and the humanoids and the things that happened within the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blaze, Ember told him many, many things about the wild tribes of dragons from beyond the Alverian border from which she hailed. When she told him of her story of how she'd been captured and under what circumstances she'd been away from her tribe at the time, Blaze was floored. Quickly, Blaze equated, \"Chieftain's daughter\" with \"princess\" and his respect and awe for the drakka grew even more intense, as did his feelings for her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I can understand why you left. I wouldn't want to be sent away from the only other dragons that I knew and cared for either.\" Blaze said as they sat beside the caldera lake the evening Ember found time to finally recite her story.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEmber sniffed. \"Leaving was the biggest mistake of my life. I should have listened to my mother. If I had, then I would never have ended up here.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze almost said, 'But then we would've never met,' but caught himself before he did. It would have been hollow and also rather selfish. They had both suffered too much pain and rape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve often thought about the same thing\u2026day after day\u2026 How I should have been stronger, fought harder, and wasn\u2019t such a scared little coward that day\u2026 Neither of us could have known that then, or could have conceived the hell that was waiting for us, yet here we are. I wish I could tell you that things are going to be all right, or that we\u2019re building a better tomorrow. Yet no matter how much we could pretend otherwise we\u2019ve still got those rings around our neck\u2026\u201d replied Blaze, his claw went to his neck, a reminder that even though life had taken a fa\u00e7ade of being tolerable, their freedom was only illusory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sighed and buried her face in her forepaws, grinding her chin into the loose soil at the edge of the lake. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying there is no way we can escape\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fortunate enough that the island is being run by an idiot\u2026\u201d he replied with a hollow laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing though\u2026 there\u2019s a difference between being a prisoner and being a slave. Dr Mordin, that demented elf who altered me, told me that he could dictate my will like a sweet instrument or bend it out of tune, that ultimately we dragons just slaves to our lusts and impulses and that eventually he\u2019d turn me into little more than a beast. He tried\u2026by the Ancestors he tried\u2026 The things they did to me, the things they\u2019ve yet to force me to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe shook his head and scrunched his teeth together, \u201cI\u2019ll have nightmares about them for the rest of my life\u2026 however long that is. Yet they won\u2019t turn me into an animal like Flamer-2 was. I won\u2019t be a slave\u2026\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEmber shifted her body and merely gazed at Blaze long and hard. Blaze, acting on impulse, flowed forward, laying a wing on Ember's crimson scaled back and grasping an elbow in a strong claw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, I don't know how I can go on.\" She sobbed once. \"Sometimes I don't know if I want to go on. Yet you gave me a reason Blaze\u2026 A reason to keep going no matter how bad things get...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze could only concur with that as he held her close, greatful that the Ancestors had given him that reason to continue to live\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018clap\u2019 \u2018clap\u2019 \u2018clap\u2019 \u2018clap\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two dragons suddenly curved their heads around. There stood Fang, clad in his flowing red robe with that clever smile on his face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cVery inspiring speech Blaze!! I can see why she likes you so much\u2026\u201d he cried, with almost genuine pride.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFang!! How by the Ancestors did you sneak up on us like that?\u201d Blaze cried, instinctively shielding Ember with his wing. Though the elf was no taller than the top of his extended elbow, he nonetheless exuded an aura of authority that even a breeder male would be wary of.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIf I told you, it wouldn\u2019t be so effective anymore now would it? To tell you the truth Blaze, I agree wholeheartedly with the content of your speech. You\u2019re no good to me as slaves; in fact, as we\u2019ve seen we get a lot more done when you\u2019ve got something to look forward for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI must say, that\u2019s quite ironic coming out of you\u2026\u201d he replied with an eye roll. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d want us to do?\u201d he added. Blaze knew that Fang often enjoyed bantering with him, but at the same time he didn\u2019t want to push too far either. In the meanwhile, Ember stayed silent through the exchange. She was still unused to Fang\u2019s unconventional style of ruling, compared with Allorahs strict and direct regime.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I figured I\u2019d let you know that the other four drakka have all arrived on the island right now and are working on the lair.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSparkles, Starry, Cherry and Rocket are all here now?\u201d cried Ember, seeming both surprised and also slightly alarmed. The news had also caught Blaze off guard, and also rather resentful that he would have to share now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You two have been doing quite a good job so I figure you deserve this time off. I must also add that the friend of yours, Flamer-6, he really knows his stuff. Had I known he was a Damescaran architect beforehand\u2026well\u2026perhaps its best we not go into that discussion hmmm? If you really must have orders, I\u2019ve been curious about the properties of this cinnabar and its effect upon dragons\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFang pulled out a large pouch the size of a camping pack and levitated it over to the two young dragons. Already, Blaze could taste the slight scent seeping out of the bag\u2026. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Cinnibar...\" Blaze muttered under his breath as the heavy looking satchel of the unseen, but smelt red power floated closer towards him.  Weightlessly, the sack flew up to land casually on the red dragon's broad snout, Fang not even bothering to wiggle his fingers, but rather staring smugly up at him.  Blaze's mouth watered, he knew already the effect of cinnibar on him, while Ember hovered closely at his side, watching and unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the bag settled onto the scales of his nose as Fang released the power suspending it.  The muscles in Blaze's body tensed.  How nice it would be to float free in the grip of the cinnibar, and how nice also might it be if it eased Ember's sense of reservation, if she might allow him to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular dragon snapped his nose upward, sending the bag soaring into the air, where it crashed with a thud at Fang's feet.  Red dust sparkled upward from where it had shot out from under the flap closing the satchel.  Fang crossed his arms, but he did not look displeased.  Blaze stared down at him, defiantly, not caring if Fang decided to punish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that you are still so reserved.  I thought you might desire some comfort after all you've been through.\"  said Fang simply and hauled up the leather sack by one of its straps as if it weighed no more than a feather pillow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinnibar is false comfort.\"  said Blaze, standing firmly upright and towering over the smaller elf.  \"And I know that you only want the eggs Ember and I might make if we let our guards down using it.\"  Ember shot him a look after he spoke that made Blaze think he might pay for his presumption later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang only shrugged.  \"Naturally.\"  Now he slung the sack of mineral powder over his slender shoulder.  \"But just because something might benefit me, doesn't mean that it automatically hurts you.  Consider this also.\"  said the elf as he began to turn and leave the two dragons beside the quiet lakeside.  \"You'll be making eggs anyways.  Why not make it easier for yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden chill ran down Blaze's spine at Fang's words.  But this was shortly followed by a surge of rage.  Not thinking at all, but unable to restrain himself, Blaze reared up, his fore paws shaking in the tropical breeze and then charged down the elf.  Fang was already ahead of the two dragons by a good margin and before Blaze could reach Fang, to offer at least a gesture of disobediance and force Fang to defend himself, the elf turned behind a tree.  Blaze grabbed at it, claws slicing through the air where the elf had been, but they found only the bark of the tall tree, into which his claws rended deep grooves and almost stuck.  It was as if the earth had swallowed up the elf, leaving no trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how he does that.\"  said Ember, waltzing up behind Blaze and placing her wing gently on the drake's quivering shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze turned in anger, ready to strike her, but Ember's face  and the cant of her wings chilled the rage in Blaze, transmuting it into softer emotions.  But she started, she'd seen the hate on Lord Flame's face.  There was a moment of tension, but it passed.  Blaze cleared his throat and said, \"If we knew that, we'd be a step closer to being able to defeat him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ember said something that surprised Blaze.  \"Maybe it doesn't have to come to killing.\"  Blaze gaped, lost for words and she spoke again, withdrawing her wing, \"I'd be fine with simply being away from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze wanted to argue the point, but the words he wanted didn't come.  He wanted to tell her that killing Fang was the only real hope of escape, and that he ought to pay for what he did.  But Ember's face told him that an argument for revenge wasn't what she wanted to hear right now.  Blaze's mouth continued to stand open stupidly, it was as if the old words, the old feelings were slipping through his paws, and he could not pin them down, make them real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a crash of pain filled Blaze's head and he covered his eyes with his wing, eyes smarting in the late afternoon sun on the ocean.  \"Blaze?\"  asked Ember, her sweet voice filled with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain seemed to go on for a time, blotting out reality and making Blaze feel numb and empty, as if he were nothing so much as a hollow egg.  There was nothing to his thoughts but confusion and a sense of loss, but underlying that, a glowing coal of rage that would have reminded Blaze of those burning eyes he'd seen in the pool of lava he'd created by the power of his breath.  That is, he would have if he was capable of assembing something so complex as a recollection in that moment when the threads of his thoughts seems frayed by a howling wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as suddenly as it had come, the headache passed. Blaze stared at Ember, watching her mouth move and hearing sounds, but not making any sense of what she was saying.  \"...you alright?\"  said Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words snapped into place, like a lens setting in.  Blaze shook his head like a dog, as if he could remove the moths that had seemed to settle between his ears.  \"I'm alright.\"  he said, though he didn't really feel alright.  His mind felt somehow hot, as if his brain were still settling back into place.  \"It's nothing.\"  said Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked at him curiously, but didn't press him.  The red drake stared off at the visible crest of ocean which was framed by the rising sides of the volcano, calming himself, but wondering what on earth had just happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have time for a quick swim.\"  said Ember, her voice cutting through the fog and drawing Blaze up like a drowning man.  \"Fang shouldn't be expecting us back too soon.  Hell he might even want us to spend more time to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze silenced her by placing a wing tip to her lips.  \"Don't say that.\"  said Blaze and then moved the wing tip with its smooth talon down the scales of her neck to first caress and then gather her up by the shoulders.  In this way, he guided her down the flat bank and into the cold waters of the basin.</span></div></div>",

It crumbled in his paws like chalk, but after several hours of excavation, the red drake was hot and weary with the effort. Pulling back from the wall where he\u2019d been expanding the latest chamber off the chute of the lava tube, the dragon flexed his paws, trying to work the ache out of them. Heaving a great sigh that expanded the drakes deep chest, Blaze turned away from his work. The last effort was to sweep away the basalt chunks with his tail. The brittle stone that landed on the curved ridged stone of the central tube sounded almost like glass breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch where you\u2019re throwing that stuff!\u201d came a shout from the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked curiously sidelong. He\u2019d almost forgotten about the crew. Fang had assigned them here a couple days ago, to help with the excavation work. Six had them mostly carving air ducts and water spills. Some of that work required raw material to be added to certain areas, so a few men were constantly in and out of the tube, scavenging for proper sized rocks to bring to their projects. Blaze thought a moment about apologizing, but then reconsidered. After all the man was here to assist him and the other dragons who lived here. He ought to be more observant and not force Blaze and the others to be constantly watching their toes, in fact, he was lucky that he hadn\u2019t decided to kill the offending human for talking back to him. \u201cI thought you wanted more rocks?\u201d said Blaze flippantly, and immediately regretted the words that had spilled out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut rather than a retort, Blazes comment was met with silence. The man averted his eyes and then seemed to find urgent business elsewhere. Blaze remembered just then that his proper title was indeed Lord Flame, and that carried significant weight around here. The young dragon still felt uncomfortable wearing such a name, but then there was nothing to do about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze slithered out of the perfectly circular entrance of the lava tube and down the steep path that led to the stream basin. His wings flared a couple times as he skipped down the slope, black pebble following in his wake. It wasn\u2019t anything like a good flight, but the fresh air rushing past the red dragons face was lovely none the less. At the bottom of the slope, Blaze braked and let himself into the pool with only a medium sized splash; medium for a dragon, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pool walls had already been raised and reinforced from what they had been and now the pool was deep enough for a shallow dive, even if it remained rather too narrow for laps. The cold water was bliss on his dusty scales and when Blaze lifted his head free from the water, he guzzled gallons of fresh water from the trickle of stream which fed the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after he\u2019d slacked his thirst that Blaze realized that he was not alone in the pool. Green eyes met his, but rather than surprised, they seemed interested and calculating. \u201cWell, hello there,\u201d said the drakka in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze curved his head to the other drakka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well now, this is going to be interesting...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze seemed momentarily stunned. Seeing only the head above the surface of the rippling water, he could not at first gather the identity of the stranger so near to him that he could feel their tails mingling at the bottom of the pool. But then her scent floated into his nose and the memory came free like a chuck of quartz stuck in the basalt. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026um\u2026 Starflare aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts Sparkles actually,\u201d said the drakka coyly. Blaze curved his head away, a little bit embarrassed he\u2019d forgotten her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you flying some supplies here from the colony,\u201d said Sparkles, \u201cI imagined what it\u2019d be like meeting you up close, but wow, you\u2019re seriously hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said it caught Blazes attention in the way that Embers usually did. That is to say, he grew more aware of his own loins in response. \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019m still not used to drakka thinking of me like that. Believe it or not, I used to laughed at for being a 1000 pound weakling,\u201d he replied with a chuckle, unable to resist the temptation to flex his chest and stomach muscles in response. \u201cNow that you mention it, I think you\u2019re quite comely yourself\u2026 I can't believe I haven't gotten to meet you until now,\u201d said Blaze. Below the surface of the water, he thought she was beginning to play with his tail with her own, but it could have been his imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve only been here a few days,\u201d she said bashfully, \u201cAllorah has me taking directions from that scarred drake...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Six,\u201d said Blaze automatically. Below the water, he felt the drakkas tail pause and then slowly begin to wrap around his own. He noticed how her own tail was more slender than his, but softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Six,\u201d said Sparkles offhandedly. Then, with unknowing cruelty, she added, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell really like a drake anymore though, does he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that she hadn\u2019t meant to anger him, or perhaps she had meant to embolden his masculine pride, yet Blaze let his head sink into the water until only his nostrils, eyes and horns were above the surface. A tangled mixture of anger, pity, empathy and relief flowed through him at the reminder of what had been taken from Six. Anger, because the handicapped drake was his friend, but at the same time relief that clearly there was no competition for maleness on this island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka seemed to realize the error of her comment and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Honeysweet told me that you and him are close.\u201c Then she drifted closer to him, paddling with her feet until Blaze could feel the tips of her toes making eddies which collided with his body with the softness of clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t his fault\u201d said Blaze, lifting his head and looking directly at Sparkles. \u201cIt could have easily been me,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, before he got, well, scarred, he actually told me that he thought you were really cute.\u201d Sparkles\u2019 eyes grew very wide and she let in a breath. How odd that her face should seem small and thin; he really was gigantic for a male fire drake. He wasn\u2019t that much bigger than Ember, but now that he thought of it, Ember was the biggest out of all the females there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his snout away then, to look off into the jungle. But a clawed hand on his jaw turned him back. Sparkles had come yet closer, she was almost belly to belly with him as they floated in the water. The closeness of her and her scent cause the water about his nethers to warm in a way that was beyond Blazes control. \u201cI think that its amazing that you care for him, after the way you males were treated back on the other island. I heard stories...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles retreated, and Blaze was briefly angry at this too. The pull away from her was like a magnetic tug, but he forced himself to allow her distance. The drakkas claws rose and splashed water against her cheeks, which had begun to dry. The droplets were like rubies glistening on her hide. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about what they did to us. It was the closest thing to the hell humans speak about sometimes that I could imagine. But they didn\u2019t force us to kill each other. And they didn\u2019t do... other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakkas lower jaw quivered and strangely, Blaze felt like comforting her, though it was he that these heinous things that she darent speak of had been done to. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that we all managed to make it through alive. I think thats all can be said about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we made it out alive... \"said Sparkles, now a little distantly. A long moment past then with neither of them talking. The only sound was of the parrots chattering in the dense trees overhead. Then her claw was on his shoulder, her digits gripping the wing joint where it sprouted from his flank. \u201cI can see why Honeysweet likes you, Lord Flame. You actually care about us,\u201d He put weight on his wing joint and lifted herself a little out of the water, enough to get her face close to the side of his head.<br>\r\nBlaze drew in a deep inhalation of breath. The lust filling his body up from his stomach was almost impossible to ignore. If he turned now, and if she did not resist, he would take her, right in the pool. But what would Ember say if he did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lowered his nose into the pool and blew bubbles, not trusting himself to say anything. Slowly, Sparkles lowered herself from his back and drifted away on the current, coming to rest against one of the artificial sides of the pool. After about a minute holding his breath under water, he felt calm enough to speak. He paddled to the opposite side of the pool and though their tails still mingled, their hips were comfortably far apart. Sparkles looked disappointed, but thankfully she also seemd to understand why he might have been reluctant to be placed in a situation where he\u2019d cheat on Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of the new workers?\u201d asked Blaze because he simply could not think of anything else to talk about. Might as well talk about the shapes of the clouds really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the drakka turned her snout and sighed. But she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really like them. I don\u2019t like the way they smell. Or the way they talk. They\u2019re too smug, almost like they think they\u2019re better than us,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze nodded grimly, he had gotten that sort of vibe from a couple of the new workers, come to think about it. But Fang was always going on about the lack of workers on the island and deadlines and such other mind boggling affairs. He probably couldn\u2019t afford to keep only the good ones which knew their proper place around dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Six has told me that he and Fang were talking about gathering trolls from nearby islands. But if Fang treats them anything like the troll slaves back on the other island, I don\u2019t want anything to do with them,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles surprised him with a more cavalier response, \u201cOh, slaves can be fine, at least after a few generations. You can breed the rebelliousness out of them, you know, then they\u2019re just as docile and useful as you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mean just like us right?</i> <br>\r\nBlaze cocked his head. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019ve had slaves before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka brushed the side of her face with the knuckles of one claw and Blaze could almost imagine the fine gems which might have once sat on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell naturally. On the west coast of the continent, trolls will run amok if they don\u2019t have strong leadership. It\u2019s part of keeping the basic law and order really. Then the drakka lifted herself so her smooth, clamshell colored chest was exposed and stretched her arms out on the sides of the pool. She drew her claws down the stone shelf of that side, eliciting a screech that sent another pulse of delightful agony down to Blazes crotch. The smooth muscles of her lean arms stood against the scales of her arms and chest as she stretched and sighed before sliding back down into the water. \u201cI think they appreciate having the stability in their lives, in their own fashion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was fine for Sparkles to talk about slaves like that, all that came into Blazes mind were the whips and shrieks of pain from the trolls he\u2019d seen when he was first brought to the other island over the long sea journey from Damescara which seemed so long ago now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was finally feeling comfortable and rested now and was beginning to contemplate how he might excuse himself from Sparkles without offending her. He knew he\u2019d be having sex with all of them eventually, yet he\u2019d still rather do it with Ember first before going to any of the others. Next time he saw her, perhaps it would be a fine idea to get that out of the way and figure out between the two of them how he\u2019d sort out their relationships with all the other drakka. He was just about to step out of the water, when there came a sound on the wind...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that moment, a powerful explosion erupted from the settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!!\" yelled Blaze. A rush of adrenaline pulsed through his veins as Blaze twisted his head in the direction of the blast, and could only gawk with disbelief as a column of smoke arose from the Fort Carmine settlement. Was this a chance for escape? Had the Empire launched a rescue mission? Yet this momentary hope was tempered by suspicion. He couldnt afford to make that assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lord Flame, stammered Sparkles, pressing her shivering body against him, \"W-whats going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dont know!\" retorted Blaze, more forcefully than he would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he watched the smoke arise from the settlement, he once again wondered if this was a chance for an escape, but something in his gut told him otherwise. The Empire didn't resort to surprise attacks like this; no...this felt similar to the attack on New Alveri, sudden and without warning, and completely indiscriminate. He had no love for the Kleaves, but for a moment, Blaze found himself back in New Alveri, that small drake helpless to do anything to stop the unfolding disaster. Blaze grit his teeth as he thought back on his weakness, and then at Sparkles who was gazing up at him with a simultaneously pitiful and endearing dependence. There was total mind-breaking panic in those eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze could not afford to panic, not now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get back to the lair!! See if everyones alright!!\" said Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the lair? Oh Ancestors!! What if there's an attack on the lair as well? What if theyve come to hunt us down!!\" wailed Sparkles, \"What if theyre already dead!! What if its already too late!! Weve got to get out of here!! Weve got to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkles!!\" yelled Blaze, shocking her out of her panic, \"We don't even know who <i>they</i> are!! If the lair has in fact been invaded and whoever did this means us harm, then I'll destroy them without exception, mark my words. Stay close to me and you'll come out fine all right? Now lets go!!\" said Blaze. Sparkles nodded hesitantly. It would have to do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze rushed back toward the lair, his hearts beating furiously, hoping that Ember, Six and the others were alright. As Blaze ascended the cliffs, he could see the settlement being continuously bombarded by some unknown ships. Fang was somewhere down there, having been supervising the construction of the coastal bombardment. Blaze wondered why he even cared what became of Fang been at the settlement when the explosion hit. Regardless, Fang would have to fend for himself for the time being. What did matter was the scent of blood emanating from the still uncompleted lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he landed, he was greeted by a large mass of humans going at one another. Whatever battle order that the Kleave guards had possessed degenerated into a chaotic mass as they were busy fighting off what appeared to be the workers. The bodies of both several workers but he didnt take much time to examine them though he did notice that their wounds were not from falling stone but from blades and hammers. \"Down with the heretics!! For the glory of God!!\" yelled one worker as he stabbed through a Kleave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazes indifference vaporized when he saw Ember rushing out of the chamber to greet him. A wild rage consumed him when he saw a trail of blood run down her front leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember!! Are you all right!!\" yelled Blaze. Ember wiped a trail of blood from the side of her flank, \"I'm all right Blaze, but things have gone to the powers below. Some of the human workers were posing as spies and assassins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Six and the others!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got separated from them when two dragons arrived inside. I dont know who they are or where they are from, but theyre not Kleaves. Last I saw, Six, Allorah and the others had barricaded the entrance at the main sleeping chamber,\" said Ember. Blaze gave a slight nod; Six was resourceful like that, but he wasn't much of a fighter, especially not after he'd been culled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we dont have much time,\" replied Blaze. \"We've got to push through this mass of humans to get to them. Just stay close to me and knock aside any humans that manage to get past me all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber gritted her teeth and nodded, yet Sparkles still looked extremely hesitant. Blaze sighed. Sparkles was going to be a liability in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkles,\" said Ember, tugging her, \"We'll be safe with Flame...\" Sparkles nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowled his way forward, knocking aside any human who dared get in his path like so much ash and trash, whether they be Kleaves or this unknown group of assassins. At this point, it made no difference to Blaze. Ember did her part, backing him up and trampling whatever humans had gotten past him, while Sparkles merely kept her head down and staggered forward, squealing with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the entrance to the half completed sleeping chamber in what seemed like no time at all. Six and the others had barricaded themselves in the chamber with a large pile of rock and loose metal. Two dragons were busy trying to dig their way through, while a group of about ten humans, each clad head to toe with armor, formed a perimeter around them. The prominent cross displayed on their chest mail indicated removed any notion that these people were from New Alveri, and the large number of Kleave corpses around them suggested that they were a step up from the rest of these mysterious infiltrators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people and what do you want?\" Blaze shouted. Immediately, the human warriors raised their crossbows at him, while the two dragons snapped around and crouched into a fighting stance. Yet despite this rather formidable force deployed against him, Blaze felt no fear as he stepped forward from between Ember and Sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the mysterious humans stepped forward, revealing what looked to be the leader of this group of raiders. Like the other humans, he was clad with heavy armor, but oddly enough seemed to be armed with only a pair of double knives that looked more stylish than functional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace brothers,\" said the leader, holding up his arms. The assorted warriors lowered their crossbows as the human leaned out from the dragon's mount, \"On behalf of Master Jiao, the Grand Master of the Order of the Hospitallers, and in the name of the Lord, I greet you dragon. I am Knight Captain Luvain, of the Order of the Hospitallers,\" he introduced. Blaze frowned, he wondered how anybody could sound so composed and controlled with all the carnage going on; he'd been fooled by the honeyed words of others before, and thus there was no way he was about to take this man at his word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I care what your name is or what clique of terrorists you belong to? What I do know is that you attacked my lair without any reason whatsoever!!\" shouted Blaze. To the humans credit, he did not flinch backwards at the threat, continuing to gaze at him arrogantly, as if he were the dragon and Blaze the puny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to make presumptions of us? No, our cause is just, and it is our duty to cleanse the world of sin. If anything, you represent the embodiment of sin, breeder male, but the Lord is forgiving, and he gives you this one chance join our cause and fight against the evil of the Kleaves, to fight for your vengeance!!\" cried Luvain, clenching his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze growled, \"And why should I believe you would keep your word? What assurance do I have that you won't just kill us all once we're no longer useful?\" he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ancestors, I don't want to die...I don't want to die...\" stammered Sparkles. To Blaze's exasperation, Sparkles had gone catatonic again, shivering against the cave wall, while Ember had made her way over to her to make sure nobody snuck up on her. No matter how much he disdained these people, at the same time he didn't want the drakka to get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose to go against the Lord, then you will surely die,\" said Luvain, \"Our fleet has surrounded this island and will cleanse it of the evil that infects it. Should you choose to go against us, then we will have no choice but to purge you in the name of the Lord,\" he cried.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old saying went, that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. As these Hospitallers had attacked the settlement, and by extension the Kleaves, the organization that had imprisoned and tortured him, should he not be joining these people in order to get revenge? Yet despite all the flowery rhetoric, Blaze could not shake that feeling in his gut, that they were not who they said they were.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The Kleaves have committed numerous crimes against me, my home and my friends, they attacked my home, they kidnapped me and inflicted all sorts of horrific, unspeakable things to me. They've forced me to commit all sorts of terrible atrocities and treated me like a slave,\" said Blaze.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLuvain smiled, but it was not a very pleasant kind of smile. \"Quite so... Having been subjected to such blasphemies, is it not natural that a dragon such as yourself should join with our order? Why should you continue to be forced to toil in the name of such evil?\" said Luvain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should have been a no brainer, but if there was anything that his captivity had taught him, nothing was what it seemed to be. The rescue workers who had meant to save him from the New Alveri attack had actually been kidnappers, and there was no reason to believe that this Hospitaller was telling him the truth either. Yet what lent him the most suspicion was the doctrine they were following. Blaze's gaze then switched over to the two dragons, who merely stared ahead as if they were a pair of complaint horses. Now that he thought about it, neither of those two dragons had said a word throughout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two,\" said Blaze, gazing at the two dragons they rode. \"What sort of master is Luvain? Does he treat you well and honestly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Master Luvain is a wonderful owner. I would do absolutely anything for the Master,\" said the first dragon. He sounded very much like the eunuch Flamer-1, who had thrown away his will for the predictability of obedience. So, these dragons were no better than than what he was under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" replied Blaze, \"Do you ever stop to question what exactly your Master is utilizing you for? What do you fight for?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Why must I question?\" said the other dragon dispassionately, \"Master Luvain serves under the guidance of Lord Jiao, who is all wise and powerful, and under his guidance we spread the word of the Lord. So long as I serve the order then I know that even if I were to fall, I will join God in heaven...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze froze in complete shock. He'd never considered himself particularly religious while he was growing up in the orphanage, but for a dragon to openly renounce the Great Dragons above was abhorrent. Thus far, these Hospitallers had shown that they subjected their dragons to an indoctrination every bit as cruel as the Kleaves had, but the prospect of abandoning the Ancestors was too terrifying and abhorrent to contemplate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... T-that can't be true, it just can't, t-that's impossible,\" whined Sparkles, rocking back and forth in fear, \"T-the Ancestors protect us... and keep us safe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Ancestors will not protect you drakka, your soul will only be saved if you accept the Lord as your savior...\" said the dragon in what was meant to be a comforting tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be silent accursed one!!\" hissed Ember, wings unfolding with rage, blocking Sparkles as if to shield her from the aura of falsehood the enemy dragon was attempting to spread, \"You poison the very air itself with your heretical filth!! If you abandon the Ancestors you may as well be a dead puppet!!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Do not speak ill of the Lord you pagan witch!! You will burn in hell for besmirching his name!!\" preached the first dragon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey!! Don't you dare threaten Honeysweet you heretic piece of shit!! Apologize now!!\" roared Blaze.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Only if you renounce your false Ancestors!! Heathen!!\" replied the dragon. To put a particular emphasis, he made a sign of the demonic cross with his claw.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat was all that he needed to hear and see. It was one thing to get enslaved by some evil order, but the fact that these dragons had openly spurned the Ancestors and threatened Ember was unforgivable. Blaze let out a roar and surged forward, slashing one of the 'Knights' into bloody ribbons. A moment later, a hail of crossbow bolts shot toward Blaze. With reflexes he'd never known he'd had, he twisted sideways and whipped his wing outwards, knocking away the bolts as if they were nothing more than bits of straw, before wheeling forward to bowl over a group of Knights.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ember leapt into the fray and let out a burst of flame, engulfing about three of these heretic 'Knights' instantaneously. However, the Knights regrouped, but to Blaze's dismay, they went after Sparkles. Luvain raised one of his knives and tossed it at her face. Blaze leapt sideways and intercepted it with his wing. It wouldn't have been a critical injury by any means, but having Sparkles catatonic in the corner was doing far more harm than good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honeysweet!! Get Sparkles somewhere safe!! I'll hold off these heretics here!!\" ordered Blaze.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"But Flame!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Do it now!!\" he retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancestors protect you Flame...\" said Ember, grabbing Sparkles and dragging her away from the fight.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Knights regrouped, focusing all their attacks on him. Blaze then realized that it perhaps wasn't a smart thing to face off alone against a group of well-trained Knights and the two Ancestor-spurning heretics (he refused to call them dragons). Yet there was no use bemoaning his fate now. He'd endured too much heartache and torture to be killed by heretic trash who worshipped an all powerful human or whatever they claimed their god to be. This was no time to think, he had to fight or die. And fight he did. Later on, he would only remember the next several minutes as a red haze. He recalled snatching a human with his jaw and literally chew on his flesh before spitting it out as if it were an oversized stick of processed cinnabar. He remembered picking up an elf by the head and closing his claw, leaving nothing more than a red and pink mess of blood and brain.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No!! My rider!!\" yelled one of the dragons, shaking catatonically and pitifully at the dying human. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze was not about to wait around and wait for his opponent to grieve. He charged forward and wrenched his jaws around the heretic's throat. The heretic screeched in agony as he tried to desperately throw him off, yet Blaze rolled over, quite literally snapping his neck open, tearing flesh and bone. The heretic flopped around as his neck dangled gruesomely and obsenely, spraying blood everywhere before the corpse mercifully collapsed upon the dirt. Blaze thought he should have felt bad for the poor soul, but the bastard had deserved it for abandoning the Ancestors and threatening Ember.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You savage!! You'll pay for killing Imperator!!\" yelled his companion.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh! I didn't know that you heretic slaves actually had thoughts of your own...\" sneered Blaze, his jaw dripping with blood. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Die!! In the name of the Lord!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe heretic dragon let out a roar and leapt at Blaze in a crazed rage. Blaze knocked the blows aside with an ease that was shocking; compared to the savage that Flamer-2 had been, this dragon was a weakling. No, it wasn't the dragon that was weak, it was Blaze who was the one that was strong. The Kleaves had made him into a breeder male, whose purpose of existence was to fuck and kill without remorse or mercy. Seizing the initiative, Blaze surged forward and slapped the heretic around as if he was nothing but a rag doll. In quick succession, Blaze bludgeoned the heretic across the face with his tail, slashed him across the belly, blocked away a counter-strike with almost contemptuous ease with a wing before responding with a vicious headbutt. The heretic dragon staggered backward, and sensing weakness, Blaze closed in for the kill, tacking him so that he was on his back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze leapt on top of him like the wild animal. The heretic dragon gazed up at him with fear and pity, \"P-please stop!! Lord have mercy!! Lord have...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBefore he could give his blasphemous prayer, Blaze grasped the heretic's head and twisted it around with a sickening snap.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh? What was it you about to say? I guess we'll never know because you're dead now,\" said Blaze mockingly, blood dripping from his maw. In his fury, Blaze continued to viciously mutilate the corpse of the heretic slave, only for a white light to appear. Blaze inexplicably found himself on his back, completely immobilized. To his rage and dismay, there stood the Hospitaller captain, holding out a holy symbol.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son and the Holy Spirit, I condemn thee to hell you foul wyrm, spawn of Satan!!\" he screamed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlaze went in a panic, he couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything!! That treacherous heretic had used those two dragons as bait so he could have time to charge up his spell!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deliberate slowness, Luvain atop of Blaze and lifted his knife, which glowed a whitish blue and aimed it at his neck. Blaze felt his breathing slow as he prepared to thrust it into his heart... With nothing else to do, all Blaze could do was pray to the Ancestors..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze was about to get out of the water when a sinuous tail held her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now Lord Flame, why don't you spend some more time with me? I want to talk more...\" said Sparkles blearily. She couldn't get the picture that Blaze wanted to get out now did she? It was at that moment that something broke within Blaze, that all that time of holding in his instincts exploded. If she was so insistent in having Blaze stay, then she would get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's eyes widened and he suddenly surged forward and pressed himself against Sparkles' body. Sparkles let out a high pitched, surprised, submissive noise, and Blaze suddenly felt a rush of power sweep over him, of the knowledge that he was going to take her and not only was there nothing she could do to stop him but that she would enjoy the fact he was dominating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lord Flame! I-I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Blaze wasn't having any of it as he twisted his neck around hers to silence her. Beneath the water, Sparkles twitched with protest, yet Blaze maneuvered himself and held her in place against the back of the bath wall, positioning his organ between her legs and thrusting inside. Sparkles let out a high pitched squeal as she threw her head back against the side of the pool, her vaginal walls contracting around his length. Being smaller than Ember, her walls were so much more delectably tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to thrust, water began to be thrown about as Sparkles laid back against the water spring and panted. Blaze no longer thought about what he was doing consciously, that he might be cheating on Ember, and let his animal instinct take over. He was a male and she was a female, and he was doing what a male of his species was supposed to do, which was fuck. Oh Ancestors, it had been far too long that his dick was inside a nice, hot pussy. Sparkles moaned and whined, gazing at him with teary eyes that were simultaneously fearful and deeply aroused. After a while, Sparkles stopped trying to resist him and instead resigned herself to lay there and take his relentless fucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ancestors! Its so big! Its tearing me apart!\" she wailed deliriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes whore!! Take it!! Take it all!!\" bellowed Blaze, his reason and sense having been lost<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fuck her he did, gripping her tighter as he felt the seed gather in his loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkles was now delirious, her mouth open and panting with a high pitched cry as Blaze pushed forward with one last powerful thrust and unloaded his semen into her. Blaze held her close as he squeezed the last drops of seed into her. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ember had watched the whole exchange happen, feeling a combination of rage and also longing as she saw Blaze fuck Sparkles. Blaze had told her that he had loved her, but the fact that he was fucking another female hurt her. What had been especially frightening, was how Blaze had been seemingly talking with Sparkles, having a normal conversation and Blaze even trying to restrain himself. Then, out of the blue he had completely lost control of his senses and raped her! She saw the bestial instinct of the breeder male subsume the decent drake that Blaze was; the dragon who was willing to risk her life to prevent her from being raped by Flamer 2.  True, they had both reconciled that as breeder male, such a step was inevitable, but still, actually watching him do it still hurt, it was frightening, and lastly and perhaps most frightening of all, it had also turned her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Flame... w-why? How could you... you...\" Blaze shifted his head around, to find Ember gaping at him with a betrayed look. The spell of lust that had enraptured him had instantly shattered as Blaze pulled out of Sparkles, who slunk back and gasped, completely spent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Ancestors Honeysweet,\" said Blaze, \"W-what just happened? What have I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Only when Sparkles was lying back against the pool, trembling and with a spaced out look on her face did Blaze realize what he had done. He had just cheated on Ember and not only that had taken Sparkles against her will!! No worse, he'd just raped her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkles, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!! I have no idea what came over me, I... I... and Honeysweet I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn't say anything else for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkles are you okay?\" said Ember, in a big sisterly way. Blaze recognized the tone as the sort of thing that the females used to comfort each other after the Kleaves had endured one of them to a particularly terrible torture session, but to think that in this instance, he had been the source of the misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" said Sparkles weakly, \"I... I'm okay. Don't worry about me Honeysweet.\" She was pulled out of the pool gingerly, and to Blaze's relief Sparkles was able to move on her own. There was a small trail of blood though, streaming from where Blaze had... attacked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Blaze?\" said Ember weakly. \"Why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember I'm sorry...\" whispered Blaze. \"I... I couldn't stop myself, I... I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I want to give you a nice fuck to make up for my little tryst</i> came the sinful thought that went through his mind. For a brief moment, he wanted to jump Ember the way he had just jumped Sparkles, but this time, with the shame still fresh, he stopped himself. What by the Ancestors was wrong with him? This wasn't him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was too much for Ember, who let out a wail stomping out of the vicinity in tears. She suddenly hated Blaze, for cheating on her, for what he had done so thoughtlessly to Sparkles; and for breaking her heart. She probably should have known better though. Blaze was a breeder male, and they had been specifically made to get them pregnant to facilitate the Kleaves quest for world domination. Yet was it really Blaze's fault? The Kleaves had made Blaze into a breeder male after all; to be nothing more than a wild beast like Flamer-2 had become, and in a sense they may have already succeeded to an extent. They had altered his physiology to the point where it could overwhelm ones reason and turn a dragon into a beast. What hurt the most was that Blaze had seemed to realize what was happening to him the entire process, and that he was scared of what he was becoming and that he really did care about everyone here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze only stared at his reflection at the pool. The dragon staring back was so unfamiliar. It still hadn't been too long ago where he had been a normal adolescent, but now this dragon, was almost completely unrecognizable. The dragon that stared back at him was a killer, a beast that had no control over its emotions and did whatever it please, but it was also a slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had vowed to fight what he was becoming, but was it even possible? Frankly, it would have been easier to just fuck them with reckless abandon; it would be far less painful that way, at least for him. But it was painful for them to be subjected to that sort of thing. To think that Blaze would be the source of the drakka's continued misery for who knew how long as almost too painful to contemplate. He wanted to make them as happy and comfortable as possible, but how could he do so if he couldn't control himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to set things straight with Ember, but... what if he attacked her? Maybe he should do something else, anything else than think about the drakka right now or else he'd do something he'd regret again. Maybe Fang had other things that needed doing?</span></div></div>",

You let the fight come to you on your own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we get to the fun part.  What breed of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Earth-Render:</u>  You are a unique class of dragon.  Rather than living in high mountain lairs, your kind prefer to burrow into the earth.  That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.  You hide has a pebbly texture and comes in various shades of brown from clay to light green. Your head is smooth and no spur or weapon lays at the end of your tail, but your large fore claws are good for more than just shoveling earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sky-Swallower:</u>  So named because when you take to the air, your wings seem to swallow the sky to lesser earth-bound mortals.  An enormous breed of dragon, your strength is matched only by the Juggernaut, and your sheer size by none.  You and your kin have often been mistaken for small hills while you lay dormant in hibernation.  You bulk is such that it can literally flatten a small village under it.  All that bulk means a big appetite, however, so big in fact, that you have to spend the majority of your year in a state of hibernation to conserve energy.  But the more food you can get your giant claws on, the less time you have to spend sleeping and the more time you can spend chasing down loot!  Your breed can come in a variety of colors but is usually brown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sea Stormer:</u>  While your kind don't actually live in the sea, long have you been associated with the surf and the pounding waves.  Weather just has a way of worsening when you are around and often, just the sight of you flying nearby is a reason to harbor the ships and close the storm blinds.  You don't spend much time in the water, but usually nest in seaside cliffs and dine primarily on fish caught at sea.  Of course, there is little wealth to be found at sea, unless you are looking for ships.  Instead of breathing fire, you can fill a very large sac at the base of your throat with water and expel it at high pressure.  Your kind have often been blessed by farmers looking for rain, but equally you have been blamed for creating cyclones and water-spouts...  Typically your kind comes in a light blue and white matching sea foam.  Pearly horns jut back from your head and fins at the end of your tail aid in both sky and water.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All in good sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.

As a Geminate drake, you have never had to worry about being alone because, as with all members of your breed, you were born as a twin. Geminate drakes reproduce in twos, no more, no less and each set of twins is intimately linked throughout their lives. The depth of the connection is such that Geminate twins are often referred to as a singular being and the custom is to have a single name consisting of two parts for each pair of drakes (for instance, a set of twins might be named Mal\u2019Drak with one twin being named Mal and the other named Drak). Pairs of Geminate drakes are usually inseparable; they hunt together, sleep together, live together and usually take mates together. All of this is due to a strong mental link between each dragon, the strength of the link varies from pair to pair ranging from the simple sending and receiving of messages to merger on the extent that it seems that there is a single entity occupying two bodies. Sibling rivalry is rare to the point of extinction, but famous cases have emerged in history; always it has ended in tragedy. Geminate drakes can typically be found roosting in mountain ranges, the dryer the clime, the better. As for size, the typical drake tends to be on the large size, dwarfing land bound beasts and mortals. While not exceedingly strong or fast or possessing fiery breath of significant note, your strongest strength lies in your constant companion and your ability to fight as the ultimate tag-team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Earth-Render:</u>  You are a unique class of dragon.  Rather than living in high mountain lairs, your kind prefer to burrow into the earth.  That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.  You hide has a pebbly texture and comes in various shades of brown from clay to light green. Your head is smooth and no spur or weapon lays at the end of your tail, but your large fore claws are good for more than just shoveling earth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Draconian Empire, or known otherwise as the Country of Nod, was the greatest bastion of civilization. Gathered as a union between human and dragon kind, it was a country of unimaginable wealth, great technological prowess, advanced magic and social harmony. There were many of course, who coveted that wealth and security, resented the greatness of the Empire, from both within and without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo combat these threats, the Temple Knights of Nod, or simply, the Knights, were created. These humans and dragons dedicated their entire lives to protect the lands and people they held dear, never flinching in duty. Many held the Knights with admiration and awe; to be a Knight was perhaps the greatest honor any man or drake could hope to achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Fangorn Irontail, a young bronze dragon, he had known these truths since the very day of his birth. His father, may the Great Ancestors watch over him, had been a famous general during the Draconic Civil War, and his grandfather had been a knight as well, and so had his father; all the way back to the founding of the Empire itself, or even before that to when the world itself was young, or at least it was said. With a large, powerful frame and stern bronze gaze, he towered over most his peers, and indeed, he seemed the fitting image of what a Knight was supposed to be. Much was expected of Fangorn, from his mother, to his elders who had known his father, to the clergy and from his peers; he would do great things, people said, defeat enemies and cover himself in glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that Fangorn would question this path in life that was set for him at birth, but on the contrary, Fangorn truly believed this. He truly believed he was destined for great things and make the Empire he served proud of him before the Ancestors. So therefore, Fangorn tried to live up to this reputation every day, in whatever duty that was assigned. However, he found the weight of expectations difficult, and the current posting he possessed tested that patient. He should be out on the Empire's borders, like in the west, defending against the nomadic dragons of the steppes. Or perhaps the south, guarding against the Dragonslayer Empire, one of Draconia's oldest and most dangerous adversaries who had staged a devastating attack, hoping to take advantage of the civil war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, Fangorn Irontail was busy guarding the gate. The gate! He would stand there, gleaming in his armor, trying to look mighty and intimidating and proud. Yet <i>Corporal</i> Fangorn Irontail felt anything but proud at the moment. It was mind numbing, dreary work, not at all suited to a dragon of his pedigree and talent. His father had been a proud general during the civil war, and his mother had also been a young heroine during the war, which had caught the eye of his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time, he wondered why he was trapped with such a dreary assignment. He had earned top marks amongst his peers and had taken the mantle of knighthood near the top of his class as well. Fangorn was proud of his combat prowess, for he was both fast and powerful, and there were few who could stand up to his blows. He had succeeded academically as well. Fangorn had always been taught to never question authority; that his elders always knew best, and to follow orders. Yet why? He should be better than this! However, this was his job, and he had to perform it at the best of his ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a test! A test of some kind to demonstrate humility. Yet the arrogant and proud bronze dragons often sound such a sentiment difficult, when they knew that they were the strongest of all dragonkind! To do otherwise was to waste their talents, or even dishonor them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that Fangorn would be insulted. However, what Fangorn was, was desperately bored. Every day, he watched mostly humanoids go about their day, going about their lives in blissful peace. Occasionally, they would try to talk with them, but Fangorn did not return their greetings. He wasn't supposed to speak with them, unless they had a pass that indicated they had official business. Those humans and dragons that did arrive usually went through the same process. Fangorn would check them in at the gate and let them through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would repeat the phrase over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Identification please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please check in all your belongings here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are cleared for entry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day, and may the Ancestors watch over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea how many times Fangorn had gone over that rote phrase. Fangorn prayed to the Ancestors for something, anything that would happen to shake this oppressive monotony. However, today would be a particularly odd and eventful day, as suddenly</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fangorn was shaken out of his stupor when there was a crash in front of the street. A young bronze dragoness had landed right in the middle of the street as the various humans gave her a wide berth. She strutted forward as if she owned the place, head held high and then strutted toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, arrogance was not exactly an uncommon trait amongst dragonkind, especially amongst the proud bronze dragons, but there was something about her that immediately irritated Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business here, fledgling,\" he growled. He hoped that using his strong, military voice would get the dragoness to show respect, as was expected from a member of her race, but instead, she grew more defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to gain entry into the temple, and become a Holy Knight of Draconia!\" the dragoness proudly and arrogantly declared at Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn thought about laughing out loud. This dragoness thought she could simply walk up to the gate and ask the nearest guard to join up? Fangorn had spent his entire life, more than three quarters of a century, working to become a Knight; he had endured long hours of discipline, academics and training to attain this position. Surely, someone with even the most basic education realized that one could not simply walk up to become a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" said Fangorn incredulously, \"And what makes you think I have the qualities to become a Knight!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a strong fighter, I train myself to get better every single day, and I take every opportunity to test out my skills!!\" said the dragoness. While on the surface, it seemed a shallow answer, had Fangorn at that point in time not lacked the knowledgeable, maturity or the ability to comprehend others, he would have noticed that despite her lack of education or her rough manners he would have noticed her conviction and clarity of purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, he did not, which unbeknownst to him at the time, was the reason why he was still guarding gates, and thus rudely responded, \"What against humans or elves?\" he chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness' gaze furrowed, deeply offended at his casual disregard for her conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! I'll show you how strong I am!!\" she bellowed, her eyes furrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn suddenly grinned nastily as the female bent into a fighting stance. Finally! A chance to show off his skills rather than just stand there all day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp, practiced technique, Fangorn surged forward and struck the arrogant dragoness in the stomach before she knew what hit her, and he quickly turned her over and pinned her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skill is lacking,\" growled Fangorn. He then let her up, but she continued to glare at him with hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home! Get out of here!! Before I decide to charge you for starting a public disturbance!!\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness glared back at her with shock and hatred; those eyes burned into his soul. and somewhere deep within, Fangorn knew that during that last exchange, he had got it wrong at some point, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back! Next time I meet I'll beat you!\" she hissed. Keeping her head held high, she spun about and stomped away. Fangorn looked passively ahead, but deep in his gut, he felt that something had gone wrong. He was too proud and stubborn to admit it, or even conduct a self-examination. For the rest of that day however, none of the humanoids ever waved or said hello as they passed by. They were whispering bad things about Fangorn, things about how badly he had treated that young dragoness and other rather dishonorable things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet the humans talk - they just rabbled amongst themselves anyhow. However, deep in his heart, a tiny voice inside him was doubting. It gnawed at his honor, it told him that he was an embarrassment of his proud lineage. It told him that the incident with the dragoness encapsulated why a dragon with as much pedigree and qualifications such as Fangorn, was still stuck guarding gates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fangorn filed his after action report that day to his superior, Lord Ragnor. Ragnor was a bronze dragon, like himself, and had been a friend and close comrade of his father Mnementh during the war. Since his father had died, Ragnor was like a second father to him and a mentor who cared deeply about the son of his old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anything of note happen today?\" asked Ragnor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn stared ahead, \"N...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought about saying that it was just an uneventful day to get his mentor off his back, but even at his lowest point, his honor would not permit him to lie. Furthermore, the human guards who accompanied him in watching the gate would have surely written a report on his conduct with that female that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, something of note did happen today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Ragnor. He had looked ready to explode had Fangorn tried to say otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Fangorn duly described the incident with the unruly bronze dragoness that he was forced to subdue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangorn, did it even occur to you that the Knights were in fact possibly recruiting? If she demanded to be a Knight, you could have easily directed her to the recruiting office. Explain to me why it is you did not do so,\" said Ragnor testily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragoness acted in a manner in which I judged that she had an intension of causing a public disturbance,\" said Fangorn, \"So I had little choice but to use physical force on her to subdue her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagnor glared at him with intense disapproval. While Fangorn was taller, stronger and more muscular than his mentor nowadays, he nonetheless felt tiny in his stern presence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you technically acted within military regulations, I feel, and what the human gate garrison commander concurs in his report, that you conducted yourself in a manner unbecoming of a Knight. Do you think that humiliating a young dragoness in the streets is considered remotely honorable? Did you stop to think for a moment that when the humans see one of their supposed draconic protectors wrestling a dragoness to the ground that they would feel proud of our great military institution we represent? There were several options you could have used to de-escalate the situation to ensure that both you and the dragoness could leave with your honor intact, yet you did not seem to be perceptive enough, well-schooled enough or mature enough to consider these alternatives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize sir. I will strive to ensure that this does not happen again,\" said Fangorn, with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagnor shook his head, \"No, it will not. You will be taken off guard duty and take a remedial course to relearn your duty. Effective immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir!!\" gasped Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts Fangorn! If you are going to do your duty, by the Ancestors, I am going to make sure you do it right!! If this rankles your honor, think about how dishonored that dragoness must have felt when you wrestled her to the ground!\" he snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" answered Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a salute to his superior, his mentor; and left Ragnor's lair glumly. It seemed like everything he had done since he had become a knight, Fangorn had been lacking in some way. Where was things going wrong? Was he simply cursed to mess up? His father certainly would not be proud of him after today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe numbly flew through the air back to his dormitory. While doing so, he spoke with nobody. Not with any of the officers, nor the new recruits, nor the human knights or the civilian contractors. The inner sanctum of the Knights was a place that not many non-military personnel got to see -  it was a huge grounds built into the ruins of an extinct volcano - about twenty million years ago, it had been one of the largest and most active in the world, but now, it formed an ideal closed community that could house thousands of dragons, and when one considers the size, strength and amount resources that a dragon consumes, that indicated that the inner sanctum was gargantuan indeed. For Fangorn, it had been the only home that he had ever known; as he had hatched there, been educated there with his peers, been trained there and had become a knight there; the only time he had ever been outside been during his guard posts or on field trips. Deep in his heart though, Fangorn knew that Ragnor was growing increasingly frustrated of him, that despite his great talent and ability Fangorn was missing something that was fundamental in being a good knight. What that was, Fangorn did not know, but what he did know that this was his lowest point of his knighthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his dormitory. It was a rather Spartan place, but rather roomy, as bronze dragons the size of Fangorn needed a considerable amount of room. There was a central general living quarters that had a small kitchen, reclining areas, some docorations and most of all, a small training area. Layered along the walls were tiny passageways, in which the ubiquitous kobold servants used to skitter in and out of to keep the place clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glorious Master Fangorn!\" chirped a kobold, bowing submissively before the huge bronze dragon. \"How was your day today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? How was my day today? Well Dirkberk, it was completely fucked!!\" growled Fangorn, stomping his foot into the ground as he glared at the hapless kobold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEEERRKK!!\" squealed the kobold, scurrying away in terror as the ground shook. When dragons were angry, kobolds knew how to run. Amongst all the lesser species, (as dragons considered themselves the most glorious beings in existence), the kobolds were the most submissive and obedient toward true dragons. These reptilian cousins worshipped the Ancestors, and in many cases dragons themselves, seeing little difference between the all powerful Ancestors, and to them, essentially all powerful dragons. Dragons tended to enjoy the constant worship from their lesser cousins, as they were creatures whose egos constantly needed to be assuaged, and kobolds were extremely useful as well in keeping a dragon's lair clean. This worship of dragonkind combined with their clannish, hierarchical society made it easy for dragons to command and employ them; even a dragon with the most modest means usually had a small clan of kobolds to help maintain his or her affairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Fangorn knew he shouldn't have acted surly in such a way to frighten the poor little kobold, who he knew was only doing his job as best he could. Damn, he couldn't even greet a kobold right these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the training area that Fangorn used to keep himself in shape. One of the most prominent features was a gigantic punching bag which hung from the ceiling with a giant chain; something that would normally be seen to anchor a giant human warship was used to hold a dragon punching bag in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his anger and frustration and insecurity, Fangorn let out a roar and slammed his claw as hard as he could. The sound of the impact echoed throughout the walls, with enough force that it actually produced a small shockwave that billowed throughout the room that knocked some of the kobolds watching it happen off their feet. He yell out at the top of his lungs, cursing his latest failure, cursing his luck, cursing his dishonor, cursing that dragoness who had been the instigator of his latest demerit, and cursing his longtime mentor Ragnor to screw himself and most of all, cursing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... almost unnoticed,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fangorn's lairmate Lorath was only about two thirds of his size, but he had an inquisitive mind and an easy going nature. Originally from the prominent Dak'saird merchant clan of Damescara, a large port city located in the warmer south of the Empire. Since he was the second son, Lorath could afford to take on a different profession than what the rest of his family could. Not so coincidentally, Lorath's merchant clan possessed many profitable contracts and investments within the military; which relied on the merchant clans, and on mercantile dragons like Lorath, to keep their finances. One could almost call Lorath a civilian contractor rather than a real knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... practicing,\" said Fangorn glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practicing? Sounds like you were trying to tear the whole place down!\" said his roommate. When they had originally gone through basic training, Lorath had been his lairmate in the barracks. Once they had graduated, they had maintained that partnership, and his usually<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn sighed. \"All right fine Lorath. I had a shitty day, or rather, shittier than usual. I'm being pulled off of gate duty to take a remedial course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A remedial course? By the Ancestors Fangorn, that'll set you back who knows how long!\" said Lorath.  Fangorn knew that would also come with a cut in his salary - while he was from a famous clan, his strict mother wouldn't let her son touch the inheritance until he obtained an honorable combat assignment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath quickly tried to put a positive spin on it, \"Still, I think it'll really help put you back on track! I believe in you!\" said Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe praise sounded hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" snorted Fangorn, not really feeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangorn,\" said Lorath, \"I know I'm not exactly the best dragon to say this, but you need to put your life together. I don't know what exactly happened to... I don't know, distract you or put you in this rut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just got to keep working at it,\" replied Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Fangorn, have you considered taking up another profession other than being in the military?\" suggested Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words wormed into Fangorn's mind like a poison, not that Lorath didn't mean well by the words, but to Fangorn, to quit the military was a dereliction of his duty, a dishonor to his family and his race. Lorath simply didn't understand how much the military life was ingrained in him, how much it dominated his every being and governed his life. It was all Fangon had ever known. Without the military and the strict disciplinary structure it provided, Fangorn would simply be lost in the world. Directionless. Doomed to be a vagrant that would probably end up pillaging helpless human villages or skulking in some cave high up in the mountains, never interacting with anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not give up yet,\" vowed Fangorn, furrowing his teeth. \"I cannot give up... To even considered abandoning my duty would be the greater dishonor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath sighed, \"Damn, I always knew that you bronze dragons were stubborn. Still, something just isn't working in your life and you need to change something up. As for what that is... I don't know. Maybe take up a hobby, find a nice dragoness or write something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn was unfortunately reminded of that ugly incident with that dragoness at the gate. While he could appreciate a good dragoness, he simply didn't feel the urgent need to go look for a mate yet, no matter how much his mother was beginning to really pester him about it. Besides, who would want to be with a dragon whose career was stagnating? Yet he wouldn't get anywhere if he just bemoaned his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably get studying then...\" said Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and when you have the time, take a look at the expenses as well,\" added Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll take care of that as well,\" added Fangorn. When they had graduated to become Knights, they had vowed to live in a rather modest dwelling so that they could save up. So far, Fangorn wasn't holding up his end of the bargain, as he should have been promoted quite a while ago if he wasn't such a screw up. If things kept up like this, he would have to leave the lair and move back in with his mother; while she wouldn't turn him away, it was not exactly the most ideal circumstance for a young adult dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn knew that things couldn't keep going like this. Somehow, he'd have to turn it around. But how, Fangorn had no clue at the moment.</span></div></div>",

A country where there was no famine, no needless bloodshed, it was almost perfect. Especially in the Capital of Nod,  the city of New Alveri. Sure there were those who disturbed the peace, but there were also those who protected the peace. These were the Knight Riders of New Alveri. Composed of a union of two distinct factions, once bitter enemies and now bonded allies, the Knights were the foundation of the peace and order that prevailed in all of Nod.  One branch was of the humanoid races, human, elves dwarves and such. The other was made of different breeds of dragons.  Neither could exist without the other\u2026 or at least that was the theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this story isn\u2019t about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the story of a young dragon who was a genius when it came to brawls. Her name was Darjza and she somehow always seemed to come out on top. Well, almost always. She\u2019s been in more than one sticky situation and nearly gotten herself killed in the process. She was the type of dragon that would tell you that a punch in the face, or a bite to the neck - even a sword in the chest - will tell you more about a person than talking to them.  This was because punches and claws never lied; a person\u2019s true nature only became apparent in a good, old fashioned brawl. Darjza\u2019s two dominant traits were her apparent lack of intelligence and her utter fearlessness. She always spoke her mind, she never backed down from a bigger opponant and she always kept her word. Now that you know a little about her, let\u2019s begin her story. Shall we\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were always busy. They were filled with humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs, dragonborns, and of course, us dragons.  Though in the central city of all the world \u2013 or at least the important parts of it \u2013 could one expect any less? Dragons took it upon themselves to maintain peace and order among the country of Nod, and the others took it upon themselves to help us out in any way they could, and to not hunt us mercilessly like they did back in the previous age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI strolled through the streets of New Alveri, heading towards the southwestern gate.  There, I planned on meeting a long time friend, Gatekeeper Kaj. He always said that we would fight when I was ready. \u201cI sure as hell feel ready now.\u201d I said out loud. Everyone around me at the gate heard it and most of them laughed. <br>\r\n\u201cSo who you fighting this time Darjza?\u201d an elf asked me from his weapons stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaj Mr. Ebon.\u201d I answered simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human from the other side of the broad avenue spoke up. \u201cKaj, really? You sure bout that DD?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am Markus.\u201d I replied. I always enjoyed talking to the smaller, two-legged folk.  I found that I always made friends fast.  As I stood to the side of the road, wagons and carts passing back and forth over the shiny enchanted cobblestones, I felt something grab my tail. I stopped and looked. It was a dwarven infant girl hanging on and tugging on me, giggling the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Darjza, she\u2019s quite energetic today.\u201d said a dwarven woman who worked as a waitress in one of my favorite Inns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries Mrs. Kagger. How\u2019s your man?\u201d I said scooping up the child with my tail and moving her back to her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill a poor drunken fool.\u201d She said shaking her head as she picked her daughter off my tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to hear that Mrs. Kagger.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m not. If he weren\u2019t, he\u2019d be parading around the place with Colzemn.\u201d she said with a wry smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back at her. \u201cSo true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was bombarded with such friendly greetings and small talk as I waited just inside the minor gate, waiting for Kaj to notice me.  It was the curse of being famous and friendly to others, as I often said jokingly. I didn\u2019t mine too much the time I spent staring up at the colossal city walls, but I did want to Kaj to hurry up and fly down so I could request a sparring match with him; I felt pumped and ready at long last. However I finally grew bored with waiting and walked out of the gate.  When I looked up to his perch, I found him asleep! Now, I did know that Sky-Swollowers are known to sleep for a vast amount of time, yet I wasn\u2019t the patient sort of dragon. \u201cKAJ!!!\u201d I roared, sending a flock of grey pigeons fluttering into the sky; almost immediately, three of them were cut down by the hawks which prevailed in the area due to the city\u2019s tall stone buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a moment of silence I was about to roar again but then Raj lifted a wing from where it had been covering his face. \u201cStop it Darjza.\u201d Raj yawned, exposing his dual rows of curved fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKaj? Your awake?\u201d I asked looked up to the massive dragon; massive purely because of his heritage, he was less than a quarter century older than me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d I heard him say, yawning again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. Wake up Kaj. You said we would fight if I were strong enough and I sure feel strong enough now.\u201d I said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard him sigh, his scaled jowls lifted a bit and flapped with the force of his breath. \u201cFeeling strong and being strong are two completely different things.\u201d he said, leaning forward with his claws on the edge of his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKaj\u2026 Please?\u201d I begged. I thought about mentioning that I could tell his superior that he was napping on the job again, but I would never do that to Kaj and the big dragon knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d He stated firmly and withdrew from the edge, putting his head back down on the stone supporting his considerable bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?  I fought my share of battles and won.\u201d I said proudly puffing out my chest despite the fact that Kaj was no longer looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good for you. You beat up your whole family and a few stragglers and some young short-lives, that\u2019s so Wonderful.\u201d He said with extreme sarcasm. \u201cLook I\u2019m one of many you haven\u2019t battled and I know you like fighting so much I say to you, find someone else. Hell, you like to fight so much why not find a partner and join the Knights. I\u2019m sure one of the other Knights is willing and able. Go ask them, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m very busy?\u201d He explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a short time to decide he was right, and I said farewell for now to him and started back up the wide, paved road. Kaj sighed in relief, as I turned away from him. \u201cYou have to admit though, I\u2019m a lot bigger then I was a few months ago.\u201d I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI truly can\u2019t tell, everyone is small or tiny to me.\u201d Kaj said jokingly, his tone finally lighter.  He waved to me with his wing as I passed back under the large stone archway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back to the place I lived, I pondered the words that Kaj spoke. Find a Partner, Join the Knights. I never thought of ever doing that but if I did I could be in fight after fight. That would definitely prove worthwhile, but would they accept as young as myself? I heard of them accepting hatchlings but that was because those dragons had been bred to be Knights, their lives prearranged by their parents and the scryers while they still lay in the egg. However, I was definitely capable of fighting; I did it whenever I got the chance, but that was it. I knew nothing on what it meant to really be a Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was half way home when I stopped and decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Edited by Shalion**</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the enormous buildings, monolithic monuments and skyscrapers that graced the megalopolis of New Alveri, the one towered over all the others was the Grand Temple of the Holy Knights of Nod. The Temple itself had actually been the original city of Alveri, constructed on the foundation of an extinct volcano, yet as the city expanded infinitely outwards, the Temple had been granted an extra-territorial status. Very few commoners ever got to see the inside of the temple, yet what I knew of the place, it was a world onto itself, where only the Holy Knights, Nod's most elite defenders, were allowed residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to emphasize its separation from the rest of the metropolis, a giant moat surrounded the Grand Temple. As reckless a young dragoness I was, not even she was brash enough to attempt to fly in from one of its perches; not with those fully armed dragon Knights and their riders watching over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be completely insane doing this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I really didn't have that much of a choice.  My parents both died when I was very small, and they had both been clanless, so I had entered into New Alveri as a drifter. I was taken into an orphanage for dragons, as it was a place I could have food and shelter, but as soon as I was old enough to walk on all fours, the caregivers had told me I would have to earn my keep by doing good deeds in the community. Good deeds meant involved me performing odd-jobs for the humans, like breathing fire as a street performer, guarding pubs, lifting heavy shipments for the various shopkeepers and other things that would get me a few gems. That was why I was so familiar with the humans, elves and the other smaller races. I learned to fight because I had to by necessity, and as I grew older, I challenged some of the watch dragons to fight for a wager. What won me so many fights was that many of these dragons didn't think a scrawny bronze dragoness would have any chance, but they did find out the hard way. However, that's the reason why they avoided me nowadays, because they now know I could fight and weren't willing to wager money anymore. Because I was almost fully grown, the orphanage was going to kick me out soon, which meant that I would have to find my own place, and have to resort to other means of getting income. Of course, for young female dragoness desperate to make money, there was <i>that</i> option. I grit my teeth in shook my head, that was NOT an option that I would want to be forced to face, so crazy as it was, I decided to try my luck to become a Holy Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIHowever, there were bridges that led to gates on ground level. Like on the skyway entrances, the gate was manned by a Dragon Knight. Though these dragons were but of the lowest orders of the Holy Knights, they would make mincemeat out of Kaj or your typical civilian watch dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business here fledgling!!\" growled the guard. I frowned. He couldn't have been that much older than myself actually. I would not allow myself to be intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to gain entry into the Grand Temple, and join the Holy Knights of Zod,\" I proclaimed, trying to sound as 'knightly' as I possibly could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" the Knight responded, keeping his face rigid, but I could tell that he looked like he wanted to laugh out loud, \"And what makes you believe that you possess the qualities to become a Knight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a strong fighter, I train myself to get better every single day, and I take every opportunity to test out my skills!!\" I answered. \"What, on a human or an elf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you just how strong I am!!\" I threatened, baring my teeth. I knew this was a bad idea, but I couldn't think of anything else that might prove myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly blindsided by a powerful blow to the belly, knocking me off my feet. My head spun, and I switched my gaze back to see the guard with his head cocked sideways, looking mildly amused. I bared my teeth and let out a roar, and charged at him again. Quicker than I imagined possible from a dragon that heavily armored, he moved aside and swung his tail around, once again sending me to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never been so outclassed in my entire life. He stood over me and lowered his head to my level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skill is lacking, but you do have a reckless spirit about you...\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next time we meet I'll beat you!!\" I vowed, trying to put on a show of bravado, \"Just you wait!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the truth was that I felt deeply humiliated at what had just transpired. While I didn't expect that they would just let me become a knight, it was only now I realized the vast difference between a knight and an orphan like myself. I had always considered myself a talented fighter, yet I may well have been a newborn hatchling taking on her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed back through the city streets, not speaking to anyone, back to the orphanage where I had lived ever since my parents had died. The orphanage, like many of the common draconic settlements within New Alveri, was built into the cliffsides. By the time I arrived, it was getting dark, as the denizens of the city returned to their homes. While I didn't worry about my ability to defend myself, this part of New Alveri became a much more dangerous place at night. Even I knew that at times, discretion was the better part of valor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI angled inside the large opening, arriving at the main chamber. The orphanage was run by the religious establishment; who out of charity took in lost hatchlings regardless of element, raising them to be upstanding members of society. During the times I was not trying to earn a few gems for myself, they taught us to read and write in standard draconic, along with the teachings of the holy church. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had I entered when I was greeted by the old matron of the orphanage, Lady Ramoth. That punishing scowl on her face was enough to make even the most valourous knight quail; as for the orphans that dwelled here, we both loved and feared the old nun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been Darzhja!! I was about to close the orphanage for the night young dragoness!!\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize Lady Ramoth,\" I answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave me a quick glance. \"Darzhja!! Did you get yourself into a fight again? You know how I do not tolerate any fighting out of any of you!!\" she hissed, \"You will tell me what went on or you will be going without supper tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed back at her. I had defied her many times before, and had been willing to pay the price for it, but this time it would be better to tell her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I traveled to the gates of the Grand Temple, and challenged one of the Holy Knights guarding the entrance to a fight,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you just came back with a few bruises. The knight could have easily had you put in the dungeons for assault, and trust me, the dungeons are a terrible place for females...\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... yet I did so with the intention that if I beat him, the Knights would accept me into their order,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth simply shook her head at me with disdain, not even bothering to tell me just how much of a fool I was for doing such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get something to eat and then go back to your cot. I don't want to hear any more of this Knight business...\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lady Ramoth,\" I responded obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go then my child, and may the Great Ancestors above protect you...\" she chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... may they protect us all...\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the chapel was a large mess hall where all the orphans would eat once a day. None of the food was particularly paletable, as most of the food was secondhand donations, and was served by the humanoid priests. At this late hour, all they had left was a batch of dried meat; it tasted like rubber, but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the orphans were already heading for bed, so after the quick meal, I headed there myself. For the last couple of years now, I was the oldest of all the orphans, which made me their de-facto leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja!! You're back!!\" cried Ophelia, a small adolescent green dragoness, jumping up and down excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I have returned,\" I said, trying to sound triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how many opponents did you defeat today?\" asked Blaze, a fire dragon who was the resident troublemaker of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several!! In fact, I challenged a Holy Knight of the Temple to a duel as well,\" I added. Of course, I didn't mention that I was absolutely trashed; after all, I had a reputation to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds dangeorus though, you really could have gotten hurt,\" said Iskierka, another one of the adolescents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!! What's the fun without a little risk!!\" retorted Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards I was drowned by a barrage of questions by the smaller orphans, who asked me glowingly of all the fights. I described the fights to them, and how I emerged victorious in each of them, exaggerating a great deal of the feats I had accomplished, such as defeating three guards with a single move, challenging an entire group of dragons and emerging victorious and such; it was all exaggeration of course, and the older orphans like Ophelia, Iskierka and even Blaze knew it as such, but the young ones liked hearing uplifting stories of heroism and like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do suppose you have a good reason for all your recent fighting though,\" said Ophelia. The implication, of course, was that as the oldest orphan, that also meant that I would be forced to leave its premises and have to face the real world on my own as an adult. Many of the orphans went on to become priests or nuns at a convent. Yet the reality was that when the males left the orphanage, they became outcasts and criminals, while the females turned to prostituion. As for myself, I hardly had the disposition to sit around all day and pray at an altar, and of course I didn't want to end up entertaining hordes of pherenome drunk males, but I hadn't thought about what I'd wanted to do until fairly recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I intend on joining the Holy Knights!!\" I said triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Holy Knights?\" said Blaze, \"Yeah, you're good, but those warriors are hard core. Are you actually serious about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed about, specifically toward Ophelia, Iskierka and Blaze. Unlike the younger orphans, they knew how so many of these dreams could be broken, and that orphans faced a life of servitude and poverty as an adult, spending the rest of their lives in dungeons. They knew how rough the world really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... I know the chances of an orphan such as myself being accepted into the order is slim, but I intend to pursue everything I have for this venture. I'm going to become a Holy Knight, so that orphans such as ourselves can see that you don't have to be born into a priviledged bloodline to achieve your dreams, that if they are determined and they want their dream bad enough, they can achieve anything. I'll prove it to all of you that I'll become a Knight, once and for all!!\" I vowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great Darzhja,\" said Ophelia, \"Because if there was only one dragon orphan in the entire Empire that can get into the Holy Knights, I think you're that one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like tearing up at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for believing in me you guys. I won't let you down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again younger hatchlings ate it up, chanting that since I had defeated so many opponents that I would be the most invincible knight in the entire Kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebration was cut off when Lady Ramoth came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its lights out young ones!! Say your prayers before we go to sleep!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, I chanted my prayers to the Ancestors. Yet this chant took a whole new meaning, as before I had done so half-heartedly, but now with my decision to strive to become I knight, I prayed that the Ancestors would give me the strength to become a Holy Knight, that I could show all the young orphans without a home that they would have somebody they called their own and could strive for, and that their lonely lives would be filled with hope. </span></div></div>",

We were woken up at the crack of dawn to give our prayers, followed by a small meal at the mess hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery morning, the older orphans would be given various chores to perform for the humanoids. Chores like these helped the orphanage keep its finances, and gave them constructive things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze,\" said Lady Ramoth, \"Mr Ebon just received a fresh order of weapons, and he would like someone to provide fire to his smelter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on it Lady Ramoth,\" he said obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want to hear the patrons finding out you burned out a merchants stall!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" he said, before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iskierka, the artists guild requested for you again. They have an upcoming convention coming up so they need someone to deliver some supplies,\" said Ramoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can count on me then!!\" she cried, before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Ophelia, the merchants guilds is need of someone to help clear out a lot of debris so they can start building a new store on that property. Can I count on you to take care of that?\" said Ramoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely Lady Ramoth!!\" she cried, before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would you have me go?\" I asked. Ramoth curved her gaze toward me, and gave a long look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... about that Darzhja. I need to speak with you for a moment...\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" I asked. Admittedly, I did get into my fair share of trouble, but it was usually the trivial sort, knocking down a few stands, interrupting foot traffic of the humanoids and occasionally fighting too often. Or perhaps she wanted to talk further about that fight I had gotten into with that Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when the old matron gave me that forlorn look, I knew it was more than just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Darzhja, the orphanage has received many new hatchlings lately, hatchlings that need home and shelter...\" she began. My face fell. I knew immediately where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're kicking me out of the orphanage then...\" I murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so Darzhja. After tonight, you will have to leave,\" said Lady Ramoth. \"Were the circumstances more ideal, I would have preferred to keep you longer until you were more prepared to face the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet...things didn't turn out the way they're supposed to then. I prepared myself for this day sooner or later, that there are hatchlings that need the orphanage far more than I, but still...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but lower my head and cry. That I would be leaving the only home I knew for as long as I could remember. I had no recollection of my real parents, and as harsh and strict as Lady Ramoth was, she was the closest thing I had to a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now Darzhja. Everything is going to be all right. Now keep your head up and face the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave Lady Ramoth a big winged hug. After arranging all my affairs, and gathering up my things, I went back outside. Since this was my last day at the orphanage, Lady Ramoth at least gave me the entire day free to myself instead of having to do chores in the humanoid district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided I would pay Kaj a visit. As usual, I found him lounging upon his post, apparently asleep. I frowned. I knew it was more an act; he only pretended to be asleep to throw off the crooks and troublemakers, where upon he would be surprise them and strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAJ!! Wake up!!\" I snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj jerked awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, to what do I owe this visit?\" he said hazily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to take your advice and I challenged a Holy Knight to a fight so I could gain entry into the order...\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\" he cried, jerking alert, \"When I told you that if you wanted to fight and join the Knights, I didn't think you'd actually take it seriously!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but take offense to that. I always trusted Kaj as a dragon I could count on to give me good advise, and I didn't think he would throw something like that so casually. Perhaps he was just surprised more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact I'm here to tell you I will challenge that Knight again. I will keep challenging him no matter how long it takes, so that I can become accepted into the Holy Knights,\" I cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I suppose you are serious about this. I know you like fighting, yet I sense you have a deeper motive to join the Knights,\" said Kaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...got kicked out of the orphanage today. They were filling up with a lot of new hatchlings, so Lady Ramoth decided that they needed space for them. I'm not looking into joining the Holy Knights as a place to stay, or act as a servant for them, but I want to join the Knights for the others back at the orphanage, so they can be proud of what I accomplished and that they know that they have something they can dream for. I want to join the Knights so I can fight for them, so that through my struggles their lives can be easier,\" said Darzhja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj gave me a good long stare, before rising from his post and facing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I challenge you Darzhja, to a duel...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you always wanted to fight me haven't you? Now's your chance Darzhja. Show me whether you're Holy Knight material or if you'll spend the rest of your life being a nobody...\" he challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and faced Kaj. While Regal Bronzes were actually one of the larger breeds of Metallic Dragons, and despite being an orphan I was by no means a small dragoness either, I felt puny in comparison to the huge Sky-Swallower. He literally shook the ground with his every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, I swallowed my fear, \"I accept your challenge then!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come at me with everything you have!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot forward and began with a quick swipe, attempting to close the distance as quickly as I could. Kaj swung with his claw to intercept; one blow from the huge Sky Swallower would be enough to finish the fight, yet I had anticipated his counter-attack and shot underneath him, delivering a sharp blow with my tail. The huge dragon grunted in irritation, but that's what my blow was to the giant dragon, an irritation. I knew enough about fighting to understand that as the largest of the dragons, Sky Swallowers were trained for defensive fighting; legends told of single Sky Swallowers warding off entire armies on their lonesome, and when clad in armor a Sky Swallower was a living wall of steel. Sky Swallowers were also used in sieges, their hides all but inpenetrable to human artillery, and could take down a castle wall with a single blow. Kaj was no exception to this philosphy, as while he was immensely powerful, he was inherently slow and clumsy. Thus, I darted in and out of his grasp, striking again and again. My only hope was to aim for a weak point, and gradually wear him out and get tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a sizable crowd of humanoids had gathered to witness this impromptu fights, and like all crowds did, made wagers and cheered on the combatants. The crowd let out an 'oh', after a particularly fierce skirmish, in which I had made a daring move to strike at his underbelly, only to miss my mark, and then barely flipping out of the way from his body slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, Darzhja, your boasts about being a talented fighter are more than just boasts I see,\" said Kaj, about half an hour into the fight. If he was fatigued from having to chase me around, he sure didn't show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I was exhausted. Had I fought him yesterday, I probably would have been destroyed in the first minute, as I had not been so filled with that much purpose then. I gritten my teeth, \"Are you ready to give up!!\" I growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you? In fact, I suggest that you do give up the fight. If I manage to land a hit, you may end up seriously hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only huffed back at him as if he were insane.  I was never the type of person ever to back down from anything. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaj was cruising along stately after me as we both circled around the fields outside of New Alveri\u2019s outermost southwestern gate.  His massive wings, an unremarkable shade of brown like most Sky-Swallowers, lived true to his namesake, shading nearly an acre of land under him.  He flapped them once mightily for every three of my own.  The big dragon could have moved faster, I knew, but he was letting me take the initiative, prepared to counter whatever move I threw at him.  He hadn\u2019t caught me yet, but I knew that he eventually would and so far all I\u2019d managed to do with my quick strikes was chip a few of his scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy plan to tire out my much larger opponent had failed.  Kaj, who\u2019d been on guard duty for the past 20 years, seemed inexhaustible.  And here I was panting and struggling just to keep ahead of him.  The distance between us decreased as I struggled to think of a way to inflict some sort of damage on him.  Behind me, Kaj grinned keenly, confident, but not with a reason to be.  I beat my wings with renewed vigor.  I was <i>not</i> going to lose!  I wasn\u2019t fighting for my life.  I was fighting for far more!  I had to prove that I was more than a penniless, clanless orphan with no future.  I had to because more than my own future rested on my shoulders.  I was through running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping a wing, I turned a 180 on a dime.  My neck heart throbbed, keeping the blood flowing to my head as I strained under the g-forces.  Kaj rushed toward me almost like a mountain.  He spread his claws wide.  I was not going to launch myself right into his teeth and claws, however.  At the last moment, I feinted, closing my wings and sending myself into a corkscrew under him again going for his underbelly.  Kaj chuffed, however at my ploy, lifting himself out of my reach with a single beat of his great wings.  With his longer leg, however, he still managed to graze me on my flank.  He failed to break through the scales \u2013 and if he had, I\u2019d have been out of the fight instantly and in mortal danger to boot \u2013 but it hurt intensely nonetheless.  I\u2019d failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why I did what I did next.  Maybe it was something in the way he was holding his body at that moment, but more likely it was pure dumb luck.  Kaj\u2019s tail was pointed straight down to balance as he lifted himself up.  As I hurtled by, I whipped my tail out and caught my tail weapon against his, an elongated and segmented bone mace with scale-like protrusions something like a cross between a snake\u2019s rattle and a pineapple.  My weight, though slight in comparison to Kaj\u2019s was not inconsiderable.  The bigger dragon\u2019s hindquarters dropped as I fell, tugging on his tail.  When his wings were angled straight up, Kaj stalled and began to plummet.  \u201cDarzhja!\u201d  roared Kaj with real fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pointed nose down with my wings closed, the wind whipping into my face as the ground neared.  Kaj, behind me and still hooked to my tail was falling tail first, his great wings billowing empty behind him as his massive bulk dragged him down to Earth.  It was one of the worst positions possible for a falling dragon, especially the bigger ones.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t how a duel is supposed to go, Darzhja!\u201d  Kaj roared again.  He whipped with his tail, but I jerked back, keeping them lodged together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt goes however I can make it go, Kaj!\u201d  I yelled over the wind.  \u201cSubmit and I\u2019ll release you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj hesitated and the ground grew nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long do you think will it take them to fill in the crater, Kaj?\u201d  I asked.  I hurt my pride to win like this but Kaj had already proved to me my superior in pure brawn and fighting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d  started Kaj, but I would never learn what it was he was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, there was a terrible explosion from within the city.  It was so close that me and Kaj were sent tumbling through the air from the shockwave.  Wordlessly, I scrambled to help Kaj realign himself before we both hit the ground.  Smoke billowed thick, black and greasy as if possessed with an evil malevolence from the trade district of New Alveri, in many ways, the heart of the city.  Before the city walls rose to block our view, I saw one of the lavish marble towers, magicked to stand as tall as a clifface, crumble and crash into some neighboring buildings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe landed heavily, all but crashing, but Kaj fortunately broke my fall.  I tumbled off his back, the larger dragon groaning.  I was still in shock, looking at the smoke erupting into the sky so close.  Little bipeds streamed out of the open gate, screaming and clutching their children.  Dragons scrambled into the air all across the city.  The unthinkable had happened.  New Alveri had been attacked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a while, all I could do was stand there in shock at what had transpired. <br>\r\nDarjza, we've got to see who we can help out!!\" said Kaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!!\" I answered, snapping out of my stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, my first concern was that of the other orphans. The orphanage, thankfully, was a good flight away from the market district, yet what worried me immensely was that my friends, Ophelia, Iskierka and Blaze, had been there at the time of the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to the market district, the scene was complete pandemonium. The shops and pubs I had visited every day were on fire, blazing out of control. I watched as the humanoids streamed out; the fear in their eyes and their panic. Some were crying, having lost everything they had ever owned, and crying for loved ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darjza!!\" cried a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI curved my gaze toward Blaze. His eyes were glazed in panic, jittery. The top part of his left horn had been clipped off, but other than that he was thankfully uninjured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze!! What happened!! Where are the others!!\" I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze began to stammer incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down and take a deep breath kid and tell us what's going on...\" said Kaj, lowering his head toward the young Fire Dragons level. Blaze gave a few shuddering breaths before he composed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was working at Mr. Ebon's smithy when there was this huge explosion. Ophelia managed to get back to the orphanage and check if the younger ones were safe, but Iskieka...\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iskierka?\" I said, my hearts skipping a beat, \"Where is she? What's happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-she was inside the artist guild headquarters when the attack came, but the passage there is blocked by the rubble one of the fallen buildings,\" said Blaze, \"By the Ancestors, what if she's...she's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get her out kid, she's going to be all right...\" said Kaj. \"Meanwhile, I want you to get back to the orphanage, there's nothign else you can do here...\" Of course, there was no way of knowing whether Iskierka was all right, but there was something about Kaj's cool demeanor that reassured us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave this to the warriors Blaze!! She'll be out in no time!!\" I assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way through the panicking crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!!\" I cried. One of the skyscrapers had collapsed right on top of a series of buildings, one of which was the artists guild. Whoever had been directly under it would have been crushed. I feared the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rushed to the scene, my front claw suddenly stepped on something squishy. I instantly stopped in my tracks. I lifted it up and stared at what I had stepped on, and wished I hadn't. It was the smashed corpse of a dwarven child. Its body had already been crushed into a paste, and the only thing I could recognize was its face, screwed in an expression of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my horrified panic, I turned my head away and swiped my claw to rid myself of it, screaming, yet the stain would not go away. The poor childs blood clung to my claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj turned back and grabbed me by the shoulders, \"Darzja!! Get a hold of yourself!!\" he shouted. I stared back up at him and whimpered, \"There's nothing we can do for this poor soul. Only the Great Dragons Above can protect him now. We've got to find your friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only nod numbly, and followed the huge dragon deeper into the inferno. Kaj carved a path through the rubble, and then I caught sight of the smashed headquarters of the artists guild. Many of the humans I had known, ones that I had worked for, were already dead, or mortally wounded. Usually, at this time of day, Iskierka would have been in the studio, one of the only places within the guild large enough to accomodate the size of a dragon. It was only because that room was so large, and well built, that that part of the guild wasn't completely smashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance had been blocked off by what had been the balcony of the marble skyscraper. I peeked through one of the larger cracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iskierka!!\" I screamed, recognizing her under a pile of rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-darzja, I...I'm...\" she said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj stepped forward and with a mighty heave and a roar, lifted what had been a marble balcony of one of New Alveri's skyscrapers over his head. \"Iskierka!! Can you move!!\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....can't, it hurts,\" she wailed. It was only then that I noticed a puddle of blood pooling around her belly. Her back leg was twisted at a terrible angle, as was her right wing. That allowed me I to duck into the path Kaj had created and gingerly made my way to Iskierka. Her body was wedged under a series of metal beams. Frantically, I began shoving the rubble out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am...am I going to die?\" she murmured, her eyes grazed and frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to die Iskierka!! You're going to be all right!!\" I screamed back. \"We're going to see Blaze and Ophelia and the others again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIskierka merely gave a shuddering breath in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Darzja!! I can't hold it up forever!!\" Kaj called, straining under the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I managed to get enough rubble free that I could move her. I had to be extremely careful, or else she could get even more injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed Iskierka underneath his front claws and pried her out from the rubble. Iskierka let out a wail of pain as I did so. Lifting her limp body over my back, I staggered out of the rubble, just as Kaj let go of the balcony, back onto the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iskierka! Iskierka!!\" I called out. She wasn't moving on my shoulders. Was I too late?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only unconscious Darzja,\" said Kaj. I let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to need help soon... Get your friend back to the orphanage,\" said Kaj. \"I've got to report with the rest of my unit to find out what's going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and quickly made my way through the streets. It would have been faster to fly, but it was too risky considering her condition. Though I had taken the route from the marketplace to the orphanage thousands of times, it felt like forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Ramoth!! Lady Ramoth!!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzja!! Thank the Ancestors you're safe!!\" the old matron cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all right, but Iskierka's badly wounded!!\" I wailed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her inside quickly then!!\" cried Ramoth. I nodded, and rushed into the chapel. I set her down at the altar, where the priests immediately rushed forth to tend to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzja, make sure that the younger orphans are within their dorms. I'm counting on you to keep them safe understand!?\" ordered Ramoth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and headed inside. The younger hatchlings scurried about, scared and panicked. Quite a number of them were crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzja!! Is Iskierka going to be all right!!\" asked Ophelia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was hurt pretty badly when the skyscraper collapsed on the artists guild. She'll at least live, but I don't know how she'll end up from there. I'm just glad that you and the others are safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still worried about Blaze though. He hasn't come back since the attack...\" said Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I saw him on the streets and I told him to return to the orphanage. You're saying he hasn't shown up yet!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped that it was only because he was late, or that he decided to ignore what Kaj and I had told him and decided to help out the civilians, but I couldn't help but fear if something had happened to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I just couldn\u2019t sit still at the orphanage, not after I\u2019d heard that Blaze had yet to return.  People were still running amok.  The humanoid priests were doing what they could for the injured dragons coming in, but it was too much.  I realized then that adult dragons were coming in, some collapsing on the landing and others walking up the steps with broken wings.  The hospitals in the area were full, they were saying, and there was nowhere left to go.  So many dragons, and yet these were the ones yet able to move and talk.  How many more were left in the burning rubble like Iskeirka?  How many hundreds or thousands of smaller bipeds were killed or injured where they did not have the strength of a dragon to see them through?  I had to find Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth wouldn\u2019t have let me go, so I didn\u2019t beg her pardon.  Besides, I was technically no longer under her authority anyways, but it still bothered me to disregard what she would have wanted.  Hopefully I could find the wayward fire drake and be back before she noticed.  I slid out the side entrance and took the stairs down, leaving worried and crying orphans behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing I hadn\u2019t taken to the air.  I saw the Knights flying in formation overhead.  They were stopping civilian dragons and directing to the center of New Alveri, the Temple itself.  I knew the dragon populace was being conscripted and recruited for rescue efforts, while at the same time, the humanoid half of the Knights were on the ground compelling the two-legged populace to evacuate the district.  It might not have appeared fair on the surface, but dragons were outnumbered by the faster breeding races fifty to one and most dragons understood that it was their duty to help in an emergency.  Such was the price of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI longed to fly up and be organized into the effort.  To the Knights now securing the skies over New Alveri, I\u2019d be nothing more than another useful body and pair of wings, but at the same time I\u2019d <i>be</i> a useful body and a pair of wings, an equal to everyone caught in this nightmare storm that had thrust the world I knew into destruction and chaos.  But I had to find Blaze first and see him safely home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fires were spreading as I reached the bottom of the clifface where the market district was.  The air was dense and uncomfortable.  But as a dragon, I could handle a good deal of smoke.  The humanoids who hadn\u2019t fled already were not so fortunate.  People, people I knew were stumbling blind along the sidewalks, choking to death, but I couldn\u2019t help them!  The bodies of those who\u2019d died in the explosion or soon after still littered the streets like refuse.  It hurt my heart to see them, so I closed my watery eyes.  \u201cBlaze!  Blaze!\u201d  I called and coughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blackened window burst from the heat beside me and the resulting back draft lifted me off my feet.  The side of my neck felt seared even through my fire resistant scales.  I lay stunned on the cobbles for how long I didn\u2019t know.  Water from the sky revived me.  I woke, the side of my neck still burned and raw, and saw overhead a passing formation of Knights.  The riders were magicking water to cling to the underbellies of their airborne partners so they could spread it over the burning district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to my feet and called for Blaze, but my voice had gone.  I had to close my water lids for the acridness of the air and I realized that I was coughing constantly.  Where was Blaze?  Where was the way back?  I tripped over my left wing which I\u2019d inexplicable left dragging on the ground.  I felt dizzy and my neck was starting to blister under the scales.  This was a foolish mistake.  How could I have thought that I could have rescued Blaze?  I couldn\u2019t even beat Raj in a fair fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crash and for a moment, I thought that another building was crumbling down to cinders.  Then I saw a large group of humanoids.  They were dressed in thick yellow coats and orange suspenders.  Their faces were blackened by soot, but around their noses and mouths, translucent bubbles clung to clean skin.  A tall, muscular grey scaled dragonborn emerged from the doorway he\u2019d kicked down.  \u201cClear.\u201d He said.  Across the street, I saw a team of sturdy dwarves carrying axes perform the same function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elf, his eyes stained red and watering ran forward to me with the speed of a deer.  He waved his arms as I bobbed my head woozily.  \u201cWhat are you doing here?  You have to get out, the whole district has caught fire!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-blaze\u2026\u201d  I muttered.  I coughed and spat out a thick black wad on the street cobbles.  \u2018M-my friend.\u201d  I subsided into more coughing and lay down before the elf, feeling wretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf raised his left arm and twirled the fingers in a complicated loop pattern, then uttered a single word.  A bubble formed itself around my snout and I found that I could breathe again, though my mouth and throat remained raw.  \u201cIf your friend\u2019s here, we\u2019ll find him.  Leave but don\u2019t fly, things are still burning and exploding in the city.  We have to keep the fires from reaching the alchemist\u2019s guild! If you see anyone alive help them get out, now go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded once then turned tail.  It was still difficult working my way back, but my water lids protected my eyes despite making my sight blurry and nearsighted.  Water was coming down now every half minute, drenching me and everything in the district as the Knights flew their patterns nonstop.  As the fires burned down to cinders, dragons were landing here and there to help sort through the rubble.  I found no sign of Blaze on the way back nor anyone else alive.  The couple of people I\u2019d seen earlier on the street were collapsed dead face down in the ash.  I wept, leaving bronze tracks on my blackened cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth was livid when she discovered my condition and I told her what I\u2019d done, naturally.  I received a smelly green poultice for my neck, but no other care.  In fact, I was put right to work as an orderly to help with the heavy bulk of the dragon patients occupying as many of the rooms as could be spared.  The orphans and staff were shunted to the closets and even hallways as the orphanage was converted into a makeshift infirmary.  Even Lady Ramoth gave up her personal quarters.  Again, I could not help but notice how many dragons lay injured on the cool stone of the caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sense was beginning to emerge from the conflicting tales of the dragons.  The explosion had happened during some sort of meeting of the four major trade princes, three of which were dragons of incredible wealth and power.  Rumors ranged from saying that all four princes had died in the explosion to only the dragons had died, the fourth having been spirited away by magic to none had actually died and that they had been using doppelgangers to conduct the meeting.  Regardless, people were saying this was a deliberate attack against the dragons of New Alveri.  \u201cCurse the short-livessss!\u201d a crotchety old deathwing hissed, \u201cCurssse them and the holesss they crawled from\u2026 ahh!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush now, grandfather.\u201d  I said and squeezed water into his mouth from a rag and placed the cool cloth on his face.  He was burned over half of his body, the black scales curling away from the skin, revealing tender red and yellowed flesh underneath.  He wouldn\u2019t survive the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quickly called away, however by a human priest in blood splattered robes.  He told me\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Isn't there anything else you can do to fix it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Darzja... I truly am. We've already tried everything we could think of, and even had a mage tried to look at it. Yet, her wing was crushed beyond repair, if it isn't amputated we risk it becoming infected and that would surely cost Iskierka her life...\" the priest sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI curved my gaze over to the young gold dragoness and could only watch with horror as a team of humans lifted a giant saw. My gaze shifted toward her broken wing. It was a mess. All of the wing bones had been shattered, while its membranes looked like torn curtains. Two thirds of the connecting tissue had already been ripped out from her back, leaving only the twisted bone that connected it with her spine. My mind told me that amputation was indeed the only thing that could be done, but the fact that it was Iskierka that this had to be done to; Iskierka who was my dear friend, and knowing that she would never fly again, never find love with a mate and likely condemned to a life of poverty was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIskierka curved a pair of pleading and scared eyes at me. \"Darzja... I... please don't let them take my wing,\" she moaned weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wished I could tell her to be strong. That everything was going to be all right. I even thought about outright lying to her and telling her that she would be getting a brand new wing. Yet I couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest came up to me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I have to ask this of you Darzja, but would you please keep your friend still while we perform the amputation?\" the priest whispered. I could only nod numbly; they were severely short of staff, and besides it was only right that at the very least, Iskierka had somebody to cry against as the grisly deed was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nno!! Make them stop!! Please!! No!!!\" begged Iskierka, sensing the saw approach her joint. She vainly attempted to thrash and kick the priests away from her, and it took all my power and discipline to keep her still, rather than to stop them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Iskierka...\" I murmured, placing my larger body over her and keeping her pinned. The next moment, the entire chamber echoed with an ungodly scream of incoherent despair, her tears pouring out in rivers, yet the sound that would give me nightmares for the rest of my life was that awful scraping sound, of flesh and bone being rended so unceremoniously. I wanted to close my eyes, but found that I couldn't, and I watched as they slowly and agonizingly ripped through her bone, her blood pour out in a grisly display, splattering the priests and most of my body. The whole while, Iskierka writhed and kicked underneath me, her hearts beating with fear and panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole operation lasted less than a minute, yet it had seemed to have lasted forever. Finally, mercifully, the amputation was over, as the priests whisked the broken wing away, setting it to a corner of he chamber along with a three others that had been amputated earlier that night, before rubbing the wound clean with alcohol, stopped the bleeding and bandaged it tightly. Beneath me, Iskierka whimpered softly and helplessly, her eyes tightly shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all over Iskierka. Everythings going to be all right...\" I assured, whispering in her ears. She didn't sound too reassured, as she could not have mistaken the quavering and fear in my own voice. Iskierka let out a few shuddering breaths, before collapsing unconscious in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed about the chamber, suddenly finding the chamber too confining. I rushed outside and took a few shuddering breaths, my thoughts scrambling over all the horror I had seen today. All the dead humanoids. The city in ruins. The orphans, crying in fear. Blaze gone missing. Iskierka losing her wing... So I angled my head into the sky and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzja...\" said a voice. I curved around to face Lady Ramoth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come back inside would you?\" she said. Yet her voice lacked the usual sharp sting to it, but rather it seemed forlorn and sympathetic. I tried to hide my tears from her, yet I could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed my head against the base of her neck, allowing her to stroke my head like she had when I was a hatchling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...its not fair...\" was all I could sputter out. \"S-she didn't deserve this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were life fair, it would have been I to have given my wing, that the victims should be the old rather than the young. If life were fair, Iskierka would have been born with a mother and father to love her. Yet, that is not the way of the world. We must deal with the hand that we were dealt with, not the one that we would have liked to have. Because above all else, life must move on my child...\" said Ramoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sniffled back. Ramoth, in her long centuries of life, must have seen an entire lifetime worth of sadness and misfortune, yet she always seemed to carry on, and remain just as strict and disciplined as she always was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, lets come back inside Darzja, I'm sure you could use some rest...\" she cried. I did come back inside. I gave a glance toward Iskierka, and shook my head for a moment. Thankfully, all the orphans were already asleep, and did not have to hear the surgeons carve out Iskierka's wing. That is, everyone except Ophelia. She was curled up into a ball, as if wishing she could return to the comfort of the egg shell, her bloodshot eyes glazed, seeing, but not seeing. As the only one of the four older orphans to escape completely unfazed, I knew she was blaming herself; that somehow she too should have gone missing or had her wing amputated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must look so pathetic...\" she murmured, \"Curled up in a corner instead of helping out like you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia...\" I cried, \"Please don't blame yourself for what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...but\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Ophelia. Even if you think you were to blame, it doesn't matter anymore. Iskierka lost her wing, Blaze has gone missing, and after tomorrow, I'm going to be gone for good. That means you have to be the one to take care of everybody now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" she stammered. \"B-but I'm not strong like you. I get scared easily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a sigh, \"Perhaps, so, yet at the very least, you have to pretend to act like you're strong and brave for the younger ones, for Iskierka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia shifted her gaze up. \"I suppose when you put it that way I don't have a choice now do I? Lady Ramoth can't be everywhere can she? I know I'm not a good leader like you, but I'll definitely won't let the others down, not without giving it my all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a hug, \"That's all I could ever want out of my friends. I knew I could count on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, I felt a little less worried, knowing that I would be able to leave the orphanage and that they were in capable claws. Thus, I was finally able to sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I awoke, the side of my neck was a mass of blisters that burned as if the fire were still upon me.  I tried not to cry out, however, because I remembered that some dragons had received much more severe and irreparable hurts than a simple burn yesterday.  Iskierka\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to go and comfort her, but at the same time, I was afraid to see her, afraid to see her disfigurement.  My weakness sickened me, but I could not will the feelings away.  I got up gingerly as I could because the warm bodies of young dragons surrounded me on three sides were we\u2019d bunked down in the hallway.  I stepped over tails and wings and Ophelia\u2019s outstretched neck as I made my way to the mess hall; I was starving for all of the events yesterday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, though, I stopped in the main living area where injured adult dragons were sleeping as closely together as their natural alignments and injuries allowed.  I noticed the unconscious segregation, metallics in that corner, fire drakes smoking near the landing, the two venomers were shunted to the side, but given the most space of all.  My hearts skipped a beat as I saw a great Sky-swallower reclining against the length of a whole wall; in his generosity, he let smaller dragons rest on his body so he would not occupy as much space.  I thought it might be Raj, but a quick sniff informed me it was a stranger.  I asked a priest, now in fresh white robes, for more poultice for my neck.  The bald human, engraved with a dragon emblem that stretched from the crown of his head to his forehead smiled and went to retrieve it.  The priesthood of the Dragon Cult was mainly composed of humans \u2013 primarily because the faith offered the shortest lived species of all eventual reincarnation as a proud dragon \u2013 and they were some of the most humble and compassionate humanoids I\u2019d ever met.  It was comfortable having humanoids around who shared the draconic faith in our Ancestors.  The man obliged me by applying the smelly green paste with his soft hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was treated, he said, \u201cIskierka is doing well, Darzhja.  But she is still sleeping with the other intensive cares and Lady Ramoth has asked you not to disturb her or the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and lifted myself from the floor, feeling relieved that I would not have to confront the golden dragoness yet.  She would ask me questions I had no answer for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mess hall, I found only a thin beef stew available.  The priests were stretching the meat store to its limit it seemed.  I quaffed down the watery soup like it was my last meal.  I shouldn\u2019t have expected more.  Dragons usually took but one meal a day and typically in the evening; the better to digest during the night.  I returned my wooden bowl, a cauldron for the dish washing team, and let out a sigh.  Perhaps it was for the best, a heavier meal would only make me turgid and I felt that I was going to be flying a lot today.  Blaze remained missing \u2013 the priest I\u2019d spoken to had confirmed his absence \u2013 and I wanted to see if Raj had found any actual information beyond the crazy rumors being tossed around the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to leave out the side entrance so I wouldn't disturb the sleeping dragons when I head Lady Ramoth shout, \u201cNo!  You can\u2019t have them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of me that was still a hatchling could not resist padding quietly down the hallway to eavesdrop.  I saw Lady Ramoth\u2019s large, green scaled figure silhouetted in the light of the door in front of her.  It was the door leading to the priests\u2019 dormitories, the humanoid half of the compound, across their meditation garden.  It was also the primary way in which humanoids entered and left the orphanage as the stairs outside were cut too large for bipeds.  In between her legs, I could see two richly dresses humanoids.  One was an arrogant looking elf in flowing robes, the other a pale green skinned orc with black powder burns permanently scarring the side of his wide face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf said, \u201cIt is the right of the Alchemists\u2019 Guild and the Circle of Magi to claim the bodies of fallen dragons.  You would defy the law?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more even tempered orc placed a meaty hand on his companion\u2019s shoulder, taking a step forward before the towering green dragoness.  \u201cYou can rest assured that the deceased\u2019s families will be well compensated.  Very well, as you know the value of dragon tissues and bones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth appeared to keep an even temper in front of the two delegates, but I saw her tail lash in the hallway, inadvertently slamming it against the wall and sending stone flakes flying.  Her voice was harsh, but controlled.  \u201cMost of these dragons don\u2019t have families and you know it.  We took in those the hospitals turned away when they began to fill up.  You won\u2019t have to pay a penny for their corpses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf from the Circle of Magi inclined his head as if to say that was the point.  The orc said, \u201cLady\u2026 Ramoth.  This is a desperate time for the city.  Our magical and alchemical component stores are nearly running dry with every officer running about casing levitating spells on rubble and every citizen seemingly in need of bandaging and repairing.  You know as well as I that dragon parts supply over half of the city\u2019s demand for magical power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistress of the orphanage cocked her head.  I shrunk into the shadows at the end of the hallway as she turned her head sideways.  \u201cWe lost twelve dragons last night and twice that number are injured.  Some will never be able to fly again.  And you wish to come here and disturb the orphans and the injured before the bodies of their comrades are even cool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc paled even more and rubbed a hand through his grey strands of hair.  The elf stood like stone.  \u201cIt is necessary that we begin the collection process as soon as possible.  Dragon blood will spoil in 18 hours after death and if it is not collected and removed, all of the other organs will be lost as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I will send a courier to you both when you may come to collect the bones after the proper rites have been observed.\u201d Said the Lady with a tone of finality<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the mage looked as though he\u2019d been slapped, the orc took a step forward.  He spoke so quietly that I could barely hear him.  \u201cI know that the orphanage is close to bursting at the seems.  Can you imagine what it will be like with the new wave of orphaned hatchlings that is sure to come as a result of the tragedy yesterday?  I can see to it that our two guilds make a generous donation to your organization if we could remove the bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDar\u2019zhul!  You can\u2019t-\u201c started the elf, but the orc silenced him with a fang-toothed snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can and you will as well, Elandrias.  The blood money has to go somewhere.  It may as well serve living orphans rather than fill the guilds\u2019 coffers.\u201d  The alchemist lifted his head to Lady Ramoth, \u201cWhat say you, Lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth\u2019s face was more twisted with emotion than I\u2019d ever seen it.  She turned away from the two representatives and wiped an eye with the edge of her wing.  Then she took a deep breath and puffed out her chest, though overall, she seemed diminished.  \u201cDo your work quickly and begone.  I will eat anyone who lets the children see what you are doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lady said the last with a matter of factness that left the two gaping.  The elf took a step forward, as if to protest further, but his partner put a hand on the elf\u2019s slighter chest and stopped him.  The orc bowed low before Lady Ramoth.  \u201cThese are grim, desperate times, M\u2019lady.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth said nothing and the two turned to go.  I scrambled to escape the small hallway as Lady Ramoth carefully turned herself about in the narrow space.  Her eyes came forward\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one thing she had been adept at over the years, it was knowing when and where unruly hatchlings were hiding and listening in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard what transpired here did you not?\" said Lady Ramoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my Lady...\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze flashed back toward the elf and the orc, as they call forth the laborers to gather the body parts of the dead. The rage and disdain were all too apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those fiends skulk about,\" she hissed, \"Profiteering from this horrendous tragedy. Have they no sense of morals and sanctity for the dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but agree, especially when I watched a pair of humanoids scoop up Iskierka's distended wing and place it in a box as if it were a product to be bought and sold on the market. That's what we were to those people; products. Considering the number of dragons that had died yesterday, the guild would certainly have no shortage of raw material. Come to think of it, the Alchemists Guild was one of the few buildings to escape the tragedy undamaged... I hoped that this wasn't any sort of conspiracy, as Lady Ramoth seemed to be implying, or else New Alveri had a far worse problem on its hands than the attack itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth let out a sigh; it was her method of regaining her composure, \"Never mind that. Some things cannot be helped...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then looked about the orphanage again; they would need people to help out with all the wounded, and take care of all the little ones that were coming in. \"Lady Ramoth. If you need me to stay to help the staff,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzja, as much as I would like you to stay to help care for the wounded, I sense that you would do far more good for all of us elsewhere,\" she said. \"Your future lies in bigger and better things young dragoness. Yet before you leave, at least you should say goodbye to the orphans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I made my tearful goodbye to the orphanage, this time for good. Of course, they, and in particular, the younger ones, pleaded for me to stay. I was like their second mother to them. I wished I could say that I had the courage to visit Iskierka and say goodbye to her, yet I still found myself unable to bring myself to see her in such a state. There would be no going back for me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, I made my way through the city streets. Most of the fires had been contained, but only now were the cleanup crews beginning to clear out the devastation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed back to look for Kaj, and found his unmistakable figure present at the gate. He was currently overseeing one of the huge tent cities that had sprung up outside the city walls; comprised of the humanoid refugees whose homes had been destroyed during the attack. I had the feeling that many of them would be stuck living like that for a long while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darjza, I'm glad you're all right,\" said Kaj, \"How are things at the orphanage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a moment to gather myself, before explaining to Kaj what had happened during the previous night; how Blaze had gone missing, Iskierka losing her wing and the other occurrences of that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear about that...\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...its....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head to gather myself, before switching subjects, \"Have you heard of any information about who might behind the attack?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truthfully, you probably know as much about it as I. The Holy Knights have not given out any official statement as to who might have been behind the attacks. For instance, if they were to accuse one an orcish terrorist group without any solid evidence behind it, then the general public will direct their rage unfairly on orc population as a whole, and then we'd have an even worse problem on our claws. Furthermore, no group has claimed resonsibility for the attack either, and they would have done so by now. All we can do right now is keep New Alveri from degenerating into chaos and helping its residents rebuild their lives,\" said Kaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\"So, it would seem that nobody has any clue as to who might have orchestrated the attack...\" I growled. I quickly told Kaj about the mage circle and the alchemists guild, and Lady Ramoths implicit suspicions about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard several rumors of the sort already this morning involving some type of conspiracy between the mage guild and the alchemists for more dragon parts. Of course, the mage guild in particular is not well liked by the draconic population even during the best of times, considering that they use our body parts for their various enchantments, and its a knee jerk reaction that blame would be shifted onto them. Besides, I very doubt that even they would go to such lengths for fresh supplies. You must remember that for every dragon killed during the attack, about one hundred humanoids also perished, so whoever did this, did so without regard to whether one was a dragon or not,\" said Kaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know...its just when I saw that elf stuff Iskierka's wing into a box, I just felt so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my teeth tightly, but forced myself to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'm sorry that I wasn't able to tell you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, its just good that I was able to speak with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj smiled for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow Darzja, you might be interested to learn that...</span></div></div>",

The Holy Knights of Nod had not actively recruited new members for over four centuries, not since the great troll rebellions.  I fluttered my wings with elation.  \u201cTruly Kaj?!\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon smiled and inclined his head.  \u201cYes.  They are accepting applications from any citizen, but they tell me that the testing process is intensely difficult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t care what I had to do.  I\u2019d fly over the ocean itself to become a Holy Knight.  This was a once in a lifetime opportunity since dragons were generally barred from joining due to the long lives of the existing Knights and even their partners\u2019 positions were typically handed down generation to generation or otherwise chosen internally.  I was already spreading my bronze wings.  I paused to ask, \u201cKaj, do you think you could put in a good word for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj snorted, \u201cI doubt a Knight would think much of what a civilian militia guard would have to say, but I can\u2019t today anyway, Darzhja.  I\u2019m too busy organizing the refugees on this side of the city.  Sorry.\u201d  The large dragon wore a sad look on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI uplifted a wing and placed it on his shoulder.  I smiled, \u201cI will be a Knight, Kaj.  And I\u2019ll find out who cost Iskierka her wing and tear them apart piece by piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj reached around with his tail and pushed me forward.  \u201cI know you will, now go!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I shortly found myself standing where I had been just yesterday morning, yet it seemed like a lifetime ago.  Before, the Temple had seemed pristine, magnificent and inert, a monument to the symbolic strength of New Alveri and the tenacity of her people.  Now, I realized that all of those landings and buttresses were more than symbolic.  The Temple had become a seething hive of dragons flying in and out and all around, carrying passengers, messages and shipments to and fro.  Horses and other magicked conveyances rushed back and forth through the main gate.  Several statues had tumbled to the ground and shattered and the lawn was a mess with dragon footprints, but no one seemed to mind.  The Temple had become <i>alive</i> in the wake of the destruction of yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of me and in between the bi-directional flows of foot traffic was a familiar face.  The guard who had trounced me soundly yesterday looked no less confident and grim today as he watched me approach slowly on foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who told you this rubbish?\u201d  he said when I\u2019d explained why I was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, I knew Kaj wouldn\u2019t have lied to me, not about this.  \u201cA very good friend of mine.\u201d  I said heatedly.  \u201cI\u2019d trust him with my life and he told me the Knights were recruiting new members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Holy Knights don\u2019t recruit new members.\u201d  The guard intoned as if the words were written on a stone plaque somewhere; which they may have been, I realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This has to be some sort of test.\u2019  I thought desperately.  I took an aggressive posture and raised my tail.  \u201cYou lie!  I\u2019ve been dreaming about this my entire life and I\u2019m not going to let you stop me!  I\u2019m going into that temple!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored guard puffed out his chest and cockily angled his head.  \u201cIs that so, hatchling?  Do you need another lesson so soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled and waved my tail.  The pedestrians to either side of us sudden gave us a wide berth.  Inside, however, I was so afraid.  Afraid because I wasn\u2019t as strong as I was even yesterday for my raw throat and burned neck and afraid that Kaj was wrong and Lady Ramoth was wrong and that I didn\u2019t really have a future.  I was afraid that Iskierka had lost her wing for nothing.  But I had to let my fears and doubts go.  I <i>would</i> be a Knight and all that stood between me and my destiny was the guard standing on the bridge.  \"I'm not a hatching!\"  I cried as I rushed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard reacted as quickly as he had yesterday, but this time I was expecting a counter.  I dodged his tail and leapt into the air, letting my tail collide into his armored flank.  I had no time to feel good about actually hitting him, however as he was right on my tail behind me, much faster than Kaj; maybe faster than me despite the armor.  I used my height advantage before he overtook me.  I whipped at his head with my tail, but he dodged easily and snapped at it so I was forced on the defensive to keep his teeth from sinking into my tail.  He continued to gain on me as we both rose higher before the massive gilded Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered my fight yesterday with Kaj, realizing that he was going to catch me.  I prayed to my Ancestors and hauled myself straight up.  I stalled and fell right as the guard was coming up behind me.  The top of his helmet hit my belly and I scratched at his neck with my hindlegs.  I tried to stop him biting my underbelly by reaching down with my forelegs, but he grabbed one of them instead and bit down hard.  I felt his fangs break through the scales.  He was flapping his wings frantically under my weight, but we were still descending.  He pulled my foreleg and I slid forward over his head.  Before I fell into space, I reached out with my wings, blinding him. My hind legs still around his neck, I came around towards his armored belly and hugged his waist tight, still kicking with my clawed feet against his head and neck.  I didn\u2019t even try to bite through the silver enchanted metal, but I did sink my teeth into his unprotected haunch.  The momentum of my fall turned the guard face down.  <i>Now</i> we were really falling, tumbling around and around.  He pushed and shoved and I stubbornly refused to let go, I bit him again and again where ever I saw scale, not caring how he scratched and bit my flanks and hindquarters.  I was mad with battlerage, sinking my claws into chainmail, ripping it away and biting whatever was underneath.  My teeth sank into something soft and the guard howled like a demon.  I\u2019d just realized what I\u2019d done when we crashed into the moat.  I sank\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I next awoke\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up in a very cold, dank place. My mind spun, as I gazed about. The first thing I noticed was a huge set of bars blocking my path out. Secondly, there was a rather faint, but prevalent mildewy smell. I rose to my feet and tried to move, when I felt something hold me back. A large chain tightly wrapped around my back leg, attached to a giant iron ball. Furthermore, my jaw was muzzled with another metal device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a dungeon!! By the Great Ancestors, why a dungeon of all places!! Immediately, my first impulse was to snap at the chains that bound me, yet the tough metal defied my efforts. I wanted to cry. I had sought to gain entry into the Holy Knights, only to end up in a dungeon, possibly for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up, you're not going to escape,\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did I notice a guard perched in front of my cell. In fact, it was the very same guard that had denied me entrance twice now.  I could make out a bandage wrapped around the midway point of his tail, the spot I had bitten before we both had tumbled into the moat.  Yet all I could do was to glare at the dragon hatefully. After about an hour of this, I turned away from his gaze for a while, trying to pretend he wasn't there, yet the guard continued to watch me intently, he never even moved. It was both irritating and rather creepy, and honestly made me feel uncomfortably vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you enjoy seeing me like this?\" I snarled at the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stepped forward into the light. Without his mask and his thick armor, I couldn't help but admit that the young bronze dragon was actually pretty good looking, and quite muscular, so much so it actually made me pause for a moment. That only served to make it even worse than it already was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact. Yes, I do rather enjoy seeing you languishing in your cell, and if my superiors decided that they'd throw away the key to keep feral amazons like you away from civilized society, I'd be a rather happy dragon indeed\" he answered haughtily. I couldn't tell if he was being facetious or not about the first part, or if he was fulfilling some type of control fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not feral,\" I snapped. \"And I have a name!! Its Darzhja and don't you forget it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard huffed, folding his wings against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" I said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I tell you that prisoner?\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so afraid of that you cannot give me your name?\" I replied. The guard huffed, \"I suppose you're going to be annoying me all night about it, so I shall give you my name. I am Fangorn of the Ironwings, Holy Knight of the Fifth Order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangorn?\" I snorted, and I couldn't help but chuckle a little bit. He frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would a Holy Knight, albeit a low ranked one, be given the duty of watching over me?\" I wondered. \"Did you get demoted perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight's eyes narrowed, which likely signified a yes. \"Trust me, this was not my idea. The wound you gave me was not inconsiderable, and sidelined me from my usual duties, and considering how unstable of mind you are, it was deemed that you should be watched in a secure location before your fate is ultimately decided,\" he answered. At the very least, it meant I wouldn't be spending the rest of my life in the dungeon. Or at least I hoped that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Darzja,\" he asked, scorn mixed with a fair amount of curiosity, \"Why is it you want to become a Holy Knight so badly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care?\" I snorted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather me tell my superior that you attacked me based on the reasoning that you were of frenzied mind?\" Fangorn replied, cocking his head sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I wanted to become a Knight so I would be able to fight all the time. Yet when the attack came.... I saw my friends get hurt. Iskierka lost her wing!! Blaze went missing!! I don't want anything like that ever to happen again, and by becoming a Knight I could protect them, give the other hatchlings at the orphanage hope!!\" I cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I have to admit that I find your resolve admirable, yet make no mistake I do not find you Holy Knight material...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean to tell me that I've been wasting my time!!\" I retorted, interrupting him. \"Is it because I wasn't born to some ancient noble lineage, or that...that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough Darzhja... I don't need to hear your tantrum about how deprived you've been all your life and that I should be feeling sorry enough for you that I would let you join the knights out of charity. I heard your reasons for wanting to become a Holy Knight and shall put them into consideration...\" he responded. I wanted to slash him so badly; and he was so tantalizingly close. Then, he smiled; as if he wanted me to try. I knew at this point it was useless and frankly quite degrading to continue to rage against this recalcitrant stiff. Thus, I curled up and glared at the bronze dragon who had given me so much grief and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you so much...\" I growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, the feeling is mutual,\" responded Fangorn, continuing to keep his expression impassive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, a dragon-shaped shadow appeared from around the corner...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A grim looking dragon came crawling around the corner. He was missing an eye, and missing a front claw, which meant he walked with an unsightly gait, and had numerous scars all along his body. I tensed up immediately. Was he here to torture me or...or worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangorn, is this the one that attacked you at the gate?\" said the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is Warden Sydroth,\" said Fangorn grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here to tell me that I'll be stuck here forever? I'll get out one day!! I'll get out and I'll become a Knight!!\" I began to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider yourself fortunate young one. Apparently there is this Lady Ramoth who is negotiating upon your release,\" said the Warden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lady Ramoth!?\" I cried out in surprise. I felt both relieved, but also somewhat ashamed that she had to bail me out. By the Ancestors, she was going to be so angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean the Lady Ramoth?\" cried Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know her?\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn gave me a look. \"What do they teach you at the orphanage? Lady Ramoth was only one of the most famous Holy Knights ever to serve the Kingdom!! You'd never heard of the battle of the Durandal? She and her rider Lessa were the ones who slew the Troll Chieftain Razhan and his beserkers and turned the tide of battle? Or when as an apprentice knight, she rallied the Knights from certain defeat to a miraculous victory during the Makuran invasions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...that can't be. Lady Ramoth? A Holy Knight?\" I cried, shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe whatever you want to believe then. The point is the Wardens going to let you out, unless you'd rather stay of course...\" replied Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the warden called in a team of humanoids to undo the locks, as Fangorn watched to make sure I wouldn't try to lash out at him, and afterwards follow him out of the dungeon. Yet I was still too much in shock to process this new information that Lady Ramoth was a Knight. Granted, the commoners didn't know that much about the Holy Knights in general, yet if Lady Ramoth had been so famous I figured that I would have at least heard about it. Yet then I remembered, just how long ago it might have been when Ramoth was a Knight. Ramoth had always been the strict, fierce caregiver, never seeming to age one bit. It had never occurred to me to realize that as old as Ramoth was now, there was once a time she was young dragoness like myself, never mind ask what she had done when she was young. I tried to picture it in my mind; Ramoth as a Holy Knight, defeating hordes of Nod's enemies in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, I had been led to the foyer. Lady Ramoth was waiting at the ledge. She spoke to the warden for a moment, and watched him return to his post, before she shot that venemous glare in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, you should have known better than to do something so utterly reckless!! Do you realize how selfish that is of you, that I would have to leave the orphans and the entire staff in order to bail you out of the dungeon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lady Ramoth,\" I replied, keeping my head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamoth let out a angry sigh. She must have had to pull all sorts of strings in order to get me out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you are the Lady Ramoth? This cannot be!!\" said Fangorn, his expression disbelieving and scornful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all you see is a senile old crone is that it fledgling? If you are uncertain of my claim, I dare you to hit me as hard as you possibly can!! Come at me as if I were your worst enemy,\" she challenged. Fangorn froze in place, while Ramoth's gaze remained impassive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd perfer not to find out the hard way...\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem you are not as much of a fool as I imagined,\" she responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Ramoth, did you really used to be a Holy Knight?\" I asked. Of course, I had seen enough evidence from my surroundings, yet I needed to hear it from her. There was a long silence, as her eyes began to wander for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was once a Knight. Yet that was a long, long time ago. So long that to the short-lives it would be but myth and legend, so long ago that,\" she answered. She took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her neck instantly snapped back toward Fangorn, \"In any case hatchling, I do not appreciate the fact that you belittled Darzhja in such a manner and did not provide her with the information she needed. Would you at least be decent enough to escort her to the Cloister of Trials?\" she snapped, seemingly back to her usual demanding self. It seemed to be a deliberate effort to avoid remembering what she once was. Yet at the same time, I couldn't believe how lucky I was, that I would truly get the opportunity to become a Knight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but this is assuming that since she'd be bypassing the recruiters that you'd be sponsoring her,\" replied Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really sponsoring me Lady Ramoth!! Thank you so much!!\" I cried out in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as I'm here, I might as well. Besides, I don't have time to drudge through that wretched beuraucratic red-tape the Knights are known for, not at my age,\" answered Ramoth, trying to appear stoic, but I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she even ready for that trial?\" insisted Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If even an addle-brained hatchling like you passed the trial, then I don't think Darzhja would have too much trouble, and you don't seem smart enough to have cheated,\" answered Ramoth. Fangorn flinched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have my duties back at the orphanage to attend to, now let me be on my way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off faster than I had ever seen her take off, as if she wanted to escape the Temple, escape her past. Meanwhile, Fangorn breathed a sigh of relief, as if he'd just escaped the eye of a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you follow me if you would be so kind?\" said Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sir Knight...\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy mocking me don't you?\" growled Fangorn. \"Perhaps you'd like it back in your cell then Darzhja...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do, I'll make sure to take you with me,\" I sniffed. Probably a bad idea though. It was more than possible that he had a particular fetish for chained up young dragonesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just go...\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off into the air. I followed close behind, and I got to see the inside of the Holy Temple for the first time. The first thing that struck me was that I had never seen so much green grass before. A river passed down the center of the valley, and I saw numerous dragons and humans interacting together. I searched for the skyscrapers that were characteristic of New Alveri, yet I noticed that all of its structures were built into the very walls of the Temple itself. One would have never guessed that outside the Temple walls, New Alveri had been attacked. Fangorn merely looked stoically forward; he was no doubt used to all this wealth and lavishness, yet to my eyes, it was a draconic paradise, a fantasy world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no time for sightseeing. Keep up now...\" said Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled back. Arrogant jerk. How did somebody like him become a knight? It had to be bloodlines, that he was born to parents that were already knights and had all the money in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the way, a dragon came forth. He was a blue dragon of similar size as Fangorn, and looked to be the same age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, never seen you around here before,\" said the blue dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Darzhja, I'm here to take the trial...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is that so Fangorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as unbelievable as that sounds...\" said Fangorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so this the dragoness that gave you that injury? Really Fangorn? From what I heard from you, one would have thought you'd gone up against some hardened criminal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but grunt with amusement at Fangorn's expense. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who thought Fangorn an arrogant blowhard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks can be deceiving with this one Lorath, I must warn you that she has an unfortunate uncontrollable urge to bite people,\" replied Fangorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if they're jerks like you,\" I snarled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's that much trouble I can take her there for you Fangorn,\" answered Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn grunted, \"I can take care of it Lorath, you need not worry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say. Anyhow Darzja, good luck to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll need it...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I followed Fangorn into a shrine. Like the rest of the buildings within the Grand Temple of the Holy Knights, the structure was built into the very walls of the extinct volcano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the chamber resembled the prayer room of the orphanage in many ways. I spotted humanoid priests, professing their faith in the dragon cult. In the center of the circular chamber was a statue of Gyrimond, whose holy manifestation represented the collective will of all the Ancestors who had passed on. Upon its walls were murals of famous Holy Knights and their humanoid partners; the majority of which depicted them in battle against the Kingdom's foes. There was Valinor, the Uniter of the Kingdoms. The Great Sky-Swallower Maximus, who had held back a raging landslide on a mountain pass to allow the villagers below to escape to safety. Yet there was one mural in particular that caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt depicted a young green dragoness, fierce, mighty and beautiful in her full battle armor, with her jaw open as if in the process of letting out a fearsome battle roar, and claws ready to strike, wings fully extended as she swooped down upon a horde of amorphous foes. Riding upon the base of her back was a human female in armor, aiming a lance that should have been far to heavy for a human to possibly carry, never mind wield in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamoth and Lessa, the Maidens of Victory, the depiction read in draconic. It was absolutely striking and also somewhat eeriee to see an image of Lady Ramoth, when she was no older than myself. Yet that dragon was unmistakably her. What might have been going through her mind, at the time this mural was painted? What aspirations did she have for herself then? I then curved my gaze toward the human female that rode upon her back. I remembered that Dragon Knights frequently formed partnership with their humanoid companions, and I could tell that Ramoth seemed especially close with her partner. Their movements seemed in rhythm and in time with one another, as if they could have read each others thoughts. Knowing that the humanoids had rather short lives, Lessa certainly had to be dead, and it may have been one of the factors that had led her to leave the Knights and start an orphanage. There were so many things about her life that I had not even suspected, and so many things I wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly silver dragon approached, clad in priestly robes. It made him look as if he were covered by a large carpet, yet even I knew better not to comment on that and pay respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These walls commemorate those Holy Knights who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, whose feats are celebrated for all time.\" he said with a sagely voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask though, what has brought you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Darzhja, and I am here to take the Cloister of Trials, Holy Father,\" I answered. \"Lady Ramoth is my sponsor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old dragons unfurled his wings slightly, \"Ramoth?\" the dragon said with surprise, his gaze shifting back toward the mural for a moment, \"She has not been heard from ever since she left our order!! Surely you don't mean to play a jest on this old dragon. How would you have come into her acquantence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Ramoth raised me along with all the others at the orphanage at New Alveri. I consider her the closest thing I have to a mother... None of us knew that she was a Holy Knight at one time, and I only found out a little while ago,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly explained the circumstances in which I made the decision to become a Knight, how Lady Ramoth had bailed me out of the dungeon and had agreed to sponsor me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you confirm this tale Fangorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Father Quazios. Lady Ramoth came by personally to the dungeon to bail her out, and I have confidence that all the paperwork is in order as well,\" answered Fangorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take your word for it Fangorn, yet if you do not mind, allow me to take a moment to confirm what you have said...\" said Quazios. Quazios waved his claw in a slight circle, and a moment later, a scroll materialized. I couldn't help but be amazed at this act of magic, never mind fathom how he had done it. I made my way to the side of the old bishop and read draconic characters depicted on the large leather sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Father Quazios<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it has been a long time since I ended my association with the Holy Knights, yet know that I am well. After having lost my dear Lessa and my eternal Knight, Lord Mnementh, it took many years of soul searching, until with the aid of the Great Ancestor, I discovered my new purpose in life, providing care and shelter for abandoned hatchlings. I never intended to gain any sort of recognition for my efforts; that I was able to give hope for those who would not have it otherwise gave me all the reward I needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving intended to fully put my past as a Knight behind me, I find it ironic but perhaps fitting that one of the hatchlings I raised in my orphanage would dream of becoming a Knight one day. So here I find myself once again, having come full circle, returning to the order I have devoted the majority of my life towards, to submit this reccommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the day she arrived at the orphanage, Darzhja has been a clawful for myself and my staff to handle. She is excessively adventurous and daring, and delights in taking part in the most reckless shenanegins imaginable. Keeping an eye on her has been an ordeal as challenging as any opponent I had ever faced in the field of battle. Yet from the beginning, I sensed a strong spirit within her, a willingness to do good, to stand up for others regardless of the circumstances.  In many ways, she reminds me of myself when I was that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I declare that I shall give my sponsorship in that Darzhja be allowed to undergo the Cloister of Trials, so that she may prove herself worthy of protecting the denizens of Nod as a Holy Knight. I have full confidence that she will succeed not only as a Holy Knight, but any worthy endeavor she sets her mind toward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all regards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a boon to hear from her once again. I say without reservation, that when Lady Ramoth left the Knights, we were diminished. It does my hearts well to know she has found contentment in her life, and that you should take great pride that she speaks so fondly of you,\" said Quazios. I couldn't help but feel heartened as well. Lady Ramoth had always been extremely strict with us, and especially with me, but I realized that she was only doing it to push us to be the best that we could be, and that she truly cared about us. For a long time, I had bemoaned the fact that I had never known my birth parents, but I realized how truly fortunate I had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only question to be asked now, Darzhja, is whether you are fully committed to take the trial, come what may?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I will take the trial and become a Holy Knight, and if I am successful I will devote my entire life to protect Nod's people and the people I care for,\" I answered without hesitation. Of course, I had absolutely no idea what would await for me inside, yet there was no turning back now. This was my chance. Failure, was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangorn, would you escort the clergy from the chamber?\" asked Quazios. Fangorn nodded, as the priests silently left the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja,\" said Fangorn, as he headed out. \"I bid good luck to you. I am certain that you will succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I hearing things?\" I called out in surprise, \"What ever happened to 'someone like you can't possibly be holy knight material?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn tilted his head away and led out a short grunt, as if he couldn't recall that he'd said anything like that at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you anyhow Fangorn,\" I answered. Then, more to my surprise, he returned an smile encouragingly, it was the first genuine smile that I'd ever seen from him. Then, he exit the chamber and take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then focused my attention back toward Father Quazios.  </span></div></div>",

I first thought he was going to lead me to some hidden door, to begin the trial, but then it occurred to me that perhaps the trial had already begun. Only, I didn't have the faintest idea of what I should do!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father Quazios, could you give me a clue?\" I asked. My hearts beat nervously, hoping that I hadn't messed things up already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need only ask Darzhja. If one cannot find answers on your own, it is never unwise to seek help,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My advice is that you should look toward the Ancestors, and perhaps they may tell you more...\" answered Quazios. I tilted my head sideways. Look toward the Ancestors? How was that a clue? Deciphering out riddles and cryptic messages was never my strong suit, yet that was all I had to work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look to the ancestors? Could you be a bit more specific about what you mean by that?\" I asked. Yet when I looked back up, Father Quazios had vanished, leaving me alone in an empty chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was one of the murals? However, that didn't seem likely. Not all the dragons depicted in the murals had passed on to join the Ancestors, Lady Ramoth being chief among them. However, that did not stop me from searching for some type of secret door, of which I found none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching fruitlessly, I was forced to once again think about Quazios' last riddle, Look toward the Ancestors, and perhaps they may tell you more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that my gaze shifted toward the towering statue of Gyrimond that dominated the center of the chamber. After all, Gyrimond was the manifestation of the collective will of the Ancestors. Though I doubted that I would find some secret switch, it was all I had, so I crawled forward so that I was facing them. I found myself staring at the statue for a while, half-expecting it to come alive or something like that, yet it did not. Perhaps 'look' was a more metaphorical term?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI searched my mind, trying to think of anything that might have given me a clue. Every week, Lady Ramoth would lead us in prayer for the blessings of the Ancestors. I never could stay still for those silent prayers, as I would often poke the human priests next to me for fun and watch them not react at all. Plus, I always thought that the proper stance one should take while in prayer was rather ridiculous, so I also put myself in strange stances as well. After prayer, Lady Ramoth would always scold me afterwards. She was a deeply religious dragoness, and took exception if anyones piety was seen as lacking. Later on, I behaved a bit better, but I still didn't take the prayers all that seriously. Yet now I knew that Lady Ramoth had once been a Holy Knight, and it obviously stood to reason that a strong faith to the Ancestors was a vital component of the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I closed my eyes and tilted my neck to the sky, pointing my chest forward to bare my soul before the Ancestors, and I prayed. I prayed that they would hear me and for them to guide me on my path, and also prayed that they would forgive me that I had not prayed enough. Most of all, I thanked the Ancestors for already allowing me to come this far, and that I would live my life in the service to others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo deeply that I prayed that I found myself in a trance. My hearts pounded faster and faster, my breath coming in deep, shuddering pulses. There was a sensation of being pulled forth off my feet, wings unfurling slowly, my mouth slightly open as I let out a soft, high-pitched squeak as I embraced them into my soul. I felt my surroundings whirl and spin, as the Ancestors spirits swirled around me, searching me, becoming one with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Darzhja...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came clear and echoing deep within me. The Ancestors, they had spoken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you...\" I whispered, both enraptured and more than a little frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Will you pledge your soul to us, that your faith will be undying and unquestioned from this point forward?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my soul, and shall devote myself to your will, so when the time should come that my spirit departs from this mortal body, that mine will be worthy to merge with yours in the afterlife to guide those that follow,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Now, open your eyes my child...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly lowered myself from my stance of prayer, before opening my eyes. I took in a breath. I was no longer in the chamber, but found myself upon a large glowing platform. Beyond the platform was a swirling vortex of purple mist. My eyes widened and I took in a deep breath as I tried to rationalize where I was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Faith spoke of a place known as Convexity, that vague state of purgatory where ones soul was judged by the Ancestors before either moving on to join them, or being cast down to the Powers Below. Thus, it would be inaccurate to say that I was in a tangible place, but rather it was more a state of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>So much to do...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice no longer came from inside my head, but echoed all around the dream world. I gazed about, but could find no discernable point of origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>So little time...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancestors? Is that you? What do you mean?\" I called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Are you afraid?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little bit afraid. Yet I forced myself to take a breath and regain my composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Then step forward Darzhja, can you do it?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a simple enough request, yet my claws seemed strangely heavy. I did step forward, pledging my faith that these were the Ancestors speaking to me and they would not lead me astray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Great power sleeps within you. If you give it form. It will give you strength...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared down at my claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Use your power to protect yourself and others...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from scattered points on the perimeter of the platform, glowing pillars of energy burst from the ground. When the glowing ceased, I saw what appeared to be trolls made out of clay, armed with weaponry, armor and war paint of the last Great Troll Rebellions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>There will be times where you'll have to fight... Keep your faith burning strong</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent downwards into a fighting stance. This was what I knew how to do, and my muscles twitched, ready to pounce. There was always that slight fear, but more so that anticipation that flowed through my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let loose a roar as I leapt forward to slash the first troll manequin, which burst into a mist of energy and then dissapating into the air. I quickly spun around and swiped at another two, and in one motion, swung my tail forward and caught several more. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what appeared to be a hand axe spin through the air end of end, quickly deflecting it away deftly with my wingtip, before charging forward and slamming into it with my horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to celebrate my victory, as there was another burst of light, revealing more humanoid looking opponents. Wasting no time, I charged forward and dealt with them before they could attempt to attack. No sooner had these been defeated when there was another burst of light. There were more of them, and this time they surrounded me on all sides. I dealt with the small crowd on my back, as the others rushed forward from the other three sides. Noticing how they had gathered into a group, I unleashed a burst of flame, incinerating them into proverbial dust, before mopping up the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that!!\" I called out triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Not all triumphs will come so easily... To overcome you must push yourself to the limit...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouched won and prepared myself for another fight, expecting to see the pillars of light again. However, my feet suddenly came out from under me as the platform I was standing on suddenly shattered like glass as I let out a cry of surprise. I frantically began flapping my wings and steadying myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had I managed to steady myself in flight did I sense the air above me shift. I looked up, to see a large shape approach from above. At the last moment I managed to fold my wings and veer sharply to the right. I curved around to see a dragon shaped opponent. Like the humanoid clay fighters, the dragon had no face and was likely a construct rather than anything that possessed free sentient will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI curved around to face my opponent, but then out of the corner of my eye I saw more dragon-shaped constructs approach from the swirling mists. Fighting masses of relatively fragile humanoids was one thing, but dragons was another matter all together. They were closing in rapidly. I had to make a decision fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never being one to turn down a brawl, even when I was at a disadvantage, I looked the the incoming faceless dragons not with fear - well, maybe a <i>little</i> fear, but a little fear is always a good thing - but with a grim certainty and expectation.  I pumped my wings, pulling myself higher in the swirling mists of the void surrounding me.  \"Show me what you can do!\"  I roared in challenge.  And they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was already higher than the one closest to me.  Up close, my opponents were not much to look at.  They had wings, four claws, a tail and a long neck with a fang filled maw at the end, but everything else was indistinct.  The scale color was barely discernible, shifting hues from red to blue to green to black, but always behind a thick layer of grayish haze.  They lacked the normal distinguishing features of a dragon, the horns, the eyes, the shape of the snout and the wings.  It was almost as if it were merely the hazy memory of a long forgotten dragon opponent.  As I swept down towards it, I supposed that could be exactly what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was clearly inexperienced, it realized too late that I had the height advantage.  It tried to dive, but I was already on it.  I swept in across the dragon's back at an angle, it was a little smaller than me as well.  I ripped the wing membranes under me, ahead of the spine with my fore-claws, behind with my hind-legs.  I passed in what seemed an instant, leaving the crippled dragon to plunge down into the mists.  But there were more, more dragons flapping their way towards me from whatever direction I cared to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wings burned as I pulled myself higher still, but my next two opponents matched my efforts.  One was coming straight on, the other maneuvering around to flank me.  I roared and charged toward the incoming dragon, claws outstretched.  I folded my wings to protect them as I slammed my body into the dragon like a missile.  It's wings surrounded me and we began to fall.  the momentum of the charge bowled the dragon over backwards, we were belly to belly, spinning head over heels.  My neck heart pumped to deal with the g-forces as we grappled, biting and clawing one another.  I bashed my skull against the creature and used the split second lapse to pin its forelegs.  It struggled, but I was stronger.  Using the leverage I had by holding onto it, I lifted my hind-legs and dug my claws into its belly.  Something wet and warm came out as I gutted the thing, but felt more like viscous jelly than actual entrails.  The creature writhed and went limp; I let it fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wings came clear of me, I spread my own, swiftly correcting my spinning.  But the world had changed.  Now instead of a shapeless void, I was in the midst of some unknown mountain range.  Stone walls soared all around me and lightning flashed in a stormy black sky.  I saw my attacker only due to a fortunate flash.  It was diving down at me, so I spun just as he was going to hit me.  Instead of hitting my back, he slammed against my chest.  I tried to grab it, but it was moving too fast and my claws slid across the scales.  I turned to pursue but was assaulted again from the other side.  The blow was like a battering ram to my flank; again my attacker did not stay for close combat.  Flapping wings filled the night sky and they were all heading for me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do?!\"  I cried to the formless, seething heavens.  I couldn't possibly defeat all of these dragons by myself.  Three of the dragons circling me began to dive, I could tell by the way the shape of their wings changed.  I did the only thing that I could do.  Continuing to flap wearily through the rising mountains around me, the diving dragons adjusted their courses.  When they were close enough, I folded my right wing and sent myself careening to  the left.  The three hurtled by where I just was, opening their wings far below me.  But there were more out for my blood, always more and I found it was all that I could do just to avoid their attacks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bravery is not measured in heads and broken bodies\u2026 Only the true warrior understands the value of life\u2026</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in me wanted to take the fight back to those dragons, but this was a fight that I clearly could not win.  I thought of Ophelia back at the orphanage, now straddled with a responsibility the young dragoness felt she wasn't prepared for.  I thought of Blaze, who remained missing, maybe scared and alone someplace, wishing for his family, maybe dead.  I thought of Iskierka who would never fly again.  They all still needed me, in one way or another.  We needed each other.  Where each of us had lost our families, we'd built a new one out of the wreckage.  They, and Lady Ramoth, and all the other orphans, they were my family.  And it was then as I drove myself onward through the cold air, ducking and diving and trying to stay alive, that I realized that the same could be applied to the whole of dragonkind, and perhaps the whole of New Alveri as well.  They were my family and they all needed me, just as I needed them.  Was this what the knights were talking about when they spoke of their honor and their duty to protect others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a deep draught of breath and I was suddenly showered by a thick rain.  I felt the drops bouncing off the leather of my wings and they had the nasty side effect of dampening my sense of the air currents above me that I'd been relying on to dodge attacks.  \"I have to get out of here.\"  I told myself.  I dove straight down, racing the droplets on their way to earth.  And I did see it below.  Spiky protrusions that could have been either rocks or trees rose from the mountainside below.  I let myself fall until I was only about a body length above their tops.  The dragons no longer dove at me, as a missed attempt would now result in death.  I beat my wings furiously to keep aloft, driving myself forward and away from my pursuers.  Four dragons were tailing me, the rest seemed to be lost in the mists and the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked my water lids rapidly for the deluge pouring into my face, but I dared not close them completely because I couldn't afford to blur my vision now.  I weaved left and right.  Now sinking below the tops of the spikes, then rising.  My pursuers followed me with the intent of the damned.  I was getting tired and there seemed no relief in sight.  I wasn't strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Trust in one's friends is the truest form of strength...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that I saw three dragons approaching in front of me, one red, one gold and one green.  What shocked me more than seeing my three best friends suddenly appear was seeing Iskierka with her wing strong and restored.  Though I was tired and beaten, I wanted to cry with joy.  I turned and rose with my comrades, each of us facing an attacker head on.  Blaze, if not as good a fighter as I was, was certainly flashier.  The young fire-lord caught hold of his opponent's claws and before they could begin to grapple in full, spewed gallons and gallons of burning, molten death onto his opponent's chest, neck and face.  The display illuminated the entire area with a magnesium intensity as the dragon fell like a flare.  I had crashed into my attacker at an upward angle.  I pumped my wings, continuing upward and I jumped higher when I got my hind legs on its shoulders.  I wrapped my tail around the dragon's neck and slit its throat as I pulled myself past with the edge of my serrated arrowhead; again, a dark jellied liquid poured out, like liquified dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo either side, I saw Ophelia and Iskierka trading blows with their opponents, circling far and coming together again in brief, but furious attacks.  I looked to Blaze just a little below me.  He nodded and angled off to help Ophelia.  I turned to Iskeirka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could reach her, however, the grey dragon rushed her and bit deeply into her left wing.  She screamed the same scream I'd heard when they'd sawed off her wing in the orphanage.  Watching it happen again felt like dying.  It was my fault... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Guilt is as deadly a poison to the soul as Hate...  One must learn to forgive, not only others, but oneself...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing.  \"Not again.  Not again!!\"  I howled, winging my way to the gold dragon.  Her mangled wing fluttered uselessly in the air as she fell.  The one who'd maimed her floated smugly in the air and began to turn towards me.  Fire exploded somewhere behind me, and illuminated the grey dragon's face.  Except he wasn't grey anymore, he was black now and he did have a face.  A face that I had never seen before, or at least I didn't think I'd seen.  He smiled cruelly, seeming to grow to incredible size.  Dragon blood dripped from his claws though I hadn't seen him rip into Iskierka.  'Who are you?'  I asked silently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than face the enormous menace, I dove for Iskierka who was spinning toward the ground.  The black dragon was coming down on top of me, his wings spreading to obscure the sky.  The ground raced towards me, but I  followed the gold dragon heedlessly.  I grabbed hold of her about the waist just under the wing membrane.  But too late, the ground was too near.  My wings strained with the effort to slow us, but it was not enough.  Behind me the black dragon laughed, so large he was more of a world than a dragon.  The ground rushed forward to meet us, black against black.  I cared about nothing except for holding on to Iskierka.  I prayed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up, gazing about in confusion. I found myself in the middle of destroyed city of New Alveri. The sky exploded with lightning, while in the backdrop to the darkness and chaos, powerful vortexes sucked in the broken rubble of the city I knew into the abyss. Before me, was that giant black dragon loomed over me, oozzing dark energy.  Yet the characteristic that chilled me to the bone was the fact it possessed but one good wing, the other broken and shattered; exactly how Iskierka's had been. The black dragon had consumed Iskierka, I realized, and now it was vengeful, hateful, despairing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancestors!! Help me!!\" I called out. There was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>They cannot hear you here. They are deaf to you...</b> Shadow Iskierka responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pray to them however much you want, for they have abandoned you. So prepare yourself to the abyss!!</b> the shadow dragon snarled, Iskierka's voice interposed with a deeper, more sinister one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts sank with panic, as I fumbled for words, words that could express how sorry I was for the loss of her wing, finding none. I struggled to stay on my feet, as a horrible sense of shame and helplessness pervaded over my soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus Darzhja!! Focus!!</i> I told myself. This was part of the test. I had to defeat this terrible foe, by the Ancestors, before I could move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you'll pay for that!!\" I shouted, \"For what you did to Iskierka!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to hold the rising tide of panic in check, I leapt forward toward the monstrocity. It seemed to take an eternity to close the distance, as if I was flying directly into a headwing, and indeed the closer I got Shadow Iskierka seemed to loom larger and larger. I didn't have any illusions that I'd be able to do much damage to it, yet I knew I had to at least try.  I reared back to strike, and then found myself blown backwards by an invisible barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy vision went red as I found myself careening back across the way I came, crashing through broken remnants of buildings and landing awkwardly on my side.  I rushed forward again, only to found myself being thrown back again, and again. As I fought, images of Iskierka buried beneath the rubble, hearing her cry out and pain in despair, played out in an endless loop, sapping my resolve. No matter what I did, nothing seemed to be able to hurt it. In fact, its evil only seemed to grow more and more virulent, while I got weaker and weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, I collapsed out of exhaution, gazing up at Shadow Iskierka's despairing screech. Every bone and muscle in my body ached, and I spat out blood. Blood, how could I spit out blood? This was only a dream was it? I was really in the Temple!! Wasn't I? Wasn't this only a test? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could no longer be sure now. What I did know was that I was trapped, helpless before this Shadow Iskierka, born out of my own guilt and despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You were the one who could not save me... Its your fault!!</b> Shadow Iskierka responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iskierka!! Please!! Stop this!!\" I called out desperately, hoping that the kind, quiet dragoness I had known all my life was still there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Why should I?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're not like this!! You're my friend!!\" I begged, hoping it would listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Friend?</b> it scoffed, <b>I always hated you Darzhja, your cocky self-confidence, your recklessness and how you tried to prove that you were better than anybody else...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt sad that she would say something like that. Yet I was sad not of the fault she was accusing me of, but that Iskierka would fall into such a dark pit of despair through the fault she attributed to me. I would not see that happen to her, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I am a lot of those things. I've done a lot of things that have gotten hurt, and maybe I'm the one who should have lost my wing instead of you. Yet this didn't turn out that way.... Sometimes...life isn't fair. If that means that I am the one you must hate for the rest of my life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...I'm all right with that. I'll still do everything I can to protect you, and would give my life to protect yours if I must. Maybe I won't ever fully get over what happened, but I don't want the rest of your life to be a sad one. I know things won't be the same as they once were, before all this happened, but at the very lease, I hope that we can be friends again,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause. Its movements began to slow. Then, the Shadow quivered, as if in an immense amount of pain, before beams of white energy began breaking out all over its body. Soon, the Shadow was completely engulfed by the light. I turned away from the light blinding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I forgive you Darzhja...</i> came Iskierka's voice in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those simple words, I felt a huge weight lift from my soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light cleared, I found myself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I found myself once more upon a levatating platform, where I had begun my test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>There will be times when you walk upon the valley of the shadow of death, and within the darkness our voices become dim. Keep your light burning strong, and you will see it through...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in relief. The Ancestors hadn't abandoned me after all, not that I should have doubted them in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Now, you will encounter our servant, the Chronicler. He has watched your journey, and through him, will judge whether you shall become the instruments of our will upon the mortal realm.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glowing rune appeared at the center of the platform. I walked forward and stood at the center. At first, nothing happened. It didn't take me long to remember the prayer I had made to the ancestors within the shrine, that had taken me to Convexity in the first place. Perhaps the rune worked in a similar manner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I twisted my neck up into the sky and prayed, allowing the spirits of my Ancestors to peer into my spirit. I prayed that I would be able to reconsile with Iskierka when I returned to the mortal realm, prayed that I would be found worthy by the Ancestors and thankful for all they had given me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, there was that odd feeling of being swept off my claws, spinning out of control with no knowledge of where I'd end up in. When the spinning stopped, I opened my eyes. I found myself standing upon a pedastal, glowing with a bronze light, mirroring the color of my scales. Torches hung suspended as if by magic all around the chamber, and surrounding me were rows upon rows of books. Directly in front of me was a large, grey dragon of unidentifiable element. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, I could only stare into the ancient dragons features, transfixed and feeling almost unworthy that I was in the presence of an individual directly chosen by the Ancestors themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... hello?\" I asked, cocking my neck sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I greet you young one. I am the Chronicler, chosen by the Great Ancestors above to uphold the integrity of Convexity, allowing those who have not yet passed on to venture inside,\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also the one who will evaluate you as a candidate for the Holy Knights,\" he said. The informality that he addressed me with in his second statement took my breath away for a moment. It also put me a little bit more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand different questions bounced around my head. Here before me was a dragon who was ancient beyond reckoning, so ancient that he might have known Gyrimond himself!! So of course, I had to ask a fairly silly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all the books on the walls?\" I asked, gazing about curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of my duties as the Chronicler, is to keep a record of our people; every dragon from the very first until the very last. You see these records as books, as it is the most efficient way mortals can rationalize this realm. Yet unlike the books in your mortal realm, these books are constantly being written and re-written, and contain nearly infinite possibilities of events that have yet to have occurred, of dragons yet unborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chronicler pulled out a book and placed it upon a pedastal, \"So, you are Darzhja. You have lived 73 cycles, having had no knowledge of your birth parents, and raised in an orphanage, whereupon you have made the decision to join the Holy Knights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you know everything about me in this book? Like who sired me, how exactly I ended up in the orphanage, things that would otherwise be unknown?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do in fact, yet if I told you, then I'm afraid that I could not allow you to return to the mortal realm,\" he answered. He didn't necessarily sound threatening, but rather as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, \"I figured as such.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, allow me to ask you a few quick questions. What is most important to you?\" asked the Chronicler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask? Don't you already know?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I would like to hear it anyhow, if only to appease the fancies of this old wyrm. Don't make the answers long winded, short and to the point,\" the Chronicler answered, deftly flourishing his ink brush in his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends and family are the most important,\" I answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he replied. He scribbled something in his book, which momentarily glowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on, what is it you fear the most?\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately pictured Iskierka having her wing removed, how helpless I felt that I was able to do nothing to prevent it from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I would be unable to protect those I love. Being helpless in the face of evil.\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Yet what do you ultimately want out of your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother vague question, one that I could have spent ages contemplating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... something... that'd I'd want out of my life... is that through my efforts in the Knights I can help create and preserve a safe world for everyone to live in. As for what I want for myself... perhaps a mate one day, or being able to fight for fun once and a while rather than to protect the kingdom all the time, I'd like a bit of fame and I wouldn't mind a mural detailing my exploits, but I don't want it to get to my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. One always finds the essence of somebody when they must answer on first impulse, rather than having time to prepare...\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I could hold you here for quite some time, yet I suppose that mortals like you don't have millenia to waste philosophizing. Thus, based upon what you have answered, and comparing that to how you performed on your trial...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately stood up straighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, you possess an unparalleled raw talent in the facet of direct combat. When you know the foe it is you fighting and why you are fighting them, I would say you would be superb indeed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In comparison, your ability to manipulate the elements is but average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not the most pious dragoness when growing up, yet your spirituality has grown a great deal in a short amount of time. Having never known your birth parents, you value companionship especially, and vow to protect them by any means necessarily. When they get hurt, you agonize over their pain as if it were your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fate has many possible futures I see, many good, some great, some that may lead to despair, also possibly a combination of all these, yet which future depends upon the choices you make in life. I suppose you already knew all that, and again, rather than bore you with cryptic riddles and long-winded philosophy, I would suppose that you'd wish to know whether or not you've passed the trial,\" said the Chronicler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts pounded in anticipation, praying for acceptance, but also at the same time preparing for failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thus, I find that despite the rather unorthodox nature of your candidacy, I cannot help but be intrigued at discovering how you'll fare as a Holy Knight...\" said the Chronicler. For a moment, my mind failed to register what the Chronicler just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that means I passed?\" I cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that not what I just said?\" he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million thoughts passed through my head, all at once. I passed. By the Ancestors I'd actually passed, and now I was going to be a Knight. Like Lady Ramoth was. All the hardship, no parents, seeing my friends hurt, being rejected time after time... it had all meant something after all. My elation crested as I shut my eyes and let out a cry of joy, dancing around the pedastal where I stood, not caring whether my outburst was un-Knightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, congratulations Darzhja,\" answered the Chronicler, seeming somewhat bored. After all, he must have seen these outbursts of joy all too often, having screened generation after generation of Knights. He waited until I had calmed myself before continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I will return you to your mortal body now, and when you reawaken you will be a Holy Knight. Though you're now a Knight, consider this but the beginning of a new step in your life's journey. With that, I shall bid you farewell for the time being, and when the time comes that we reunite it shall hopefully after a long and noble tenure of service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye then!! And once again, thank you,\" I answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go forth young Knight,\" he chanted. The Chronicler's image faded away, along with the chamber that he had taken residence in, and once more I found myself swept off my claws, under the mercy of the Ancestors, swirling through Convexity while thanking the Ancestors for granting me the priviledge of becoming a Knight. Images flashed through my head, that spoke of honor, chivalry, sacrifice and upholding its sacred code, filling me with ancient knowledge of its rites. And there was power, a power that been lit within the very depths of my soul, now awakened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what had seemed like both eternity, and no time at all, I found that I could control my body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes. I found myself back in the Temple, standing before the statue of Gyrimond. Before me stood a small gathering of Holy Knights in full armor. I recognized Father Quazios among the Knights, yet I had no idea who the others were. I too was now clad in armor, yet felt more ceremonial than something I would actually fly into battle with. Yet I felt as if I belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black dragon in armor stepped forward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I am Lord Demios, one of the nine dragons priviledged to hold office within the High Council, and I bid you welcome, Darzhja of New Alveri, into the order Holy Knights of Nod, chosen by the Great Ancestors above to fulfill their will upon the mortal world,\" the black dragon spoke with a deep, noble voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while I wasn't sure how to react to the notion that a Deathwing was a Holy Knight, and one of such influence at that. Regal Bronzes and Deathwings traditionally never got along, and the few that I'd met always seemed bitter, gloomy and unfriendly. Personally, I didn't have anything against Deathwings, but Holy Knighthood didn't seem a likely profession for them. Apparently, I was wrong in that regard. Furthermore, perhaps the very fact that Lord Demios was a Deathwing and his element were known to have a malevolent reputation, he made extra effort to adhere to chivalry and formality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... honored Lord Demios,\" I responded. The gathered Knights gazed at me, as if expecting me to give some sort of sacred vow, or its code. Of course, I didn't know any such code, having grown up in the orphanage of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Lord Demios, yet I do not know any of its sacred rituals, nor any of its creeds. All I can promise is that I will protect the people of New Alveri, combat evil wherever it is found and that by the Grace of the Ancestors I have the strength and wisdom to do so,\" I answered with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Demios nodded, \"Scripture can be learned, yet what truly matters is that the Ancestors found you worthy of joining our order, and thus we are expecting many great things out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned toward Father Quazios, \"Now then, Holy Father, if you would be so kind as to administer the order of initiation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deathwing stepped backwards, and was replaced by the old cleric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Darzhja, will you kindly lower your head,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you pledge your service to Nod and all its subjects, maintaining law in order in times of peace and defend them with claw, tooth, wing, tail and piety during times of war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall...\" I answered without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you faithfully adhere to our orders tenants, and live your life according to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Quazios chanted a few more proclamations, of which I answered affirmative to each one, before he laid a claw upon my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus, I dub thee Lady Darzhja, Holy Knight of Nod, with all the responsibilities and priviledges granted as such...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now rise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the ceremony was largely over. It had been a rather humble ceremony; after all, while I was now officially a Knight, I had achieved but initiate status. As the Chronicler had said to me earlier in Convexity, this was but a beginning of a long journey, rather than the crowning accomplishment. There was still a lot I had to learn, and I would have to pay my dues and work tirelessly and even thanklessly in order for me to advance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke to a few of the Knights, once again congratulating me on my initiation. They asked me a lot about my time in the orphanage, and specifically the influence Lady Ramoth had upon me. I had quickly learned that during the time I had undergone the trial, all the Knights had learned of Lady Ramoth's re-emergence from self-imposed exile, and quickly, the focus of their conversation switched from myself to her. I didn't mind it that much actually. After all, my own ascension to Holy Knighthood had as much to do with her wisdom and guidance alongside my own merit, and thus deserved praise as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese Knights, I observed, were in their regard for Lady Ramoth very much like the wide-eyed younger hatchlings back at the orphanage, whole-heartedly believing my exaggerated stories of martial prowess and that I was an invincible conquering hero. Lord Demios, for all his power and influence, had been but a fledgling when Ramoth had left the Knights, and the others had only heard of Ramoth through her tales of heroism, having hatched after her departure, so to them she had a mythical quality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, she must be very proud to know of your accomplishment. Now then Darzhja,\" said Lord Demios, \"I congratulate you once more on your initiation, yet I must return to my duties now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned to one of the Knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arathos,\" commanded Lord Demios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green dragon came forward, standing stiff in salute. \"Yes my Lord!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm placing you in charge of getting Darzhja oriented with her duties, as well as aiding her in getting her affairs in order,\" instructed Demios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well my Lord,\" he answered with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI switched my gaze over to the green dragon. He hadn't particularly stood out from any of the others during the post-ceremonial congratulations, yet he gave the impression of being the solid and reliable sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I followed Araphor over the Temple grounds, taking in my new surroundings. The Temple, I would be living here for many years, perhaps centuries to come, so one did not need to be the Chronicler to understand that I should familiarize myself with its layout as soon as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a Knight newly inducted into our order, you'll be placed under a strict training regimen to better prepare you for the duties of Knighthood. This is required for all incoming knights, and failure to complete them within the required amount of time may get you stripped of your Knighthood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stripped of my Knighthood?\"  I shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only in rare cases. You'll find out exactly what these requirements are later on, but for now allow me to give you explain the layout of the Temple,\" said Araphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, we don't have the time to cover every nook and cranny within the temple, and some of the places are currently forbidden, so I'll show you the places you need to know of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Araphor close behind as he took off from the shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, I was led to a cave that had copious amounts of smoke seething out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the smithys, that deals with all the armaments and metalworking within the Temple. You'll receive a set of a suit of armor to use on missions, and they'll also fix any superficial damage received during missions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I be able to customize my armor as well?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a fee of course,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, let us move on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was then taken to another one of the large ledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the medical ward. Should you get injured during a mission, or if you suffer an illness, you are covered free of charge. Furthermore, despite the fact you'd been chosen by the Ancestors themselves, you'll also be required to undergo a full physical examination to ensure your fitness for duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An...exam?\" I asked, feeling somewhat nervous. \"What exactly goes on during this exam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief awkward moment, as Araphor curved his gaze away for a moment. \"The specifics will be explained by the healers, and you'll be informed which results you wish to remain confidential. I'm not a doctor in anycase...\" he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...moving on now, perhaps we should find a more comfortable setting to answer more of your questions. After enduring the trial, I'm sure you must be very hungry. Would you mind if I showed you the hunting grounds?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did I remember that I hadn't eaten anything since I was back at the orphanage, and after the euphoria of the ceremony had worn off, I was indeed famished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors yes!! I could eat a wyrern!! Show the way!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then follow me then,\" answered Araphor with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the hunting grounds. You are permitted to hunt one adult beast per day free of charge, yet any additional animals will come with a customary charge,\" explained Araphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, once you've picked out an animal, meet me back by the rivers edge so we can discuss this further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was only half listening to him, as my eyes were fixed upon the giant herds of cattle below. Having grown up on dried meat, thin beef stew and other rather spartan meals, the sight of these large, fat cattle made my mouth water. They were all just standing there, waiting to fill my belly. A fresh, live, kill. My eyes grew wide and predatory as I circled overhead, watching my prey.  I soon spotted a particularly tasty looking cow, landing upon it. It attempted to resist me, its legs futilely kicking about, and honestly I couldn't help but savor the animals helplessness for a moment, before I decided to slash out its throat. Satisfied, I picked it up and glided over to where Araphor was waiting, who had already picked out a large bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took one bite of the cow, feeling its raw, blood go down my throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!! I've never tasted anything so great in my life!!\" I called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely resisted the urge to simply bury my head into its juicy corpse and devour it, but though what little I knew of etiquette, it probably would have been 'unknightly'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Temple employs the finest humanoid shepards to provide sustenence for the Knights. As you no doubt have already been able to tell, the humanoids provide an abundant number of essential services to keep the Temple maintained and operational.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew dragons wanted to admit it, but without the humanoids to do the tasks that dragons found rather trivial, New Alveri would have collapsed into chaos and dragons would have been relegated to a society of disparate clans. Once again, dragons needed the humanoids as much as the humanoids needed us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also heard a lot about how dragons can partner with a humanoid Knight. I've heard how Lady Ramoth had a very deep relationship with Lessa, but most of the time I don't see the Knights accompanied with a humanoid rider. Can you explain how that works?\" I wondered, after taking a few bites of its gut. I recalled how Lady Ramoth had possessed an extremely deep bond with Lessa, and that when she had died Ramoth had been devastated. While I had worked with humanoids within New Alveri, I was not willing to commit to that type of relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramoth's bond with Lessa is a rare case. Mostly, we are partnered with the humanoid knights based upon the particular needs of the mission. For instance, if the mission requires you to scout out a new area, the partner that will be assigned to you will be one that has expertise in scouting. Similarly, if you were to be called to battle, then a partner who is adept at martial prowess will be given to you. Once you've advanced enough, you can pick whichever humanoid you feel would help you the most within any specific mission, yet while you remain an initiate the humanoids you'll be working with out on the field will be assigned,\" answered Araphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who will be the one who decides the humanoids that are assigned?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mentor. While you are an apprentice knight, one of the more experienced knights will be assigned to further your training, provide you with wisdom, as well as serve as a guide you on your first few missions,\" he explained. \"Make sure to heed the lessons of your mentor well, as they will decide how fit you are for further advancement within the ranks. Your mentor will also help you decide your specific area of expertise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like whether I'll be a fighter, or a defender, things like that?\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something of that nature. If I may comment though, I don't envision you specializing in any particular field of magic,\" added Araphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took absolutely no offense at his observation. \"Neither do I actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, I had stripped the animal all the way down to the bone, deeply content and satisfied with my meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well into the afternoon by then, so that led me to my next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Araphor, where exactly will I be staying?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an apprentice Knight, you will reside with the other apprentice Knights. These are segregated by gender, to ensure no illicit activities, and within your lair you'll have a lairmate. The lair mate you are paired with is selected based upon your attributes as a Knights, along with your personality and such. They'll also accompany you on many of your earlier missions. If you'd like Darzhja, I could show you to the lairs at this moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Araphor directed me to the administrator of the apprentice lairs, a non-descript dwarven female. I thanked the green dragon, and watched him take back off. It took quite a while to get all the arrangements in order; one thing I was to learn about the Holy Knights was that there was as many tasks involving arranging paperwork as there was in physical training, mental conditioning and the sort. The lairs were arrayed all along the cliffside, lined up side by side next to each other in a rather spartan manner. I saw a few other dragonesses heading toward their respective lair, and I stopped to say hello to a few of them in passing. It was getting close to sunset, most of them were already on their way to their lairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lair I had been provided was large, spacious and clean, and for an orphan used to having to twist my body into cramped spaces, having this much space to myself was paradise. Branching out from the main chamber was a watering room, along with a place to relieve ones self. I was also curious to meet my lair mate, whoever she was. I gazed about, wondering where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer. Maybe I didn't have a lair mate after all. Then out of nowhere, there was a puff of smoke, and I instinctually jumped backwards, my hearts pounding. When the smoke cleared, I found myself staring at a small dragoness. Actually, a small dragoness would have towered over her; in fact she was a tiny little thing, no larger than the size of a typical hatchling. Her hide was a light greenish color, interposed with slightly glowing stripes of every color. The Faerie Dragoness fluttered around in quick little circles around me; my neck swiveling in vain attempt to keep up, her eyes glowing with mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YYYYIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\" she squealed with a tone so high-pitched, that I wrenched my jaws together, \"I finally have a lairmate!! By the Ancestors I've got a lairmate!! We're going to be the bestest of best friends!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By the Ancestors... save me...</i> I thought, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fluttered her overlapping, translucent, fragile-looking butterfly wings rapidly, literally bouncing off the walls, sending bright sparkling dust flying everywhere in excitement. When I inhaled a bit of it, it made me lightheaded and somewhat dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Linal'eiel!!\" she squeaked excitedly, stopping a foot in front of my face, \"But you can call me Lina!! What about you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja...\" I answered stoically. Had I said anything more, I thought that I would go insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Faerie dragoness, Lina, let out another girlish scream of pure, unrelenting joy, fluttering around so rapidly I thought she would have a seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another poof. The Faerie Dragon had suddenly appeared on right on top of my back, leaning her tiny head forward so that it was next to mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!! Tell me everything about yourself Darzhja!! What's your favorite flower? Dandelions are my favorite!! Do you have a favorite type of gemstone? Any males you like?\" she chittered, rattling of a series of the most random topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!! Get off me!!\" I growled. I reached with my claw to grab her, yet once again she disappeared with a puff of smoke, giggling that high-pitched giggle of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't catch me!!\" taunted Lina, flashing me a series of juvenile faces. She was taunting me. The little rascal was taunting me. If the Ancestors had established trials designed to test ones patience and restraint, sharing a lair with a Faerie Dragoness surely had to be one of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now Darzhja...calm down, it\u2019s going to turn out all right. The Ancestors haven't abandoned me yet...\" I whispered to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!! Sorry about that!! Its just that I can get a little carried away meeting new people!\" cried Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarried away? I had only known her for a few minutes now, and already I was on the verge of losing my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose it happens to all of us...\" I answered, trying to compose myself and attempting to restore a sense of sanity within the lair; \"I've never met a Faerie Dragon before until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then consider me your first!! Understandable really, since there aren't that many of us,\" she answered, appearing to have thankfully calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I ask this, but are most Faerie Dragoness like you?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!! We're the ones who make your wishes come true!!\" she answered. \"If you\u2019re wondering, the males are like that too. They don't get much respect from the others. Like my dear betrothed, Ein'theil, he got picked on a lot because everyone one thinks male Faerie Dragons are gay and effeminate, but I love him just the way he is!! Once we become mates, we're going to have four wonderful little ones!! And we're going to name them Tin'kerl, Bell'eithe, Orio'neitel and...well, we still haven't thought of the last one, but we're working on it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you've been arranged to be this... Ein's mate, I'm assuming that this was made long before now and probably because your kind is relatively rare. Still, are you okay with that?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were made for each other!!\" she squealed, eyes glowing dreamily. She began singing a song similar to one of those nursery rhymes given to hatchlings, about how compatible she was with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then...\" I replied, eager to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...any males you like Darzhja?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be somebody...\" she inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. I figured that I'd just answer her, or else she was going to be bugging me all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the orphanage, I did once like this older fledgling, but I quickly got over it. Blaze was like a little brother to me, and Kaj, the gatekeeper, like an older brother. As for here, I really don't know anybody. Araphor seems like the type that wants to help out everybody. Lorath seems friendly. As for Fangorn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes furrowed when I thought of him, \"He's a jerk. He called me a hatchling and he threw me into prison and took no small amount of joy seeing me chained up. I'd never felt so degraded and humiliated in my life. I hate him so much. He's arrogant, full of himself and - and, well at least he wished me good luck before the trial...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Lina, leaning her head closer, starting to get excited, \"And what else is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind started to wander, as I suddenly started to feel light-headed again. I was about to go on when I noticed she was fluttering her wings softly, pouring fairy dust over my nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second!! Why I am telling you all this!! I just met you!!\" I wailed, eyes snapping back into focus. The only reason that came to mind was that the mischievous little fairly had gradually put me on some mind-altering spell. Could Faerie Dragons make one spill out their deepest, darkest secrets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like him don't you?\" she whispered, appearing ready to burst out in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sniffed out a plume of smoke at her, which of course, she fluttered away from. Could I see myself liking Fangorn? Maybe if he didn't act so arrogantly. Yet there was a lot to choose from though. I shook my head to rid myself of such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina, I know you find it fun, but I don't appreciate it when you play these types of mind tricks on me,\" I cried. Magic was a complete enigma to me, and Lina was bursting with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026all right...\" she answered, her wings drooping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a breath. \"I suppose being a Faerie Dragon its something you can't help about yourself. Just... try not to do it so often all right?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!!\" she squeaked. \u201cYet if you need to escape the burdens of the world, just remember that I'm always here!! Because with a tiny bit of magic, all your dreams can come true!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my stomach cringe, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly let out a yawn. It was getting quite late. It had been a long, long day, and I had a feeling that I would be waking up bright and early the following morning. I laid myself on my stomach, only to find that a moment later a heard a 'poof', and discovered Lina reclining her body atop of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you sleeping on top of me?\u201d I asked, tilting my head in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina let out a high pitched yawn, curling her lithe body atop my back, and laying her tiny head against the base of my neck, \u201cBecause you\u2019re big and comfy Darzhja,\u201d she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted in annoyance. Then again, I didn\u2019t want her pulling any more mind tricks on me, so I figured it was a reasonable request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself then. Be warned that if I roll over while I\u2019m asleep, then I won\u2019t be able to guarantee that you\u2019ll emerge unharmed,\u201d I warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I found that she had already fallen fast asleep. I let out an exasperated, exhausted sigh. What a strange dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I prayed to the Ancestors, and fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was floating on a golden breeze.  The air holding me up smelled of lilacs and honey, a warm, hypnotizing scent.  Dazzling electric blue flower petals danced through the air all around, floating down from the green and blue mottled heavens above.  'Wait'  I thought dreamily, 'That's not the sky\u2026'  Ah, I was upside down.  I reached my claws forward to swoop over backwards, but the tips of my claws touched the flowery, psychedelic scene in front of me like the surface of a pond.  The world rippled and I found myself sinking in azure waters.  I was not troubled by the prospect of drowning in the slightest, however, I swam through the placid abyss with the ease of a fish.  Ahead of me I saw what I took to be a fish, but as I got closer, I realized that it was actually a tail, a bronze dragon tail.  I had to check to make sure that it was not my own, I was feeling not at all my usual self.  I swam closer, chasing the bronze dragon ahead of me with glee.  When he turned, suddenly, it was him chasing me.  I laughed, bubbled escaping upwards and swam as fast as I could, though he remained close behind, a gorgeous smile on his young, masculine face.  \"You can't catch me!\"  I called like a hatchling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn said nothing, though his face remained intent on me.  Then he uttered a single word, \"Darzhja\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja\u2026 Darzhja!\"  the azure sea disappeared and I was rushing through blackness.  I awoke with a start to the noise of trumpets filling the smallish lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie\u2026\"  sobbed Linda from the floor.  Apparently I'd knocked the smallish dragon off my back when I'd woken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Linda.\"  I said sincerely, though my head was still spinning from the incredibly vivid dream.  \"I was having such a weird dream\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faerie dragon bounced up into the air effortlessly, the moment she started flapping her wings, dust began to cascade off of them.  \"That's normal.\"  she said with a smile.  \"You'll soon develop a tolerance.  My dust is only mildly toxic to other dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's\u2026 er, great Linda.  Nice to know.\"  I said, turning my grimace into a semblance of a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda didn't notice my disembling however as she began flitting about the small dormitory.  \"Oh do you hear the trumpets, Darzhja?!  I do so love the morning anthem!\"  It was impossible not to notice the militaristic tune emanating from the stone walls on all sides, so I nodded.  \"The caves are magicked to carry the sound all the way from the trumpeters downstairs.\"  Linda explained.  She rushed forward as I was rising to hover near my head.  \"You were sleeping like a log and I was afraid that you were going to miss them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one calling my name?\"  I asked.  The image of Fangorn and that look on his face was impossible to forget despite how I tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda did a backflip in the air, her butterfly wings rippling,  \"Of course, Silly!  Do you see anyone else in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head.  \"So this is my first day as a new Knight\u2026\"  I couldn't bring myself to say 'Holy Knight'  I didn't feel particularly holy.  \"What happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small *pop* Linda disappeared and materialized back in front of me.  She scratched at a few of the many decorative green tendrils projecting from the back of her neck and down her spine with a foreclaw.  \"Well\u2026\" she said in her high voice, \"In the morning, it's usually exercise and training for us initiates.  Since this is your first day, they might have extra stuff for you to do as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have to feign excitement, my paws were almost dancing on the floor.  I stretched my wings in the small chamber which was still larger and more luxurious than what I was generally accustomed to and found that I did, in fact, have enough room to fully extend them if I stood in the middle.  Linda gave a small yip and popped up over me as I stretched, almost filling the little room.  \"What big, beautiful wings you have!\"  Linda exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to blush, \"Thanks, Linda.  Your's are beautiful too.\"  The faerie dragon spun and bounced on the air as I pulled my wings back, folding them to my back.  \"I'm so ready to get out there.\"  I said, already walking down the small corridor that led into the common rooms of the female barracks.  \"Will you show me where to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head to look for Linda behind me, but saw nothing but a tiny puff of smoke and her trademark *pop*.  I whipped my head back around and saw the little dragon gliding down the rough stone passage.  \"You'll have to move faster than that, Darzhja!  We're already late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned and ran after my lairmate.  Despite my initial misgivings, I thought that me and the little dragoness could be good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ran down the twisting passage after my flitting companion, the corridor widened and opened into many side passages leading off behind me.  Each side passage was inscribed with a number in Draconic above the entrance; I assumed that these led to other dorms.  It was difficult chasing after Lina in the confined space.  She glided openly down the descending passage while I had to run on all fours.  Arriving in the common chamber, I saw that we were at the tail end of a mass exodus out of the caverns.  \"Linda, where-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the faerie dragon was suddenly at my head, tugging me forward, her little claws gripping one of my horns.  \"Come on!  Don't stop here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the little dragon drag me ahead, though I coughed a little at the dust pouring into my face.  Past the washroom with the stream flowing down the middle of a carved cannal and past the main chamber where there were large, flat rocks and rugs suitable for reclining was the landing where brilliant sunlight was pouring in.  A silver dragoness who looked a little on the heavy side so that I wondered if she were carrying eggs jumped just as we exited the female dorms.  The breeze brushing against my scales was cold, crisp and invigorating; just the way I liked it.  Away and up the valley, I saw dragons of many, many colors and breeds soaring in the early morning air.  I grinned at Linda, still attatched to my horn and took three quick steps forward before flinging myself off the ledge without spreading my wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faerie dragon shrieked as we fell and I laughed, catching myself after twisting my body around.    \"Eiyah!  Why'd you do that for?\"  asked Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still laughing.  As I angled myself towards where the other young dragons were going, the little dragoness detached and flew alongside me; though I thought that she left indent on my horn where she had been gripping with her claws.  \"Why not?\"  I answered and then Linda started laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, I saw the dragons circling and landing in an orderly fashion on a barren field at the head of the volcano's crater, it was ringed with a simple rope fence and had two large pavilions at either side that I thought could fit several adult dragons within.  \"Is that where we're going?\"  I asked, inclining my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"  chirped Linda.  \"Those are the training grounds.\"  Then Linda shrugged, \"They're not that great.  I'll show you the gardens after.  The Knights keep all kinds of exotic plants, including many from my homeland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, but trees and shrubs did not hold my attention, what did was all of those dragons assembling ahead.  In my mind, I was already sizing up each one that I saw, both male and female.  I hoped there would be sparing.  I stole a glance at my much smaller companion, I supposed it natural that she not be so interested in fighting.  But seeing as we would be bunking together for the forseeable future, I decided to make an effort.  \"What kind of plants come from your homeland, Linda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faerie dragon smiled, clearly excited. She tipped a wing and fluttered a little way towards a large green ledge on the far side of the valley.  \"See, way over there, they grow an bush that's important for my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat bushes?\"  I asked dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"  she exclaimed, \"I don't eat them, but I do eat the beetles that live in them.  They are pretty powerful magic... and they keep my wings nice and sparkly.  See?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda popped and appeared right in front of me, displaying the vivid display on her back.  The crisscrossing, wavy lines were colorful enough to remind me of my psychedelic dream.  I was showered in dust, however.  I gulped a big breathe against my best efforts and sneezed horrendously, sending the smaller dragoness flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiieeee!!!\"  she squealed as she tumbled through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted and blew my nose, sending the slime down to the ground far below.  \"Sorry!\"  I shouted, but she was gone again suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pop* \"It's alright.  That one was my fault.\"  said Linda with a giggle.  And then suddenly she gasped.  \"Ein'theil!!\"  She dived in loops around my long neck, \"Do you see him?!  Do you see him, over there by the bushes!\"  She spared a quick look at me, but it was clear she was too excited to linger, \"I'll catch you later, Darzhja!  Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, L-\"  But she had already popped away.  I saw Linda appear about two body lengths away, but only momentarily before she teleported again.  Thus, with several *pops* she traversed the considerable distance in just a few seconds.  With the last, I saw her land on her betrothed's back in the distance before both went tumbling down into the greenery, laughing so loud it carried all the way back to me.  I couldn't help but smile, though I felt a little relieved as well.  I turned to face the other big dragons and got in line to spiral down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip down was a short one, me following the slightly bloated sliver dragoness who had been the last to leave the dormitories.  The youth had gathered below, landing just outside the dirt field, folding their wings and walking forward to form clean, neat rows.  There were three such rows, bisected in the middle by a narrow gap, males on the right, females left.  Ahead of the young dragons were three larger veteran Holy Knights.  Two were quite grizzled looking males with stern expressions as their eyes wandered over their fresh cadets like newly slaughtered meat; one was very muscular, clearly he had some Juggernaut blood in him, the other leaner, but with oversized, shovel shaped foreclaws - he was missing his left eye as well.  The third was female, but, as I would eventually learn, she was the one to be most feared of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would not find out this day, however.  As I was stepping forward to join the ranks at the end of the last row, I was shunted aside by a wall of bronze scale.  \"Fangorn!\"  I hissed.  I'd been seeing far too much of the arrogant drake lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, I need you to follow me.  And be quick about it.\"  He hissed right back at me without so much as a hello.  He turned his big, scaly self around and began to trot off towards the interior of the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked with longing to the other trainees who were beginning to perform calisthenics at the direction of the three sergeants.  I hesitated, thinking seriously about ignoring Fangorn and forming rank with the others.  It was a struggle not to heed the wild, impatient side of myself.  I had to force myself to recall that I was a Knight now - a real Holy Knight! - and that I was not free to do whatever I wished.  Fangorn was obviously still in charge of me to a degree.  Besides, I had the suspicion that he was going to take me to perform some of the tasks that needed to be done to finalize my introduction into the knights.  I jogged to catch up to the bronze male and spread my wings after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'd sidled up alongside Fangorn, I asked rudely, \"So what is this all about then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn frowned, \"That is not the proper tone to address a superior cadet.  Do you wish me to report you for insubordination?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Ugh\u2026 this power-trip is really going to his fat head.</i>  I thought with malice, but I also realized that he was completely right.  \"I'm sorry\u2026 Sir.\"  I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn grunted for a reply.  It was a minute before he answered my question.  \"I'm here to pair you with your mentor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\"  I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn glared at me and showed the canines the left side of his mouth in a clipped snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what, Sir?\"  I corrected, barely able to avoid snarling myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mentor will be your primary teacher for the duration of your training.  You are responsible, in addition to your normal recruit duties such as morning drill and helping maintain the dorms and the grounds, for assisting your mentor in any number of tasks she may ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a female mentor, Fangorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bronze didn't seem to mind the use of my name.  \"We typically segregate the sexes as much as we can.  Hormones and such\u2026\"  His eyes darted to me and lingered for perhaps a moment longer than they should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not so unhappy about missing the drill now as I winged my way back into the valley's interior.  I was anxious to start my training for real.  \"Who is my mentor going to be, if you don't mind me asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn just sighed.  \"You'll meet her soon enough.  We're almost to her cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't speak anymore for the next three minutes as Fangorn angled to a dark hole in the side of the volcano's interior walls.  One of many such holes, I noticed again the style of placing a symbol above the entrance.  However, in this case, there was not a number, but a personal rune, the dragon equivalent of a signature.  It had no verbal equivalent, but I supposed I would soon meet the dragoness who was associated with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA worn rug just on the inside of the landing padded our feet as we entered.  The place smelled worn in, the scent of the occupying dragoness ingrained into the very stone walls.  It was possible she had lived here for centuries.  Torches, though mostly unnecessary for a dragon's excellent night vision, cheered up the place and various shiny baubles and nicknacks placed on stone shelves around made the place seem warm and welcoming, quite cozy, really.  Having made no slight amount of noise entering, it was not a surprise to see the occupant of the lair soon appear from deeper inside.  Fangorn bowed at the knee and I copied his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Scabia.  At your service.\" said Fangorn, quite uncharacteristically humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at ease, young drake.\" said the older female, waving her claw.  She was quite large, though not as large as Lady Ramoth and younger than my former mistress and current sponsor as well.  Her scales were a very dark shade of green and the shape of her eyes led me to believe that her line had crossed with deathwing in the past.  She held her right wing a little crookedly, as if she couldn't close it all the way and she bore a burn pattern in the way her scales grew on her right shoulder.  I was immediately impressed, my own burn on my neck now being mostly healed through magical and non-magical means.  Whatever had inflicted such a mark on her had to have been foul indeed.  I had learned enough by not to remain kneeling despite the fact that she had released Fangorn.  \"Is this Ramoth's child?\"  she asked in a curious voice as she lowered her head to take in my scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er\u2026  Lady Ramoth is sponsoring her, if that's what you mean, Lady Scabia.\" said Fangorn  I felt my mentor's breath on the nape of my neck, but held still.  \"Her name is Darzhja, Lady.\"  he added a bit late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm\u2026  I misunderstood, then.\"  Scabia flexed a wing, \"You are no offspring of Ramoth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was horrified by the prospect of being rejected.  I supposed I could always be assigned another mentor, but a dragoness who obviously knew Lady Ramoth personally seemed somehow ideal.  but I dared say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it pleases you, I can reassign her to anot-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your sniveling, Fangorn, you're not fooling anyone.\" scolded Scabia dismissively with her good wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebuked, the bronze drake frowned, but I grinned with my head between my paws.  \"Rise\u2026 Darzhja.\"  I complied and looked into Scabia's intense yellow eyes.  \"You may not be of my old friend's blood, but if Ramoth had seen fit to sponsor you, then\u2026 that will do.  I shall have you as my apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lady Scabia.  It's an honor.\"  I said with perfect honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm.\"  acknowledged the older female.  She turned, however, back to the bronze drake.  \"Has she completed her other errands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still needs to visit the Vault to collect her things and set up her account as well as receive a physical at the physician.\"  said Fangorn.  I held my wings close about me as he again mentioned the physical examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia came to my rescue.  \"You shall accompany the young female to the vault and nothing else, young lad.  You shall let me attend to her personal matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Lady Scabia.\" said Fangorn inclining his head; he seemed ever so slightly deflated.  I wondered if he was looking forward to seeing me in such a degrading situation, as if seeing me chained and in a dungeon cell was not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark green dragoness turned her gaze on me once more.  \"Run along now, child.  Return to me tomorrow morning after drill, I already have need of a swift flying new recruit such as yourself.  Bring your lairmate, as well.  Her name was Li- Ly-something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linal'eiel, but she goes by Linda.\"  I provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right, the squeaky little one.  I've spoken to her mentor already.  She'll be your partner for what I have planned for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts beat faster with anticipation.  I wanted to hear what she had for me that instant.  Setting up account and having my body examined sounded like no fun in the slightest.  I had to console myself with the fact that she was only asking for less than a day now.  \"Thank you, Lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older female grinned for the first time since I'd met her and I saw that she had a good smile, the lines well worn into her face.  \"Well go on now!  I have things to do, you know.  No one can sit around these days.\"  she dismissed us with a wave of her wings and we were soon again airborne and soaring over the green fields of the valley below.  I was tempted to grin smugly at Fangorn, and I, in fact, indulged myself when I was behind him where he couldn't see.  Very shortly, we landed in a wide opening not far from the grand entrance to the Shrine where I'd experienced the trials.  The entranceway was also heavily decorated and hooded members of the Dragon Cult as well as armed and armored guards traversed up and down the smooth marble floor that spiraled in a long curve, descending ever downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of the entrances to the main keep.\"  Fangorn explained.  It was then that I truly began to comprehend what a magnificently large place the Temple was.  In addition to the valley above and all of the dragon living areas carved into the walls of the volcano, there was a sprawling city - there was no other word for it - underneath all of that.  Passage ways sprang off at even intervals, many of them guarded by either humanoid or dragon.  But we kept descending, ever in the slight, wide spiral, into the bowels of the mountain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, we arrived at the Vault. The guards down here were mostly Earth Renders, dragons at home deep underground, interposed by their dwarven auxilliaries. They were the meanest and most menacing Knights I'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business here...\" an Earth dragon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Tanaroth, I have brought Darzhja here to open an account. Lady Ramoth is sponsoring her, so Darzhja's information would be under her account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon performed a spell, and began scanning his gaze over something that I couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well now, I'll have one of my representatives go over the details with her...\" said the Earth Dragon. \"If you are her chaperone, which it appears you seem be, I must ask you to wait outside the vault, unless you have anything of concern over your own account Sir Fangorn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all my Lord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth dragon growled, before gesturing for a dwarf came forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja now is it? My name is Gaelin, come with mae...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the dwarf down a passage, leading to a large chamber. Upon the vast wall, were rows upon rows of intents that had glowing runemarks upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This part of tae vault deals with the personal accounts of the Dragon Knights. If yae see these runes; only tae dragon whose account it belongs to can open tae account, and woe to you if you aren't tae dragon the rune is set for...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo basically, what he meant that there were security measures of the sort that not even the most experienced criminal or mage would be able to steal from them, and that the consequences for attempting it would be steep indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you conduct a mission, the payment will be directed straight to your account. Your wages will automatically be placed within this account as well, as do any expenses you incur will also be taken automatically from your account. The Vault will be sending you a parchment every season detailing how much money you have in yer account. Some of yer wages e'll be deducted in the form of taxes to tae Temple treasury of course, a necessary evil to bae sure...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued on, I was given more details about the nature of my account, such as regulations, laws that needed to be followed, when I could or could not withdraw gems, what would happen, if by the Ancestors forbid, that I went into debt, and other important details. Finally, I was led to an corner of the Vault, where there were mostly empty spaces. I made sure to memorize the route I had taken, as well as the number in Draconic above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, may you place your claw upon the rune for mae?\" he asked. I did so, and I watched with fascination as my claw sank into the rock, feeling like clay.  The wall glowed for a moment, identifying me as the owner of the account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer sponsor had been keepin all your belongings in a temporary account, yet now dat ye have one of yer own, these are automatically transferred tae yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, open it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the tip of my claw upon the rune, and watched it glow for a moment, before the wall dissapeared to reveal a room about the size of my current dorm. All of my valuables were already stored there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked inside. The hoard I had accumulated thus far was quite small at the moment, comprising about fifty pounds worth of gemstones at the moment (though for a humanoid, they'd be fairly well off, but then again the costs of living for dragonkind were far larger in proportion); comprising of the prizes I had accumulated from doing various odd jobs within the market district. Even so, it didn't stop me from sorting through the gemstones I had, making sure they were all present, and checking again until I was absolutely content. Unlike humanoids, dragons were only content with their wealth if they could actually see the hard evidence of that wealth in piled up gemstones. I had absolutely no idea how the humanoids could possibly trust those easily meltable coins they used, much less those flimsy, easily burnable paper slips with number values printed on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy list of possessions wan't particularly large either. There was a small collection of trophies that the impressed city-folk of the merchant district had given me for placing first in the amateur sparring tournaments that I'd taken part in, where I'd gained a small amount of fame as a 'fledgling prodigy' of sorts. I also had a few baubles that I received as gifts for completing a particularly hard project with the city folk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, carrying them all to my dorm would be a rather cumbersome trip. As if anticipating my question, the dwarf stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like, we could have a crew transport your belongings up to yer dorm, with yer permission of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I know you won't try and steal from my account?\" I asked. I didn't think they would, but it was more for knowing how the whole process worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With tae security measures installed into the runes, plus the hazards of stealin from a dragon... trust meh, you don' need to worry a bit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, I'll let you have a team take my belongings to my dorm...\" I answered. Besides, I had a lot more to do still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI returned to the reception area of the vault, where Fangorn was waiting nervously and anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get your accounts settled?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is affirmative...sir,\" I answered, searching for an alterior motive. You never knew with Fangorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, with that matter settled...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I grunted an affirmative when Fangorn said he was going to take me back to Lady Scabia.  Inside, I was glad to soon be rid of the annoyingly arrogant bronze drake and the way he eyed me when he thought I wasn't looking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back up through the bowels of the Temple was far more of a hassle than coming down.  It seemed as though we had climbed down the entire height of the mountain itself and the entire journey had to be made on foot; space was obviously at too much of a premium to allow any but the smallest dragons room for flight.  While I considered myself quite fit, I was a beast made for the open air, not for crawling on the ground like a mule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curved hallway we had come down, one of four main entrances at the staggered points of the compass - north-east, north-west,  south-west, and south-east - seemed to drag on forever, always curving away up and to the left.  Numbers at each landing - not in Draconic, but in the Common tongue -  informed the weary traveler of what level they were on as well as direction, north or south, east or west.  As we passed a very small entrance which led to what appeared to be some sort of humanoid mess hall through which a party of elves in leaf-green leather armor were proceeding, Fangorn snidely noticed my lagging behind.  \"You will get used to walking up and down through the Temple, Darzhja.  Morning drill will help you build the needed muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low grumble that was not quite a growl managed to escape my throat.  My only reconciliation was noting the ginger way in which Fangorn still held his bandaged tail; I hoped my bite still pained him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether for the sake of my education or to further degrade me, Fangorn continued, \"Over there, on the inside wall, you will notice the little glass doors on each floor.  They're there so you don't need to walk all the way around the place next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to ask why then I had to descend all the way to the bottom level of the Temple in the first place, but realized that given the secure nature of the vault, they probably needed to see me in person\u2026 also, they probably knew that I would want to see my gems for myself.  So instead, I walked up to the square glass panel opposite the landing on the north side of the spiral.  I looked into it, but saw only my reflection\u2026 followed by Fangorn's as he slid in beside me.  I took a side step to increase the distance between us and said, \"So how does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn gestured with his broad nose, \"All you need to do is say the name of the person you are looking to contact or the name of a department and then say your name.  If you are cleared for access, then an imp will appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?  Imp?\"  I asked, very confused.  The Temple was turning out to be far more magical than I was used to down in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn sighed, though a look in his eye told me that this was the response that he'd been looking for.  \"A messenger imp, a minor demon.  It will receive your message and deliver it to your intended destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon\u2026\"  I said slowly.  Demons were among the last things that I had been expecting in the Temple of the Holy Knights of Nod.  I wasn't sure I wanted anything to do with the mirror's polished surface anymore.  Demons and other evil spirits were featured in children's folk stories the world over, no matter the species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn smirked at my trepidation.  \"Don't worry, it's perfectly safe.  The binding spells are airtight and the imp is compelled to immediately return to the mirror once it's delivered your message.  It's really reduced the paperwork that used to flow through here in the last fifty years.  Here, let me show you.\"  Then Fangorn looked deeply into the mirror and intoned, \"Lieutenant Hazzorah from Fangorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but flinch as the glass went dark and a tiny, red skinned creature appeared, no larger than a human child.  Its eyes were like green embers, it's body hazy and indistinct, as though made of gas, though clearly humanoid.  It waited expectantly.  I found it a little unnerving as Fangorn spoke, as if dictating to this Lieutenant in person. \"I have completed escorting Darzhja to the Vault, Sir.  Her mentor will see to any additional responsibilities.  Over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched avidly as the smokey apparition vanished, leaving the mirror clean and reflecting once again.  I turned my head away, but stopped when I saw Fangorn waiting, still looking at the mirror.  \"If your target person is near one of these mirrors, they can give a response, otherwise the demon will just whisper your message in their ear.\"  explained Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few moments passed before the smokey imp reappeared.  In a wheezy, whistling voice, the imp said, \"Lieutenant Hazzorah for Fangorn.\" The mirror then issued a gruff, masculine dragon's voice. \"Acknowledged.  Fangorn, return to my Lair immediately, I have an assignment for you.  And don't tell me you are on medical leave.  It's been terminated prematurely.\"  The bronze dragon's jaw dropped and I could not stifle a chuckle.  \"You don't need your tail for what I have for you.  Over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoulders slumping, the bronze drake said into the mirror, solemnly, \"Acknowledged.  Over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's not guard duty, Sir.\"  I said with an unconcealed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn hissed at me and turned to go, clearly displeased for what had transpired.  He walked briskly up the curved corridor, clearly no longer caring if he left me behind or not.  I pushed myself, though and managed to keep up as we walked all the way back to the surface.  The drake began to spread his wings on the landing without a word and though I was panting, I managed to sprint ahead and put a wing on his back to make him pause.  \"Where\u2026 are you going?\"  I panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the message.  I have a new assignment.  You can find your way back to Lady Scabia now.\" said Fangorn and then he shrugged off my wing and jumped into the air.  I was left in a state of both boiling rage at his rude departure and perverse relief that he was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught my breath on the landing, leaning against a cold, damp stone wall and watched other dragon Knights come and go.  It felt strange to be on my own for the first time since I'd been released from my cell...  How could it be that so much has happened in less than three days since an explosion rocked New Alveri to its foundation and changed the world as I'd known it forever?  The feeling of being overwhelmed was almost enough to make me sag to the ground, the weight of the past few days seemed like a mountain on my back.  And yet... and yet, I was a Knight, at long last.  I was what I had been working my entire life since I could remember to become.  Still my future spread out ahead of me, shrouded in mists so that I did not know what would happen in the next hour, let alone where I would be in the next few years.  I sat, my back to the wall and looked out over the edge of the landing, though at surface level, the broad stone landing was still a good twenty feet off the ground.  The green feilds spread out ahead, the single river flowing down the middle of the valley from the basin damed up in the north face of the circular cauldron.  I breathed, taking in its beauty.  I prayed to the Ancestors for the strength to deal with all the things that were happening.  Though I was no longer in the Shrine, I thought I could feel their caring eyes on me, filling me with a warm sensation that, somewhere out there, someone cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a *pop* and then a sudden weight on my back.  \"Surprise!!\"  shouted Linda, her thin legs around my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a yelp and shot forward as if someone had stuck an iron prod into me.  I still wasn't used to the way the faerie could simply appear like that.  \"Yieee!\"  squealed Linda and suddenly she was gone from my back, fluttering her wings in the air a short distance over the edge of the landing.  I skidded to a hault, my fore-claws digging into the stone at the very edge.  I breathed a sigh, my hearts thundering in my ears.  \"Oh, I thought you were going to dive over the edge again.\"  Linda said and laughed as she spiraled closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda...\"  I breathed, \"You can't scare me like that, I'm not used to it.\"  And it was true; in my book, surprises were usually immediately followed by a blow to the head or a weak point like a wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just having a little fun.\"  Linda brushed off.  \"But hey, I have some important news, that's why I came to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head to the side and looked at her with an eye.  \"Really?\"  I asked.  It seemed my private time was to be cut short just as Fangorn's had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  But it's good news!!\"  Linda chirped and fluttered over backwards before popping to the other side of my head.  She told me...</span></div></div>",

I clearly remember her telling me to return the following day after drill.  A shiver crawled up my spine, I hoped that it wasn't the physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green faerie dragon flitted by, sparking dust trailing from her wings; they were too small in proportion to her body to allow her to soar as I was doing, but she didn't seem to mind.  I was reminded that she was coming along with me, so it couldn't be the physical, not unless they wanted to see us both at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the hole in the valley wall that was Scabia's lair, I landed lightly, flapping my wings as I came in hindlegs first and bracing my wingtips against the side of the cliff.  As I busied myself about folding my massive wings, Linda was already walking in, apparently she simply popped herself to the floor.  I smiled at her convenience; landing was probably the hardest part of routine flying.  I walked in after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no sooner crossed the threshold of the cave than Lady Scabia' started speaking.  She'd been waiting for us in her cozy greeting chamber.  \"I apologize for calling you back here so soon, but a situation has arisen that must be dealt with immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down, my eyes wide and sparkling in the torchlight.  I could barely sit still for the anticipation.  \"What has happened, Lady Scabia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wing, the older female ushered in a humanoid.  Studying his features, I had to guess he was half-elf, half-human and about middle aged, though the lines on his face made his expression hard.  \"Elandor here has uncovered a potential lead that I would like you to investigate along with your lairmate as your first mission.\"  She turned her head, angling her face down to the half-elf.  \"Would you be so kind as to reveal your face to Darzhja, Elandor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, the humanoid acquiesced by withdrawing a small crystal vial from his coat pocket and drawing forth a small nondescript bronze pendant that he wore around his neck.  If he was a spy, I naturally assumed that he would be using some sort of spell to disguise his appearance, but as I soon discovered, this spy was utilizing no mere glamor.  Elandor unfolded a small prick at the rear of the pendant and I watched in surprise as he drove it into the skin of his chest.  Grimacing in obvious pain, he then undid the stopper from the small vial and poured several drops of the contents onto the smooth surface of the undecorated pendant.  I smelled dragon blood.  The ruby blood scattered across the surface of the pendant in obviously arcane lines and tiny, finely scrawled runes before leaking down into tiny holes at the sides.  When the blood had past, the half-elf's features softened sickeningly, like clay.  His ears elongated, his eyes angling and his chin and nose becoming finer.  The whole time, he had that pained look on his face.  I did not envy the elvish spy in the least for his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Elandor has gone to great lengths to disguise himself.  This method defeats any casual observation and leaves no magical aura behind.  With a false identity provided by the Temple, he can become completely inconspicuous and untraceable.  I only asked him to revert so that you may know his true face before we begin the investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I may ask, who are we investigating, Lady Scabia?\"  I asked, the tip of my tail dancing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to that in a moment, dear.  But first, what do you know about the attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, wings inflating a little and settling back, \"Next to nothing, Lady Scabia.  I was there right afterwards, but\u2026\"  My words faltered, my mind filled with fire and black smoke and Iskeirka's screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScabia lowered her head and looked away, understanding.  \"Of course\u2026 and I'm afraid to say that, despite all of our best efforts, we know little more than the average citizen.  No group or organization has come forward to claim responsibility and that worries the Nine deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Linda fluttered up to eye level, a worried look on her thin face.  \"Some are saying that this is an enemy from within, Lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark emerald dragoness growled openly and turned on the faerie dragon, \"Be wary where you say such things, little one.  Very wary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sank back to the floor, deflating and Scabia continued.  \"Our scryers at the scene have come up with no leads and none of the sooth sayers have found a soul in the afterworlds knowledgeable about the attack or willing to speak of it.  Not a single scrap of the device which caused the explosion has been recovered for study by the alchemists guild, so the magician's guild have been the most successful so far in their efforts.\"  I remembered that pitiless elf badgering Lady Ramoth, his soulless black eyes and the way he packed Iskeirka's wing into a crate and shipped it to be dissected and sold for parts.  My claws dug into the stone at the memory.  \"Their spellweavers have detected the auras left behind at the scene and concluded that the bomb was elemental based.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ignorance of magic was beginning to seem like a severe handicap.  \"What does that mean, Lady Scabia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female dragon drew in a deep sigh.  Elandor at her side had finished his changing and I saw now a fair-haired, full-blooded elf.  \"It means,\" said the elf, \"that this was likely an attempt on the part of our enemy to develop a weapon of mass destruction.  Their silence on the part of their crime lends strength to the idea that there may be another such attack already in motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Linda and I gasped.  I refused to believe that another day like that one would happen again.  I'd sooner die than live through that again.  I had to push down the tears deep inside.  Lady Scabia needed me to be strong.  Iskeirka and Ophelia and poor lost Blaze needed me to be strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia spoke heatedly, \"And that is why we are doing everything in our power to track down the culprits and deliver unto them a dragon's vengeance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, Lady Scabia!  What will you have us do?\"  I nearly roared.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your job is to be much more subtle.  In fact, you shall be Linda's partner in this.  She has much more experience and natural ability in the skills you will be needing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart fell like a stone.  I hadn't realized it, but I had been expecting to take the lead, despite the fact that I had been here for scarcely a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was turning a backflip and squealing girlishly as Scabia continued, \"We are experiencing a crime wave down in the city.  The criminals think they sense weakness and are taking advantage of the chaos left over after the attack.  The militia are barely able to keep the trade district from devolving into looting and rioting while the excavation teams are still digging through the rubble in search of survivors.  In particular, we have received evidence of slavers moving through the city and the refugee camps.  We would normally have our claws too full to deal with them, but Elandor here has discovered that they are attempting to move several clutches of dragon eggs and perhaps even a few young dragons out of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped and my hearts pounded in outrage.  I wanted to claw and tear and rend until there was nothing left.  I was left embarrassed when Linda asked the most intelligent and level headed question, \"For what purpose, Lady Scabia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is still unknown at this time, but we have to recover the eggs and any captive hatchlings before they get out of the city and beyond our reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor spoke, \"Given our tightly stretched resources at the moment, I wouldn't have advised direct action at this time.  However, I found that the smugglers have somehow collected a staggering number of eggs, and as you know, dragon eggs are far too precious to let go, so this is worth breaking my cover for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt that a single egg would have been worth ruining an investigation, but I didn't voice my heated opinion.  Instead, with my hearts still filled with the hurt of the smoke and the inferno, I said, \"But Lady Scabia, what does this have to do with the attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps nothing.\" said the aged dragoness,  \"Or perhaps everything.  We are stretched to our limits, Darzhja.  In times past, you would not have left this valley for anything other than training for at least ten years.  As things are, we need even recruits like you to do work in the things that we simply do not have the dragons or the men for.\"  I set my wings stoically and inclined my head in understanding.  Lady Scabia gestured at me with her good wingtip, \"You will be providing Elandor with transportation for this, Darzhja.  He will guide you and take your lead from Linda as well.  You shall be their muscle should things go rough, but you must try to be subtle with this matter.\"  The elf walked forward and smiled up at me. I inclined my head and smiled back, he did have a nicer face now to my eyes; he put a hand on my foreleg and rubbed up and down in a friendly manner.  \"But remember, the first priority is to get those eggs back.  Do what must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Linda and I nodded and Lady Scabia retreated back into the depths of her lair, leaving the three of us behind.  I looked down at Elandor.  \"Ready to leave?\"  he asked in passable Draconic.  I grinned toothily down at him in answer and lowered my chest to the ground so that he could ride on me at the base of my neck.  His weight was like a feather, though he gripped me tightly with his knees.  The elf obviously had no use for a saddle as I'd seen other riders use at times.  In response to my question of destination, he answered that we were to be heading for...</span></div></div>",

Most of the guilds of consequences usually use these areas as storage space for merchandice before preparing them to be shipped out to the Kingdom's other cities,\" explained Elandor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you believe that some of these slavers are using the storage warehouses to conduct their smuggling operations?\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe this to be the case Darzhja. Let me fill you in on more of the details. Most of these slavers pose as subsidiary shipping companies for the larger guilds. By paying these companies to do their shipping, they not only cut costs, but they also don't have to necessarily take responsibility for their activities. That also means that the guilds may not always know what activities these shipping companies may conduct on the side. While we may or may not find the eggs here, what we need to find out is which guilds have contracted the 'shipping companies' recently, and from there we can connect their illegal activities to their sponsors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'shipping company' that I suspect may be involved in smuggling activities is called the Mevlevi Keepers. I figured it sounded somewhat cultish, so I took the liberty to investigate the location in secret, and discovered evidence of unethical business practices. I will speak with the proprietor of the warehouse and ask him to give me a full inventory of the goods at hand, along with all their recent business transactions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't they be hiding all their illegal goods, if they think you're a regulator? Won't they deliberately be telling you that they have nothing to hide?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats where I come in!!\" chirped Lina. \"Sometimes they'll use a charm to make a door look like a bare stretch of wall. I can detect these charms easily, along with the magical essence that any dragon egg would give up, and if I detect anything like that it means they would have something to hide. I can disarm these charms and return them to their natural state. I'll be hidden though with a cloaking enchantment. Because Fairy Dragons are rare, most storage facilities don't have the necessary runes that would detect our particular signature. However, even I have a limit to my magic!! If I get detected without having found the eggs, then by law we would be convicted of illegal search methods,\" said Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's a time limit, what if we find the eggs though?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, they'll be placed under arrest, or they might decide that the only way to shut us up would be to get rid of us,\" answered Elandor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my claws, \"And that's where I come in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Yet for this mission we cannot give you armor as it would reveal you as a Knight, rather than a bodyguard for a regulator. If things go wrong, I've also contacted a small number of humanoid knights on standby to help us fight them and cut off any escape routes. Hopefully, it won't need to come to that. However, with the increase in looting and the such, many of the comapnies have increased their company security forces in order to better protect their assets from 'theives and bandits', so we have no jurisdiction over them...\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled. So they would hire mercenaries to protect the slavers and bandits these companies claim to be protecting their merchandise from? How deceitful. Frankly, if they were even suspected in dealing in the smuggling of dragon eggs, their entire facility deserved to be burned to the ground. I had to be patient though, discipline was the name of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storage warehouses were located in the Industrial district of New Alveri on the eastern side of the city. I had been there a few times to pick up some goods for the various merchants in the Merchant guilds, and had escaped the brunt of the attacks. Many of the larger storage companies had facilities large enough that a full family of dragons could have lived comfortably in. In fact, an entire section of cliffside was devoted to this form of storage; the slavers must have believed that with the Knights currently stretched thin, they wouldn't be able to check them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor directed me to land upon the ledge leading to the inside of the 'Mevlevi Keepers'. The entrance to the lair was wide enough to accomodate a dragon, while a large metal gate covered it. It looked tough and secure, in that I'd have a hard time breaking through it. I also took note of the location of the armed guards, and the weapons they carried, in case that I would have to fight them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gatekeeper of the storage facility was a female goblin that spoke with a scratchy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business...\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor dismounted me gently. \"I am Ealstan... an inspector of the alchemist guild,\" he said, showing a fake ID, \"I understand that we have a contract with your company concerning the storage of lay-line maintenance parts, and in these troubled times I merely wish to ensure personally that all the agreed upon goods are accounted for. The dragons here are for my protection and aid in my inspection. Thus, I wish to speak with the proprietor of this facility...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that he did not mention me as a Knight. I wasn't wearing any battle armor, which immediately would have given me away, and with Lina hidden, I could pass as simply a hired mercenary. The goblin checked the identification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll contact Mr. Skarnu now...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, an elf came forward. He was dressed extremely professionally, as if he wanted to emphasize that his business was truly professional. Frankly, I thought he was overdoing it, which was suspicious in my eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how may I help you?\" he said. He spoke far too smoothly for my comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to take a quick inventory over the merchandise for this guild. My benefactors are expecting that everything be in order,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already sent the guild a full report on all the inventory I have in stock. I assure you everything is secure and accounted for,\" said Mr. Skarnu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you good sir,\" answered Elandor, walking alongside the elf, \"Yet in these chaotic times one must be especially careful wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. Anyhow would it be all right if you left the beast by the gate?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but growl. Elandor placed an arm on my leg. \"I'm afraid I cannot. Again, these are desperate times, and one must proceed with extra caution. I assure you that it is fully under my control and will not bring you harm. Now, come along then dragon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dared not speak a word as I followed Elandor inside. I had to play the role of dumb beast, which made me boil inside, yet I had to discipline myself and play along for the sake of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I followed Elandor around the facility, it didn't look like anything suspicious. What I saw were parts of lay-line cables just like Mr. Skarnu claimed. Yet even so, I still couldn't help that there were quite a number of security guards for a mere 'shipping company', and Mr. Skarnu, he seemed to slick, too well-polished and silver tongued. There was just something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ealstan?\" said Mr. Skarnu, \"That's what you said your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me if I say this, but you don't seem to be any regulator to me. You search too thoroughly, and no regulator brings a dragon with him...\" he said. My hearts skipped a beat. If he was a slaver, apparently he was sharper than I imagined. Yet Elandor took it in stride.  The elvish spy master...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, so you've caught me.\" said Elandor, the tall elf - well, taller than Mr. Skarnu who walked beside him anyways - while I lifted an eyebrow in mild panic.  The warehouse owner was extremely canny if he was able to pick apart Elandor's cover story so easily.  I prepared myself for immediate battle, though I gave no outward sign as I plodded slowly behind the two humanoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you really can't expect a business owner such as myself to get along without having some skill in this area.\" said Mr. Skarnu, showing extreme arrogance in his discovery.  He suddenly stopped in his stride.  \"Care to tell me who you really are, Ealstan, or shall I show you and your\u2026 pet off of my private property?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was struggling not to tear the small elf in the fancy pant suit to pieces while Elandor said, \"Well, I wasn't lying when I claimed to be here to inspect your goods.\"   Mr. Skarnu lifted a highlighted eyebrow.  \"I just lied about who I represent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is your employer then?\"  The warehouse owner peered deeply into the elf's face across from his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually represent a group of\u2026 ah, potential buyers.\" said Elandor without so much as twitching a single facial muscle.  \"You are aware of the havoc being raised in the underground markets, yes?  With Kulver and Sons being forcefully put out of business, my employers have suddenly found themselves bereft of essential supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Mr. Skarnu actually looked interested rather than casually aloof.  \"Yes, I heard about Kulver.  When is he due for the chopping block, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometime next month.\" said Elandor, and he should know, having captured the infamous opiate and rare animal smuggler himself.  \"But he is hardly irreplaceable.  In fact, I hear that there are loads of new suppliers springing up around the city, ready for financial opportunities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People say a lot of things\u2026 these are hard times.\" said Mr. Skarnu, though he began to walk through the aisle of towering boxes once more.  While it irked me not to be part of the conversation, I had the feeling that I would blow our cover almost immediately.  As the two elves talked, feeling each other out and trying to trap one another in a deadly game of words, I spared a glance to the warehouse proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I might catch a glimpse of Lina as she moved about the stacked boxes and stone walls of the vast chamber, but I saw nothing.  I supposed that was a good thing after all.  I was still deeply impressed at Lina's innate magical skills.  I had been expecting a concealing glamor to allow her to pass unnoticed by those who observed her, but no, Lina had shimmered in the air above the landing and completely disappeared.  True invisibility.  I hadn't been able to detect her since, through either the flapping of her wings or even her distinct, vaguely fruity scent.  I wondered how long she could keep up such a potent spell and if she had found any secret rooms yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026His own sister?  Truly?  I never would have guessed.\"  laughed Mr. Skarnu in an aristocratic sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hephaestis turned out to be quite the scoundrel.\" chuckled Elandor.  Both elves stopped upon reaching a dead end, stone wall on one side, the wooden sides of boxes on the other two.  \"It seems we can go no further\u2026\" said Elandor with a vague, cautious suspicion.  He casually put a palm on his sword hilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mr. Skarnu smiled disarmingly, \"Well, perhaps your beast can go no further.  I still don't understand why you brought that smelly thing along with you.  Magic carpets are not as expensive as they once were and they require far less maitainence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't lying when I said it was for protection.  But this one has been trained for a special trick as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" asked the warehouse owner with skepticism.  I wanted to grind him into wet paste with my paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can identify true dragon components from knock-offs.  See?\"  Elandor reached into his vest pocket and withdrew his vial of dragon blood.  He lifted it in the air.  \"True blood or false?\"  To Mr. Skarnu he added, \"It grunts once if it's fake, twice if it's real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably the most degrading thing I'd done in my life, and I'd spent entire days emptying selling lots of week's worth of manure in the city and cleaning the orphanage cesspools; dragons were not known for their perfect bathroom hygiene.  I made a show of lowering my head to Elandor's upraised fist and sniffing.  I grunted twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Skarnu, however, cocked his head.  \"And how am I supposed to know that is real dragon blood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor carefully let a single drop of the dense, precious ruby fluid pour out onto his fingertip.  \"Taste it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an Elf, who were not generally concerned with close proximity between males of the species, Mr. Skarnu carefully took Elandor's finger and licked the single drop off of it.  The warehouse keeper shivered,  \"Ah, that is very fresh, and very pure.\"  He paused momentarily and looked at Elandor suspiciously, \"What reason do you have to keep such valuable material at hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor looked at Mr. Skarnu with a grin on his face.  \"Virility.\" he said with a wink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Skarnu grinned conspiratorially.  \"You are my kind of buyer, Ealstan.\"  At last he looked strongly at the elf before him, trying to judge something I could not see.  Then he gave a strange whistle, clearly a specific tune.  Suddenly a door opened in  one of the boxes ahead, not magic, but extremely well made so that it blended in with the irregular wooden surface.  \"This way, Ealstan.  I'll get you acquainted with the merchandise we have in stock.\"  Mr Skarnu spared a glance up at me, the first time he'd looked at me since we'd arrived.  \"The beast will have to wait out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElandor looked for a long moment up at me.  Then he said, \"There's no need.  It will clearly not be able to fulfill its purpose in here.  Return to the entrance and await my return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not have that thing galavanting about my warehouse unattended!\" said Mr. Skarnu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest at ease, friend.\"  said Elandor, \"It is well trained.  And I will pay for any damages that it causes, but I assure you there will be none.\"  he said the last strongly looking up at me.  As if I would exact petty revenge by flattening a few boxes here and there...  well certainly not while we were working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two elves started chatting again as they entered the box.  From what I could see inside before the door closed, Elandor had not entered a secret room so much as a secret complex, built into the piles of boxes which filled the vast chamber.  Where it would lead, I couldn't fathom.  I wished him good luck and for his safe return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that I was feeling quite useless as I plodded my way back to the main landing.  I could see the iron gates built into the cave entrance over the boxes and the sunlight filtering through.  It was hard to believe that it still wasn't even noon.  Before I'd even gotten halfway, back, however, I head a tiny voice in my ear.  It was Lina!  I forced my expression to fade after my momentary excitement.  \"Where is Elandor?\"  I was about to answer, but she spoke again, \"Wait! Don't answer, you're still being watched.\"  I had the vague feeling that Lina was flitting about my head, but I knew only because I could feel the air moving about me slightly.  Lina's spell still made her virtually undetectable.  \"Just listen, I...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Turn left ahead.\" said Lina and I complied with my unseen companion's instruction.  It felt odd, especially since the faerie dragon was alternately on one side of my body or the other, barely disturbing the air as she passed, like nothing more than an ethereal spirit.  Frankly, at that moment, I found myself quite jealous of my lairmate's natural abilities.  As for myself, I could not even speak aloud for the eyes of humanoids sitting atop high stacks of crates were on me at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina knew of my instruction to head for the landing - I supposed Elandor had known that Lina would contact me at some point between here and there - and guided me in an off center course towards it.  \"It's just off from the center of the room.  Thank goodness for the smell, or I would never have found it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI burned to ask Lina what she had found.  Fortunately for me, she elaborated as I continued to pad slowly and calmly down the wide aisle of stacked shipping crates.  Their tracking runes and serial numbers glowed faintly in the gloom.  \"I've had a hard time in here.\" whispered Lina, \"It was a while before I figured out that the smuggling areas aren't hidden by magic.  That I could have detected.  They have just crafted the entrances into the sides of these boxes to look like the regular sides of the box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in the irregular shapes of the crates.  I don't know why I didn't notice it earlier.  Some of the wooden structures had obviously been here for many years, dust and cobwebs were evidence of that, while a normal warehouse, while never empty, would usually be completely turned out at least once every couple years at the very longest.  Some of the boxes also, though it was a little hard to see with the crowding, were exceptionally large.  One I saw within the inter of a log rectangle of stacked boxes, the corners formed by aisles, was even large enough to admit a creature of my size.  I knew of no creature that could shift or carry such a burden, for while dragons were extremely strong, we had notoriously small airborne weight capacities.  These warehouse operators were obviously hiding something, practically in plain sight.  I saw an orc above notice my lingering gaze on the boxes, he scowled, showing his yellow fangs and leapt down from his perch, disappearing behind the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina apparently saw him too, for she said, \"Hurry, Darzhja, I don't think we have much time left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last turn led away from the main entrance and down a narrow aisle that I had to squeeze into in order to pass.  I hugged my wings to myself and stepped forward hurriedly, one paw in front of the other; the space was wide enough for perhaps a horse and rider, or a faerie dragon for that matter, but it was very cramped for a Regal Bronze such as myself.  \"Ahead on the left, Darzhja.\"  said Lina, just a notch louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sucked air through my nose.  I no longer needed Lina's direction.  I knew the smell of my own kind.  Ahead, the boxes got higher and higher, but I didn't slow.  I steped on a small crate, it burst under my weight like a grape.  Some copper tubes, as if for an alchemical set, tumbled out, rattling on the stone floor as clear as bells.  Someone shouted in the distance.  \"Darzhja!\"  said Lina, but I already understood.  I raced forward as fast as I could, my nose leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped, my snout pressed against a section of wood box that was identical to all the rest around it as well as the boxes before.  But I could smell the dragon scent, pungent, and sulfurous, familiar.  And not just any dragon, young dragon.  Some instinct told me that this was not at all the place where these scents should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina suddenly reappeared on the ground in front of me.  She let out a sigh of relief as she allowed herself to lapse the concentration needed for her invisibility.  \"Darzhja, there's something behind here, but I couldn't open it.  It's not magic so I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smashed the side of the crate in with my front paw.  Wood splintered and cracked and I saw metal hinges and some sort of locking mechanism bend away amongst the debris.  Dragon scent poured out.  Lina was shocked, but definitely not as shocked as the smallish humanoid - halfling perhaps - who was sitting on a stool just inside the crate.  He had his mouth hanging open at the sight of Lina and the side of my face, which was just about as large as the entrance I had opened, a glass mug of a foul smelling brew fell from his grubby hand and shattered on the hay strewn floor.  In the corner of the small hidden room was a brazier, a coal fire under it smoldering while on top, an iron brace cradled a single, precious egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lina and I growled.  The halfling let out a choked yelp and made for a side exit into the box complex.  \"Lina!\" I said, but she was already darting forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tackled the little humanoid and despite Lina's diminutive stature for a dragon, she was still a giant compared to the spec of a halfling.  Pinning him to the floor in a way that I could not have done without killing him, Lina quickly extended her wings and flapped them vigorously, showering the hobbit with glittering dust.  The tiny man gasped and stopped struggling, a dreamy look and a dopy grin overtaking his features.  Lina got off of him, though her prey remained prone.  \"Hopefully I haven't given him a lethal dose\u2026\"  she gave a sidelong look to the halfling who was now studying the lines on the backs of his hairy hands with extreme fascination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't care in the slightest if the man lived or died, not when he was in the same room as a precious egg, no matter if it was properly warmed or not.  I stuck my nose into the room and sniffed heartily.  \"There are more eggs, I can smell others.\" I said with urgency, wishing I could fit into the tiny space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina looked down the passage further into the compound.  \"Maybe I can find them...\"  At that time however, a deep brass gong began to sound in the distance; an alarm.  she looked up at me with panicked stricken eyes, \"We're out of time Darzhja!\"  The faerie dragon rounded on the single precious egg, her tail spinning and sending the table and chair flying against the wall where they broke into yet more splinters, and carefully took it in her forearms.  Effortlessly, she fluttered up and out of the room.  \"We have the proof we need now.  Let's rescue Elandor and alert the other knights so they can raid this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled, aware that every second the guards were marshaling their forces and also knew exactly where we were.  But the other eggs...  \"Lina, I smelled other eggs, maybe hatchlings too.  We have to find them, they might be moved out of here before the other Knights get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina was torn. but her sense of duty to the Knights was perhaps more strongly engrained that mine,  \"I\u2026 I know, but we can't help anyone if we're dead\u2026 and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina was hesitating, I could see it in her eyes.  She didn't want to kill, even with proof that these humanoids were egg stealers and trafficking in our kind's young.  As a faerie dragon, perhaps it was not in her nature to stand and fight, so I suppose I could forgive her, but right now, every fiber in me called out for the blood of these would be egg snatchers.  But she did raise an important point.  Elandor remained missing, worse, perhaps in the hands of the warehouse owner by now.  The instinct to go after the eggs was strong, but so was my urge to see my new elven friend and partner delivered from danger.  Either way, I knew I wasn't going with Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina,\" I said.  \"Take the egg and get back to our strike team.  I'm going to\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

The elvish spy had indeed gone with the smugglers and entered the box complex. It was very possible that he was now a hostage and in need of assistance\u2026 But somehow I doubted it. Elandor was quite skilled and experienced after all, I could tell in just the short time that I'd known him. The eggs, on the other hand were helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elandor can handle himself. Saving the little ones is our first priority,\" I said gruffly, not inviting debate. The alarm was still sounding, gongs echoed from all corners of the vast chamber. I had to move and so did Lina. Still, the faerie dragons seemed torn. I gently prodded her with a wingtip to restore her senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lina. You have to get the egg away from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lairmate seemed to focus. \"Right, Darzhja.\" She afford me a long look, full of concern, \"Stay alive, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned up at her and motioned with my snout to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile crept onto Lina's face. \"Close your eyes, Darzhja. I'm going to give us both some cover to get out of this hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately followed her instruction. There was no longer any doubt in me as to the potency of the small dragoness's abilities. I heard Lina flap her way up and there was shouting all around. The guards who had been placed at high points in the forest of boxes all immediately began to train their crossbows on the small green dragonesss. While most humanoid weaponry was more a nuisance than a threat to me, Lina was another story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they began to fire, however, there came a blinding light of the intensity of the sun. I could feel the heat of it through the scales on my face. Humanoids all around staggered and moaned in agony at the sudden brilliance, covering their eyes and often dropping their weapons. I could see the light even through my scaly outerlids, I could see the tracelines in red around the scales which shone a metallic bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flare lingered for several seconds and I did not waste a single one of them. I groped my way up the mountain of boxes, my claws crushing and sinking into the wood as I dragged myself up. As soon as I felt I was at the top of the narrow aisle, I spread my wings and launched myself forward, in the direction that the tunnel in the small room below me had been leading. The light now behind me, I ventured to open my eyes a little. I could see the boxes passing swiftly below me. To the sides, most of the guards had abandoned their posted or were lying in fetal positions, their faces protected in the crooks of their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne flap, two, then the flare extinguished itself. I had precious little time before I would draw fire from the whole rest of the room. I just hoped that enough of the guards had dropped their weapons or been blinded by Lina's light. Ahead of me, I saw the unusually large box that I had passed earlier, the one that looked more a house than a shipping container. It was almost directly ahead of me and I'd been following the flow of boxes, keeping a mental picture of where the aisles were which would break any possible hidden path, so I knew that it had to be part of the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI built up some reckless speed, flapping my way to the large box, and I began to receive some half hearted crossbow fire. I paid it no heed, the side of the box rushing towards me. At the last moment, I closed my eyes and covered my face as I slammed into the side of it like a battering ram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI met more resistance than I thought I would, but still, I was a large enough projectile that I sheared off half of the roof of the large box. My forequarters were inside of the box proper while my hindlegs still rested on the boxes, or rather box debris at this point piled up against the outside of the extra large box. I coughed with the wood dust filling the air and looked down. There I saw the shocked faces of several shady looking humanoids, but also...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With an innate instinct that only a dragoness possessed, I could sense the fear and uncertainly emanating from the unborn souls of the little ones, pining for their mothers. I'd never felt so violated in my entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to face the infant stealers, and roared at the top of my breath, only inches from their faces. The humanoids stared up at me, shivering and babbling in panic. They backed away as far away as they could from the eggs and huddled in the corner of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!! Please don't kill me!! Please don't kill me!! Please don...\" begged one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I was in no mood for negotiation or mercy. The poor mothers who'd had their babies stolen from them screamed for bloody vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your pleas for the ancestors egg-stealers!! You have sealed your fate!!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsumed by rage, I reared back with my claw and swiped at the gathered group. I caught the entire group with my claw, lifting them clear of the large box and sending them flying in all directions. Their bodies broke with sickening cracks against the walls of the various boxes, crumbling limply to the floor all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately shifted my gaze back toward the inside of the box, where the little ones lay packed in straw like nothing more than brass tubes or alchemical equipment. I reached out with my neck brushed my nose against each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay little ones... Mommy is here now. I'll protect you...\" I reassured. The aura of fear from the unborn dragons lessened slightly, knowing that at least somebody was there now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet my attention was diverted by a sharp pain against my side. A crossbow bolt had lodged itself between a crack in my scales at the base of my tail, I immediately swung around and noticed a humanoid leaping across a pile of boxes attempting to get away. He wasn't fast enough, as I charged forward and slammed onto the pile of boxes, sending bolts, metal parts and wood chips flying everywhere. More importantly, the crossbowman lost his balance and fell with a dull thud to the stone floor below. He tried to limp away but when my shadow hung over him, he curved his head back toward me and screamed. I crushed the rat with the flat side of my tail, unable to help but feel a distinct satisfaction at the sound of the egg stealer's bones snapping underneath, and blood spattering and staining the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the side, I saw what appeared to be the entire company mercenary force was gathered down below, and began to climb over the hills of boxes. I snorted with anger and contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet them all come, they would all learn the fatal mistake of taking on a Knight in battle!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed about, looking for something that could make their climb a bit more difficult. A great pile of wooden bits, metal parts laid scattered about the floor. An idea formed in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swept my tail forward, sending a massive hailstorm of metallic bits into the air. I heard a scream of panicked humanoids below as they attempted to cover themselves. One of the metal projectiles caught an axeman directly in the forehead, sending him tumbling back toward the ground. Another had had his belly sliced open by a shard of wood, his guts spilling out. Several more lost their balance upon the boxes they were scaling and tumbled all the way back down to the hard stone ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the mercs still continued on. One thing I'd learned about the humanoids, both good and evil, was that they could be surprisingly stubborn in the face of suicidal odds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form up you cowards!! Anyone who flees will see their families have a hard time of it!!\" shouted a scrubby looking orc, who appeared to be the leader of the company mercs. That still didn't stop a few, who immediately ran for it, but the threat of retribution against their families kept most in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snarled. Coerced or not, I was not about to let any of these theieves near the eggs. Thus, while the merc leader was busy still trying to instill backbone into his comrades, I reared my neck forward and breathed a plume of fire at the gathered humanoids. It was the first time I had ever used my fire against sentient beings in anger, and immediately a large group of them was engulfed in the flame. They screamed and wailed and fell to the floor, the smell of burnt flesh instantly filled the cavern. The boxes caught in the blast began to burn merrily, filling the chamber with an acrid smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this dramatic display of carnage was enough to send half of the remaining mercs running for their lives, screaming in panic. Yet the remainder clutched at their weapons, approaching me carefully. I realized I'd made a mistake. The mercenaries had purposely placed their inferior troops up front to absorb the brunt of the breath weapon, leaving the more hardened and experienced veterans to deal with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form up mercs!! The beast can only use its breath weapon once every few minutes!! We can still put it down and escape with the cargo before the Knights arrive!!\" screamed the apparent orcish sergent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was left facing three groups of four mercs each. Obviously, they were trying to surround me from all sides so I couldn't get them all, or that they might be able to sneak through the forest of boxes behind me and snatch an egg before I could respond. I later learned that was the usual strategy for stealing dragon eggs; usually it was a dragoness whose mate had left her; the male would usually guard the entrance itself to prevent any crooks from infiltrating the cave in the first place, but when a female was alone she had to stay right on top of her eggs, but in doing so allowed enemies to flank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately lashed at the group on my left with a quick swipe with a claw. Three of the mercs staggered out of the way, but one was knocked aside, having lost his balance where my claw crushed the wooden floor under him. The hairy man with his sword and his spear fell down the slope of the stacked boxes, fortunately, for me at least, landing on his helmet at the bottom and breaking his neck. The groups at the center and right immediately tried to close in. I lashed out with my neck and snapped my jaws, forcing the center group back momentarily, and in a single motion, swung with my flexible tail and caught two of them with the blade, their bodies cleaved in twain as the weight of it plunged into boxes under them. My tail came away draped with bloodstained wool blankets, utterly unsuitable for market at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in that time, the left group had managed to close in. I was unable to dodge as one of them brought their great axe down on my flank. I let out a roar of pain, and lashed about, smashing a few boxes under me, before in a rage, I whipped my head forward and took the offending human in my jaws. He let out a scream as he vainly tried to pull himself free, but I broke his worthless life with a single bite and tossed the puppet-like body far away into the neighboring pile of boxes.. The flesh wound bled more than a little, yet it only served to make me angrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that they wouldn't just be able to get by me in one quick charge, the remaining mercs kept their distance. They waited tantalizingly out of range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on cowardly beast!! Are you going to let a group of scum like us taunt you like that!!\" the orc who I'd first seen taunted. I wanted to jump forward and shut him up for good, but I was disciplined enough to realize that it would have given the other thieves a chance to jump in and snatch one of the eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you all so proud of yourselves? Working for a scumbag like Skarnu?\" I answered. I realized that all I had to do was keep them away and buy time. Whenever one of the groups crept forward, I slashed at them to make them jump back. Every so often, I managed to get one of them, but there was always one or two more guards climbing up the side of the pile to take their place it seemed. I also made sure to periodically take a quick look at the eggs down below, to make sure they were all there. It would be a disaster to discover that I had held off the troops only to find they had managed to sneak away with the cargo from under my haunches. The process repeated itself for quite some time. The one thing about humanoid opponents was that there always were a a lot of them, and that there never seemed to be a limit to their numbers. As far as I was concerned, they may have well sent the entire company security forces to secure their 'cargo'. Yet they could all come, I was not going to fail in my duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, coming from the edge of the hall, was a chorus of alarmed voices. At first I couldn't make out the quick alarmed common, but after listening in I found that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An alarmed looking mercenary called up from the aisle below, \"Mosgov!!\" shouted the merc to the orc standing in front of me, still brandishing his long spear, \"Government forces are here!! We've got to get out of here!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Already!! Can't you hold them off? We've got to secure the cargo!!\" the orcish leader insisted. If they had had any chance of escaping, they should have started running now, yet their leader's reluctance to leave the fight cost them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another series of crashes, this time they came much closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!!\" yelled another gruff looking warehouse guard who had dropped his weapons and was running flat out towards the back of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, no fewer than twenty humanoid guards in full armor came flooding up the aisle beside the huge stack of now mostly shattered boxes I was balancing on; off and away, I saw the outlines of dragons landing on the shelf where the sunlight was pouring into the chamber through the entrance. They were dropping off their passengers and then winging their way into the warehouse. With alacrity and glee in my hearts, I roared down to the shining soldiers below. \"Up here!\" I shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the rather disheveled looking guards in front of me, I was intent on making sure they didn't try anything desperate now that the warriors of the Holy Knights of Nod were upon them. But then, suddenly, Lina was there, having flown in along with the rest of the strike team. I noticed that she was no longer carrying her single dragon egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw down your weapons now mercs!!\" shouted Lina, hovering above the crowded humanoids opposite from me so that they were quite surrounded. I had thought that she must have been intent on preventing any bloodshed to our own troops, but the grave look on her face told me that she had been predicting what was to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough looking soldiers-for-hire gazed back in forth with alarm, their tall boots shifting on the wooden debris and metal parts under them, seeing that there was no way out of the situation. I watched them all begin to reach for daggers sheathed in their breast pockets in a grim, practiced sort of way; after all, dead men couldn't be interrogated. The orc leader stared at me with with a black fire in his orange pupiled eyes as he reached for his own dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!!\" squeaked Lina and she dove into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flapped her wings above them, her downstroke very nearly brushing the tops of their leather helmets, and showered them with her mind-altering dust. They all began to wobble unsteadily. Wasting no time, the humanoid Knights finally came up over the edge of the stack rushed forward to quickly tackle and bind the former warehouse guards and now prisoners of the state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I finally was able to relax a little bit. The sounds of battle, ringing metal and occasionally the sizzle or whistling of a spell, filled the chamber, but my part in the battle was done now that the eggs under my tail were safe. And the battle was certainly not a long one. Any resistance that there was had been defeated in about a minute judging by the sounds echoing through the large chamber of the warehouse. With a heavy sigh of relief, I turned about, letting the armored Knight haul away the dazed guards. Carefully, so carefully, I brushed away the wooden splinters and debris that had fallen on the crates containing the precious eggs with the back of my claw which seemed mammoth and clumsy in comparison to the tiny, fragile things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina helped me in moving the eggs down into the aisle as I no longer felt that they were safe in the greatly damaged remnants of the large box I'd fought over. I did not trust anybody else but another dragoness to aid me in this task, fearing they might drop the little ones or that they were perhaps theives in disguise. When they were on the stone floor, I wrapped my body around them, surrounding them with my warm flesh so that they might not die of cold. I couldn't help but hum contentedly, basking in the aura of the relieved and happy little ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn indeterminate amount of time later - for me anyways - a large blue dragon clad in armor found me and Lina. Even under that armor, I recognized him. It was Lorath, that companion of Fangorn that I had briefly met before heading for the trial. Honestly, had it been Fangorn and had he seen me guarding over a clutch of eggs, I wouldn't have known how I would have reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, are the eggs secured?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are, thank goodness...\" I panted, lifting my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath grinned in relief, \"That's a relief. You did an extraordinary feat holding them off for us Darzhja. I'd say that I now see why Fangorn was so intrigued about you,\" he answered, grinning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but avert my gaze for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind about him anyhow. Give me the details of the attack...\" said Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly and in the professional way of the Knights that I was still learning, I told him everything that had happened since we entered the warehouse; how Lina had found the secret door and the single egg, how I had crashed into the large box and found the hidden clutch, and how - I realized with a hiss through my sharp teeth - how Elandor was still missing and the circumstances in which we had departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath frowned, \"You shouldn't have left your partner like that. Even though he was the senior member of your team, as a dragon, you have certain responsibilities to your assigned rider.\" His sea green eyes were hard under his metal helmet. \"That was terribly irresponsible of you to leave him. We can only hope that the spy master was skilled enough to avoid being captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brazen part of me wanted to stand up and shout, to defend myself. After all, Elandor had all but commanded me to depart. But I took the captain's rebuke in silence, I hugged myself about the eggs a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lorath's eyes softened, his eyes no longer a hurricane so much as a slow mist. \"But I expect that Elandor has eluded capture, Darzhja. He has something of a reputation for miraculous escapes.\" said the large blue drake with a grin, \"In fact, he may even be in pursuit of this 'Mr. Skarnu' character as we speak, though I doubt that is his real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned up at Lorath and Lina fluttered down to the stone floor and pressed herself against my foreleg. Lina said, \"Regardless, we have men searching every corner of this building. Chances are, that both of them have already been found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another humanoid guard rushed towards us from around a corner, he had to vault over some fallen timbers clogging the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Lorath!! We've managed to round up the last of the mercs and we're sending men to look into the hidden chambers!\" shouted the human Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!! Take them into custody immediately so that these egg-stealing scum can be questioned!!\" growled Lorath. I couldn't help but be impressed by his professionalism. He'd been very laid back before, yet he knew when to be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow Darzhja, I'm loath to have to ask you this, but now that the eggs are secured we need to have them taken back to the Temple's medical wing to care for them, along with hopefully getting these hatchlings back to their parents,\" said Lorath calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay...sir...\" I said hesitantly. It was extremely difficult for me, as a young dragoness, to simply step away from the eggs that I had spent the past several minutes guarding, even though they weren't my own. Still, I was very much appreciative that Lorath recognized the situation I was in. Fangorn probably would have said something either very callous, me being insubordinate, or perhaps something perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the humanoid guards carefully secured the eggs and store them. The little ones didn't want to leave my warmth, and I could feel them pine to stay with me, and even though I knew they were being taken to a safe place, my instincts still gnawed at me to snatch them away from these potential egg stealers and keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its going to be all right Darzhja,\" assured Lina, \"They'll all be back with their mommies soon!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only hoped she was right, though my mind told me that inevitably, a few of them might be orphaned, as I had been. If they were, then at least I knew of one place where they would surely be safe...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, I felt the pain in my side, and I winced. In my rage, I had not noticed how the axe wound that one of the mercs had given me had been aggravated a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja!!\" squealed Lina with shock and concern, \"What a terrible wound!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fixed my teeth together. It was still bleeding, perhaps worse than before although the blow had been a rather small one. \"Its nothing... I can still perform my duties without any hindrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath came forward and sniffed the wound in my flank, I could smell the oil of his gleaming armor and the slightly musky scent of his scales, \"That may be, but you still need to get that fixed up right away. I don't want to alarm you but the weapon that inflicted that may have been poisoned. Its probably nothing major, but I'm ordering you to head for the Medical ward straight away just to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clicked my teeth together. I wanted to help out more, but even if I was uninjured I probably wouldn't have been doing much anyhow now that all the mercs had been subdued. I was a fighter, and wasn't quite as good with the investigative stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well sir,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Lina, I'll still need your services to help us interrogate these mercs. Your fairy dust will be able to get their gums flapping quick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One batch of fairy dust coming right up!!\" exclaimed Lina, turning a flip back into the air. The tiny dragoness then turned back toward me, \"Sorry if you're feeling a little left out Darzhja. Anyhow, I'll see you back at the dorm later tonight!!\" she squeaked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back, and headed back outside. When I got outside, I saw a number of humanoid soldiers forming a perimeter around the entrance of the warehouse, keeping the curious onlookers away. I noticed that when I got up into the air - my side aching quite a bit more than I thought it would - there was still quite a bit of daylight left. Though the whole investigation and the fight had seemed to have lasted a long time, really, no more than a few hours had passed since I had spoken to Lady Scabia about the mission. I figured that she probably didn't expect that the investigation of the storage facility would transform into a takedown of a major smuggling company, as well as the capture of slavers. Yet as I flew back to the Temple, I couldn't help but feel proud of myself, that already I had done my part to protect Nod from evil, and felt very Knightly indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical ward of the Holy Knights of Nod was clearly marked, the large landing, upon which multiple injured dragons could be treated if they were unable to be moved further in if need be, was painted in severe tones of red and pale yellow strips. I landed heavily, clutching my side, I could feel the blood welling between my digits, thick, gooey and dark as it clotted. I'd taken worse than the axe wound in the course of my sparring career, so I was not terribly concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust inside, there was a large open chamber, color coded strips lead from the main entrance along to floor and into the branching tunnels beyond. Everyone here, from the humanoid physicians to the dragon orderlies moved professionally and briskly to their destinations. The place was unsettlingly quiet for a chamber with so many occupants. I thought back to the overcrowding of the orphanage, which was still doubling as a makeshift infirmary, and how many of those patients could have fit in the ward. Then again, the interior of the Temple of the Knights was a rather exclusive place compared to the city at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt my feet, there was a long stone desk made for humanoid height. Standing behind a counter covered with sheafs of paper and parchment was what first appeared to be a female human, though her olive skin and slanted eyes hinted at some fey blood in her background. \"Greetings, Lady\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja. Just Darzhja.\" I said, introducing myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Adrial.\" said the clerk in a cheerful voice. I was still rather unused to humanoids being so familiar with dragons here in the temple, the human female seeming perfectly at ease with me towering over her. A drop of blood fell from my flank and landed on the cool, but perfectly dry floor. Adrial sniffed. \"It seems you are in need of some patching up, Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted an affirmation. \"My captain also mentioned something about\u2026 poisoning?\" I said a little unsurely, not wanting to sound like a hypochondriac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let your physician be the judge of that.\" She shuffled among her papers, the documents tiny and the letters indecipherable scrawl from my vantage point. Grabbing a quill, she asked, \"Now can I just get your ID number and your mentor's name? I assume you are a new recruit, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a step back. \"My mentor is Lady Scabia\u2026 but I don't know my ID number\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk sighed. \"Well, I need your ID to know what care you are qualified for. If I don't have it, I will have to charge you the full price out of your hoard account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grimaced, showing my fangs. \"Really?\" I did not want to contemplate a single gem going missing from my minuscule hoard. \"What if\u2026 I\u2026\" I hesitated, trying to figure out if I could just turn around and lick my wound like a dog rather than face some outrageous bill for getting stitched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of all the dragons that had to make an appearance, it had to be Fangorn. He looked somewhat pallid shambling into the lobby, holding his tail well off the ground and very stiffly. A female dwarf followed him hurriedly, struggling to keep up with the dragon's large stride. \"Corporal! Wait! I haven't finished the dressing, you're going to rip your stitches again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn sighed raggedly and came to a stop. He took a few steps to the side and laid down with this back against the wall. My eyes narrowed suspiciously \"How is it that you know my identification number, Fangorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corporal cleared this throat and ignored me as the dwarf busied herself about the red and raw wound on the underside of the drake's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to take a deep breath to calm myself, \"Fangorn, <i>sir!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bronze drake smirked, but then twitched as the dwarf pulled on one of the thick black cords which was currently binding his flesh together. \"Hold still!\" she chided, \"You squirm worse than a hatchling.\" It provided me some small satisfaction to see Fangorn in pain, but then I looked at the wound I'd inflicted on him in my fervor to join the Knights, and it was far more severe than I'd realized. I saw that I'd actually lifted a flap of skin and flesh away from his tail. About 80 stitches lined the wound, holding down the flap so that it would heal seamlessly, although likely still with permanent scarring,  I was shocked as to the damage I'd caused him, though I couldn't be moved to feel badly for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn was long in replying, as if considering the benefits and risks of conversation with me. Rather than addressing my question, he decided to address my staring in the rudest possible way. \"Do I detect amusement with my predicament Darzhja?\" Admittedly, I did, yet I wasn't about to let him know about it with a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I was certainly not prepared for what he said next, \"You like what you see? I certainly know a few better places than this for me to give you a better look.\" he finished with a chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes grew wide as saucers and let out a hiss.  With my right wing, I slapped him on the snout. The dwarf backed away from the two dragons with a practiced agility as Fangorn shifted his weight with the blow. He growled and lifted a claw to his scaled cheek. \"A bit touchy now aren't we?\" he said, as if I were the one overstepping boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't care if I was. Even though I assumed that one was not supposed to hit a superior officer, Fangorn was an arrogant jerk, always bringing up those rude insinuations and the irritating way he kept popping up at the most random times, he deserved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just admit it, Fangorn. You're stalking me.\" I accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw his eyes slip to the female dwarf at our feet; her arms were crossed in front of her generous bosom. Then he loosened his wings in a disarming shrug, retreating. \"So, you would believe I would rip my stitches on purpose just so that I would be here waiting for you? A bit paranoid now are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excuse sounded reasonable enough, yet considering that it was Fangorn, I wouldn't have put it past him to intentionally injure himself to meet me on false pretenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me how you knew my ID number.\" I demanded for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn hesitated for a brief moment, before composing himself, \"I was your escort\u2026\" said Fangorn, \"It was my job to know certain details about you, to help you through the integration process.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why couldn't you just say that!\" I hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would have already figured it out Darzhja\u2026\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted, \"Maybe, but you don't have to be such a jerk about it. Why can't you be kind and understanding like Lorath is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" said Fangorn, his jaw dropping. \"Lorath?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a startling intensity in the drake's eyes. I seriously hadn't expected Fangorn to be jealous of Lorath, but now that he was truly riled, I was going to milk it for all it was worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Fangorn, I'm working for him now. Unlike you, he actually cared enough to send me here after getting injured, or perhaps you just didn't notice me bleeding all over the floor where I stand?\" I growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn's claws dug into the stone as if it were little more than brittle chalk. His wide eyes expression was so full of shock and anger that I was actually rather afraid of what emotions I'd sent into play within the unstable Knight. Yet Fangorn being Fangorn, he quickly screwed his jaw back to its usual self-assured expression, \"Well, Lorath has always been quite the charmer, but don't think for a moment that he's as pious as he'd like everyone to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts were pounding. What by the Ancestors was wrong with Fangorn? I was fully set to defend Lorath despite the short time that I'd known him and the fact that it had been basically Fangorn who'd introduced us. I had gotten the sense that while their personalities had been different, Lorath and Fangorn were actually pretty good friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with acting nice... Sir? Besides, I'm better off with the people I'm working with than with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before we could launch into a tirade on the absent drake's credentials, I felt a wing gently pull me to the side, a familiar odor basking over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now, Darzhja.\" said Lady Scabia. I relaxed unresistingly into her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn, however was still smoldering. \"Lady Scabia, me and Darzhja were just having a brief word. If you could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragoness turned on him, \"You're dismissed, corporal. Or perhaps I should ask your nurse here what sorts of topics you two were exchanging before I dropped in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn hung his head in a most satisfying manner. \"No madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suggest you take your treatment and move along. In fact, I think I will have a word with Lieutenant Hazzorah if you continue to linger here.  Everyone's too busy to afford slackers shirking their duties in the medical center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn swallowed in obvious fear. \"That won't be necessary, Madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suggest you let your nurse perform her duties and be on your way.\" said Lady Scabia as she ushered me away down a tunnel on the opposite side of the lobby. However, before I turned away, I couldn't help but take a moment but to stick my tongue out at him. Fangorn merely snorted, seeming rather amused, before turning his head away; the dwarven nurse moved back in to finish dressing his wound. If he were but a tenth as nice as Lorath, I probably would have liked him a lot. I let out a sigh. Things were always so weird with Fangorn.  As things turned out, however, I was merely trading one uncomfortable position for another.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thanks for helping me out Lady Scabia...\" I said to her after my scrape with Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe humphed, \"Better that I would not have had to get you out of that at all. You should know better than to get drawn into pointless banter with that wretch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lady Scabia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sigh and shook her head in exasperation. \"Still, it must be nice, to be so young and beautiful...\" I heard Lady Scabia muse under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" I uttered, a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that,\" she growled curtly, \"Lets get the healers to tend to your wound. Furthermore, you still need to get your physical done, so as long as you're here, you may just as well get that taken care of as well. The sooner you can get it done, the better\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... right...\" I answered, shifting nervously. I had forgotten about the physical exam during my mission. Furthermore, I had also been wondering why Lady Scabia had led me though a long corridor that had seemed out of the way from the rest of the medical ward, and had passed by several other perfectly good rooms. It seemed that she wanted me to be somewhere that I wouldn't be overheard or peeked at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I'll be waiting for you back at the lobby. Be sure to do everything that the healers tell you to do all right?\" said Scabia. I walked into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human nurse clad in robes was present. She introduced herself as Callia, and after informing her why I was here and giving her my ID number, she set to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow lets take a look... Would you lay down on your belly please?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so, and allowed the healer to gaze over it. She worked quickly and efficiently, cleaning up the blood and grime from the wound and then rubbing a strange liquid upon it. The alkaline smelling liquid stung a little, and I could hear the slight sound of bubbling, before it went numb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there poison in the wound?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a bit of rust and grime. The rubbing alcohol managed to neutralize it. Don't mind me asking, but where did you get the idea your wound had poison?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her about Lorath and how he'd sent me straight to the Medical ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I heard that a lot of dragonesses like him, but I'd never heard of him actually going out of his way to see to the well being of one dragoness in particular,\" she commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but feel heartened. \"I'm just happy he seemed geniunely concerned about me,\" I replied. <i>Unlike a certain stalking, arrogant, pervented bronze drake....</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, the nurse had just about finished healing the wound. \u201cThere we go!! You should be able to return to your normal duties without any issues tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but grunt with satisfaction. As grueling as today\u2019s mission had been, I was keen on getting back into the fold straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse gazed down at the file again. \u201cI\u2019ve also noticed that you haven\u2019t undergone your physical yet. I'm guessing that's why you're in this room then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clicked my jaw together. \u201cErr...yes...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, Lady Ornaryz is currently free, so if you\u2019d like I can schedule you to have it taken right now\u2026\" she answered. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I could have sworn that I saw her eye twinkle for a moment. I lowered my gaze at the human and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy her in particular?\u201d I asked, more as a means of testing the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see, Lady Ornaryz specializes in caring for the specific needs of dragoness\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened, and my mind fluttered with wild imaginations. \u201cI suppose I should just get it over with then\u2026\u201d I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow\u2026I\u2019ll just call her over then\u2026\u201d said the nurse, leaving the room. A few minutes later, a motherly looking Silver Dragoness entered the room. She possessed very soft, refined features, and furthermore, I also noticed that her claws were also neatly trimmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Darzhja. Very pleased to meet you,\u201d she said, with a slight bow of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise,\u201d I responded, trying to hide my anxiety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ornaryz smiled kindly, \u201cI can\u2019t be that scary now can I? Don\u2019t worry, the first part of the exam is pretty straight forward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, and a moment later, her claws became encased by a thin film, so as to not accidentally scratch, and also to ensure cleanliness. She gently placed her claws under my neck, checking for something. They felt rubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the meantime, tell me about yourself\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, while she measured my height, weight, length, wing length, heartbeats and other rather routine tests, I told her a little bit about myself and what I thought of the Knights. She seemed like a very trustworthy, kind and sympathetic dragoness, so I felt comfortable telling her my opinions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the exam itself, while they did check up on us back at the orphanage, oftentimes they were perfunctory and rather rough, by contrast Ornaryz was very precise and thorough. I couldn\u2019t help but be rather amazed at how deftly she could manipulate the various medical instruments with her claws, with nearly the expertise of a humanoid, and combine it with the use of magic so that nothing was left unchecked. All in all, that part of the exam was hardly as bad as I feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, came the invasive part of the exam, the part that required the skills of one dedicated to the particular needs of dragonesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do what!?\u201d I all but shrieked at the healer, my wings unfurling and tail tightly coiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ornaryz kept her calm stare, as if she had fully expected my particular reaction. She calmly explained what was going to happen, and why this part of the exam was important. Oddly, being informed made me feel a bit less on edge, and that I could be assured that she knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're not going to do it here now are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we have special facilities to perform this exam... if you would follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered, but at the same time I couldn't help but be curious as well. She led me to an isolated room, in which she sealed the entrance with a spell. When I saw the contents of the room itself it I couldn\u2019t help but flinch. In the center of the room was a large padded table that was tilted at an angle, and next to the table was a series of rather invasive looking medical instruments. All together, the room resembled something out of Fangorn\u2019s most perverted dungeon fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't hurt will it?\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not,\" she assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm still going to be...well... you know...\" I stuttered, shifting my gaze away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure will not alter the physical structure of your birth canal in any way...\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... all right...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it can be pretty daunting, especially for younger dragonesses like yourself. What I find helps a patient relax during the exam is to concentrate on their breathing. Now then, do you have any other questions before we begin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath. \u201cLets do it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe healer positioned me on the examining table, placing me on my belly with my hips angled upwards and spreading my legs apart. My tail was then gently nudged upwards and held in place with a hook. Had Fangorn been present in the room (which by the Great Dragons Above he was not) and witnessed it, his head probably would have exploded, or he\u2019d try to... actually, I probably shouldn\u2019t be thinking of Fangorn right now. Especially not right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn\u2019t hurt, but it did feel rather\u2026strange, and admittedly even oddly soothing to be prodded and poked in that place. Every so often, Ornaryz would utter an intrigued hum. Briefly, I wondered if she was a bit skewed in her orientation. Maybe she was, maybe she wasn't. Again, something I probably would be better off not thinking too much upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her roll forward that invasive looking metal rod and I nearly balked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, give me a nice, slow exhale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exhaled, willing myself not to flinch. I kept my eyes closed, and tried to think happy thoughts to keep my mind focused off that unsettling cramped sensation in my abdomen. I let out a short, staggered breath as what felt like a brush gently turn in a circle inside me, followed by a tapping noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great Darzhja, we're almost done...\" Ornaryz said encouragingly. There was a bit more poking and prodding, only this time she rubbed my abdomen while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the exam was over, and I was gently taken off the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, I still have to test the results, but on the surface everything appears to be normal,\" said the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 great!!\u201d I answered, not really knowing what else I should say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad now was it?\u201d said Ornaryz with a smile, leading me out of that room and back into the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026suppose it wasn\u2019t,\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, we\u2019re all done here. You'll be scheduled for your next physical exam either five years from now, or before any mission that requires you to be away from the Temple for an extended period of time,\" said Ornaryz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and returned to Lady Scabia, who had started to look rather impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time. I swear that dragoness enjoys her work a little too much...\" she mused. \"Anyhow, now that you've got that taken care of...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, meet me at my lair so we can discuss the results of the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Lady Scabia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I left the hospital ward. It was getting rather late now, so there wasn't that much time to do anything else before going back to the dorms in any case. However, there was still enough time to go get something to eat, so I flew over to the hunting grounds. I picked out a fat, juicy steer and set down to eat it. I wondered if Lina had finished interrogating the mercs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if merely thinking about here triggered her appearance, heard the sound of a familiar 'poof'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja!! I\u2019m back!!\" squealed Lina, twirling her body in the air before settling next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina!! How did the interrogation go!!\" I called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we found out quite a bit about the mercs intensions. However, we\u2019ll talk about it more tomorrow with Lady Scabia. As for now, Darzhja, I want to introduce you to someone special!!\" she squeaked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faerie drake instantly poofed into existence next to her; like Lina, he resembled a typical hatchling than a full-grown dragon, and possessed green scales similar to Lina\u2019s, only with a slightly bit darker. In fact, he looked as if he could have been Lina\u2019s sibling, and it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if they actually were related by blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEin'theil!!\u201d she squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very pleasant to meet you Darzhja!!\" he chittered. \u201cSo you\u2019re Lina\u2019s new lairmate? Wow you\u2019re big\u2026\u201d he cried. I'm fairly sure he meant it as a compliment, yet if Fangorn had said it, it would have earned him a slap. Thankfully, I wasn't speaking with Fangorn here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I only got here yesterday so I\u2019m still trying to find my way around here and get to know everyone here. Lina\u2019s really helped me out get my bearings straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmhmm!! Because that\u2019s what best friends do!!\u201d squeaked Lina. To emphasize this, she poofed on top of me and gave me a winged hug. Though I did think she was going overboard, I nonetheless grinned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, I also noticed a halfling riding on Ein\u2019theil\u2019s back. He was so small that I hadn\u2019t even noticed him until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!! I\u2019d also like to introduce my partner Peteringe!! Say hi Peter!!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halfling gazed up at me, seeming a bit intimidated at how much larger I was than him. \u201cOh\u2026um\u2026hello!!\u201d he said shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour partner?\u201d I asked, wanting more specifics. The one I\u2019d had with Elandor seemed to be only a working relationship, yet I sensed that Ein\u2019theil not only had that but also a genuine friendship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how long have you been working together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-about six months now. I\u2019ve been training to be a mage, and part of my training is to partner with a dragon whose also specialized in the magical arts.\u201d Said Peter. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t have the highest opinion in humanoid mages, especially the ones that specialized in using dragon parts, but he didn\u2019t seem all that bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you also living together?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!!\u201d said Ein\u2019theil, \u201cSince we\u2019re already partners, studying together, it makes sense that we share the same lair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut once we become full-fledged Knights!! I\u2019ll be the one sharing your lair and making little ones with you!!\u201d squeaked Lina excitedly. I couldn\u2019t help but cringe somewhat at her exclamation, and moreso when Ein\u2019theil answered it wholeheartedly. When seeing those two together, I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of two hatchlings going to a lair made out of candy than a betrothed pair. I suppose that was normal for Fairie Dragons though, so it probably wasn\u2019t my place to comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated to break up their little conversation, but I noticed the shadows begin to grow long and the sky glow red, \u201cIts getting rather late now, so we should probably be headed back to the dorms now,\u201d I commented. Since I had missed that first day of training, I likely had a long day ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh all right\u2026\u201d said Lina, not wanting to be parted with her betrothed, \u201cSee you tomorrow my shiny prince!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, my sparkling princess\u2026\u201d cried Ein\u2019theil, twirling together and nuzzling, before reluctantly separating. The rather dazed halfling apprentice mage, Peter, also gave a rather timid goodbye. The entire way back, Lina had a dreamy look on her eyes. It must be nice, to have someone that already loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When I arrived with Lina back at the lair, most of the other dragonesses were already headed back to their respective lairs as well. I hadn\u2019t had the chance to speak with any of the other dragonesses for more than a few moments, and I reckoned that I should take the opportunity to get to know the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI yawned once I got back to my lair, laying upon my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Darzhja, how did the rest of your day go?\u201d asked Lina, eyes glowing excitedly. Frankly, I didn\u2019t find it particularly exciting; perhaps it was exciting in that my argument with Fangorn had been rather explosive, and also the physical\u2026 However, I didn\u2019t want to tempt Lina into using fairy dust on me, so I decided to just tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bumped into that wretch Fangorn again at the Medical Ward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooo!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly, twirling in the air, \u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. \u201cSome rather rude and perverted things. I swear, that jerk is absolutely obsessed with stalking me. Its driving me completely crazy!!\u201d I growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDriving you crazy hmmm? Sends your heart racing now does it?\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou have an over-active imagination Lina. Besides, Lorath is a hundred times nicer than Fangorn anyhow!! I wouldn\u2019t mind going out with him,\u201d I added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorath is very nice, and a lot of dragonesses like him. Yet I bet that you were thinking about Fangorn rather than Lorath when you were having your physical\u2026\u201d she continued, looking ready to burst into excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze for a moment, before catching myself. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t tell me that while that weird nurse was sticking that awful metal thing inside you that you were fantasizing about Ein\u2019theil,\u201d I snorted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was Darzhja\u2026could you not help but imagine just how big and hard his\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLINA!!\u201d I shrieked, baring my teeth. Lina began giggling wildly again. At that point, I knew I probably shouldn\u2019t spur her own, so I decided to calm myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit it Lina. As much of an arrogant jerk he is, Fangorn\u2019s hot. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a drake as good-looking as he is. I\u2019m not expecting him to be Lorath and be smiling and sentimental all the time, or anything like that, but would it kill him for him to be polite once and a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina seemed to think about it for a moment. \u201cYet if Fangorn was kind and polite rather than a stalking, perverted jerk, would you really be thinking about him all that much?\u201d she countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I said, trying to imagine Fangorn being chivalrous and proper like a normal Knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a yawn, as I laid down upon my stomach.. I didn\u2019t want to think about Fangorn right now.  Besides, I'd probably bump into him again some time soon anyhow, and then I would deal with whatever snarky thing that comes out of his mouth. It had been quite a long day, and tomorrow would likely be another long day as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a poof, and once again Lina reclined on top of my back, preparing to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet dreams Darzhja\u2026\u201d she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted out a laugh. Whatever dreams I ended up having, Lina would likely have something to do with them. \u201cYou too now Lina\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trumpeting sound of of the morning bugle awoke me from a rather fantastic and more overtly sexual than I was used to.  I couldn't help but begrudge the little dragons who was now flitting about the room in her usual excitement the ability to manipulate my dreams\u2026 and also her perkiness in the morning.  I was still sore from yesterday - Everywhere, it seemed, and I do mean <i>everywhere</i> - and I felt like putting my head back under my wing as soon as the clarion call of the morning tunes began to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina, however wouldn't have let me even if I had had the option.  \"Get up sleepy head!\"  she squeaked landing heavily on my head.  I drew the line when she reached down with one of her fine claws and proceeded to lift one of my heavy, scaled outer eyelids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose, shaking my head and growling a bit in my agitation.  But with that signature 'poof' Lina was already gone and at the entrance to the lair.  She grinned mischievously.  \"Wanna race again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked slowly ahead, stretching and gave a big, toothy yawn.  I scratched at my shoulder with my hindleg and a couple of coin sized loose scales clinked onto the stone floor.  I didn't really look in the mood and Lina's face fell slightly.  Then, with a silly twist of my head, I stuck my tongue out at her and charged down the hallway ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't really think I had a chance of winning.  Lina's ability to fly in the cramped space as well as teleport should have ensured her victory no matter if I cheated with a head start.  Still, feeling foolish all the while, I spread my wings slightly to block Lina getting around me.  I assumed she would just poof ahead of me and that would be that.  However, she didn't.  \"Hey!  Move your wings, Darzja!\"  squealed the pint-sized dragons.  Down the hallways leading to the dorms, past the shower with its flowing trough of water and into the common room, Lina remained behind me, unable to get past my outstretched wings.  That was the day that I learned that Lina's short-range teleport ability was also limited to where she could see.  It was a useful lesson to be sure, and one that I took advantage of at the times the little dragoness proved to be extra bothersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd won, but my only prize were glares from the other females as they proceeded in dual lines out to the landing.  I struggled to compose myself, but ultimately failed, what with Lina slamming into my haunches, laughing and dropping sparkling dust into the air.  \"Not fair!\" said the faerie dragon as she crawled up my back, her little claws gripping my scales like a hatchling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt comfortable enough to shush her by now as I moved to the rear end of the quickly moving line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun with your lairmate, newbie?\" said a dragoness whose dark red body was covered with long black spines which had a tendency to rattle as she moved, \"We have a sand pit downstairs to play in if you two are interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joke earned a laugh from both her and two other females nearby and though I was larger by half than the venomous dragoness, I did not want to pick a fight with her.  I remained silent though I glowered down at her, mantling my wings a little to emphasize my size.  The effect was largely ruined when Lina crested my shoulder and lying on it, said, \"At least we know how to have fun and are not so stuck up like you, Tsarra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venom quilled female lifted her nose haughtily, though the way her quills lifted betrayed her true mood, \"Spoken like a hatchling, Bite-Size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra began to walk away with her fellows and I allowed two more females to get ahead of me to put distance between us as we all shuffled forward to the landing.  \"I hate it when they call me 'Bite-Size'\"  muttered Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stirred to touch her gently with my wing.  \"Don't worry about it, Lina.  You're more of a dragoness than the three of them put together.\"  Lina said nothing, however and sat on my shoulder as we made our way out into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not the very last like yesterday, I was stalled in leaving due to my size.  Sky-swallowers were really the only breed bigger than the Regal Bronze and as such I was larger by almost a third than most of the others here.  They skittered around me and I was too hesitant in proceeding to make a lot of head way in the unorganized flow of apprentice Knights.  Whatever respect my size might have afforded me in the group seemed lost by my choosing to associate with Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, it was not long before I reached the landing.  I spread my wings, almost filling the platform while Lina simultaneously poofed out into the air.  I dove and quickly overtook the smaller dragon.  The sensation of the wind filling my wings made me forget about any social awkwardness in the cave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I landed once more in the dirt of the training yard, Lina and I were separated.  It seemed that the smaller dragons were placed in the forward rows with the larger in the back of the dual columns.  As I was landing, my eyes immediately settled one a blue, now unarmored, figure in the male column.  Lorath had his head turned to someone a little further down his row.  I looked and saw Fangorn two dragons down from him.  Lorath was saying something, but Fangorn seemed not to hear at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was puzzled and wanted to hear what they were talking about, but my place in the female column was beside two female sky-swallowers and I could not see over their bulk.  But anyway, I was soon too busy to care what it was the two males were or were not talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the shovel-clawed male with the missing eye who started us off.  He landed heavily, I could feel the shock of it through the earth in my toes, and began to walk from right to left - male to female - ahead of the collums.  His foreclaws dug into the earth as he moved, \"You all are still the sorriest excuses for new recruits that I have seen in my life.\"  The sergeant spoke loudly enough for all to hear.  \"Limp, unmotivated, lazy, fat,\" at that he gave a hard look to the silver dragoness in the row ahead of me, \"weaklings.  None of you are worthy to be called a Holy Knight.\"  He turned on us and there was not an apprentice that didn't flinch.  \"It's up to you to prove me wrong.  Now give me some wing extensions, and don't stop until I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for me to get going, having missed the previous day, but I just copied everyone else as they moved their wings first up and then out, up, then out.  It was uncomfortable after a while, I wasn't used to moving my wings in that way.  I dug my claws into the dirt and continued, though despite the burning.  The sergeant traveled up and down the rows, pausing here and there to yell at someone who was doing the exercise incorrectly or tell them to go faster if they were having it too easy.  The red veins in my wings grew livid, cooling me as my wing muscles burned.  It seemed I'd barely made it through the first exercise before we were called on to stretch our wings forward and then back.  Halfway through this exercise, were were told to do push ups with our claws while simultaneously moving our wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had difficulty in doing this, somewhat in the way that a human might have trouble rubbing their stomach while patting their head.  I tripped and my chest hit the dirt.  I struggled to recover, but with my wings flailing about, I'd caught the attention of the sergeant.  He moved down to the last row.  \"Are you taking a nap, recruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir!\"  I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get out of the dirt and show me some stamina!\" shouted the one-eyed dragon.  He was smaller than me physically, but I felt as small as Lina under his withering glare.  I tried but then felt my forelegs give out again under me.  If I just had a couple minutes, I could get the hang of the motion, but I didn't think I'd have that much time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, instead of the one-eyed sergeant addressing me, a pitch black Deathwing came forward.  A miasma of gloom and hate seemed to emanate out from her, and I felt as if every positive feeling and happy thought had been sucked out of me. She seemed to fulfill every negative stereotype I had of Deathwings; hateful, malevolent, masochistic and enjoyed causing suffering. The entire exercise came to a halt, as even the one-eyed sergeant seemed uneasy around this malevolent dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? If it isn\u2019t the wench who decided to miss the first day of training,\u201d she said, pacing next to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam, I was called away\u2026\u201d I began to insist. Bad idea. Her eyes narrowed, and she swung her hook-shaped tail and slapped me across the flank. I gasped as a piercing pain filled my body. \u201cI do not want to hear whatever pitiful excuse you were prepared to give me. You missed the first day of training, and for that, you shall suffer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Madam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed, unsatisfied. I only realized now, that since I had missed the first day, I didn't even know her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lieutanent Shadia to you wench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Madam!!\" I shouted. She hissed, still unsatisfied. Then, she turned toward the rest of the recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this slackers incompetence, you will all give me ten laps around the perimeter of the Temple!! Furthermore, there will be no break for the recruits afterwards as I expect you sergeants to get them back to their exercises immediately,\" she hissed. They all took off, but not before giving me dirty, murderous glares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how does it feel? Watching the other recruits get punishment because of your incompetence,\u201d she growled, her head next to mine.  \"Now then... I want you to give me eleven laps. I will be watching you closely, and should you be the last to arrive\u2026\" She angled her tail blade and held it over my neck, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my teeth, desperate to get away from Shadia, and I took off, scared out of my mind. I flew as fast as I could, powered not by a desire to prove myself as a Knight, not to let my other fellow recruits down, or to not shame everyone back at the orphanage who was cheering me on, but by a primal, all-encompassing fear. Yet also I wanted to show that sadistic driller that she wasn't going to push me around like this, and I imagined the look on her face when I would return and she would have no reason to punish me worse than what she already had in store. Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t last, if only because I was able to get ahead of the plump looking silver dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had returned, all but ready to collapse, the the driller gazed at me, looking for any excuse to punish me further. I was determined to give her none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the drillers had already begun a new excruciating exercise. The human magicians had conjured a series of suspended beams, and the apprentice knights were ordered to wrap their tail securely around these beams and lift their entire body up and over so that their jaw would touch the tip of the tail without the aid of ones wings. I quickly found that it was an extremely difficult exercise, especially for the larger breeds of dragons like myself that had so much more bulk to lift up. I could only do about four or five before collapsing in exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, the Lieutenant took a special interest in tormenting me at every moment of the exercise. She would snap at me for the slightest mistake. She would taunt me ceaselessly, with the most degrading insults imaginable. Yet the most insidious thing she would do is that while I was doing that one last tail up, she would slap at me with that hooked tail of hers, causing me to lose my grip and knock me to the ground, and in such a way not to cause as much pain as possible without it being a disabling injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me recruit. Do you hate me?\u201d she taunted. I couldn\u2019t help but take notice of her eyes, eyes that took exquisite pleasure into causing pain and suffering to helpless victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did hate her, but I was not about to give in to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mam\u2026\u201d I growled, biting back the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Then perhaps I have not been going hard enough on you.  Rest assured wench, I will make sure that you suffer. I will break you wench. I will watch as the hope fades from your eyes, your resolve shatter, as despair overtake you as you beg for mercy. Then you may truly realize just how utterly worthless and meaningless your existence is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but give a shuddering breath. I had expected the drillers to be means, and indeed the sergeants were mean, yet this dragoness did not seem to have a single shred of decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grinned maliciously, and said with a would-be sweet voice, \u201cIt can all be over right here recruit. No more pain. No more suffering. No more of that depraved, Lieutenant Shadia. You can go back home to your normal life\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I honestly did think about giving up. Yet the fact was, I didn\u2019t have a home to go back to. Nobody had ever said it was going to be easy, and if I could not over come this driller, even one as unusually malevolent as she was, then there was no way I could be a Holy Knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t break me!!\u201d I spat defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadia sniffed disdainfully, \u201cWe shall see then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lieutenant then led the recruits to the obstacle course, located within a large, specially made chamber within the Temple walls. This involved climbing upside down along a cliff face that had been doused with oil, followed by slogging through a narrow, claustrophobic passage, followed by navigating through a hazardous labyrinth of razor sharp rocks, more climbing and then leaping across a series of suspended pillars without the aid of ones wings. I wish I could say that I stumbled only a few times, at which I would have to repeat that stage of the course all over again, but thankfully, I wasn't the only one either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, the Lieutenant hung over me like a black cloud, slapping and insulting me the whole way. What made it more infuriating is that when she performed the course with me, she did so with the greatest of ease, as if to emphasize just how incompetent I truly was. She didn\u2019t get tired, not even slightly, so much so that I wondered whether she was drawing dark energy from the powers below or something of that nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after the obstacle courses, we finished things off with ten more laps around the temple. Of course, the Lieutenant made me do fifteen laps, with her watching the entire way. At long last, the lieutenant released me from her vile clutches. I was covered head to toe in filth, exhausted, and could barely move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, it was still right around the early afternoon when the exercises were over. There was still time before I had to meet with Lady Scabia again, so I took the time to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone else, even the plump silver had gone in ahead of me having had to finish with only ten laps around the Temple grounds to my fifteen.  My wings ached so it took me twice as long to fold them, my legs felt like lead and my back hurt so that I walked in stiffly.  I dragged my tail, spirits low, but not broken, not yet.  I spoke to no one as I dragged in dirt and dust; thorns and small rocks fell out from my scales as I walked to the showers.  I thought only of the cool water as if I could shed all of my miseries as easily as the filth covering my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked in on a golden dragoness who was utilizing the water trough which flowed through the middle of the room.  Modesty was different in dragons than humanoids, after all, we went about the world comfortable in our flesh and never felt the need to cover ourselves.  As such she didn't even pause as I moved to the side, looking for a particular symbol on the wall.  Perhaps it was because she was a fellow metallic or perhaps it was just because she felt sorry for me, but she brushed a wing against my filth ridden body and said, \"Don't give up, you did good out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned and nodded and she exited the chamber.  That little comment meant more to me than she could possibly know.  I touched the symbol carved into the rock of the stone with my foreclaw and immediately water began to cascade from a chute above me.  It was diverted from an underground steam, I knew, that serviced the female dorms as well as the kitchens and various other chambers located below us.  It was all top notch dwarven work and I recognized the heavy straight lines of their rune-work.  Though honestly, I sometimes had to wonder at the wisdom of placing a constantly flowing waste chute so high up above other facilities, even if they were kept separate; hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not thinking too much about dwarven plumbing at the moment, however.  As the water began to cascade over me, all I could absorb was the pure bliss of the cold, clean water flowing over me.  Though my back was sore, I reared up against the wall and faced the heavy, oncoming stream, enough that a humanoid would be bowled over if it were in the way.  I opened my mouth and drank, closing my eyes against the blasting water.  I shook my wings and the water soothed my burning muscles and my overheated body.  I knew not how long I'd stood under the flow, but eventually, I was interrupted...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the water rushing into my face, I perceived nothing amiss until a scaled hand grasped the end of my tail.  I whirled immediately, the water continuing to slam into my back, ready to rend and tear.  However, the person who had grabbed my tail simply giggled and teasingly let go; I let my jowls fall to cover my long fangs.  Before me was a lithe female, her scales a dark shade of violet with a very long face and slanted eyes.  She was staring at me with the water pouring down on me with a weird expression; almost hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not in a mood to be trifled with if this was some sort of game to her.  \"Hasn't anyone told you that it is rude to stare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hasn't anyone told you how good you look dripping wet?\" replied the strange dragoness smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thrown off balance by the remark which was not what I'd been expecting at all.  The 'compliment' made me feel immediately uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my moment of hesitation, the other female moved in closer, brushing her shoulder against mine; water splashed down her side.  \"The Lieutenant really took a liking to you today didn't she?\" she said, finishing with a titter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed in the other female's odor and despite the water dampening the atmosphere, I could smell her unusual musk.  It reminded me of how Lina's smell intensified when she talked about Ein'theil.  I was uncomfortable with her being so close, yet her mentioning of the vile, black winged devil who'd driven me like a beast of burden all day was enough to set me ranting.  \"Like?  <i>Like?!</i> She nearly drove me into the ground today!  I can barely move and I stink like a horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than a horse actually.  Here, let me scrub your back for you.\"  The violet dragon reared up and put her claws on my back as the water continued to rush unabatingly downward.  My back sagged a little under her weight and there was a low thrumming in her throat as she slid her claws over my wet scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved away, out of the stream and shook my wings.  I was breathing a little harder than I had been before.  \"Hey, what's with you?  I am perfectly capable of washing myself, thank you.\"  I held my wings protectively about myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seemed to disappoint the violet female with the slanting eyes.  She tilted her slightly and muttered under her breath, \"\u2026perhaps a bit too forward\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"  I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing sweet heart.  Anyway, I was meaning to tell you that getting picked on by Madam Shadia is actually a great honor.  She must really see something special in you to drive you so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted a small plume of smoke.  I noticed the way the water sparkled as it struck the violet female's scales and the way her wings bent under the weight of the water.  \"It seemed like she was just trying to get me to quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet just grinned, turning her snout to the side.  \"That's how it is with Madam Shadia, her 'favorites' all end up either quitting or advancing to the higher ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI coughed and spat into the water trough which was foaming with rapids from the torrent of the shower flowing into it.  \"Well I'm not quitting.  Not ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, beautiful.\" said the dragoness.  \"By the way, my name's Thereesa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja.\"  I said perfunctorily, still not sure what to make of this strange female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around.\" said Thereesa as she turned and began to walk away.  I watched her drip onto the slick stone floor and the way her tail swished side to side as she moved.  She turned her head before she exited the washroom and winked at me.  \"Don't hesitate to call on me if you ever need a hand with those hard to reach spots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed back under the waterfall and let the cold flow drown out my thoughts as I finished my shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I was starting to feel more than a little waterlogged, I headed back up the tunnels to the lair I shared with Lina and found the faerie dragon already in a light doze within. I asked her about Thereesa while we were both taking a moment to rest in our lair.  She told me that she was the sort who preferred the company of other females, and I felt like a complete imbecile.  Still, afterwords, I thought about her exotic, captivating eyes and her nicely formed face, her long black tongue\u2026  The look Lina gave me was horrendous in its shrewdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered and distracted myself by asking when our appointment with Lady Scabia was.</span></div></div>",

I nearly forgot!!\" squeaked Lina, \"We're supposed to be meeting her right now!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leapt out of my reclining position and immediately sped for the exit, Lina fluttering behind me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia was waiting for us in her lair. We both bowed before the large dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja. Lina. You are just in time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Auntie' Celianeithe?\" squeaked Lina. I assumed that she was talking about her own mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize Lina, but unfortunately, she was not able to make it to this briefing. She\u2019s been asked to interrogate the high value prisoners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust as I thought\u2026\u201d sighed Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, confused. \"Well, remember how Lorath asked me to help get information out of the prisoners? As it turns out, the rank and file mercs didn\u2019t have any specific information, yet the mercenary captains and the other more important managers of the warehouse had uncommonly powerful magical resistances that I wasn\u2019t able to penetrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026that means that some very powerful magic users managed to seal their minds, or something like that? So that they wouldn\u2019t be able to give out any information even if they were captured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Scabia, \u201cThat can only mean that what you and Lina uncovered yesterday is but the tip of a large, well-funded criminal network. Its possible that the same people that were discovered with the cargo may have also had much to do with the attack on New Alveri\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only gave this mission to you out of the expectation that it would be only a routine inspection, and I didn\u2019t anticipate that either of you would end up facing the perils that you ended up facing. However, I must commend you both for performing as well as you did considering the circumstances,\u201d she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas any news come about concerning Elandor\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d asked Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo far, he has remained silent\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean he has been captured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely. Were he in a position that he would be captured, he would have sent us a distress signal to let us know. His silence can only mean that he is simply going undercover again for an indefinite period of time,\u201d answered Lady Scabia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, it was our fault that forced him to go undercover in the first place,\u201d I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia shook her head. \u201cNo Darzhja. If you recall, I specifically told you that if on the off chance that the shipping company you were to investigate did contain stolen hatchlings, their safety was the first priority beyond all else. Elandor understood this, and indeed would have been appalled had you decided to save him instead of the infants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming this organization is larger than we imagined, that must surely mean there are other eggs under their control,\u201d I growled. The mere thought of it sent a wave of fury through my veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. The interrogation has managed to get leads on other warehouses, both in and outside the city limits, but the reasons for it still remain a mystery. Furthermore, since the attack, a number of fledglings have also been kidnapped as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events played out in my mind; the city exploding, Iskierka, Blaze. My eyes widened, \u201cWait a second!! Blaze!!\u201d I exclaimed, wings unfurling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d asked Scabia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was one of the fledglings I grew up with in the orphanage. He went missing during the night of the attack and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he could he have been kidnapped just like the eggs were?\u201d said Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was heading back to the orphanage when he was last seen. Blaze might be a reckless troublemaker, but he\u2019s far from helpless. If he was directly attacked, he would have fought with everything he had before allowing himself to get kidnapped, and hiding a young drake was different from hiding hatchlings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if these smugglers could manage to kidnap not only helpless little ones, but adolescents as well, that could only mean these people had to be extremely dangerous\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do anything we can to stop these people\u2026\u201d I snarled. Had she given me a mission right then and there, I was ready to take off immediately and fight. \u201cI know you are, but now that we have a better idea of the magnitude of this conspiracy, all the missions concerning these cases would be delegated for more experienced knights. You\u2019ll both still have to prove yourselves capable of taking on these tougher missions by completing your training as initiates as well as performing your daily duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled. Even so, I knew the reasoning behind it. I had barely been a Knight for little more than a couple of days now, and Lina was hardly longer than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience. If you demonstrate that you both continue to work hard, then you\u2019ll get your chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, we\u2019ll work harder than anyone else, so that we can get involved in stopping the smugglers again!!\u201d I answered. Lina nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last thing!!\u201d cried Scabia.  \u201cFor your involvement in this mission, the Nine have also seen it fit that you get rewarded properly also. You\u2019ll both receive fifty pounds worth of gemstones for completing your mission. In addition a couple of mothers have claimed their little ones, and wanted to thank you both for protecting them from the smugglers, and have also given you twenty pounds of gems each for your services. The gems have already been transferred to both of your accounts\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow!!\u201d I called out. Honestly, I hadn\u2019t even thought about the monetary reward, and I actually had been content if the only reward had been the satisfaction of doing my part as a Knight. Still, I had expanded my horde in a single mission, more than I previously had gathered in my entire life thus far. Obviously, this was but a drop in a bucket compared to how much the more experienced Knights made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lady Scabia!!\u201d screeched Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll expect nothing less from both of you\u2026\u201d she nodded. \u201cI will inform both of you when I need your services again. Until then, return to your daily tasks at hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina and I bowed respectfully and then left the premises. Now that the meeting was over, there was still plenty of daylight left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this may sound like a dumb question, but what are our daily duties?\u201d I asked Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for today, there is going to be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lina and I winged our way back over the green fields of the valley, I could not help but feel a renewed sense of determination, but also apprehension.  It seemed that my future as a Knight in training was spreading out before me.  I'd had a brief taste of what it meant to be a knight on my very first mission, and as terrifying as it had been, I longed for more action, to make a difference.  To be redirected to more common and mundane duties about the Temple, while more appropriate for my station, seemed a reduction, a waste of my potential.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much going on about the city, what with the missing eggs and fledglings.  With Blaze still not accounted for, the happenings were even more close to my heart.  How could I hope to concentrate on our current task Lady Scabia had given us?  I wanted to get out there and fight.  I said as much to Lina as we flew, the smaller dragon holding a spell to allow us to speak to each other over the rushing wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, you can't think about things like that.\" said Lina.  I could hear her plainly in my ear, though she flew comfortably in my wake behind me.  \"You have to remember that we're still just apprentice Knights.  We need to work our way up to handling situations as sensitive as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we've already proven that we can handle them!\"  I insisted.  \"There are lost eggs and hatchlings out there.  They're more important than the fact that we don't have a lot of experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina sighed raggedly.  \"I know how you feel, Darzhja.  Believe me I do, especially now.  But\u2026 but we can't just go out there and change the world.  We'll get ourselves or others killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina's voice was high-strung with emotion so despite the fact that I was still burning inside for missions grander than inspecting the female dorms, I decided to drop the issue.  I knew from our experience in the warehouse that although a capable magician, Lina was quite frightened and stressed out by even the prospect of open combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were almost at the landing, in fact Lina, in her preferred method of landing had already poofed herself down while I circled, dropping speed and flapping my wings rigorously for my landing, when something that she said rose back to my mind.  \"Lina, what did you mean earlier when you said that you cared, 'especially now.'\"  I asked, the cupping the air above the landing with my wings as I lowered myself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina tittered, the fleshy tendrils under her jaw waving in the breeze I was stirring.  She turned her head away girlishly and said, \"After the inspection.\"  I was not so ignorant at this point not to have my suspicions, but I kept them silent and moved into the common room, folding my massive wings against my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting the dorms was at once a high honor and an embaressement.  Most of these other females had been here much longer than Lina or I, so the fact that we were inspecting their living areas was testament to the honors we had won in the warehouse.  However, we were not honored in the eyes of our peers in the slightest.  The other girls gave us nasty looks as we poked about the decorative rocks and shelves for contraband or spoke of  the cleanliness or hygiene of the often unadorned caves - dragons did not have much need for furniture - as needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertain of the veteran apprentices, such as the venomous female I'd encountered this morning were particularly\u2026 well, venomous.  I was sliding my tail blade under a rock which served as something of a couch for Tsarra and her two lair mates in order to lift it when the spined female said, \"So how does it feel to be a hero already after just a few days here, Newbie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my teeth as I lifted the large rock.  I supposed that word of my mission was going to get around sooner rather than later, and linger especially in the ears of those who didn't care for a young new hotshot.  I said nothing and continued to look under the 'couch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said that you already lost your first rider.  How does that feel?  Knowing that you got an elder humanoid killed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled and let the stone fall with a crash.  A large crack ran across it so that it was nearly in twain; one of the other females who lived in the large chamber yelled.  I said, \"I suggest that you get your facts straight before accusing other people of things they didn't do.  Hearsay is unbecoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra's spines lifted just as I adjusted and loosened my stance for fighting.  I hadn't the slightest idea how to fight a venomer, but I supposed now was as good a time as any to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lina appeared between us, scattering dust over our snouts, my muscles relaxed almost involuntarily and Tsarra's spines smoothed against her scarlet hide.  She turned her head away.  \"You're not worth the effort, Newbie\" she snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina brushed against my head, leading me back out of the chamber.  \"Come on, there's nothing here.\" she said hurriedly.  I grunted and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach lair did not take long to inspect, but there were a lot of them.  In the webbed hallways in between each, I asked Lina about the interrogation process.  I was actually morbidly interested in whatever harsh methods of extracting information out of the miserable mercenaries had been used, but I was disappointed when I heard that Lina mostly just sat in a small room, fanning her wings while another Knight, usually a human or an elf, asked them questions.  I also tried to pry out the secret Lina was keeping from me, but without much luck in that field either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, most of the lairs were empty, just as Lina's and mine was - although, considering my size there was not a whole lot of room for anything else besides me and Lina - although some were richly decorated.  I shuddered a little when I met with Thereesa again.  She winked at me and licked her chops with that black tongue of hers.  She actually had a small private room as it turned out that Thereesa was expected to graduate to full Knight quite soon.  The room itself was dazzling to the eyes, covered as it was with glowing purple runes of a unique and stylistic design.  \"My own calligraphy.\" commented the violet dragoness.  So it seemed that Thereesa was a skilled magic user as well.  I searched only perfunctorily and left with as few words as I could, my hearts pounding.  Lina, infuriatingly lingered and had a long conversation with her as I dawdled in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she definitely has the hots for you, Darzhja.  She said she likes big girls.\" laughed Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"  I said, and the smaller dragon let the matter drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough there were many caves which could have used sometimes significant cleaning, there was only one which contained any contraban.  The silver dragoness with the bulging waistline had stuffed what looked like half a cow into a crease in the wall and then covered it with a large boulder.  Her name was Heliana as Lina informed me and she was shaking with fear when I moved the the large stone, revealing the hidden meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heliana, what is this?\"  I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Oh no, you weren't supposed to see that...\" she said dejectedly, her voice full of embarrassment.  \"I-I just get hungry at night is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina fluttered up, \"Please tell me this is the other half of your daily ration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she refused to make eye contact made it clear that this cow was most definitely in addition to her regular ration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure how to handle the situation, the fat silver female seemed embarrassed and repentant.  I didn't know if I had the heart to turn her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina spoke again.  \"Heliana... you've put on fifteen stone since I was invited to the Temple.  Tell me, are you...  you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA worried look crossed her face.  She admitted that...</span></div></div>",

It did not come as a surprise when she said this, but nevertheless I was now in a position that I did not want to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it happen?\" squeaked Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana curved her gaze away, holding her belly as she sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...did something so stupid. I was so happy that I'd passed the trials, that I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who was it that you...you know...\" I cried, keeping my head next to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't want to talk about it...\" she stammered with a small voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he force you?\" I snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head forcefully. \"He's a good dragon. He'll...be shocked, but he'll...understand\" she cried. By the ancestors I truly hoped so. Having never known my own parents, the notion that any parent would leave their little ones rankled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is his...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina placed a tiny wing over my mouth, and I instantly shut my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that this would happen sooner or later,\" she sighed, seeming resigned to her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Heliana, I really am,\" cried Lina, \"But...since you're pregnant, by regulation we're going to have to report you to the Lieutenant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could already imagine just how horrifying that would be for Heliana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina, Darzhja,\" cried Heliana, \"Don't blame yourselves. All it means is that...I'll just have to wait a while until I can resume my training!!\" she finished, trying to force a grin. I wished I could say something to make her feel better, but I couldn't say anything. The only thing we could do was accompany her and as she plead her case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked through the halls, there was a forlorn feeling that pervaded the hallway. A few of the dragonesses peeked outside, giving Heliana sympathetic looks. This may very well be the final time they ever saw her, at least as an apprentice Knight, and as we passed by, they all wished her good luck, even that whore Tsarra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lieutenant had a lair closeby the dorms. Decorating her wall, were a number of metallic contraptions designed to inflict the most painful torture imaginable, while the rest of her hallway was a dull, gray color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report...\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the dorms have been properly inspected, however there is a matter we wish to bring to your attention.\" I cried, trying to keep my wits about me. \"We found an extra ration of meat stashed away in Heliana's lair...\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadia's eyes narrowed, as they switched toward Heliana, then toward her bulging belly. She looked as if she wanted to die right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're preganant aren't you?\" hissed Shadia. Yet her voice lacked the usual chilling edge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Madam...\" she answered. I was surprised at the amount of poise she showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand the consequences do you Initiate?\" sighed Shadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja, Lina,\" growled Shadia, \"Please leave my chamber now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lieutenant!!\" I wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This matter is no longer your concern. I shall deal with this matter personally!! Rest assured, all responsible parties will be held accountable. Now, back to your lair you two!!\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Madam...\" Lina and I responded glumly. We left the room back to our chamber, in a dour mood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid myself upon my belly. \"I wish we could have done more to help her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen to her now?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...won't be able to undergo her training program throughout the duration of her pregnancy. Whoever the father is will be forced to pay for the cost of raising them. Best case scenario is that he agrees to marry her, but if not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painful to imagine what the worst case might be. In the brief time I had known her, Heliana had been a kind dragoness, putting others before herself. Still, even with the best case scenario, it was numbing to know that her dream of Knighthood would be cut short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, that night, I prayed for her. Prayed that all would be well and that she would one day be able to become a Knight again. </span></div></div>",

No!  No, I'm not\u2026 how could\u2026\"  She tossed her head to the side, affronted and embarrassed, \"I mean, I've put on some weight since coming here\u2026\"  She ran a long set of claws down her bowed out torso.  \"But it's so stressful being in training!  You know that.  So\u2026 so I\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat to make yourself feel better.\"  Lina provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana nodded sadly, her lovely white wings falling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart went out to the new recruit, it really did, since Heliana was one of the few who had shown me kindness since coming here.  But the half carcass in the corner of the cave represented a very serious crime, and from the looks of the silver's waistline, this was far from the first time she'd stolen extra food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat then, and I could not help but wince a little as I observed her big tummy make contact with the ground.  Heliana was certainly not the sort of shape one imagined when thinking of a Holy Knight.  She pleaded with me and Lina, \"Please, isn't there anything you can do for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed roughly.  \"Heliana, we're going to have to take this in\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please!  They'll kick me out of the knights for sure!  Lieutenant Shadia always give me such dirty looks.  She's got it out for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted, \"I think she's got it out for everyone, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina, floating on the air, sidled up to the large silver female.  She said, \"I know this is embarrassing for you, but maybe you can explain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody understands what it's like.\"  Heliana blurted then.  \"My father's been trying to get into the knights for 300 years.  When he tried to sign up, they said that they were only taking young dragons.  He told me that joining the Knights was the best thing in the world for me.  But it isn't!  They drive me like an ox and everyone's so much prettier and thinner\u2026\"  Her voice was cracking and a few warm tears like crystals slide down her cheeks.  \"I feel better when I'm eating....  It makes it bearable for one more day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed.  Being a Knight was the one thing that had driven me almost since I'd known what a Knight was.  However, in the few days I'd been here, my definition of a Holy Knight had been reshaped utterly.  I had chosen a hard path, my reward for chasing an impossible dream.  I could not fathom quitting myself, but I now understood that being a Knight was not for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was not Lina's nor my place to ask that question.  Not here, not now.  I stepped forward and embraced the silver dragoness with my wings.  I held her for a few moments and she stopped sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to report you for having contraband in your room.\"  I said.  \"But maybe we can look over the fact that you stole the cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina piped up.  \"If we get your punishment issued and served tomorrow, then there probably won't be any time for anyone to double check the husbandry mandates.  The numbers are always a little short anyhow.\"  she finished with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana grinned, but didn't laugh.  \"Thank you two so much.  I really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled toothily and walked over to the carcass.  \"Just make sure that you keep your appetite under control from here on out.\"  I said and took the half-cow between my jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina said \"And maybe flying the morning drills won't be so hard if you manage to drop a little weight.\" Heliana snorted sardonically and the faerie dragon shrugged.  \"Well\u2026 cleaning up this blood couldn't hurt for starters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana sighed, looking conflicted and in deep thought.  As I carried away the stolen cow, I wondered if she would stay and stick it through or if I would have to say farewell to one of the few dragonesses around here who valued my company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was forced to file my report under the watchful glare of Lieutenant Shadia who led the female dorms.  A dragon cult scribe took down my words as I dictated; humans proved to be quite capable in regard for paperwork - dragon sized vellums and writing skins would take up many times the space of papers and parchments.  Shadia snorted when I reported Heliana's offense.  \"I knew that fatass was hiding food somewhere.  We have little need for anyone to be testing the foundations of our caves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that was unfair, considering that a Sky-swallower was still much heavier than Heliana could ever be.  But I said nothing to that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, where did she get the carcass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer onyx eyes seemed to peer into my soul, scorching it with its iciness.  Lina saved me, saying, \"It was the other half of her ration, Lady Shadia.  Heliana said that she gets hungry at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deathwing scowled and was silent.  Then she said, \"Then that flying hippo should eat the whole thing in the evening as intended.  The caves are dirty enough without drakka butchering their kills on the stone.\"  Shadia snorted some smoke and became silent.  After a few moments, we realized that we were dismissed.  However, I could almost feel her eyes burning my back as I retreated hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid down on my scaled stomach once we were back in our own lair.  I was worn to the bone so that I did not even mind Lina's weight as she settled atop me.  However, I wished that it was as convenient for me to find a soft resting place.  Curling my tail in the same direction as my head in the oval shaped space, I said, \"Well, the inspection is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina already started laughing, her claws dug into my hide with her excitement.  \"It is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was milking it for all it was worth.  \"Well\u2026?\"  I was obliged to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina, unable to contain her secret any longer burst out...</span></div></div>",

I wasn't sure whether I should congratulate her or be alarmed. I suppose that I just found it rather strange to rationalize a dragoness the size of a hatchling was herself pregnant. Despite the fact she'd had a betrothed, I was also a bit shocked she'd had her first long before I ever would. Lina had always been going on about how she and Ein'theil were going to make little ones together, but I'd always assumed that they would at least wait until they'd both become full-fledged Knights. Apparently I was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet...if you're pregnant what happens when the Knights find out? What if they decide to kick you out or something?\" I cried, deeply concerned. It would be horrible if they expelled her from the Knighthood because of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina hummed, not the least bit concerned. \"Actually, that was part of the reason why I ended up becoming a Knight...\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" I called out, eyes bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how I told you how Faerie Dragons are rare? Before the Knights took over, my kind used to be hunted by rogue magicians who wanted to increase their own power, along with loggers who used to cut down our meadows, so much so we were almost wiped out. Even after the Knights took over, what remained of my kind scattered and went into hiding in order to protect the rest of us. My egg hatched in my own little meadow, and lived with all the Sprites and the little magical creatures. I loved it there, but it was also very lonely. Then, Auntie Celianthe came to the meadow...I'd never seen another Faerie Dragon before!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's your mentor isn't she?\" I commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She told me about what became of my kind, and that through the Knights they would be able to restore the Fairie Dragon Clans to what they were before.

Had a recruiter made the exact same offer to me, I would have been immediately suspicious, and I was flabbergasted that Lina could be so trusting. I supposed it was one of those peculiarities about Faerie Dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmmm... They'd also train me how to use my abilities, but what really sold me was that for so long, I feared that I'd never get to meet another male of my kind, that I'd never get to have babies. So when the day came that I met Ein'theil... it was love at first sight!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a squeal. I tried to imagine what it was like had I never met another bronze drake before, and vice-versa. When seen from that perspective, it was little wonder why Lina had taken to Ein'theil right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I then gazed about the chamber, making sure nobody was eavesdropping, \"So...w-when... um...exactly did it happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina blushed, swishing her tail back and forth, \"Remember the morning? Before our first mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered Lina pointing him out and then excitedly fluttering over to that ledge where her mate was, and had then watched them start to roll around in the bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that's what she'd been doing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so happy that I had a lairmate that I told Ein'theil about it, and he was so happy for me, and I happened to be in season, so then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a high pitched moan as she reclined on her back, \"Oh, it was so wonderful Darzhja!! To come together with him like that, and feel him pour his sweet nectar into me, and then feel the life bloom within me... And...and... I'm going to be a momma now!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors its all so overwhelming!! Knowing that there's going to be babies depending on me to care for them!!\" she gasped. It seemed that only now did she appreciate the enormity of the task that now laid before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't doubt yourself for an instant Lina. I know what a wonderful dragoness you truly are. The little ones will be truly blessed to have you as their mother,\" I assured her, curving my head next to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina heaved, tears streaming out of her eyelids, before pressing herself against me. \"Oh Darzhja, you have no idea what this means to me. Thank you. Thank you. I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords couldn't possibly describe that shared feeling I felt for Lina. I was just so happy, content, that I could be part of a significant moment in a dragonesses lifetime, more so because it was a dear friend. If I ever found that significant other, I wondered if I would also be this elated if I found out I had little ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she let out a heave, seeming to calm down, \"Thanks Darzhja, I feel a lot better about things now, now that I got this off my chest. I won't be laying for quite a while, so we'll still have lots and lots of fun together!!\" she squeaked. My jaw dropped and I let out a shallow laugh, knowing full well what Lina's version of fun meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes took that mischivous glow again. \"So Darzhja, Thereesa was telling me just how comely you looked in the baths...\" she tittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're implying that I roll that way, you're wrong...\" I snorted, my eyes narrowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she giggled, her eyes glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? O-of course I'm sure!!\" I retorted, yet there was a brief uneasiness and hesitation. That opening was all she needed to egg me further on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina leaned her head closer, \"Oh come on...wouldn't you be the least bit curious to see what it might be like with another female?\" she murmured. To my chagrin, I couldn't help but imagine such naughty thoughts. I remembered all those glowing runes that decorated the dragoness' room; perhaps the magic that glowed from them had something to do with her odd orientation? Maybe if I allowed Thereesa to slake this lust of hers, she would calm down and get over me, instead of continuing to pester me about it... In fact, maybe it might be fun just to try it out once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of my eye, I noticed the mischievous Faerie Dragoness clinging onto my neck, extending her tongue and licking the underside of my jaw in a very lascivious manner. My wings unfurled in alarm, and she purred back hungrily, tail swishing from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina!!\" I snapped, lashing my claw at her as I rose to my feet. The faerie dragoness giggled madly as she poofed out of my reach, dancing about the dorm.  Lina was back to her usual tricks, knowing exactly how to manipulate my fantasies. For such a tiny, happy go lucky dragoness, she could be surprisingly perverted when she set her mind to be. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but smile. I wouldn't trade her for anyone else in the world. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I tried to keep my thoughts off of any potential encounters with Thereesa. Yet the more I tried to banish these thoughts, the more they would return, more potent than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what Lina? Maybe I have you to blame for this, but I can\u2019t help but be curious now,\u201d I admitted, surprising myself at how casual I sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I was thinking was that I should keep my mind open to new things, even if they are rather strange. Who knows? It might be interesting to try once\u2026\u201d I added. Lina started giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a yawn. \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019ll think about it. Its getting rather late anyhow, so we should get some sleep\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina hummed in agreement. \u201cSweet dreams Darzhja\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Lina\u2026\u201d I yawned. I curled up into a \u2018C\u2019, Lina taking her customary spot atop me, before I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the following morning, I woke up knowing for the first time as a knight what I could expect and what my routines were. I raced down the corridor with Lina. Tsarra gave me her customary bitchy taunting. Thereesa not so accidentally rubbed against me and giggled. Then I took my place on the training grounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecruits!! Given the increased troubles that have been going on in the city, I have deemed it fit to intensify your training regimen accordingly!!\u201d hissed Shadia. Part of me was thrilled because it would get me into the action sooner, but on the other claw, it meant spending more time with the hated Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, instead of only training in the morning, all Apprentice Knights will undergo an additional three hour training session during the afternoon, unless otherwise notified by your mentors. If you think I\u2019ve been harsh so far\u2026trust me, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still expect you to perform your other daily duties without fail, and those who shirk their duties will suffer accordingly!!\u201d she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Shadia had not been kidding when she said she would intensify our training. Now, every day was like that horrible first day of training when Shadia had taken it upon herself to torment me. One day was dedicated solely to strength and conditioning. The day after that, she had us practice various maneuvers in flight. Then, there was a day at the obstacle course, navigating through treacherous terrain. Another day was dedicated toward endurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, sparring session was something that I looked forward to, and in that aspect I could say without false modesty that I excelled above all the other initiates. I was too strong for the medium sized dragons, too skilled for those that were my size, and too fast and agile for the Sky-Swallowers. While the initiate Knights were all proficient with standard defense techniques, having had these drilled while they were adolescents, what separated me from the others was my array of unconventional dueling techniques that I\u2019d learned working for Mr. Marcus in his small fighting ring in the market district. For instance, I would kick up a clod of dirt with my wing at my opponent, which would distract and disorient my opponent enough for me to close in and pin him or her. Or, similar as I had with my battle with Kaj, I would hook my tailbone around that of my opponent, and then maneuver myself to a favorable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took particular satisfaction in beating up that vile, poisonous whore Tsarra. Had she actually been allowed to use her poison, it would have been far more dangerous, yet as it turned out her raw fighting technique was frankly inadequate. She was the one who always spread those poisonous rumors about me, and the fact that her parents happened to be influential Knights seemed to give her the right to look down on everybody. While she and many of those in her clique still despised me, I did gain quite a bit of grudging respect, if only I because I was able to always put them in their place during sparring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa was pretty much fawning over me after these fights, and seemed to grow more and more determined to... cuddle up with me. I hadn\u2019t told her I was curious on taking up on her offer, however, she seemed to be able to sense it. She would always know exactly when to give me those subtle little winks, or lick her chops, for the express purpose that I would think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I had quite a bit I needed to improve upon. Taking note that I might have started to grow a bit cocky, Lieutenant Doom-and-Gloom had taken it upon herself to fight me in the ring. She knocked me out in exactly three moves, and then for the rest of that training session decided to torment me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yet out of all the recruits, poor Helenia had the roughest time with Shadia. Ever since that day I did inspection, she truly was trying her hardest. However, she remained by far the worst out of all the initiates, and Lieutenant Shadia personally made sure to make her miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you telling me that you\u2019re already tired you fat bitch?\u201d she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d stammered Heliana\u2019s, absolutely exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get up!! If you have a shred of self-pride, get up you worthless piece of shit!!\u201d screamed Shadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not a piece of shit Lieutenant!!\u201d she wailed, tears streaming out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadia seemed to pull back for a moment, and I nearly thought she was about to take sympathy for the overweight silver dragoness. Yet she only drove the wound in deeper when she spat back, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not a piece of shit. You\u2019re a crying, worthless lard of fat who won\u2019t improve no matter how much I push you. Why am I wasting my time getting you in shape? You\u2019re only going to pig out like you always do!! Get out of my training session!! Go ahead and eat until you\u2019re a ball!! See if I care!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Helenia laid there limply on the obstacle course crying her eyes out. Apparently, Shadia had known of Heliana\u2019s stealing habit the entire time, and instead of simply turning her in, decided to break her spiritually instead, so that she would up on her own accord out of shame. I truly began to wonder if she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. She was a kind natured dragoness, and didn\u2019t take well to harshness. Personally, I had to reluctantly admit that Heliana wasn\u2019t Holy Knight material, yet at the same time I didn\u2019t want her to give up either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I still wondered\u2026 After that training session, and a long cold shower (in which Thereesa had all but waited for me to arrive and watched the whole while) I decided to head toward Heliana\u2019s chamber while it was unoccupied. I lifted up the boulder she had used to hide that contraband food. To my dismay, I discovered that indeed she had hidden a cow torso within, and I shook my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Heliana came into the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!! What are you doing in my\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw the food I had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were stealing food again weren\u2019t you Heliana?\u201d I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even try to deny it this time. Instead, all she did was give me that pitiful look of hers. Indeed, I was tempted to lash out at her at this act, like Shadia would, but I feared that if I did, it may well have broken her entire psyche. I took a deep breath, and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She'd given me little reason to be lenient with her or to put my neck out on the line for her.  The fact that she continued to steal food and overeat despite the clearly obvious fact that it was doing her and her body no good should have been enough to tell me that she was not cut out to be a Holy Knight.  But there was something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was in her eyes, the way they were filled with pain and hopelessness, the same hopelessness I'd felt when I was tackling an armored and far more skilled Fangorn with my bare teeth and claws; a hopelessness that had been intensified when I'd awoken in chains with him staring down triumphant at me with his hungry eyes.  Or perhaps it had more to do with the fact that she was still here.  For the past week, Shadia had been driving us like a demon, driving me and Heliana the hardest of all.  Me because I was perhaps the most talented physically of the new recruits - or so Lina kept telling me - Heliana because she was the least.  But maybe it was just because Heliana was a good dragoness and by this point, she'd become my friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver was sitting before me, her big tummy resting on the stone floor, white skin showing between the scales all across her midsection like an engorged snake's.  Her forelegs were shaking, perhaps out of fear, but more probably because she was exhausted and worn to the bone.  \"Heliana, this has to stop, today.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried!  I've tried quitting, but\u2026 but I can't.  It's been worse than ever.  I can barely move at night, I can't sleep, and I'm so hungry\u2026\"  She took a deep shuddering breath and then wailed, \"I'm useless aren't I?  It's all true, what Shadia says about me.  I'm heavier than I've ever been in my life!  I'm a useless pile of stinking dung!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to sob, I stepped forward and batted the back of her head with my wing.  She squeaked like a much smaller dragoness.  \"Cut that out!\"  I demanded.  \"You are not useless.  You are a beautiful young dragoness.  I'm going to show that to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're what?\"  she asked timidly, and looked up at me with her light colored, watery eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to help you see the kind of dragon you can be.\"  I said, hardly believing the words that were coming out of my mouth.  I had no idea if I could help her.  Heliana was very, <i>very</i> out of shape, but it was plain that she needed <i>somebody's</i> help or she wasn't going to make it.  \"I want you to start meeting with me just before and after feeding.\"  Heliana swallowed.  \"No more stealing.\"  I intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026\"  her eyes darted about, but finally settled back on me, rising to meet my amber eyes.  \"I won't steal anymore.  I promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned down at her and rose.  Heliana rose as well, the scales rasping softly as they rubbed the insides of her thighs.  \"Then lets go and bury this cow before it gets too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made Heliana carry it out of the cave.  I noticed the way she had to concentrate on walking and holding the dead beast, what with her teeth puncturing its soft, flabby hide and making it bleed on her tongue.  She didn't dare to take a single bite with me watching, so she had to resist.  That was good.  As we exited to the landing, I saw out of the corner of my eye violet scales reflecting the torch light which illuminated the common area.  Thereesa watched us go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe buried the cow in a remote area of the valley which was well forested and peaceful.  The trees around us were ancient and large, certainly aided by elf-magic if not truly elf-born trees themselves.  I patted down the earth with the flat side of my tail blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI broke the silence which surrounded us when we had finished moving the earth.  \"Heliana, why do you want to be a Knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  she asked, startled.  I glared at her softly until she sighed and said, \"I came because my father wanted me to come.  They wouldn't take a middle aged dragon like him, so I guess I was the next best thing to becoming a Knight himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the only reason you're here, then you should go home.\"  I said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana hissed, \"Darzhja!\"  The trees seemed to whisper as a breeze flowed over the crowns above our heads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to find a reason to be here for yourself.  You can't do this just so that your father will be happier.  It's wrong of him anyway to live vicariously through you.\"  I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claws shifted, tearing the turf under her weight.  She turned her head to the side.  \"I do want to be a Knight\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  I prodded.  \"And don't tell me just because it's a good career with a good wage.  You can make money in other places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana opened and closed her mouth.  She looked at the ground, her eyes distant.  I wondered if she was recalling her Harrowing under the immortal, penetrating gaze of the Chronicler.  I hoped she would not break her oath not to mention him.  She swallowed again and spoke with a dry voice.  \"It's something inside of me that's always been there.  Ever since I first looked up to the soaring mountain of the Temple.  I want to do good, I want to help people.  Maybe if there were more Knights, then my sister wouldn't have lost her husband in the attack\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inclined my head.  There probably wasn't a dragon here who had not been affected by the sudden, devastating attack on New Alveri.  Heliana was no exception.  Extending my neck, I rested it against the silver's in a warm embrace.  \"I understand.\"  I said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back, Heliana asked, \"How are you going to help me, Darzhja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cold hard truth, I had no idea.  I was not a fitness trainer.  And we both got plenty of exercise as it was during the day.  I did not know where to start in helping to get Heliana's waistline under her control.  So I said,  \"Anyway that I can.\"  Then, grinning foolishly, I slapped her on the back and lifted myself into the air.  \"I bet you can't catch me!\" I shouted.  Heliana smirked and came up after me.  The trees shook with our passage and were still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veins in my wings were livid when we came back to the dorms quite late.  The torches were all extinguished and I knew that we would both have a hard day tomorrow.  It was fine though.  Dragons could operate on little to no sleep for limited periods of time\u2026 we just had to make up for it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana panted happily.  I'd pushed her, I knew, but it wasn't the same as when Shadia demeaned her and wore her down body and spirit.  In fact, Heliana seemed in as good a spirit as the first time I met her.  \"Good night, Darzhja.\"  she whispered to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow.\"  I whispered back, just a little sharply so she knew I was expecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe separated then.  As I was walking back to my lair, full of thoughts of Lina and if she were wondering where I'd been...</span></div></div>",

She didn't seem to mind, simply smoothing the scales on her shoulder where I'd bumped her with a smooth, almost sensual stroke.  \"That's really nice.\"  she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  I asked.  I was indeed tired and wasn't thinking straight.  I breathed in her odor, how full of feminine musk it was.  I wanted to get away.  I'd lost enough sleep as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Thereesa had boldly extended a wing, being more forward with me tonight than she was usually with her off-hand comments and knowing looks.  \"You know what.  That's really kind, how you are helping Heliana.  Nobody else will touch her, they know that the Black Bitch has got it out for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted, \"She's got it out for me too\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa harumphed, \"Don't make this about yourself, Darzhja.\"  That closed my snout.  She looked at me deeply, studying me, as if there was something new in my eyes that she did not understand.  \"Why are you helping her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not ridiculing me, I knew that straight away.  It was a pure, honest question.  I could only give my pure honest answer, \"Because she's my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa grinned, showing her serrated teeth.  Her eyes seemed heavy with knowing, understanding, perhaps more deeply than I understood myself.  I was suddenly a little afraid.  Thereesa was a master of not only magic, but she held her own in the ring.  I'd beaten her, as I had the rest, but her fighting style was unique, fast, adaptable, though there had been something missing; I could tell during our spar.  I bet it was because she'd been barred her magic.  I wondered if I would even stand a chance if it was a no-rules fight.  She was twice my age as well and this combined made her suddenly intimidating despite the fact that I was taller than her by a head and longer by a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lina's not in your lair.\" she said suddenly.  \"She decided she needed to share the good news with her betrothed earlier and she has not returned.  I assume they have both found some little hallow somewhere to share the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a wide grin on Thereesa's long, narrow face, though her news deflated me somewhat as well as making me grin uncomfortably.  I was looking up the dark, empty hallway when she hit me with the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdrew her wing first, no longer barring my way forward.  \"You are welcome to share my lair with me tonight, if you like, Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air hissed between my teeth with my sharp intake of breath.  There was no one waiting for me in the lair, but then I'd just planned on going straight to sleep.  The violet dragon's smell called to me in an interesting, homely manner that was not at all like a male's.  Like with like, though I knew that Thereesa had a much different and deeper way of expressing passion that I had ever experienced before.  Still the curiosity tore at me, and I did like the set of her eyes, that black tongue of hers was a conundrum.  The threat of experience hung over my neck like a blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I knew for sure was that if I went with her, there would be little sleep for me this night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd grown used to living in near constant poverty, every garnet that I gathered was needed to procure enough food to keep me healthy or else sent to my tiny hoard that I built bit by grueling bit.  There was always something that needed doing.  And also, there was always Lady Ramoth there looking out for us, but also disciplining us with sometimes a heavy claw; although never unfairly.  There had been no sexual overtones to my life previously; there'd been no time for it.  Of course, as a young dragoness, I could not escape the passing glances, the comments and requests of the opposite gender, but Lady Ramoth had instilled in me\u2026 well, some might call it prudeness, but she called it 'respectability.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of what I was about to do, what I was going to welcome into my life stunned me as if walking into a brick wall as I was treading up the sloping, narrow tunnel.  I almost turned back, but I looked forward again and saw Thereesa's whip-like tail, unadorned with a weapon at the end, but rather a single fin which could be opened and closed at will.  Her haunches sauntered with an easy grace as she walked up ahead of me and I could not bring myself to turn away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was like one dying of thirst, except it was a thirst for I knew not what, nor that I even had this thirst in me until so recently.  It was born when Thereesa caught me in the showers\u2026 had rubbed her claws on my back so briefly.  No.  It was before then, born with those soft, concerned eyes and kind words from a blue scaled, handsome face concealed by a silver helmet.  Or maybe even before that?  In hot, angry words and intense, burning eyes in a bronze scaled face like my own, but not at all like mine.  I wondered at the fact that their faces even came to me, and I recalled their scorching, masculine scents even as I was entering into a dorm where I doubted any male of my species had ever set foot or ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing lavender runes on the walls of the vaguely round chamber seemed to intensified from what I remembered; did they anticipate what was to come?  It didn't matter if I outweighed Thereesa by 50 stone, I felt small and unsure as I walked in.  I breathed and the very atmosphere was different, charged by magic, perhaps.  In the incandescence, I felt transported to another realm, and perhaps I was.  Thereesa certainly seemed alien enough at times.  She grinned at me and I noted her numerous small, sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you decided to come.\"  said the violet dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head slightly aside and said guardedly, \"I haven't yet decided on anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was too clever by half and could tell that I wasn't going anywhere.  Not until I <i>knew.</i>  Knew for sure.  She stretched her wing and laid it against my flank while simultaneously touching my claw with her own.  \"It's alright.  Just relax.  This is a good place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd surprisingly, I did relax.  The light from the many runes decorating the walls and ceiling cast a dim glow which was not overpowering, but revealed every contour of the room and its occupants to my sensitive eyes.  I was still weary for my day's training and flying and romping about with Heliana afterwards.  Her wing against my side was warm and it felt nice.  I relaxed into it, letting myself become limp and I sighed and closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Thereesa's chin against my shoulders, her neck against mine.  She was quite warm and her scent was intense with that exotic flare which was uniquely hers.  I heard her breath and knew that she was savoring my scent as well.  But thereesa's scent, though interesting, was so mild.  It was not hot and rank like a male's, almost leaping into my nose as they would leap upon me given half a chance; or at least as Lady Ramoth would have put it.  It did not electrify me the way that Lorath's - or Fangorn's, I had to admit to myself - did.  But I did so like the care and gentleness with which Thereesa rubbed her scales against my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings around me, so that the light from the runes illuminated the veins in the leather walls surrounding me, I sat on my haunches as Thereesa ran the backside of her foreclaw down my chest.  The knuckles clicked as they past each row of the shaggy, bronze scale mail that I wore at all times.  She drew her head back and looked at me, her claw still moving down, down.  \"Do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes drifted down from her long face, took in the shape of her shoulders and her shallow chest, her trim waist below and her flat tummy.  I thought I did, but then I thought that I was making myself like it.  \"I don't know\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa licked her chops with that black tongue of hers and my hearts rose in pitch for a few moments.  Her wings folded from around me and the small cave was revealed again.  \"There's no need to hurry.\"  she said and got to her feet.  She walked a few paces to a worn looking corner of the floor.  She padded a bit, turned around once and laid down upon the stone.  \"Let's just talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her lead and reclined on the floor opposite her.  At the opposite end of the room, Thereesa wrapped her elegant tail around mine which at the moment felt heavy, clumsy and only good for smashing things.  \"Anything you'd like to know?\"  she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a million things that I wanted to know, but they were not the things that Thereesa would be able to answer.  How could one know another's heart when one did not know it herself?  So I looked about the walls.  I was far from a scholar, but I could tell one rune apart from another and could see where one string of characters began and another ended.  There was on character which seemed to start the lines of almost all the strings which wrapped around the walls.  \"There,\"  I said, indicating a rune with my claw, \"What does that one mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa grinned at me with happy surprise.  \"Ah, I hoped you would notice that one.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What is it?\"  I asked while I stretched my weary legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, 'Who is it.'  That symbol represents Paxi'Andrianth, First Mother, Mother of Wisdom and of Patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could utter was, \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa grinned and looked away, to the walls covered in glowing writing.  \"I'm not surprised you haven't heard of her.  Most people either pray to Gryakrond or else the Ancestors as a collective.\"  She pointed her snout at me, dipped low and looked at me with large eyes, \"She was Gryakrond's first mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, like most any other dragon who was aware of our cultural origins was aware that Gyrakrond, or the First Dragon, lived in a primordial time beyond reckoning when there were no other mortal races, not even the ancient elves.  There are multiple origin myths, but everyone agreed that he was a being of terrible wrath and power.  He was the embodiment of aggression, lust, pride and invincibility.  He took a harem of wives in his time, claims ranging from a dozen to a thousand females, all shaped or sired by himself; the fact that our patron god essentially raped his own daughters and ate his sons was fairly good evidence that our stories were handed down faithfully from much darker times.  But I'd never known any names given to the few first females he was said to have shaped from air, earth, water and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fact that they <i>would</i> have had to had names did make sense, although what Thereesa was saying was making me feel uncomfortable in a spiritual sense.  I'd just had my faith in the Ancestors reawakened after having lain dormant in the back of my mind for most of my life.  Now I felt as if I were on the verge of heresy.  \"I-I didn't know.\"  I said a little shakily.  \"But why is her name on your walls?  Is it part of your magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa nodded her head solemnly.  \"In these written spells, her name is evoked as a source of power.  Her will helps guide the energies that I create, and if I have her blessing, perhaps she adds some of her energies as well.  She gives shape to the spells that I write in the Unseen World beyond what I could do by myself.  Wizards often do the same with a familiar, but an ancestor spirit is a much more potent ally and she is wise enough to guide me and correct me, instead of just blindly following direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was obviously more to magic than I'd ever dreamed of.  I didn't understand a lot of what threes was talking about, especially with 'energies' and 'guidance and shaping.'  And I still didn't grasp the central idea.  \"Why?\"  I asked, \"Why do you call on a specific ancestor?  Wouldn't the ancestors as a whole be even more powerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh certainly.  By far.\"  said Thereesa with perfect ease.  \"The Ancestors as a whole are just as powerful, or even more so than any of the other major gods in and outside New Alveri, subsiding as they do on dragons' collected faith as well as the faith of the dragon cult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn up a palm, \"Then why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why take only one.\"  said the violet dragoness, nodding her head as if asked this same question before.  \"I'll admit, it's unorthodox.  But the thing you have to realize is that the Ancestors, although they have your wellbeing in mind, is only a generalized well wishing.  They are interested in the wellbeing of <i>dragonkind</i> not necessarily the wellbeing of a specific dragon.  This is because their consciousness is composed of so many, many dragons of all types and temperaments that they are neutral in almost every respect.  A single, specific ancestor, you'd probably have more luck dealing with, and I think that I have so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost gasped, hearing Thereesa speak so frankly about the Ancestors.  She hadn't said anything really negative, but after a lifetime of knowing only praise for the wisdom and guidance of the Ancestors, what she was saying now really did sound almost like heresy.  The first thing out of my mouth, however was, \"Then why not call upon Gyrakrond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa tittered as if the answer was obvious.  Then she said, stretched her paw out against the ground towards me.  \"Oh, don't get me wrong, I have called upon him before in the past.  But he's so\u2026  so\u2026 explosive.  And I mean that literally, he once made a rune circle of mine explode.  He's also very dominating and tends to overwhelm my own energy and take over the spell himself.\"  She shook her head, \"I just don't think our spirits are very compatible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all so overwhelming.  Before I'd walked into her lair, I'd no idea that the Ancestors I'd worshipped could be tied directly into the working of magic.  Lina didn't seem to call on anyone to work her skills nor had I seen any magician call upon gods when they called upon anything at all.  Perhaps it was because this was magic in the written form, the more disciplined organized school of magic.  But I had no way of knowing for sure, and I didn't have the energy to puzzle it out right now.  In fact, I hardly had the energy to feel more than mild shock at Thereesa's unusual style of magic and I did not want to get into an argument with her.  Sources of magic aside, I asked, \"So what sorts of things can you do with your spells, Thereesa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet female fluttered her wings a little where they rested folded against her back.  \"Oh, many of the usual things you'd expect from a humanoid magician.  I can store things here on a rune and summon them to me anywhere else.  I can change the shape and nature of objects - that's called transfiguration, by the way.  Runes are particularly good at defining boundaries and creating order.  Keeping things in, keeping things out, separating things, that sort of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my tail was becoming increasingly occupied with thereesa's, I gestured with a claw to the walls.  \"And these here?  Do they protect you against spirits or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no.\" said Thereesa.  She raise a wing and touched the bony spur to the wall where the glowing column of runes increased their light five-fold.  \"These are all mostly to capture and store energy that I can use later on the field.\"  When she removed her wing, the glow slowly decreased back to its original intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed.  \"And\u2026 where exactly do you get this energy from?\"  Looking at the surrounding walls and their bright glow, it certainly looked like a lot of stored energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Thereesa scrambled forward on her elbows, her tail suddenly tight around mine like one snake strangling another.  She put her foreclaws on mine, I could feel the talons putting pressure on the scales of my wrists.  with a husky, breathy voice, she asked, \"Would you like me to show you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feminine musk showering over me, I said breathlessly, \"Yes.\"</span></div></div>",

Without words, the violet female across from me stretched her neck out and rubbed her cheek against the whole length of my neck.  As her head rose, one of the horns spiraling back from the crown of her head brushed my cheek.  Her claw rose to grip and run down my shoulder and nervously, I tried to reciprocate, reaching out with my own paw to touch Thereesa's leg, moving up gently.  I could feel the firmness of muscle under her scales which were smoother and less shaggy than my own.  Thereesa purred and pushed herself closer still, levering herself with her chin against the base of my spine.  As she pulled herself to me, so our chests touched, her tail entwined aggressively around my own, squeezing it and moving further up its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was nervous.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I was afraid that Thereesa would say that I was not doing something right.  But at the same time, I also felt overwhelmed.  The violent female now opened her mouth and let that thick black tongue slither up the back of my neck and as she did, became more forward with the rest of her body as well, pushing against my scales and running her claws over my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings opening a little in her obvious state of excitement, I said.  \"Thereesa\u2026 I don't\u2026\"  The shame of admitting it filled me, \"I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail loosened a little from around mine and she pulled away from my neck to look at me.  Her eyes were still slanted, alluring and full of desire themselves.  \"Don't worry about it.  Let's just make tonight about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a little nod and reclined further back against the wall and its glowing runes.  Thereesa's tail squeezed mine again, as if signalling the return of play and moved a little more up my own length.  Her fin now brushed the backs of my haunches, the ends far more substantial than a feather and vaguely aquatic.  Rather than returning to caress my neck and shoulders, however, the violet female shook her wings out a little more.  She reached out and touched my back and my own folded wings with the bat-like appendage, the boney digits and warm purple leather sliding against my skin and scales.  She put her foreclaw on my ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huffed a breath as she pulled herself up over me and on top of me.  My natural instincts said  to fight back and Thereesa must have sensed my stiffness.  \"Relax.\"  she commanded again and I did as she told me, swallowing my hiss, though her weight was far greater than Lina's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa folded her legs and settled onto of me.  Our entertained tails formed an open circle of sinewy muscle and vertebrae behind us since my partner had spiraled hers down from the tip.  Squeezing hard now, the female onto of me forced her tail around mine once again with obvious effort on her part.  \"Darzhja.\"  breathed Thereesa.  \"I want you to take a deep breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and excited, impatient and timorous all at once, I closed my eyes and breathed in.  Thereesa's tail then found its way between my haunches, it pressed up against my nethers and the air caught in my throat.  I clenched my teeth and turned my head away.  Just feeling the side of her tail against my privates elicited a stronger sensation than I'd known during my physical last week.  It was unfamiliar, it was powerful and thought devouring.  It felt like oblivion, it felt like utter bliss.  I wanted more.  Thereesa obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew her tail backward against me, the smooth, firm surface of her tail forcing from me the breath I'd been holding.  Thereesa leaned down over my writhing neck and ran her thick, black tongue over the thin scales of my cheek.  I barely felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the end of her tail withdrew, I uttered a soft, \"Don't\u2026\"  I didn't want that feeling to cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa grinned down at me.  \"As you wish\u2026\"  Her tail tightened brutally around my thicker one again and the violet female's stiff fin came down hard against my soft spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw my head back against the floor so that my horns scrapped against the floor, making a horrible sound.  But I didn't care, I was lost in a fog of pleasure.  I reached up blindly to the dragoness ontop of me and pulled her down onto my chest.  Thereesa tittered in surprise and then purred, rubbing her cheek against mine even as she pressed down still harder against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the fact that I held her in my arms, despite the fact that her scent was showering down on me and filling the small room, my thoughts were not on Thereesa.  Rather, in my mind's eye, I saw watery azure eyes.  The same ones who cared when I was injured after my battle in the warehouse, the same ones which belonged to a large, well muscled, blue scaled figure.  It was my first time, I was greedy and soon merely brushing and pressing against the surface of my yielding nethers was not enough.  My nature commanded me and dictated what was supposed to follow, but was frustratingly not being delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lothar!\"  I breathed in a state where I was not completely sure where I was at.  I only knew what I wanted and that what I was receiving was not the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion and the pressure and the friction stopped to my utter horror as Thereesa's tail withdrew from between my thighs.  It felt like I was falling, like some sort of life essence were leaking out of me.  I was panting, but in a few moments, I'd regained most of my faculties.  When I did, I saw her violet face looking down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say what I think you said?\"  said Thereesa with a complex expression.  It was as if she were disappointed, off-put, but had been expecting it all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled over partially so that I was on my side again.  Thereesa sliding off of me, her tail unwinding gently from my own; the return of the flow of blood to the muscular appendage sent a chill up my thickly muscled tail.  \"What did I say?\"  I asked, though I knew, or at least thought I knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa just smirked with her knowing grin.  \"You love him don't you.\"  said the dragoness across from me, our legs still touching, \"...Or at least you want him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what we were just doing, I was shocked at her bluntness.  But I could not summon up the old Darzhja who would have balked and denied and changed the subject.  It was as if a layer of insulation between us had been stripped away after Thereesa had had her tail between my legs.  \"I do.\"  I said simply.  \"I really do, but that doesn't mean that I don't like you, Thereesa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps as a friend, Darzhja.  But you don't see me the way I see you, and I don't think you can.\"  I was about to protest, but she placed her tail fin against my snout to still me.  \"It's not your fault.\"  Now she turned her snout away and sighed.  \"I didn't think that you ran in my direction, to be honest.  But you are such a handsome dragoness...\" Her eyes flared, taking in my sleek, bronze scaled form, \"I couldn't help but try to lure you over to my side.  But we can't fight our natures.  I can't and you can't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her foreclaws, her thin, elongated digits and her black claws, shining, perhaps polished.  The truth was staring me in the face, but I didn't feel upset or embarrassed or uncomfortable about what me and Thereesa had just done, or attempted to do.  She had allowed me to see at long last a part of me that I didn't even know was there.  Still, behind those violet eyes which were no longer quite as captivating as they were before - though they still exuded a wonderful exotic beauty - I saw his azure eyes waiting for me; and behind those, perhaps the burnt orange eyes of the one who still haunted my thoughts and darkest dreams.  \"I think...  I think I understand.\"  I said sollemly.  Then I flashed my sharp teeth and touched her snout with my own playfully.  \"But I still want you to be my friend Thereesa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet dragoness giggled and poked a ticklish spot in my armpit with her folded tail fin.  \"Well who wouldn't want to be!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed and rolled onto my side.  Thereesa rolled over as well, folding her wings and resting her back against my belly.  I asked, \"Do you mind if I still spend the night here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa lifted her head slightly and looked at me sidelong, her long thin snout pointing skyward.  \"Only if you promise to tell him how you feel.\"  she winked at me slyly.  I gasped softly and she then brushed her wing partially against my flank. \"I just want you to be happy, Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be happy too...\"  I said quietly, but still felt timid.  Thereesa was easier to feel emotionally, the male mind remained intimidatingly obscure.  How such a large dragoness as myself could be so timid when it came to matters of the heart when I was capable of leaping fearlessly into battle was beyond me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa allowed us to lapse into silence.  The runes on the walls, which had been glowing brightly with our passion dimmed and eventually became dark.  Our breathing slowed, Thereesa pressing her back into the hollow of my tummy and I resting my claws on her shoulders.  Eventually I slept...</span></span></div></div>",

They didn\u2019t say a word, yet there was this knowing look on their eyes. Especially Tsarra. The look upon her gaze was utterly\u2026 poisonous that morning. If I were to ever get into any sort of confrontation with any of them, she\u2019d use that episode with Thereesa to blackmail me out of the Order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had also expected Shadia to learn of what went on that night, yet strangely, and in fact, ominously, she treated me just as badly as she did any normal morning. Perhaps she was saving it for a time to really embarrass me? The lieutenant was very crafty in not only inflicting suffering, but knowing the opportune moment to inflict it to cause maximum humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during meal time, when Lina had heard of what had happened between myself and Thereesa\u2026 lets just say that she was utterly excited. She instantly dropped the scarab she was feasting upon and began squealing uncontrollably for a few minutes. Meanwhile, Lina huddled right next to Thereesa, looking like two thieves ready to break into the Vault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Thereesa, tell me about the whole thing. Step by step. I want to know all the juicy details\u2026\u201d whispered Lina. I could only watch with horror as the two began whispering to each other, yet deliberately loud enough that I could clearly overhear what they were gossiping. I snorted; they\u2019d surely make a far better \u2018couple\u2019 rather than Thereesa and myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a bite out of my steer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that much really,\u201d I replied, keeping my head turned away so she couldn\u2019t see the anxiety on my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa instantly sabotaged whatever meager efforts I\u2019d made to downplay it. \u201cCome on beautiful, you know that you liked it,\u201d she giggled, \u201cOh Lina, you should have seen her when she threw her head back and listened to the wonderful sound she made last night!! By the Ancestors it was the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina giggled wildly, while I wished for nothing else but to return to my eggshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not seeming too forward, considering that my dorm is right next to Thereesa\u2019s, I did seem to find you weren\u2019t really protesting her advances\u201d said Heliana mildly. \u201cI did not envision you the type that would possess that kind of orientation\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes sheepishly, \u201cI actually think its nice that you\u2019re able to explore that side of yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face scowled into one of annoyance, \u201cI\u2019m not a lesbian\u2026\u201d I growled back, with a bit too much force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. That is quite a shame\u2026\u201d purred Thereesa, \u201cHowever, maybe when you\u2019re having your season and you need someone to help you relieve your tension\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to stop coming after me are you?\u201d I cried. I didn\u2019t feel particularly surprised at that at all. \u201cA dragoness as beautiful as you are, never\u2026\u201d giggled Thereesa. \u201cYet I suppose you would prefer to do this kind of thing with Lorath though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded rapidly, glad to take my mind of that weird experience last night and instead envision that kind dragon instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet once again, Lina had to throw a wrench into that plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that what Darzhja told you?\u201d she snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes instantly began to widen with dread; I knew exactly where Lina was going to take this next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare Lina!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was too late. \u201cActually, the drake that Darzhja really has the hots for is Fangorn\u2026\u201d she giggled. Thereesa now looked quite surprised, so much so that she let out a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana put a wing to her mouth. \u201cFangorn!?\u201d she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly froze, as whatever fantasy I\u2019d had of Lorath was replaced by one with Fangorn. The harder I tried to wipe it out of my mind, the worse it became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! Fangorn\u2019s a jerk!! I hate that arrogant stalker!! I\u2019ll never like him!! Never!! Never!! Never!!\u201d I retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that you were saying about me?\u201d said a voice. I turned around, and I let out a gasp, wings unfurling and tail rising over my head to strike. By the Great Dragons above, it was Fangorn. He looked both alarmed with my outburst, but also, a little intrigued. For a long moment, I could only stammer, my hearts pounding. He always had to pop up at precisely the wrong moment. I turned around to where my friends were, only to see that they had backed away at a safe distance, giggling and gossiping to each other like spectators about to witness a volcanic eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFangorn!! What are you doing here anyhow!? Sir\u2026.\u201d I cried, trying to keep a straight face, but more than likely not succeeding. I knew full well how much Fangorn loved seeing me \u2018vulnerable\u2019. I curved back to meet his gaze stiffly, into those eyes of his. Why did he have to be so good looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to deliver to you a rather interesting proposal,\u201d said Fangorn, suave as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d I growled, \u201cFirst of all, how did you manage to sneak up on me like that!! Its creepy!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith you ranting and raving like a crazed cinnabar addict, it wasn\u2019t that hard at all,\u201d he snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed, \u201cJerk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn humphed. By now, he always seemed to take that as a compliment. I had to think of a new insult from now on. \u201cSo, now that you\u2019re here, what do you want?\u201d I snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be certain, it does have a lot to do with my more mundane duties. Lieutenant Hazzorah requires more time out of my schedule to take part in a project of unspecified nature, so therefore I need someone to take over gate watch for a few afternoons out of the week,\u201d said Fangorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have something to do with the attack?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Darzhja, but unfortunately I am not alowed to reveal any specifics about the investigation. Now before you decide to lebel me as a 'jerk' as you so fondly love to disparge me as, the reason is because you are not of high enough rank nor do you possess authorization to receive any details of my project,\" he answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course....sir,\" I answered, \"Anyhow, why are you offering this to me?\u201d I wondered. One always had to be suspicious of Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you telling me you would turn down a little bit of extra pay for a bit of petty pride?\u201d snorted Fangorn. I rolled my eyes. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. \u201cBesides, I thought you might appreciate the irony of the situation, plus I think the job is particularly suited for an individual of your temperament. Furthermore, I already checked your schedule and found the days I have in mind fit in nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was speechless for a long while. That last statement encapsulated all of Fangorn\u2019s obsessive ness, his overly clever comments and how he just seemed to be particularly adept at irritating me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wish to know, it was Lorath who initially brought forward this proposal, however given his other duties at the moment he wanted me to bring it up to you,\u201d he answered, looking a bit glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d I said with a would-be sweet voice, \u201cBecause Lorath is too decent a dragon to be an obsessive stalker like you are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn\u2019s gaze hardened and I heard him utter a soft yet threatening growl. Apparently, the mere mention of me uttering the word Lorath was enough to raise his hackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, turning my body away from him. \u201cI think about it then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me know by tomorrow then\u2026\u201d he replied, seemingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn looked somewhat relieved. I made my way back to Lina, Thereesa and Heliana, keeping my gaze on Fangorn as he took just a bit too long to stare at me, before heading off to whatever he was going to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following afternoon after training, I found myself at the southern gate, clad in my full armor. I\u2019d already asked Lady Scabia about the proposal and she had agreed. It was a way to earn a few gems and taking part in active duty, while not interfering with my training schedule. Plus, with the Knights needing all personnel to deal with the smuggling ring, they still needed qualified personnel to do the more mundane tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn was present at the gate to give me a quick run-down on my duties. As much of a jerk he was, he took pride in his work, however mundane garrison duty was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, you are not to let any non-Temple personnel inside, unless they possess a permit,\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured toward one of the human garrison guards, who quickly showed me what it looked like, \"These are made by the mages within the Temple itself, so you need not worry about any counterfeits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet if you're still not sure, ask Sir Lawson over there,\" said Fangorn, pointing toward a human male clad in armor. \"Sir Lawson is in command of the humanoids protecting this gate, he's been at this almost as long as I've been a Knight, which is quite a while for human standards, and he'll be able to get even somebody like you up to speed in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that, but what if anybody asks if the Holy Knights are recruiting?\" I asked. Fangorn gave me a look. It was a memory he did not want to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then direct them to the civilian militia so they can immediately be put to work. If they continue to persist, then you may use non-lethal force to subdue the troublemaker in question. I don't imagine you'll have much trouble, your appearance represented a highly unusual circumstance...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026that must have come as quite a surprise\u2026\u201d I replied, my eye not so subtly shifting toward his still-bandaged tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, the Temple must have figured that it would be safer to have you working as a Knight rather than terrorizing the good people of New Alveri,\" added Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Fangorn, you can count on me...\" I answered. He flew off, to do whatever that secret task he'd been assigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I stood watch at the gate, watching the humanoids walk by and going about in picking up the pieces. Every so often, a humanoid would come by, flashing a permit, whereupon he or she would be allowed entry. Most of these were suppliers, ferrying raw materials and other essential goods in and out of the Temple. The humanoid guards would check the materials for anything suspicious, for which there was none. Other times, there would be the odd humanoid troublemaker who inadvertantly sneak too close. There was also a rather silly attempt by a group of dwarven children that tried to sneak into the temple; I'd actually heard them planning their rather silly plan in one of the small alleyways, and then when they attempted it, I pretended not to notice until they actually thought their plan was going to work, when I scooped them all gently with my tail. They screamed, scared stiff, and one of them begged me not to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I promised I wouldn't, because fortunately for them I wasn't hungry at the moment, after which they all scurried away in exaggerated panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a familiar face appeared at the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t you DD\u2026\u201d said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted my gaze downward. \u201cMarkus!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the grizzled old human that I had fought so many times for in the small fighting ring of his. He\u2019d also been the de-facto strongman of the streets in the poorer areas in the merchant district; the person that everybody usually turned to whenever they had a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you!! A Holy Knight!! You really look good in that armor. I always knew that you were something special!! To be honest I was rather worried when you decided to confront that guard directly\u2026\u201d said Markus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026you mean Fangorn?\u201d I retorted, my eyes narrowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFangorn?\u201d said Markus, a strange gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m taking over for him between my training sessions. Gave him a nice bite in the tail, so he had no choice but to let me in\u201d I replied quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how ye ended up in the dungeon....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was thankfully taken care of, now, I do find it kind of ironic that I\u2019m guarding the same gate I was trying to barge into earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange how the world works doesn\u2019t it?\u201d answered Markus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Being a Knight is a lot different from what I\u2019d thought it be,\u201d I answered. I thought back to that encounter with Thereesa, the fight in the warehouse, the \u2018physical\u2019, the weird encounters I\u2019d had with Fangorn. I had changed quite a bit since I had first challenged Fangorn to that fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case, how has the rebuilding process gone?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus paced about, \u201cEh, its been quite a undertaking I\u2019ll give you that. There\u2019s still a whole bunch of petty thieves and troublemakers making life difficult in the Merchant district. Yet for the most part, Kaj and his militia have managed to keep things under control and putting people back to work. If you want my opinion, a dragon as strong and talented as him is wasted as a militia dragon; should\u2019ve been a Knight instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my opinion, I had to agree. Kaj was more than a match than any Knight I could name. I couldn\u2019t help but have an image of him beating up Fangorn the way he deserved to be beaten for pestering me all the time. However, Kaj seemed to find more fulfillment out in the streets helping the citizenry directly than the stiff rituals of being a Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, what brings you here? If you want to get into the Temple, you\u2019re going to have to show me a pass even if you are a long-time friend,\u201d I replied. Knowing Markus for as long as I had, I doubted that he was here just to say hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe provided a pass, \u201cCan\u2019t give you the details, but its concerning the fate of the merchant guilds. I know I don\u2019t look anything like a merchant, but I do keep tabs on the market after all. I\u2019ve got to speak with a certain individual within the Temple and negotiate a series of contracts and information with him,\u201d said Markus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that one of the Knights has a connection with the merchant guilds then?\u201d I inferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, that\u2019s right. Again, I\u2019d like to tell you more, but I\u2019m not supposed to\u2026\u201d said Markus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \u201cI understand. In any case, speak with the messengers so that they can process and communicate their message.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Darzhja,\u201d said Markus, before he was escorted in by a squad of humanoid Knights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was rather peaceful. I wondered what the details of Markus\u2019 mission was, and made me aware that while I was now a Knight, I still was only privy to a small part of a much larger and complex situation. What was truly going on in the city? What was the relationship between the merchants and the Temple? Perhaps these were questions I would learn in time. Yet for now, I still had to perform my duty to the upmost, no matter how trivial it seemed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lina was very happy with herself lately. Granted, she felt heavier than she was used to feeling, but it was a good kind of heavy. It meant her little ones would be healthy and strong once she laid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t wait for the day they would hatch, and she would get to see their shining little faces!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it had been a little while since she\u2019d seen Ein\u2019theil. He\u2019d been busy with his partner in his magical studies, but she figured now would be a very nice time to surprise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes twinkling, Lina poofed her way over to Ein\u2019theil\u2019s lair. The first thing that struck her was his scent. She grinned, perhaps he was getting ready for her tonight\u2026 Yet then, she started to hear voices, and she got confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Peter\u2026stroke me right there\u2026 That\u2019s really nice\u2026\u201d she heard Ein\u2019theil\u2019s voice cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina\u2019s eyes went wide, and slowly made her way inside. She was shocked at what she saw. Ein\u2019theil was crouched over a mount, similar to the ones used during the physicals, his mouth open and panting. Below him, sitting on a stool, was his partner Peter, using both hands to stroke his cock, and worse, the halfling was not wearing any sort of clothing at all. She could only watch with a perverse fascination as the humanoid stroked him, until he let out a cry and of relief as he spurt all over the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, that was wonderful\u2026\u201d purred Ein\u2019theil. There was a dreamy look in his eye, one that was usually reserved for her. When that happened, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She burst into the chamber and let out a scream of pain and fury, tears bursting from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin\u2019theil slowly turned to face Lina, with a look of pure horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Ein'theil!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Linal\u2019eil, I-I can explain\u2026\u201d he stammered. \u201cW-we need dragon semen for the next experiment\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very lousy excuse and Ein\u2019theil seemed to know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors Ein\u2026 I knew this was going to happen eventually,\u201d gasped Petering. He instantly rushed in front of Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLina, I\u2019m so sorry about what happened. I should have known better, I was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n\u201cLeave now!!\u201d Lina hissed. Peter backed away, put on his clothes and rushed out of sight. It was pitiful that it was the halfling that had been the first that had tried to take responsibility, as in fact; all her rage was reserved for Ein\u2019theil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Ein\u2019theil? We made babies together!! I thought you loved me!!\u201d she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of course I love you Lina!!\u201d stammered Ein\u2019theil, yet his voice was hesitant. He tried to move forward to embrace her, yet Lina was too disgusted and turned him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! You love your human more than me!! You only wanted me so we could continue our race isn\u2019t it!?\u201d she screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!!\u201d insisted Ein\u2019theil. \u201cI do love you!! Yet I also love Peter as well!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina sniffled and trembled. \u201cH-how can I trust you Ein\u2019theil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLina\u2026 I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina hissed, \u201cI guess I was the foolish one then, being so blindly in love as not to think it through. Better\u2026better I should have stayed in the forest then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to turn away back to the dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLina!! Wait!! I\u2019m sorry!! I should have-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina didn\u2019t want to hear about it right now. She\u2019d never felt so betrayed in her entire life. How could he have done this to her? She\u2019d trusted him blindly, and she\u2019d gotten burned. Had Ein\u2019theil just been open about it and told her, she would have been fine with it, but since she had to discover it\u2026 and the possibility that he had just used her as a breeder was the part that was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nThat night I returned to the dorms, tired after a long day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina was present to greet me as usual. She seemed her usual bubbly self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!!\u201d she squealed, \u201cSo how was your day!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI met up with an old friend, Markus, who ran the fighting ring. Other than that, guard duty was rather uneventful,\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you Lina? How did your day go?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina jerked backwards, \u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d she cried, seeming surprised by this question, \u201cIt went all right I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I knew something wasn\u2019t right. Usually, she\u2019d be squeaking about how wonderful her day was, but she seemed strangely hesitant for some reason. Her eyes were reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-did something happen today?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina took a deep breath. I\u2019d never seen her so unsure of herself before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts\u2026its\u2026its\u2026nothing...\u201d she stammered, curving her gaze downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t want to talk about it. Maybe you can go see Ein\u2019theil and talk to him instead\u2026\u201d I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes began to water, her jaw quavering. That\u2019s when I realized it. \u201cDid something happen between you and Ein\u2019theil?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I saw him Darzhja. I caught him making love with his halfling partner\u2026 He\u2026he\u2026\u201d she squeaked with a small voice. Then, the dam broke, as she threw herself against me and began weeping, screaming at the top of her breath. All I could do was hold her against me as if she was a hatchling, trying not to cry myself. It hurt me deeply to see Lina hurt like that. Rage began to build within me toward that cheating little runt. How could any male do that? Abandoning one\u2019s mate, especially when they were pregnant with little ones\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-darzhja\u2026 I-I\u2026don\u2019t want you to get involved in this. H-he apologized\u2026but\u2026but\u2026\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not getting away with this Lina\u2026 he can\u2019t\u2026\u201d I snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina sniffled again. It was apparent that while she\u2019d been cheated on, she still loved Ein\u2019theil and didn\u2019t want any harm to come out of it. These types of quarrels were something I had little experience in dealing with, and there was a real chance that if I got involved, I could simply make it worse. Maybe I should let the situation sort itself out before deciding to lash out? Yet still, it was against my nature to passively sit on the sidelines and do nothing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I immediately rose up out of my haunches, rage consuming me, my wariness from the day evaporating. It didn\u2019t matter if it was the middle of the night; my friend had been hurt and she needed somebody to stand up for her. Nobody was going to stop me until the situation was made right again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew off toward the cheater\u2019s lair. It wasn\u2019t hard to find, since the specialized lair that was provided for Ein\u2019theil was near the mage\u2019s guild, while the size of the lair itself was also crafted to accommodate the size of a smaller dragon that specialized in magic instead of combat. Unfortunately, that meant I could only stick my head through the opening of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEin\u2019theil!!\u201d I snarled, switching my gaze toward the fairy dragon. The small dragon leaned up against the corner and began babbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out here coward!! How could you do such a horrible thing to Lina!! She loved you so much and you cheat with a male humanoid of all creatures!!\u201d I roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I-I c-c-can explain\u2026 I didn\u2019t want this to happen. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d he stammered. He then curled up into a ball and began bawling pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!!\u201d cried a voice from behind. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI switched my gaze toward the direction of the voice. It was that mage, Peter, or whatever his name had been, and likely the humanoid lover Lina\u2019s cheating mate had cuddled up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of my way halfling!! Unless you wish to suffer my wrath as well\u2026\u201d I snarled. Frankly, it was one thing for a humanoid to be led astray into this sort of relationship, because they were often blinded by their reverence for dragon-kind and didn\u2019t really know any better. I\u2019d actually thought him rather irrelevant mostly, as humanoids consisted merely part of an amorphous mass compared to dragonkind. So, I was more than surprised that while Ein\u2019theil cowered in the corner, it was the halfling who held his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-look, I know your after Ein\u2019theil and you\u2019re going to give him a piece of your mind for hurting Lina, but please, hear us out first,\u201d he cried. While I couldn\u2019t help but feel a vast amount of disgust at the small humanoid, I also had to grudgingly admit that had he actually climbed the entire way up without the aid of a dragon just tointervene on Ein'theil's behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted, \u201cI\u2019m listening\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m probably in no position to explain things, but\u2026please forgive us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been doing\u2026this sort of thing together?\u201d I asked, trying to keep the obvious disgust out of my mouth. Ein'theil remained silent and ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEin\u2019theil, don\u2019t make me be the one to have to face her alone. Please, we\u2019ve got to take responsibility for this mistake,\u201d said Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin\u2019theil sniffled, and rose back to his feet. He still seemed scared out of his mind, but at least he seemed to have recovered some composure. Apparently, his partner seemed to give him the courage he lacked on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I met Peter, I was\u2026well, a wreck. I was always alone and scared and got picked on all the time. I thought\u2026about killing myself a few times, and one time I was about to go through with it, but for reasons that I don\u2019t fully understand to this day, Peter happened to be there and he stopped me. He was only a child back then, but he seemed to understand me better than anyone had before. Peter\u2026 he was my first real friend, and I\u2019d never had a friend before. He told me I wasn\u2019t a worthless piece of trash, and that I actually could become a Knight, and because of him I was able to become a Knight. Its also part of the reason how I was able to meet Lina\u2026\u201d said Ein\u2019theil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you obviously care about Peter. Then what is Lina to you? Is she only a means for continuing your race?\u201d I snarled. If it was, then he was going to get no mercy from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin\u2019theil stammered for a moment. \u201cI\u2026had never seen another Faerie Dragoness before, at least not one my age. I\u2026didn\u2019t know what to do at first. Yet, when she got so excited about me\u2026it became infectious. I knew I\u2019d never wanted to be with any other dragoness in the world. When I found out I was going to be a father, you have no idea how happy I felt for both of us. And yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of its actually my fault,\u201d cried Peter. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing to admit, but at the time, I couldn\u2019t help but be a little bit jealous that Ein was spending more and more time with Lina. I probably shouldn\u2019t have felt that way, but he felt bad that I was feeling that way, and well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you decided to take your relationship one step further?\u201d I snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Peter and I would be able to keep this sort of relationship secret. You\u2019d think that we should have known better and that Lina would find out eventually right? In fact, it probably would have been better had we been brave enough to tell her straight up, but I was too scared that if I told her our relationship wouldn\u2019t be the same anymore,\u201d said Ein\u2019theil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teeth became clenched again, \u201cYou are an idiot, you know that? Even if you do make up, she\u2019ll never adore you with the same blind devotion again,\u201d I spat acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin\u2019theil nodded glumly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered the question though. Who is more important to you, Lina or Peter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer should have been obvious, yet once again Ein\u2019theil could not speak. He looked deeply agonized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a fair question to ask Darzhja,\u201d cried Peter, \u201cWhy should he or anybody be forced to choose between one or the other? You probably think that such sentiments would be utterly insane, but its true. Its not about who you love more, its just a different sort of love, that\u2019s all. Still, if he ever had to choose, I\u2019d rather him choose her over me. I\u2019ll be dead in sixty years anyhow\u2026\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare think of it in those terms. I\u2019ll always treasure you even when you grow old and gray,\u201d insisted Ein\u2019theil. I imagined the faerie dragon getting pleasured when the halfling was near death\u2019s door. It was not a pretty thought at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Darzhja. I messed up really badly. I could give you all the reasons I can give for why I did it, but that\u2019s irrelevant at this point. Somehow, I\u2019ve got to put things right. She\u2019ll hate me now, but I\u2019ve got to take responsibility for what I\u2019ve done,\u201d said Ein\u2019theil. There was a resolve in his eyes now that wasn\u2019t there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to tell Lina what you just told me right now. She deserves better than what you put her through. It will be up to her to decide whether you are still worth having. Yet if I find out you\u2019ve hurt her again, you\u2019ll have to answer to me understand?\u201d I growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d he answered solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still felt as if not much had been resolved, in fact I was under no illusions that things would just turn happily ever after. This was but the start of a long healing process, and ultimately I had already done most of what I could have possibly done. It was up to Lina and Ein\u2019theil ultimately to make up\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days that followed Lina's revelation to me and my confrontation with the cheating Ein were long and disturbingly quiet.  My fairy lairmate, although far from stoic, did not pester or tease me as much as she used to; nor did she bother to drug me into deep, borderline hallucinogenic dreams.  Strange as it sounds, I found myself missing the way that she would poof in front of my head and grab my face as I was walking into the common room, the way she would stick her tongue in my ear, but most of all her chiming, wind bell laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught her more than once staring blankly at a wall or a small pebble on the ground, her wondrous wings closed to her scaly back, wrenching her tail in her claws.  When she noticed me she usually bounced up into the air, told a joke and quickly gave me several other things to think about.  Though once she simply poofed away, I knew not where, and I didn't see her again until late that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with monumental effort that I restrained myself from asking her about her and Ein everyday.  Every time she left my side I imagined her reconciling with the father of the eggs which were growing every day inside her creamy scaled tummy.  Every time she returned, she had been away on some chore for her mentor, or catching a scarab to feed her high metabolism, or practicing her magic.  If she refused to bring it up on her own, I was not going to press her.  Surely she knew by now that I'd pressed Ein to confront her with the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I knew that he had because  for one, Lina was no longer bawling or depressed, despite how she was now acting quiet and withdrawn compared to her usual self.  And for two, I knew that he did not dare tempt my wrath.  I was sure that even he did not know enough magic to keep me away from avenging Lina's honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I had the feeling that Lina was confused.  Perhaps confused about what had happened, what had driven Ein'theil into the arms of a male halfling of all things.  Maybe she was confused about whether she wanted the father of her eggs to be around anymore, and if he deserved to be a part of their lives.  But, honestly, I thought she was confused about if she could possibly forgive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Lina struggling with her personal issues and no real way for me to help her, I found better company in Thereesa and Heliana in the week following the incident.  Thereesa proved to be quite knowledgable in advanced culinary skills suited for dragon pallets as well as a queer stretching exercise that was challenging, but without the cardiovascular strain that we were all forced to suffer for much of the day as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, a few hours after our secondary afternoon drill and Thereesa laid her languid self on the grass.  She had her right foreclaw stuck straight up and her right wing pointed in the direction of her toes; something quite difficult to accomplish.  Her haunches were twisted so that her right hind paw was on the floor, the left stretching out behind her, the top of her foot brushing the grass.  She balanced the awkward position with her tail.  \"This is called 'Drawing-Down-The-Sun.'\"  she said in a voice like a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana and I stood across from her, imitating the older dragoness's motions.  Heliana lacked much of the range of motion required for the stances and frequently fell on her face, as she was almost doing now, every few seconds as she waggled her thick tail behind her.  But Thereesa said that it didn't really matter, so long as one stretched the muscles.  Frankly, I was little better than Heliana.  Sometimes it was as if Thereesa were asking me to dislocate my wing or one of my legs.  The things that girl could do with her spine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa caught me looking and licked her chops, eyeing me.  I laughed nervously and moved my foot a little more into the right position.  Pain shot up my torso, along my right flank.  I cried out  and fell in a jumble of wings and scaled legs.  Thereesa slithered up to me.  \"Did you over extend your latisimus dorsi?\"  she asked, as if I had any idea what what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hissed and rotated my aching arm.  \"I'll be fine.\"  I said, struggling to my feet.  I folded my wings with as much dignity as I could muster, though Heliana's bright clear eyes were obviously amused.  I limped a little to the hole we had dug in the earth.  \"When is this going to be done?\"  I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana's still oversized gut growled loudly, scaring away three birds from a nearby tree.  The silver laughed it off and patted her large midsection.  \"Honestly, I'd have been fine with it raw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa knelt down and lapped from the pit into which we'd dumped two butchered cows, several crates of assorted vegetables and enough water to make it into a stew.  Runes glowed softly around the perimeter of the pit, both to keep the food insulated from dirt around it and to keep it suspended over the fire below.  Heliana, as it turned out, had already mastered a small cantrip, \"A trick from my father.\" she had said, though she still refused to talk about him much except that he fought in the troll rebellions as a civilian conscript.  The silver had breathed fire over the bottom of the pit excessively until the very stones were glowing.  she'd uttered a single word to shaped the spell, 'Fire,' in Old Draconic, and now she could keep her dragon's breath burning in the same spot for as long as she maintained her concentration.  She'd said it was a trick her father had picked up out on the plains were there was little in the way of firewood to keep watch at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for my part, in addition to feeling increasingly useless for knowing nothing of magic, I was unsure of this new diet.  We'd traded a cow for the grains and vegetables for the stew and Thereesa had transported the water from the showers using a small Rune-gate.  It reminded me of the lean times in the orphanage when we'd had to stretched the meat for many mouths.  \"This is cleansing,\"  insisted, Thereesa, \"The vegetables and grains help flush the system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as I was concerned, eating the stomach of the cow gave all the fiber a dragon really needed, but then I was not much of an expert on anything\u2026 except maybe sparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thereesa claimed that the stew was done, the three of us gathered around the pit and lowered our heads, biting and slurping the meal.  It was thick and tasty after all.  Although Heliana had a tendency to eat too fast.  Twice I batted her on the flank with my wing to remind her to share.  She looked at me sheepishly and paused before lowering her head again.  Thereesa\u2026 she seemed to enjoy watching the two of us eat as much as she ate herself; or perhaps it was just me.  I could not stop myself from shuddering a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ate, I thought about the routines that had crept into my life.  My mornings were spent being browbeaten by Shadia who was still more demanding of me and Heliana than any other recruit, especially now that we had formed our alliance with each other.  Always she sought to break us apart, punishing Heliana the more I succeeded, or punishing me the more she lagged behind.  But what the lieutenant didn't realize that she was only driving us closer together.  And Heliana was not doing so terribly anymore.  She was much more emotionally stable now and had even lost 3 stone in the last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen four days out of the week, I had guard duty.  I was excused from afternoon training, but as a downside, I had to meet at least passingly with Fangorn as the shift was changed.  I met Markus most days as he was now busy bringing supplies to his mysterious merchant guild contact in the Temple.  There was obviously something big going on.  I would have bet half my hoard that it had something to do with the power vacuum left in the wake of the three guild leaders' deaths.  Three ancient, powerful dragons, the youngest of them was still over 800 years old, gone overnight.  I was sure that there was a lot of paperwork to do.  It would probably take years to sort it out.  Then at night I rested, the familiar weight of Lina lying on her favored spot curled into a ball in the hallow beneath my arm and over my ribs.  I had no days off.  These scant hours represented my only free time to spend with my new friends.  I couldn't be happier to have them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my head from the chow and looked across at Thereesa who was actually bothering to lap up some food rather than eat me with her eyes.  \"Um... Thereesa...\"  I said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"  the violet dragoness hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my mouth and asked... \"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heliana was noisily gnawing on a thick thigh bone of a steer when I asked Thereesa if she could teach me some magic.  Even the silver bothered to lift up her head on her thick neck to glance at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa looked at me candidly.  Apparently, I'd taken her by surprise.  \"Magic?  Well\u2026  I probably could\u2026\"  she hesitated and looked askance which worried me because the violet female was always so smooth and controlled.  \"But I really don't think rune-magic is the sort of thing for you Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, though Thereesa already looked uncomfortable having said that.  \"I'm not smart enough is what you mean.\" I said it harsher than I meant to and immediately regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa's finned tail twisted on the ground in her discomfort.  \"No.  That's not what I meant.\"  She did a good job of sparing my feelings, but the guilty look in her eyes told me that it was indeed true, or at least partially.  With some finality, she forced her tail against the ground, \"I meant that rune magic is all about symbology and the history of runes.  There's obscure texts to memorize in disused or forgotten tongues.  It takes ages to learn how to do anything useful with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head and flipped a paw.  \"Again, you don't think I'm smart enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa's jaw dropped and Heliana hid her face behind a wing as she was about to suffer a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 oh\u2026\"  Thereesa turned her head to the side.  \"I just don't think you'd have the patience for it, Darzhja.  That's all I meant.\"  She turned her face back to me, a slightly fervent glean in her eyes.  \"I don't think you're stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stared at her for a moment over the now mostly empty pit of eaten beef stew.  Then I broke into a toothy smile,  \"I know you don't.\"  I relaxed my thin jowls back over my fangs, \"But still, I keep feeling out of place because I don't know any magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana reached out a wing and touched my back,  \"You know, most dragons don't know any magic, Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a fact.  In the lower tiers where I'd grown up, magic was an obscure, mysterious tool that was mostly for the rich and affluent of New Alveri, among humanoids and dragons as well; perhaps even more so due to our proclivity for physical labor and fighting.  \"But is that true of Knights?\"  I asked disdainfully.  \"Almost everyone I've met here knows at least a little magic.\"  My voice was strained, I didn't even know how much my ignorance was bothering me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other females stared at me.  Thereesa's tongue flickered out, like a snake poking its black head out of the ground, and she looked at the surrounding trees in thought.  \"Well\u2026 there is one thing that usually comes naturally enough to any dragon.\"  said the violet female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Thereesa with wide, hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked at me and stretched her neck up and out.  But the muscles contracting at the base of her long neck, I could tell she was summoning her fire.  Heliana saw it too and ducked her head.  I flinched.  Having grown up in a city vulnerable to fire, fire-breathing was never something done lightly or without reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThereesa's neck bulged in a controlled way and then she belched a column of flame into the air.  Except it was no flame as I'd ever seen it, at least from a dragon.  The flames were bright green and stank of chemicals, like disinfectant.  At the edges, crackling yellow sparks shot out like firecrackers.  The display lasted about one and a half seconds and Thereesa closed her smoking jaws with a click of teeth snapping together.  Heliana and I sat in stunned silence.  And why shouldn't we have, Thereesa had just shot green fire and fireworks out of her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke still streaming out of her nostrils, Thereesa said, \"Always a good party trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"  the words tumbled out of my mouth like stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet shook out her wings a little in pride.  She was always happy to be the center of attention.  \"It's actually pretty easy, well, the basics are easy.  That\u2026 that took some practice to master.\"  she laughed.  \"You just need to understand one thing.  Dragonfire is inherently magical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  I asked dumbly.  My fire had always been explained to me in terms of ducts and fire glands, and sulfurous oils, usually for the purposes of hygiene.  My fire breath seemed as natural to me as the functioning of my ear, or perhaps more appropriately, my urethra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  said Thereesa vehemently and snaked her tail forward to bat my shoulder.  \"Maybe the physical base is totally natural, but the way that it burns is magic and it is tuned to your emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana nodded, stretching her neck into the conversation.  \"My father told me that he was instructed to work up a rage to destroy and kill with his fire.  He told me how the flames burned through and ate up the magic wards the troll shamen put up to protect themselves, but only if he was angry enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, our fire burns hotter with our passion\u2026  but not just anger works, though perhaps it is the most potent and useful emotion for battle naturally.\"  Thereesa turned to look at me squarely.  \"You need to swallow down your emotion, bottle it up in your chest.\"  She placed her claw against her breast.  \"Then, at the right moment, release it up and out with your breath, your fire.  I know some breathing exercises also, if you are interested, Darzhja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head thanks, having learned now to take advantage of Thereesa's wealth of information.  Later the conversation turned to a message Heliana had received from her mother over the semaphore.  This was the first that I'd ever heard of her mother, since the heavyset silver was stll shy about her background.  Apparently she lived in the major port city of Nod, Damescara.  It lay far down the eastern trade route out of the city so they did not get to see each other much.  It was a short message.  \"My mother is a fisherman and doesn't make a lot of money\u2026\"  said Heliana briefly.  \"But she's so happy to hear that I made it into the Knights\u2026\"  the silver was quiet a moment longer, but looking into the warm faces of her friends gave her the confidence to continue.  \"She says that she's holding up well, and wishes that she could visit me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana was obviously emotional over the contact.  Both Thereesa and I embraced her with our necks.  Our scents intertwined.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, we filled in the pit along with the dregs of the stew and the coals under it.  As soon as the runes around the pit were disturbed, the glass-like field of force disappeared and allowed us to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the good time with Thereesa and Heliana, I was a little hesitant about returning to my lair, despite the fact that it was after dark.  And I felt horrible that I felt that way.  Especially since this whole mess was not at all Lina's fault.  still, I wished for resolution between her and Ein, one way or the other.  I wished for my old Lina back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I entered the lair, I found Lina sitting on the floor, gnawing on one of the magic beetles which kept her fairy magic strong.  She leapt up in greeting, but still it somehow seemed half hearted.  \"I have news, Darzhja.\"  she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to curl myself up in the smallish chamber.  \"Really?  Is it something that I'm going to like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina snorted as she circled about the room.  \"Maybe\u2026\"  She landed on my bronze hide heavily, causing me to chuff.  \"Actually, I don't know.  I was just told to tell you to meet with Lady Scabia after tomorrow morning's drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my head in surprise and anticipation.  \"Oh!  Do you think it is another mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina shrugged, already twisting around on my chest, her little claws clicking against and tickling my scales.  \"Probably.\" she said indifferently.  \"But whatever it is, it's just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026\"  I mumbled, unsure whether to show the excitement I felt if Lina were not to be included in my upcoming experience; whether it was a mission or whatever else.  The chamber settled into silence.  I tried a last ditch effort, unable to stand it for long.  I reached up with a claw and brushed the smooth side of it against Lina's abdomen as she lay curled on top of me.  \"Someone's looking a little rounder.  How are those eggs coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina trilled loudly and stumbled on top of me, spraying dust every which way before being forced to poof into the air to escape my pestering claw.  She harumphed down at me and struck the side of my snout with her soft, curving tail as she flew past, accosting me for my juvenileness.  I stuck my tongue out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on her haunches and sat straight up, looking at her midsection which was creamy scaled, contrast to the emerald color on the rest of her.  She moved her neck this way and that.  \"I've been feeling heavier than usual...\"  she said unsurely.  \"Do you really think it shows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was honestly hard to tell.  Lina remained still a hatchling to my eyes, despite how I'd grown used to her dirty, adult jokes.  Perhaps there was some loss to the normal abdominal tuck-up below her rib cage.  However I said, \"Oh yes, Lina!\"  I said enthusiastically, bending my neck down as if to peer closer.  \"You look fit for carving on the Harvest Day Festival!\"  I laughed and poked her again gently in her midsection.  She bent over, grasping my large hand with both of hers, flashing me the dirtiest look.  Then she burst out laughing.  The stones walls rang with our mirth, however brief it was that night.</span></div></div>",

A young dragon beside him chuckled under his breath and slapped his friend's flank with his tail. 'Gazzer-leb' hung his head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would not have been able to resist a snort of laughter myself, but the Black Demon Queen herself was strutting down the aisle to the female half of the recruits. She stopped at the row ahead of me and glared down at us females, somehow even glaring down at the sky-swallowers. \"And who do we have dead last, as always? Need I bother mentioning her name at this point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Shadia had made it a personal point of hers in the last week to tell everyone exactly how much Heliana was lagging behind, in some new twisted campaign of humiliation in the face of the silver's increasing confidence and motivation. Shadia walked between the rows until she stood directly before Heliana. \"What's your excuse today, you sagging excuse for a knock-off leather handbag? Up too late with your head in the trough? Can you explain why you took over five and a half minutes to get through the simple little obstacle course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana looked ahead blankly. If she lowered her head, Shadia would wallop her over the skull with her tail; as had already happened more than once in the past. \"I got stuck, Ma'm.\" she said in a tiny voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? No one can hear you over the sound of your reeking failure!\" Shadia hissed, her deathmask of a ruff shaking like a snake's rattle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got stuck!\" Shouted Heliana, \"One of the logs was too close to the ground and I couldn't squeeze under it! Ma'm!\" Fresh tears were coming down her snout both ways, but she kept her head high and her face straight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced on Heliana's behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a metallic *clink!* as Shadia rammed the end of her sword pointed tail into Heliana's armored and protruding midsection. The silver scaled female crumpled onto the ground, drawing ragged breaths. \"You couldn't fit because my course was designed for future Knights. Not hippos.\" Shadia stalked off, apparently satisfied for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Black Bitch's back was turned I stretched out my wing and touched Heliana's flank. She shivered under the contact and lifted her head to look back at me. We shared a small smile before Heliana wiped her tears off on the grass and got up to her feet to stand in line once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that morning's training finally ended, Heliana came straight to me, exhausted mentally as well as physically, but with an optimistic expression planted painfully on her face. I didn't want to hurry off, but I had no choice. Lady Scabia was expecting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI appreciated Heliana's efforts to be enthusiastic for me. \"Darzhja, that's terrific. Do you think that you're going to get another mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around us was filled with dragons departing in every direction. The resulting wing stirred the light fronds at the back of my neck. \"I don't know for sure.\" I admitted, \"But I think so!\" I was not so worn out by morning exercise as Heliana was, and I couldn't help but tread lightly on my claws. It felt like a strong wind would carry me away. My wings itched as I held them half open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight silver seemed to realize that she was holding me up, but she asked, \"Will I see you this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that she meant around dinner. I had hoped that she was starting to feel more confident about controlling what went into that wide maw of hers\u2026 but apparently she still felt she needed the support of her friends. \"I really don't know, Heliana.\" A stiff breeze blew down from the north over the hills at the edge of the caldron and really forced me back for real. I planted my claws in the earth. \"Ask Thereesa if I don't show. Maybe she'll serve you some onions and roots for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana made a gagging sound and bid me goodbye with a smile. I leapt up backwards and soared south like a kite in the breeze.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lady Scabia's lair was more than halfway across the width of the long dormant volcano. Fluttering to the landing shelf, I gripped the stone in my claws as I landed. I breathed in Scabia familiar scent, but also caught the strong musk of a male just recently past. A male I knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extended my neck and let out a loud warble, common Draconic for a visitor (female) entering another's home. Lady Scabia chirped back twice with her deeper, maturer voice: acknowledgement and assent. I crossed the threshold into the unlit dimness within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was in the circular entry room, so I padded on down a curved, horizontal tunnel. Still more mementos and curios decorated the walls within recesses set in the stone; a collection obviously spanning multiple hundreds of years. Quickly I came into another chamber. I had just identified the other guest of Scabia's by his scent as I walked in on the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Scabia's dark green bulk reclined a smaller male against the wall nearest the entryway. He had left his silver armor behind, but the blue scales gave away his identity. Lorath. I had to bite back a sigh. <i>What a surprise! what did this handsome drake have to do with this?</i> I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome Darzhja. Good to see you again.\" said Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, I stepped over his long, straight tail as I entered the generous, though low ceilinged cavern. My eyes traveled farther up to the base than might have been polite. His masculine scent filled the room, overpowering Scabia's; I couldn't help but drink it in. \"It's been a while\u2026\" I managed, averting my eyes to Lady Scabia to keep myself clear headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked past and settled myself against a stone wall, I couldn't help but notice that I did have Lorath's attention, though perhaps only because I'd just walked in the room. Still, I found myself swishing my tail just a little bit more than needed, and holding my wings out just a tad from my body. His nostrils flared and I saw just a tiny half smile lighten the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia spoke. \"Darzhja, as you might have guessed by now, I'm offering you a mission.\" She rolled her eyes and added, \"Well\u2026 not exactly a whole mission. You are to be assisting Lorath with his. Lorath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue male took his cue and turned his liquid eyes on me. I thought of sea foam and dark tide pools, or at least pictures I'd seen of them. I've never been very far from New Alveri. Still, I had to concentrate to hear his words, my hearts were beating too loudly! \"You know about the aftermath of the warehouse incident right? How we used our unearthed information to smoke out several other places where the smuggling cartel has apparently been operating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded firmly. I kept my eyes on his face though they kept wanting to drift down to his broad shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've found yet more dragon eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was news enough to shake me from my embarrassing physical attraction. \"That's great! More little ones delivered from whatever ghastly fates awaited them!\" I exclaimed with real enthusiasm, even bringing my fist down on the floor. A relic wobbled uneasily on a shelf nearby, however, and I was forced to give Lady Scabia a sheepish look. The elder female just snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath, however did not share my excitement. He turned his snout away. \"That's just the thing, though. Many eggs have been claimed by their worried parents, but a surprising number of them have not been picked up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, It was unthinkable that any mother could leave their unhatched offspring behind. Most any drakka I knew would rather die than surrender her eggs, it was the natural reaction. \"How many?\" I asked guardedly, not really wanting to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost half.\" said Lorath, his eyes haunted. \"The dragon cult members have been diverted to build fires to keep them warm, but we simply don't have the facilities for the eggs. It'll be even worse when they hatch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a hurt sigh, already knowing where this was leading. Painful childhood memories came up unbidden in the back of my mind. \"They'll be orphans then\u2026\" I said regretfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Scabia picked up the conversation with her usual authoritative tone, \"Indeed, Darzhja. And the Temple only has a single nursery and that is reserved for active duty Knights and their young. These unclaimed eggs will have to be sent to orphanages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my face flush under my bronze hued scales. Damn the Knights and their partisan preeminence. These hatchlings need a home! Then I thought of Lina and other female drakka like her who, by the very Temple itself, were not exactly discouraged from procreating, or in fact outright encouraged. Should she have to sacrifice her progression through the ranks, her career, to settle down and build a nest? Something in me, ancient instincts which were not so deeply buried in dragons as in most humanoids, thought that it was appropriate. But it still rankled with unfairness, especially in regards to the male half of the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides nothing I said would change the system overnight. The eggs needed homes and care now. I shook my head, knowing what was coming. \"Lady Ramoth\u2026\" the name slipped between my scaled lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss.\" Scabia said with a slight hiss. \"We need her help desperately with so many eggs going unclaimed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why!?\" I said rather too loudly, thinking of so many young ones destined to the same rough life I'd been forced to live. \"Where are the parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath stepped in, \"We think that they are dead, Darzhja.\" I flicked my head to the blue male, eyes wide. He continued, \"Many died in the attack, we still haven't accounted for all the missing dragons, though the rubble is mostly cleaned up now. It is possible that these smugglers have been preying on eggs they know belong to dead or missing dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be the whole story\u2026\" I rankled, conspiracies and dragons held hostage ran though my mind, as irrational as it was.  \"What about the missing adolescents around the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Occam's Razor, Darzhja. That wise Alchemist stated not to multiply entities needlessly. We have no proof that the two occurrences are related.  For now, the simplest explanation is the best.\" said Lorath, and though I had no idea who this Occam fellow was, I felt some of my fervor evaporate in the face of Lorath's unshakable logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes fell and then drifted back up, taking in both dragons to either side of me, \"You are going to have a hard time with Lady Ramoth. Her orphanage is still overcrowded, though perhaps not so much now if some of the injured dragons have recovered\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, Darzhja?\" asked Scabia. I quickly related my experience with the crowded orphanage before my acceptance as a Knight apprentice. How the poorest dragons injured in the attack sough sanctuary when the hospitals turned them away. How the hatchlings were forced to reside in the hallways. I mentioned nothing of the blood money Lady Ramoth had accepted in return for the corpses of the stricken dragons, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Lady Scabia's face darkened. I was only glad that I was not the target of that elder's ire. She seemed suddenly as scary as Shadia\u2026 well almost as scary. Then Scabia unexpectedly stretched forth her good wing and rested it upon my flank. \"You can rest assured, Darzhja. The Nine have already promised considerable financial backing for any organizations who can take these eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money is fine and good.\" I said, \"But it still takes time to turn that into bigger and deeper caves and more dragon cult members. Lady Ramoth will be heavily burdened in the short run, no matter how much the Temple promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natrually,\" said Lorath. \"But we can work out those details later, with Ramoth herself. However, where we really need your help, Darzhja, is with certain political complications that are going to arise because of this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I was stunned, not only because this should only have been a simple transition, but also because both Lorath and Scabia seemed to think that I could help in some way. \"What sort of complications?\" I asked cautiously.</span></div></div>",

One day, she left without a word and was not heard of again until she sent that letter informing us that she was now running an orphanage and that she was willing to sponsor your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the obvious reluctance in Lady Scabia\u2019s voice to tell me even this watered down, abridged explanation of Lady Ramoth\u2019s exodus from the Knights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit cheated, slamming my closed claw against the ground. \u201cLady Scabia!! You knew her when she was a Knight!! Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s all you know!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath raised his wing and placed it against my flank. \u201cCalm yourself Darzhja!!\u201d  he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll my anger instantly evaporated under that firm yet sympathetic gaze of his. \u201cMost of the other Knights know as much as you do about the exact circumstances. Lady Scabia has her reasons for not revealing the specifics. I can only assume she does so out of respect for Lady Ramoth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScabia looked deeply relieved that she had not needed to be the one to scold me. She gazed at me solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize I can\u2019t give you any more specifics than that Darzhja,\u201d said Scabia, \u201cI only wanted you to keep in mind that there are circumstances that may make her uneasy about working with the Knights again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can ask Lady Ramoth if she is willing to share that story with you,\u201d Lorath suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll tell me?\u201d I wondered. I knew how prideful she was and did not like to admit weakness of any sort, and the situation in which she left the Knights was one of uncertainty for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot say for certain Darzhja,\u201d said Scabia, \u201cYet what I can say for certain is that you are a dragon that she deeply cares about and trusts. If she knows that you are personally involved in this mission, she\u2019ll be assured that the Knights truly do care about the fate of the orphans and that our pledge to give her the resources she needs to care for them properly is sincere, rather than seeing this as a way to earn a few political points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel very warm inside at that sentiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, I feel that we have wasted enough time here as it is,\u201d said Scabia, her expression hard and firm again, \u201cYou\u2019ll find the eggs at the southern gate ready for transport. A squad of humanoid knights will also be present to help you escort the eggs to their intended destination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a plumb of smoke after hearing this. Frankly, I did not trust armed humanoids of any sort anywhere near an unhatched little one. In my eyes, they all had the potential of being egg-stealers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath placed a claw upon my shoulder, and I felt my hearts skip a beat, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Darzhja, I\u2019ll tell the humanoids to make sure that they keep their distance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but blush deeply, nor help but fantasize that the clutch of eggs that we would be protecting may one day be our own. Those thoughts danced in my mind as I made my way toward the southern gate with Lorath at my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, I found the eggs arranged neatly in a large wheeled carriage. Underneath it was a magically conjured fire; one that would warm the eggs but not burn the cushion that they lay upon. The humanoid Knights were wise enough to immediately get out of my way as I rushed forward and placed myself right next to the egg carriage. I lowered my head and placed my nuzzle upon each of them, murring protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn happened to be on guard at the gate that afternoon. Whether it was by design or coincidence, I'd never know, yet once again, the enigmatic yet agonizingly handsome Bronze Drake always knew when to select the most awkward moments imaginable to show up. I watched as he and Lorath merely stared at each other for a long while, neither knowing what to make of such a situation. Then he turned to face me, and when he did so, there was this most awkward feeling, something between anxiety and distaste while blushing all the while. I expected Fangorn to make one of his patented perverted jokes, yet that gaze of his, there was so much turmoil in those eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I saw Lorath lean his head forward and begin to whisper something I could not hear to Fangorn. The bronze dragon tensed up noticeably for a moment before facing me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, I-I want you to know that\u2026that\u201d cried Fangorn. His voice seemed to lack its usual biting edge, no doubt because of Lorath\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head sideways, more than a little put off by Fangorn\u2019s awkwardness, \u201cYes? Is there something you wish to tell me? Can\u2019t you see that Lorath and I are on an important mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice came out extremely harshly; perhaps it was because I was on edge that I was watching the eggs, or it was just an automatic response for anything Fangorn said and brining up Lorath's name was a defense mechanism. Or maybe because his eyes burning with an intensity that almost made me faint, and that the only way for me to settle myself was to lash out in desperation. Whatever the reason was, somehow, I regretted the tone that I had taken, as it seemed as if Fangorn looked like he really wanted to say something and appeared as if he\u2019d been stabbed by a ballista. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI just\u2026 never mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn then made a concerted effort to appear as if he were addressing any other individual passing through, \u201cI\u2026 apologize for interrupting your mission. You have clearance to continue on with your cargo into the city.\u201d He then stepped aside with a pained deliberateness. I couldn\u2019t bear to see the expression on his face. It was shocking how much I was tempted to shout out and have Fangorn tell me whatever intended to tell me, even if it turned out to be something rude and perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I passed by into the street, I couldn\u2019t help but grit my teeth together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFangorn\u2026 why do you always have to be so\u2026so\u2026\u201d I said with a quiet voice. I couldn\u2019t find that last word though. Right when I thought I had Fangorn figured out, he would pull off something like this. He always made me feel, unsure and insecure. I shifted my gaze back toward Lorath, hoping that would distract me from this emotional turmoil. It made it worse. I wanted nothing more than to simply screa in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, I shifted my gaze back toward the little ones. Somehow, they seemed to have sensed my emotional turmoil through their eggshells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle ones\u2026 it would seem that I\u2019m not ready to care for ones of my own yet\u2026\u201d I sighed.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unable to help myself, I kept looking over my shoulder for hidden dangers lurking in the tall buildings all around as I came up the rear of the small procession passing down the teirs of New Alveri; I winced everytime the wagon hit a bump or loose cobble and cursed the ineffectiveness of humaniod ground transport. I was being paranoid I knew. The eggs were safe from all foreseeable harm what with Lothar in front, myself in the rear and a full squadron of Knights in and around the wagon. It would take a small army to capture the eggs now... Even so, I would not feel safe until they were secured at the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the tiers from the height of the Temple entrance at the very peak of New Alveri seemed like a chore compared to flying. We were forced to walk quarter turns around each tier, passing lower through several guarded gates into lower tiers on a zigzagging path. Still it was the only way, though my nerves were half frazzled by acute hyperawareness by the time Lady Ramoth's orphanage came into view. Upon arriving at its entrance, the first thing that struck me was just how small and cramped it seemed in comparison to before I left. It wasn\u2019t that I had grown physically larger in any dramatic sense, rather it was that up until that day, my life had been a simple and routine one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt oddly nervous as I stepped forward then. The archway leading into the complex of caverns was perfumed with Lady Ramoth\u2019s familiar scent, as well as those of the orphans and the humanoid priests that provided for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young green dragoness stepped forward out of the gloomy passageway. It was Ophelia. I studied her for a moment. She seemed older and far more mature than the last time I\u2019d seen her, likely having grown into her new responsibilities for the younger orphans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, h-how can I help you?\u201d she asked. She seemed a little bit intimidated standing in front of a pair of armored Knights alongside their humanoid auxiliaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOphelia!! Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d I cried, stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studied me for a moment, looking beyond the heavy armor which covered my hide, then Her eyes went wide, \u201cDarzhja!?\u201d she called out. My jaw curved into a smile. She rushed forward and threw her head against mine. I caressed her with my wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I was worried about you Darzhja\u2026\u201d stammered Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wings unfurled a little, \u201cYou were worried about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast I heard was that you got in a fight with a guard and got thrown into a dungeon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d said Lorath, as he stepped forward, \u201cYet we are here on an important mission.\u201d It might have seemed insensetive of Lorath to interupt, but I realized that it was I who was out of place. This was offcial business and there was a certain propriety that had to be upheld, especially in front of our humanoid peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d said Ophelia, taking a step back, her gaze eying Lorath wearily. I stepped back, but surprisingly, Lorath came forward to address Ophelia directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Ophelia,\u201d he said, performing a dramatic bow before the green dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia angled her head away and let out an embarrassed \u2018eep\u2019, and folding her wings against her back, \u201cYou\u2026really don\u2019t have to call me that\u2026\u201d she stammered unsteadily. I couldn\u2019t help but rumble with amusement; Lorath was irresistible for dragonesses of all ages, shapes and sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but I insist,\u201d he answered, \u201cI am Sir Lorath, if it is not too much trouble may I speak with Lady Ramoth, the matron of this facility?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 all right\u2026\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia flashed Lorath one last bashful look, before dashing back inside the orphanage and was for a few moments again the rambunctious immature drakka that I remembered. We had only to wait a few minutes, the magicked brazier under the wagon behind us crackling merrily, before my former mistress came forth. When I saw her, I couldn\u2019t help but call out with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Ramoth!!\u201d I called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!! It has been far too long. I\u2019ve missed you so much\u2026\u201d she answered, giving me that soothing, grandmotherly winged hug of hers I had missed so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back and scanned her gaze over me. Her eyes glowed with pride. \u201cYou look all grown up now Darzhja. A Holy Knight!! I trust that you have behaved yourself thus far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly\u2026\u201d I answered with a half smile. I couldn\u2019t help but think back to that \u2018time\u2019 I\u2019d had with Thereesa, no doubt it was something that Lady Ramoth would have disapproved of. Lady Ramoth gave me that piercing look of hers, as if she could relive every exact moment I\u2019d spent with the Knights thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath then stepped forward, and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Ramoth. It is indeed an honor to finally meet you in person,\u201d said Lorath in deference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026yes\u2026\" answered Ramoth, her eyes narrowing slightly, \"You must be\u2026 Lothar if I\u2019m not mistaken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorath my Lady,\u201d he corrected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d heard of you from Scabia that you\u2019d be the head of this little envoy. Quite the charmer I see?\u201d answered Lady Ramoth with mildly veiled skepticism. Judging purely by her tone of voice, one would have thought that Lorath had come recruiting for young drakka for the cinnabar dens. I could only wonder how she would have reacted to the temple dispatch had I not been present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome would say that indeed,\u201d answered Lorath with a smile, calmly ignoring Lady Ramoth's tone.  \u201cIn any case, as you may have heard from Lady Scabia, we have recovered a number of unborn hatchlings from smuggling rings all over New Alveri. However, a large number of these have not been reclaimed by their parents, and thus, the Knights have humbly requested of you to take them in and care for them, if you are willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ramoth held her gaze over the unhatched little ones with a loving yet weary gaze. She was the sort of dragonesses that when things got tougher, she worked even harder than she did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will never turn away hatchlings in need of caring,\u201d said Ramoth. Her head then darted toward me and Lorath, \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve come to understand that there are a few contracts for us to go over I\u2019m sure. The humanoid Knights will wait outside to keep watch so we aren\u2019t bothered,\u201d she ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamoth sighed, first toward the sacks of gems that were to be her compensation, and then toward the large basket of eggs snuggled in hay over the warmth of the brazier. \u201cI suppose I am in no position to refuse am I? Rest assured that my staff and I will do all we can to care for them,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors, we thank you deeply,\u201d bowed Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then. I suppose I should start getting the paperwork and all that other bureaucratic nonsense taken care of.\u201d Lady Ramoth seemed already partially drained by the exchange. I couldn't help but notice the way she faced me even while speaking to Lorath. It seemed rude, but then perhaps to her Lorath represented the Temple and a whole lot of bad memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath then switched his gaze toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we are beginning a more formal association with Lady Ramoth's organization, we also need to know the names of all the fledglings in the orphanage so they can be properly accounted for in our records. Darzhja, can I trust you to inspect the premises?\u201d said Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d I immediately offered. While Lorath was a chivalrous dragon, I got the impression that Lady Ramoth wasn't comfortable enough to allow him in the company of the orphans themselves. Lorath was smart enough to recognize this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, I\u2019ll get someone to help you out,\u201d she cried. Lady Ramoth curved her head into the hallway. She called forth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCallisto!!\u201d she cried shrilly, \u201cCome over here now!!\u201d she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young silver drake I had never seen before rushed out of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lady Ramoth?\u201d he answered. I studied the silver dragon. He looked smart and capable, so much so I wondered how he\u2019d ended up in the orphanage in the first place. In many ways, he reminded me achingly of Blaze. Not that there were many physical similarities between a silver dragon and a fire dragon, but there was that trustworthy younger brother quality to Callisto that reminded me of the still missing Fire Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be so kind as to assist Darzhja in obtaining a record of all the orphans?\u201d said Ramoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can count on me!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you must be Darzhja then!! In the short time I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve already learned how all the orphans hold you in very high regard,\u201d he cried. \u201cI heard a lot about you from Ophelia, especially how you wanted to become a Knight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got quite a ways to go though,\u201d I answered, thinking of Lady Ramoth, \u201cIts only been a few weeks since I left to become a Knight, but it feels like I\u2019ve been gone much longer. There\u2019s a lot of new faces here, like yourself for instance.\u201d I answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019ll introduce you then\u2026\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto took me through the rooms. The younger wingless orphans that I recognized screamed excitedly when I passed by, and I took the time to address them like a conquering hero. However, there were quite a few, as many as a third of them perhaps, that didn\u2019t know whom their longer tenured fellows were talking about, and gave me rather scared and frightened looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about twice the number of both humanoid and draconic staff now, hired in the wake of the disaster. The place was bustling with engineers and their crews also as they dug and chiseled in hallways and rooms that had not existed a few weeks ago, digging ever deeper down into the depths of the mountain. The by now familiar wing and talon tattoos of the ubiquitous Dragon Cult covered the forearms and scalps of nearly all of the workers. <i>And the work is still far from done.</i> I thought sardonically as I was led past them, thinking of all the new hatchling that were to be added to the already crowded complex. It was also apparent that the older orphans, like I\u2019d seen with Ophelia greeting us at the door and Callisto showing me around, whom informally categorized as those whose wings had emerged, were by now de-facto staff members as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, this may sound like a pretty random question, but do you know a dragoness named Heliana?\u201d asked Callisto, his eyes lighting up hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide at the recognition of the chubby silver drakka, \u201cHeliana? Yes I know her!! She\u2019s one of my friends in the dorm!! Are you related to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto grinned, \u201cShe\u2019s my cousin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto looked a little bit embarrassed, \u201cTechnically, she\u2019s my aunt, but mother\u2019s about a hundred years older than Heliana, she\u2019s a lot closer to my age than her own sister. Last I saw her was about a year ago when we had a sending off party for her when she was going to join the Knights. Yet last I heard was through a writing skin delivered before the attack,\u201d he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered Heliana telling me that her sister\u2019s husband had died during the attack, and that was her main motivation for being a Knight. Yet still, assuming that Callisto was being truthful with his relation, which I saw no reason why he wasn\u2019t, and that Heliana\u2019s family, while not exactly being rich, weren\u2019t destitute either so it seemed odd that he would be in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me asking, but since you still have family, how did you end up in the orphanage?\u201d I asked. Instead of answering verbally, he sighed and led me into one of the occupied rooms. I instantly wished that I hadnt asked. There was a silver dragoness  lying there on her belly, her eyes vapid and uncomprehending, as if her soul had already been sucked out of her body. A team of humanoid priests was attending to her, as if she were a hatchling just out of the egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2026\u201d said Callisto, forcing a smile, \u201cThis is Darzhja. She\u2019s a knight, and she\u2019s a good friend of Heliana\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I thought I saw the inert dragonesses eyes waver in recognition of that name. A sobering reality took hold. This was Heliana\u2019s sister, but the chubby dragoness hadn\u2019t shared that fact to me; only that her mate had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Silvania\u2026\u201d I bowed, taking a look at the name plaque beside her cot, \u201cYour sister has improved quite a lot. She\u2019s fighting for you every day, and wishes you well\u2026 So please, don\u2019t give up.\u201d I said encouragingly. Callisto\u2019s mother let out an incoherent noise, and Callisto answered her back with encouragements. I couldn\u2019t help but be both saddened but at the same time amazed that he managed to keep up his wits about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto had to take a breath after leaving the room so we could continue the evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how did she end up like that?\u201d I stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad was bleeding to death, and Mom went hysterical and tried to use her magic to keep his spirit attached to his body, but she lost her mind doing so.\" Callisto's eyes were distant at he continued, \"The fire gutted our home and our bank as well. All of my parents' records and things were gone. I-I tried to get someone to help us get our money... b-but Mom can't identify herself, you know...\" The young drake had to swallow and pause. He sniffed and then continued; I didn't know how he could be so strong, having no memory of my parents seemed peaceful, sublime compared to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The social worker I spoke to said that with the Trade prince Dek'saird gone, there was going to be a lot of confusion until things settled down. Someone will get our savings straightened out eventually. But it might be a long time until then... In the meantime, I didn\u2019t have any way to take care of her or transport her back to Damescara where Grandpa is. I had to literally drag her through the streets for a few days. The alchemist guild creeps were always hanging around like vultures; telling me that it would better if she were killed her for parts than dragging her around. Lady Ramoth was the only one who was willing to take us both in,\u201d he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then thought back to the time when Heliana had told me that her sister\u2019s husband had died during the attack. Evidently, she had hidden the fact that her sister had also gone crazy nor any mention of an orphaned nephew. I wondered if she hadn\u2019t heard, but more likely, it was perhaps too painful for her to share to me back then. It also added to the list of reasons why Heliana had been comforting herself with food before I\u2019d decided to help her. I also wondered why Heliana\u2019s father hadn\u2019t been able to ensure that at the very least that her oldest daughter would be able to afford a better hospital, or ensure that Callisto would not have to live in the orphanage. Perhaps they had spent all of their hard earned savings to ensure that Heliana would get the opportunity to become a Knight, and left only enough for themselves to survive. Callisto was obviously a very smart and capable young drake, and I wondered if he resented the fact that he was left with virtually nothing after the disaster. Yet if he did, he sure hid his resentment quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn't mean to get you all depressed Darzhja. Mom seemed quite happy knowing that Heliana\u2019s doing better. Next time you see Heliana, tell her that we both said hi all right?\u201d answered Callisto, trying to screw his expression into a cheerful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure will\u2026\u201d I answered. Heliana would definitely be glad to know that her cousin, while not in the most ideal circumstance, was doing more than all right considering what they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater as I walked down a long hallway, I spotted a slim figure within one of the storage rooms out of the corner of my eye. I slowly turned around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Callisto led me through the rest of the orphanage, as I made sure that everything was properly recorded. One of the humanoid priests had accompanied us to write it down on paper. There was only one corridor left. As I walked down the long hallway, I spotted a slim figure within one of the storage rooms out of the corner of my eye. I slowly turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Iskierka. Though I shouldn\u2019t have, my gaze switched right toward the amputated wing joint. Fastened with a series of rough leather straps to the still stitched and livid stump was a rather crude wood and canvas simulacrum painted gold. Her body was still covered with a number of bandages from the other wounds she had sustained during the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to how much she had suffered, the pain she was in when she had lost her wing, never to fly again. Yet she stood, calm and serene. She was busily and contently rummaging for her drawing skins, like she had prior to the attack. She had always been such a wonderful drawer, not to mention the best singer out of all of us; and, as much it was painful to admit now, probably was the prettiest among the orphaned drakka before she had lost her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, Ophelia rushed into the storage room, \u201cIskierka!! Should you be up and about right now?\u201d she cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all right Ophelia. It doesn\u2019t hurt so much to move around anymore\u2026 In fact, I thought it would be nice if I could start drawing again!!\u201d said Iskierka, gesturing toward the leather skins. She sounded resigned to her fate, yet hid whatever despair she felt about losing her wing with that soft smile of hers. That was when she saw me. \"Darzhja! Ancestors! It's been a long time. I haven't seen you since you saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grimaced, feeling terrible for the gold drakka's jubilant expression. I had not seen her since I'd held her down so that the doctors could saw off her wing. I'd been too afraid to face her. My voice shook. \u201cIskierka\u2026 When I left the orphanage\u2026 I should have stayed and said goodbye to you. Yet I was a coward\u2026\u201d I choked out, \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to see your\u2026your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face suddenly grew concerned, \u201cDarzhja, don\u2019t blame yourself for what happened,\u201d she said, placing her head next to mine. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m lucky that you were there for me that night, and that you got me out of the artists guild. I\u2019m still alive because of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was amazed that she could remain so poised after such disasters. Perhaps it was because of the fact we were orphans and expected tragedy, and thus were able to bounce back better when it actually occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIskierka was quick to shift from this most depressing topic, as she gazed up and down my armor and cried, \u201cI\u2019m also glad that you were able to fulfill your dreams and become a Knight!!\u201d she said with an encouraging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts a lot harder than I thought it would be. In training, there\u2019s this evil Deathwing Lieutenant named Shadia who drives us as if we were her slaves...\u201d Was it a crime to complain of such trivialities to one who was maimed irrepairably? Still, I could think of little else that Iskeirka would be able to relate to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she really that evil? Perhaps she\u2019s doing so only because she wants all of you to be as strong as possible,\u201d said Iskierka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so, but its hard to tell knowing her.\u201d I said, ducking my eyes and thinking of the time she'd hobbled my wing with a leather holster and forced me to glide and climb through a course meant for flying. Though I ought to be grateful I had a wing... {i }Great Ancestors above! Will I ever be able to stop thinking about her wing?!{/i } I chided myself, wishing things could be as they had been between us. I wanted to change the subject again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Callisto broke the silence, sensing the awkwardness that had taken hold. He\u2019d been eyeing the sketches that Iskierka had been working on. \u201cWow Iskierka, I didn\u2019t know you were such a skilled drawer!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026its nothing really\u2026\u201d she said Iskierka bashfully, folding her one good wing behind her back. The few open skins at her feet displayed a watery stylized version of New Alveri as seen from the cliffside landing, I knew; it captured both the soaring heights of the upper tiers and the Temple as well as the dimmer dregs of the levels below. There was also something that looked to me to be abstract, though I caught traces of what might have been wings or claws moving through the fluid landscape. Then again, it might have been upside down for all I could tell; I had about as much aptitude for art as I did for magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Iskierka!!\" Ophelia interjected as Iskeirka was moving to gather her fallen skins, \"You\u2019re a wonderful artist and we all know how much it means to you!! How about we help you move your art supplies back to your room?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you really don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d said Iskierka, curving her head away, modest as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we insist,\u201d I answered, \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto, Ophelia and I carried Iskierka\u2019s art supplies back toward the small private room she\u2019d been given where the priests could attend to her injuries, located back in the direction of the entrance; the dragon cult priest that continued to dog my steps was too small and frail to help with the heavy skins and tools. As we headed there, I spotted Lady Ramoth and Lorath continue to conduct negotiations in the chapel. I was relieved that Ramoth looked a lot calmer than she did earlier, and also toward Lorath for that matter, for he was always calm and endlessly patient, even toward the most irascible people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Iskierka and Ophelia stopped right outside the chamber to gaze at him dreamily, purring slightly and wagging their tails back and forth, like love struck human maidens waiting for their dashing prince to come along and whisk them away in those fairy tales that Lina told me about. Lorath briefly turned in their direction, flashing that suave, friendly smile of his and raising his wing slightly, much to the annoyance of Lady Ramoth, and causing the two young drakka to yelp and skitter into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors Darzhja, is that Knight that accompanied you?\u201d cried Iskierka, smiling indolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Sir Lorath. I\u2019ve worked under him for a couple missions now,\u201d I answered, trying not to blush or squeal in glee myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was movement outside the chamber..... </span></div></div>",

You will find both the original and copies of the full medical records and documentation of each of the orphans, along with the evaluation of the orphanage\u2019s facilities,\u201d I cried, trying to keep myself as composed and professional as possible. I gestured toward the humanoid priest who\u2019d I had help me write it on paper, and after making sure he had properly recorded what I had asked, gently slipped the stack of paper it into a small leather satchel strapped down close to his breastplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you kindly Darzhja,\u201d cried Lorath appreciatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath then shifted his gaze toward the other orphans. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing these are your old friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir. I apologize if I did not let you know in advance sir, but I wished to make sure they were doing well\u2026\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense taken at all Darzhja. In fact, I was hoping to stop by to greet you all for a brief moment,\u201d said Lorath. He first turned toward Ophelia, \u201cLady Ophelia, I must once again thank you for being such a charming hostess for us today,\u201d said Lorath, bowing again, which made Ophelia grin extremely wide. His gaze then shifted toward Iskierka, \u201cAnd may I have the privilege of your name young dragoness?\u201d said Lorath. From the jaw of any other drake, it would have sounded superficial and corny, yet with Lorath is was actually genuine. The way I could tell, was that there was not the single moment in which his gaze lingered on her missing wing, which made Iskierka swoon all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Iskierka, my Lord Lorath\u2026\u201d cried Iskierka, her eyes sparkling. Lorath\u2019s switched his gaze toward Iskierka\u2019s sketches. \u201cBy the Ancestor, I am quite amazed at what you have managed to create with only wax styluses. I wasn\u2019t sure it was possible to combine the bold style of Lord Pentangelor with the graceful texture of Lady Karla in that fashion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t know the first thing about art, but I was surprised that Lorath would be so informed and knowledgeable about these type of things. The fact that he did meant that Iskierka looked ready to faint from glee, \u201cYou really like them that much!!\u201d squealed Iskierka. \u201cY-you\u2019re not just telling me this to make me feel better are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would never give false critique in that manner. You have a rare artistic talent indeed Lady Iskierka. Don\u2019t let anybody else tell you otherwise,\u201d he encouraged. Iskierka nodded briskly, seeming more confident and encouraged, as she had ever been at any point since the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto, more than a little squeamish from the lovestruck behavior of the young drakka, opted for a more conventional introduction, \u201cI\u2019m Callisto. I just got here right after the attack\u2026\u201d said Callisto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pleasure to meet you. Maybe its just me, but you resemble\u2026what\u2019s her name\u2026 Heliana right?\u201d said Lorath, tilting his head sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d nodded Callisto, \u201cShe\u2019s my cousin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019ll be happy to know that you\u2019re safe,\u201d answered Lorath. Callisto merely nodded with a grin. He wasn\u2019t quite as skilled in charming drakes as with the drakka, in which I could honestly say if he had, it would have been more than a little unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case, I\u2019m going to discuss a few more details with Lady Ramoth. Darzhja, we\u2019ll be heading back to the Temple right afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need any help sir?\u201d I offered, even if contract negotiations were far from my strong suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the offer Darzhja, but I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m nearly finished anyhow. Why not share to your friends what the Knights have been like so far?\u201d said Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath then switched his gaze back toward the orphans, \u201cIts been a pleasure to meet you all, I hope that I will be able to see you again soon!\u201d he cried. Ophelia and Iskierka leaned against each other and waved exuberantly, while Callisto contented himself with just a respectful head bob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors Darzhja!! I\u2019m so jealous that you get to be around such a comely Drake all the time!!\u201d Ophelia interrupted, her eyes sparkling, \u201cIt must be so hard to concentrate on your work!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto rolled his eyes as he pretended not to have heard the drakka giggling, as he busied himself with setting up Iskierka\u2019s art stand on his lonesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be hard to maintain my discipline at times\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but admit. I tried to act more mature and less smitten than Ophelia and Iskierka were; after all I was officially a Knight, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure if I succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he your\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts skipped a beat, \u201cLorath? Well\u2026 I\u2019m not sure about that yet\u2026 He\u2019s a very chivalrous dragon to work with and he genuinely cares about me. And if things turned out that way, I wouldn\u2019t mind at all\u2026 He\u2019s kind, polite, caring and respectful,\u201d I cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay better than that jerk Fangorn\u2026\u201d I added, without thinking. I realized only after that these dragons would have no idea who I was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFangorn? Who\u2019s he?\u201d asked Ophelia, extending her neck inquiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a grunt, \u201cRemember when I told you how I challenged a Knight at the gate? That\u2019s Fangorn. He\u2019s a paranoid, perverted stalker with dominance fantasies whose sole purpose of existence is to make my life miserable. He always pops out of nowhere and says extremely rude and perverted things to me\u2026\u201d I snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be all that bad\u2026\u201d cried Iskierka, shifting her gaze away, \u201cMaybe he just doesn\u2019t know how to express himself very well. And perhaps in reality he likes you\u2026\u201d Iskierka's eyes slanted in the way that I knew so well. She was teasing me, like she had 30 years ago when we were both having our little crushes on the mature drakes, and the males our ages were having crushes on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew this, but still, I responded as if she were serious; Fangorn's name was like nail caught between my scales. \u201cTrust me, he\u2019s a jerk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swept my wings open in irritation, \u201cArrgh!! I don\u2019t want to talk about Fangorn right now!!\u201d I snapped, perhaps a bit too violently. Ophelia and Iskierka continued to giggle with intrigue. Perhaps they were using the subject of Fangorn to be in a more favorable position to command Lorath\u2019s favor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto, eager to get in on the conversation, but also wanting to move it away from drakka gossiping, then asked, \u201cWhat other interesting people have you met so far thus far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shared to the three younger orphans my friendship with both Lina and Thereesa, making sure to tone down the rather weird shenanigans that each of them faced, in Lina\u2019s case being her cheating mate and Thereesa her unusual sexual preferences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while we were reminiscing and engaging in a rather light tone of our conversation, I suddenly became aware of the one individual who was missing among this clique of older orphans</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDarzhja. Did you ever find out whatever happened to Blaze?\u201d asked Iskierka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head in regret, \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t been able to find him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlaze?\u201d said Callisto. \u201cI remember the two of you telling me that he went missing during the attack\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was kidnapped\u2026\u201d I snarled with an absolute certainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think that? I know you may not want to hear it, but could he have been killed?\u201d answered Callisto. I ground my teeth together. Considering how many dragons had died during the attack, it certainly was a possibility. Yet in my gut, I doubted that was the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I growled, \u201cMaybe its just me, but had he been killed, I would have found his body or at least detected his scent. He was definitely kidnapped\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto still didn\u2019t seem convinced. He certainly wasn\u2019t the sort of dragon to take any sort of intuition as tangible evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath, gazing about the small chamber to ensure nobody was overhearing us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will let you three in on a big secret. You have to promise not to tell anybody...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy first mission as a Knight was supposed to be a routine inspection of a storage facility in the Industrial district\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, won\u2019t you be kicked out if you tell us this?\u201d said Callisto, barely keeping his voice to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated for a moment. \u201cThe consequences of not telling you could be worse, so please hear me out,\u201d I whispered. \u201cDuring the inspection, we discovered that they had hidden a number of dragon eggs in a secret chamber. Instead of surrendering, the smugglers called forth their entire mercenary force to silence us. We were able to beat them, and when they were interrogated we learned that there was an entire underground smuggling network, other warehouses with stolen dragon eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the poor little ones, the ones that you brought to us here, were stolen from their parents?\u201d murmured Iskierka, quavering. I felt bad for having to frighten her like this, but there was no way that I would allow my fellow orphans to remain ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallisto took a breath, \u201cWhat were they planning on doing with so many stolen eggs?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to find that out, but I have no doubt it is for some terrible purpose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what does that have to do with Blaze going missing?\u201d said Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026I think I know what you\u2019re getting at\u2026\u201d murmured Callisto, his brows furrowing. \u201cIf these smugglers are capable of kidnapping that many eggs, and do so while hiding their operations, who\u2019s to say they aren\u2019t capable of kidnapping young dragons as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teeth snapped together, \u201cIn fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was those same people that orchestrated the attack. I mean, it\u2019s a lot easier to get away with these kind of things when things are in chaos\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long dark silence that permeated through the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped back and focused my gaze on each of the three orphans, \u201cNow you know what\u2019s at stake. I know that the streets are filled with all sorts of unsavory individuals, but this is entirely different circumstance all together. What happened to Blaze could happen to any of us if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut as long as we\u2019re here in the orphanage we should be safe right?\u201d said Ophelia, though she didn\u2019t look convinced by that in any stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true to a certain extent,\u201d I admitted, \u201cWe\u2019ve always relied upon Lady Ramoth to keep us safe, and we can continue to count on her. In fact, Lady Ramoth used to be a famous Holy Knight before she opened the orphanage\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of the three drakes widened with shock, but I held up a claw to prevent them from accidentally crying out and blowing our cover. \u201cYet not even Lady Ramoth can be everywhere at once. Nor for that matter can the people of New Alveri idly assume that the Knights will take care of everything sooner or later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you all this, because I need your help to ensure that the younger ones remain safe in the orphanage, and to make sure what happened to Blaze doesn\u2019t happen again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The glade where I was currently resting was filled with the scent of freshly spilled blood, a bullock\u2019s blood to be precise. It was late autumn and the now thoroughly deceased steer was particularly fat and delicious. I felt that cooking it would only spoil the fragrant, tasty juices, so I tore into it raw. After I had easily snapped the smaller animal\u2019s neck with a twist of my jaw, I opened its abdomen to get at the succulent liver and vitals. Needless to say, I had soon made a horrific mess. No one seemed to mind, however, particularly Lorath who lay beside me; though noticeably just out of range of the splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d developed the habit of taking our meals together. We both had our own different schedules, but this way we always got to see each other at least once every two or three days. We descended upon the Temple\u2019s cattle fields before twilight. I enjoyed watching the fierce orange sunset behind the mountains surrounding us whilst dining and then spending the starlit early evening with the comely blue drake before we each inevitably had to part. I did my best to delay each departure until it became habit. As far as I was concerned, we could remain in the windswept damp field until morning every time we met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lorath, his steer was still sizzling a short distance away. He\u2019d breathed on a stone until it had glowed and then stuffed it in the belly of the carcass to cook from the inside. The blue drake had at least had enough sense to enjoy the liver fresh. He lay sprawled casually on the grass opposite me, his wing carelessly draped over his thigh. Tail flicking idly through the grass behind him, he reached out with a claw to pluck a small cluster of tiny white flowers, which grew at the end of long stems. He asked absently, \u201cAre you the sort of dragoness who enjoys flowers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my bloody face from the now mostly empty interior of my steer. \u201cThose aren\u2019t flowers, they\u2019re weeds.\u201d I scoffed with a bit of smoke from each nostril and then clamped down on a haunch and tore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath flicked his scaled digits and the clump of flowers fell softly to disappear amongst the grass. He heaved a sigh. The sound came as loud as a thunderbolt to me and I started upright. Though there was blood dripping from my chin and bits of gristle stuck in my fangs, I let my concern show on my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. I got up and trotted over to where he was laying, I brushed my wing against his side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I called them weeds, they\u2019re\u2026 pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath smirked. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t figure you\u2019d like them, I know you\u2019d prefer a good sparring match any day of the week. That\u2019s why I like you Darzhja, you\u2019re different from any drakka I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but beam at his statement. Then he looked up and met my eyes. \u201cCome to think of it, how long have we been seeing each other now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned toothily. \u201cYou mean since I started seeing you, or <i>you</i> finally started seeing <i>me</i>?\u201d I laughed. I never kept it a secret that I\u2019d had my eye on him almost as soon as we were introduced\u2026 nor let him live down how long it had taken him to finally notice my attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as well and straightened his wing. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered myself down on my belly so I\u2019d be level with him, although as a blue dragon and a male to boot, his was still rather smaller and lighter than I was, but not by a whole lot. I lowered my head onto my forepaws and looked up at him. \u201cIt seems like forever\u2026\u201d I said dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s been three summers since <i>that</i> night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, <i>that</i> night. Unbidden, a goofy grin spread itself on my bloodstained chops. Lorath was of course talking about the night, about three months after our first real mission together to Lady Ramoth\u2019s escorting the precious dragon eggs, when I\u2019d finally snapped and gushed my heart and soul out to him in his lair. It\u2019d started out as a silly dare from Lina which she\u2019d given me after weeks of - recognizably in hindsight - annoying whining and complaining that he would never notice me. She\u2019d dared me to go to his officer\u2019s lair after dark, and I did and naturally Lorath had caught me almost instantly. What had started out as a game had quickly and heart-poundingly become serious and just then, I hadn\u2019t been able to take one more second of secret and unnoticed emotions any more. I\u2019d laid my heart out on the floor for him, and even broke down in tears while doing it. Lorath could have snapped me in two, right then and there. To think, a drakka so foolishly pursuing when it was her job to be aloof and make him pursue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lorath had reacted favorably and so began many a night of long talks and neck embraces. The relationship had grown further through our mutual work with the Knights; it was always a joy to work under him. It\u2019s still sometimes hard for me to believe that I\u2019d once been an orphan with little more prospect than whoring myself out on the streets for food. Though I was looking off into space for a moment as I recalled this, I soon returned and gave Lorath a friendly sock to his shoulder. \u201cWhy are you asking me questions you already know the answer to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller blue dragon lifted a claw and rubbed at his shoulder, more for show than anything else; I hoped. \u201cWell\u2026 I was just wanting to say that I really enjoy what we have together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my face calm and relaxed, but inside, I felt a sinking sensation. Despite our fondness for each other, it was still hard to pick up the nuances of his thought process. \u201cWell, I really enjoy what we have as well, Lorath. I\u2019ve never met another drake like you.\u201d It was hard to fight the temptation to gush. Ancestors! One would think that I would\u2019ve gotten better at this with time! I paused for a moment, then when it became clear that Lorath wasn\u2019t going to speak, I asked, \u201cIs there a reason why you\u2019d bring that up now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath lifted his head on his long neck up a little straighter. His powerful azure eyes seemed strained and I saw something in them that I wasn\u2019t used to: fear. \u201cMy brother\u2019s become engaged.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoken?!\u201d I asked, suddenly excited. \u201cWhen? To who?\u201d It took me a moment to notice that Lorath was not exactly excited for his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let a breath escape through his teeth and then said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be mated with Slytherilia. She\u2019s the heiress of a major clan under former Trade Prince Rek\u2019thalanar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRek\u2019thalanar\u2026\u201d I said, rolling the vaguely familiar name off my tongue. \u201cIsn\u2019t he in charge of those black dragons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsed to be. Remember, he was killed in the blast along with the other Trade Princes\u2026\u201d Lorath hung his head slightly. He didn\u2019t need to mention that one of those trade princes had happened to be his esteemed grandfather, whom Lorath had loved dearly as a family hero even if as the second son of his second son, he\u2019d received little personal attention growing up. Who\u2019d have thought that the second son would now be in control of a vast trade empire, a full quarter of the Empire\u2019s entire economic might? It was still daunting realizing just how much wealth Lorath\u2019s clan possessed, especially with the fact I had grown up with nothing. Though both his grandfather and his uncle were killed in the awful attack that had rocked New Alveri to its foundations, the chances of Lorath putting his claws on that inheritance remained miniscule. His older brother and his offspring would now have that privilege\u2026 in the coming centuries it would take for Lorath\u2019s father to become elderly and infirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d I said dumbly. \u201c\u2026So what\u2019s the big deal with the pairing? You don\u2019t seem too happy about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath shrugged. \u201cOf course, it is going to be a rather joyous occasion, with lots of pomp and circumstance, but to be honest I really don\u2019t know how I should feel\u2026 You know why they\u2019re getting matched up right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorath, please, I have no mind for politics and you know it.\u201d I pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake chucked and reached out to cuddle my head with his wing. \u201cMaybe your skull\u2019s too thick for your own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome a little closer and I\u2019ll show you the merits of having a thick skull.\u201d I growled playfully. I almost reached out to grab him for a quick tussle, but he simply laughed and folded his wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to find out the hard way thank you very much, certainly not now considering you\u2019re our \u2018Most Prospective Rookie\u2019\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tossed my head away bashfully, \u201cIt\u2019s an informal title. It doesn\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Words gone around that you almost pinned Shadia.\u201d Lorath purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the stones in my crop grumble and grind together. \u201cAlmost is most certainly not the same as definitely, especially with Shadia. I still think that she was simply luring me into a false sense of victory before she reversed my hold on her\u2026 She\u2019s as slippery as an eel you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath laughed at my wide-eyed expression, though for me, Shadia was and still remained a personal demon of my everyday life. Seeing the risk of losing tract of the conversation entirely, I said, \u201cSo why exactly is Loken marrying Slytherilia?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHopefully it\u2019s going to bring more money into our family and shore up our relations with Rek\u2019Thalanar\u2019s clan, although some are saying that they are showing signs of internal division. Honestly, I think Honored Grandfather would have done a better job situating my uncle, but although Loken now holds the same position as he had, he still seems a bit like second prize, unfortunately. I\u2019m sure that Father did the best he could do\u2026\u201d Lorath rattled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pained me severely that I could barely follow half of what Lorath was saying. This was important stuff to Lorath\u2019s background and I realized that all this time I\u2019d been admiring his personality and physical traits, I\u2019d learned only the bare bones of the complex politics that Lorath was - even marginally - involved in. I supposed that I\u2019d thought that since he\u2019d devoted his life to being a Holy Knight rather than working in the family trade empire it didn\u2019t really matter. It obviously did still affect him emotionally, though as was now plainly obvious. \u201cSo\u2026 you think your brother could do better? I ventured haphazardly. I had nothing against black dragons as a breed, though of all the ones I\u2019d met so far, none of them had struck me as a potentially good mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that,\u201d Said Lorath firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d  But Lorath just gritted his teeth and then rose to his feet.  I watched him pace away from me a few steps while he ruffled his smooth, luxurious wings before I rose to go after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was obvious, the only thing I could say was, \u201cSomething\u2019s really bothering you about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inclined his snout grimly.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense for me to feel like this but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d  I prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments, but he finally released his burden.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at his handsome, blue scaled face, but he was looking off into the dim, shadowy valley where the plump shapes of bovines could be seen, well away from the dragon scent, slumbering on their heavy hooves.  \u201cYou think you\u2019re going to be forced to marry, just like your brother.\u201d  I said, hoping that I was connecting the dots correctly.  Sometimes I wished Lorath would be a little less enigmatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath sighed and sat down on his haunches, though he kept his head high.  He turned to meet my wondering, fearful eyes.  \u201cYes.  But it doesn\u2019t make any sense for me to feel this way.  All of the power will be Loken\u2019s and then only if father meets a premature end.  More likely his hatchlings will be the eventual inheritors.  It makes no sense for me to be married off and yet, I still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026can\u2019t help feeling the way you do.\u201d  I finished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d  He breathed, and then sighing again, he leaned towards me and placed his head against the side of my neck.  I cradled his horned head under my jaw, relishing in his rich, pungent male odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want the embrace to end, and neither did Lorath apparently because it was I who first broke it.  I pulled away and said, \u201cWell, if it is so unlikely that you\u2019ll be obligated to marry for your family, why choose to be worried about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the thing, Darzhja.  I\u2019m not choosing to.  I\u2019m just filled with this sense of forboding, ever since I first heard of my brother\u2019s engagement.  And I can\u2019t make this feeling go away, no matter how I try to rationalize it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out and stroked the underside of his throat with the tip of my nose.  Lorath purred like a large cat as I did.  When I\u2019d finished, I asked, \u201cDid that feel better just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, he let an unreserved smile spread across his face.  \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it has nothing to do with the pairing at all.\u201d  I reached out and laid a wing across the drake\u2019s shapely, slender back.  \u201cYou\u2019re as tense as a cow in labor.  Maybe all you need is some personal time to relax and take your mind off of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath\u2019s eyes darted away but then lit up.  He spoke excitedly, so that his perfect white teeth showed as he spoke,  \u201cDo you remember what next month is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for my brain to process this sudden turn in conversation.  I flicked my tail several times and then answered.  \u201cIt has to do with that millennial thing right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s a tri-millennial and it\u2019s a week long celebration of Si\u2019Hazethant\u2019s victory over the ancient blood mages who\u2019d sought to enslave us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat jogged my memory.  \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right and not only did he win back freedom for the dragons of Nod, but he enslaved those blood mages in turn.  That\u2019s the ancient foundation for the Dragon Cult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.  And did you know that it\u2019s formally, a week long celebration?  That\u2019s how long the last siege of the last holdout of the blood mages took\u2026  Although there\u2019s likely to be festivities pretty much all month long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tossed my head eagerly.  \u201cOh, this is great!  Isn\u2019t this celebrated only once every hundred years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.  But since this is the third millennial, it\u2019s bound to be a huge celebration.\u201d  My eyes were already lighting up with images of banners and lights and parties and plays and parades\u2026 and the feasting.  Second only to once-per-decade event celebrating the rebuilding of the Temple and the symbolic start of the New Alverian Empire, this was the big dragon holiday in Nod.  While I was sitting there raptured and wondering how I could have forgotten such a major holiday - although to be fair, it had not yet occurred in my lifetime - Lorath spoke.  \u201cI\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d spend the holiday with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly startled by the question, nonetheless, I murred softly and rubbed Lorath\u2019s back with my wing, my talon brushing against the upraised ridges of his spine.  \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to ask, silly!  Of course, I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath grinned hugely.  \u201cThat\u2019s great news.  I\u2019ll let my people in Damescara know that I\u2019ll be bringing a guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?  Damescara?\u201d  I stammered.  The name of the Empire\u2019s primary coastal and trade city had dropped on me from out of sky it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Damescara.  That\u2019s where the biggest celebration will be.  The blood mages had holed up in the sea caves to the north of what\u2019s now the city, where they thought fire couldn\u2019t reach them, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know that bit of trivia, in fact.  But it was the name of the city which was echoing around in my skull.  <i>Damescara\u2026 Damescara\u2026</i>  Even the name sounded vaguely foreign.  And yet it was the place where my current lair mate Heliana originally hailed from and where her cousin Calixsto\u2019s sole remaining family - aside from his largely comatose mother - resided.  The poor brave child still lingered in the orphanage, clinging to the hope that his mother would eventual recover or that his family funds would finally be unlocked from the confusion and burned documents left behind in the wake of the bomb.  \u201cLorath\u2026\u201d  I started slowly,  \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026  I\u2019ve never actually been very far from New Alveri.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his credit, Lorath did not make light of my confession.  He just grinned and leaned in closer, pressing his shoulder against mine and placing his paw over mine.  \u201cThat\u2019s alright.  I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get lost or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it seemed like the horizon was opening ahead of me and as I looked at its bare, naked surface, I realized something unsettling.  I was afraid.  \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026  Are you sure it will be better in Damescara, I mean, New Alveri is the heart of the empire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath smirked and punched my foreleg.  Though I growled at him, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think those wings on your back were meant to get you from the upper tiers to the lower ones, do you?  Trust me, dragons fly from one end of the country to the other.  Getting to Damescara will be easier than snapping a calf\u2019s neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d  I growled, considering Lorath\u2019s words.  Though I already knew that I\u2019d follow Lorath anywhere he cared to lead me.  \u201cBut do you know what\u2019s even easier than snapping a calf\u2019s neck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  asked Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned as I snaked my tail up behind him.  \u201cGetting the drop on you!\u201d  I grabbed the base of his neck with my tail and pulled him down as I rose.  I laughed as he growled and recovered quickly.  Of course, Lorath was an officer of the Holy Knights and well trained, but since we were wrestling and not actually fighting, I had a huge weight advantage over him.  He squealed deliciously when I finally pinned him down under my bronze bulk, though technically he was still able to flap a wing in my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMercy!\u201d  cried Lorath and I let him stand.  He shook the grass and dirt from his scales like a dog and I laughed.  Prissy about his appearance as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both stood and panted at each other for a while, both grinning like idiots.  I honestly don\u2019t think I could have loved him anymore than I did right then.  Lorath sniffed and rubbed the side of his snout with a paw.  \u201cI think my bullock\u2019s gone cold now because of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sauntered back over to where the remains of my kill were waiting for me.  Training had hardened my stomach and despite the tossing and turning just now, I wasn\u2019t willing to let the rest of this particularly tasty ration go to waste.  \u201cI told you just to tuck in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath slowly shook his head as he walked back to his meal.  \u201cJust like a beast, my darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m your beast, and don\u2019t forget it.\u201d  I answered and before more words could be exchanged, I was digging into the carcass\u2019s meaty hindquarters and swallowing large chunks of muscle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I returned to the barracks that night, beaming. Lorath had invited me to Damescara for the holidays!! The thought of it was both scary and wonderful at once, and sent my hearts pounding. Heliana was already waiting for me at our lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!! Darzhja!!\u201d she cried excitedly. Though she\u2019d been my lairmate for the past few years now, I still found myself half expecting Lina to poof in front of me, giggling, while sprinkling mind-altering fairy dust all over me. Nonetheless, I gave her a warm smile, and always looked forward to having her company, no matter how much some of the other drakka disparaged her for her weight. Of course, Tsarra and her whores never called us the \u2018fat sisters\u2019 directly to my face, lest she receive a sounder thrashing than usual on the sparring ring. Besides, Heliana had lost quite a bit of weight these past couple of years, and while she would never be trim, she could keep up with the pack in most exercises now, and Shadia didn\u2019t nearly torment her as much now. That being said, as I came inside, Heliana had to scoot over to the side a bit so that the two of us would have enough space to lay side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly look happy today, might it have something to do with Lorath?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMmmmhmmm\u2026\u201d  I purred, his image forming in my mind. \u201cLorath\u2019s invited me to Damescara for the Third Millenial!!\u201d I squealed with a higher pitched voice than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s wonderful!!\u201d she cried, placing her head next to mine. I couldn't help but shudder inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m actually rather nervous\u2026\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never been outside the confines of New Alveri before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana puffed, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine Darzhja. Damescara is only half the size of New Alveri, and besides, it\u2019ll be good to see new places. As it turns out, I\u2019m headed there also to visit father and the rest of my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said, my head perking up, \u201cSince we\u2019re both headed there, why don\u2019t you come with the two of us!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorath won\u2019t mind will he?\u201d asked Heliana apprehensively. The last thing she wanted to be was a third wheel, but considering that Heliana was a very close friend and didn\u2019t really have any serious designs on Lorath besides the usual admiration of his good looks that wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorath was the one who asked me to go out with him, so therefore if I decide I want to bring a friend along, he\u2019s in no position to refuse. Besides, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to have you along!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really mean it!?\u201d she replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!!\u201d I answered, giving her a reassuring smile. Having her along also eased a lot of the worry and uncertainty I had for going alone with Lorath, so things wouldn\u2019t be quite so tense and formal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me what happens at the festivities?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never been to one of the big celebrations, but they do have smaller celebrations once every five years. Usually, they have a parade down the mainstreets and fireworks at the docks, but this party is going to be a million times bigger!! Oh!! I don\u2019t know where to even begin!! A week is hardly long enough for me to show you everywhere!! There\u2019s going to be shopping, wrestling competitions, parades, but most of all feasting!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana\u2019s eyes grew big at the thought of her favorite pastime, \u201cChefs from all over the world are going to come!! The jungle orcs from the south are preparing a herd Water Buffalo!! Fresh porpoises caught straight from the sea!! Big horn elk from the north!! I heard that the most famous chef from the far orient, Lung Chi-fan, is bringing over an entire ship of the most exotic animals from his homeland for us to sample!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw was all but watering with a savage hunger, this despite having just eaten only a couple of hours before. \u201cOh Darzhja!! I can already taste them!!\u201d she swooned. Yet as it always was with Heliana and food, she took things a step further, as while lost in her fantasy of feast she lowered her neck and began nibbling at my arm as if it were the leg of a prime steer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeliana, I\u2019m not on the menu you know\u2026\u201d I said with a slight annoyance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d she apologized playfully, lifting her jaw away.  I stuck my tongue at her, and we burst into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Shadia burst into the entrance of our lair, as usual looking as if she brought the souls of the condemned with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcited for the holidays are we hmm?\u201d she said with her oily tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes Lady Shadia\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but blurt out. Even her presence couldn't shake me out of my good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet its not the holidays yet is it?! Torches out in 10 minutes understand fat sisters?!\u201d she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mam\u2026\u201d we responded simultaneously. Shadia scowled, before storming away to repeat her message to the next pair of recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe let out a sigh of relief. Even though Heliana had improved, Shadia was still the hardest on the two of us. Then again, every drakka in the dorm swore that Shadia made a special exception for them. Heliana angled her head toward the switch that activated the glowing torches, making a concentrated expression for a brief moment, before the switch flicked off, leaving the room dark. It was a little trick that she\u2019d picked up a couple of years ago, and now she could do it easily, though whenever I tried that same rudimentary magic trick I still looked as if I were trying to lay an egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get how you do that so easily\u2026\u201d I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana merely shrugged, \u201cWell, since you\u2019re so good at sparring its only fair\u2026 anyhow, good night Darzhja\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Heliana\u2026\u201d I answered with a smile. I closed my eyes. Yet it was quite a while before I was able to fall asleep, my mind fantasizing about the festival and the time I would spend with Lorath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although I was still wrapped up in the excitement of Lorath\u2019s offer the following morning, I still had to endure the same routine of a cadet in the Holy Knights as I had for the past few years now.  Wake up to the morning call filling the caverns, walk down stairs through the showers and shuffle along with everyone else as well all moved towards the large landing platform set in the inner wall of the Temple.  The exhilarating sensation of falling and the cold wind blasting into my face never ceased to shake all remaining sleepiness from my eyes, however, the sheer joy of flying to the training grounds had lost most of its former joy through sheer routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the grounds, we lined up, drakes on the right, drakka on the left, as always and smallest to biggest.  Shadia, as always was there, and also the shovel-clawed sergeant Fathgar barking orders at us as we stretched the kinks out of our bodies and then performed rigorous exercise to strengthen them.  All of us were stronger now, that is the ones in my original class who were still here.  Some had graduated, like Thereesa, and were now full fledged Knights and had other business than to exercise with the recruits; not that they were not expected to remain physically fit as well of course.  But others had indeed dropped out when the training had proven too much for them.  It pleased me to no end that of Tsarra\u2019s Bitch-cliche, two had not had what it took, reducing her and her one friend down to the bitch-duo; which unfortunately did not roll as easily off the tongue, even in Draconic.  New recruits filled the positions of those who left so it seemed that the rookie group remained at about the same time always.  Though the new faces that turned up always seemed to surprise me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised me even more was the fact that I was viewed largely as a senior cadet.  Thereesa had had to explain to me that progression in the cadet level was based on performance, not simply seniority.  A dragoness could spend a decade or two in the cadet level - although if one did not eventually progress, that dragon was usually dropped after a certain period of time - whereas another might spend half that time.  Exceptional dragons were advanced more quickly, the better to be of use to the Order sooner.  So it was that when Shadia hounded me, called me an oversized lizard and as slow as a frozen shit sluice, I still saw a black-eyed demon, but I also saw something more.  I saw someone who was going to get me to where I wanted to go faster than I could have ever done on my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exercise there were drills and also classes.  The drills were not at all dissimilar from what our humanoid counterparts went through.  We simply moved in formation, practice for following orders and moving in a group, however, moving on the ground was the smallest part of it.  We flew in several different formations and had to reorganize on command.  For the humans, drills were mostly psychological work and practice for ceremonies.  For us, these airborne formations had very practical use.  The classes were my least favorite part of the whole experience.  We divided into subgroups, usually about twelve dragons each, and suffered through lectures from both dragon and humanoid instructor.  Unless there was some equipment needed, lessons were usually outside and conducted on large chalk boards wheeled out onto the field.  I was told that our education was equivalent to pretty much the best available in the upper tiers.  But the nuances of Ancient and Modern Draconic and even of written Common were tedious and mathematics made my head hurt.  The worst was Magical Theory which didn\u2019t even have the decency to include practical spells.  However, through intensive practice, I picked up a cantrip to stop a cut from bleeding during a First Aid lesson; it helped that I accumulated lots of opportunities to practice during training and sparing.  The only class in which I was vaguely interested in was Alverian History, which sadly was among the lesser taught subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still had guard duty at the front gates three days a week.  I\u2019d progressed to the point where sometimes I wasn\u2019t even supervised.  Although both my partner and I were fairly confident that I could take and would-be trespassers at this point.  I hadn\u2019t yet been tested, but I figured it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that it was mid-afternoon when we were released from lessons.  It seemed a minor reward to be released on time.  We were usually penalized as a group for poor performance and when Heliana had been struggling - and I defending her - staying late had been the norm almost since the start.  But she\u2019d dropped a lot of weight that first year and although she was still pretty heavy for a drakka and had shown less progress this past year, she was gaining steadily in both stamina and speed.  Despite her ample waistline, she could keep up with the group now, and I\u2019d say she was a ready match for most in old fashioned grappling; save for yours truly, naturally.  And those times when we were matched up for sparing, despite the fact that she was rather soft under the scales, she threw her weight around effectively and I had to be careful and play against her weaknesses, like her smaller center of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when Heliana dropped next to me like a boulder smacking the earth as I was pacing away from yet another dull class.  She greeted me enthusiastically and then added, \u201cI just can\u2019t stop thinking about this trip to Damescara!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, it\u2019d been on my mind all day too\u2026 that and Lorath\u2019s pleasingly cut and shapely form.  I sighed, \u201cI know, but thinking about it is just making the time go by slower.  I could barely stay awake as Dr. Evermore droned on about acceleration, vector shift, and derivation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!\u201d  Heliana scolded slightly.  \u201cThat stuff\u2019s important!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?  I\u2019m not going to be a scholar\u2026 hey!\u201d  I remarked and receive a cuff from Heliana\u2019s wing as a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time we fly, we take those sorts of things into account, even if we don\u2019t know them.  I for one, find it neat to explain what we do everyday in a rational sort of way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d  I sneered, \u201cI\u2019d rather go flying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana, however batted me again. \u201cYou might be an ace out on the field, Darzhja, but they are going to keep you here as long as I am if you can\u2019t pass the classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted roughly, but there was truth to what the Silver was saying.  I tossed my head, \u201cUrgh\u2026 can\u2019t we talk about this later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.  Want to join me on the hunting ground?  The steer look especially juicy right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink back to last night I could not help my mouth watering.  \u201cI know.  I had one last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana chuffed, \u201cI figured as much, I forgot that you only take meals with <i>Mr. Handsome, Rich Blue Drake.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled at my friend, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her tongue out at me,  \u201cOf course I\u2019m jealous, who wouldn\u2019t be!\u201d  My eyes widened, but then she wrapped a big wing around me, \u201cBut I\u2019m also happy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and was comforted by Heliana\u2019s warmth and soft figure pressed against mine.  As the silver withdrew her wing, she said, \u201cSay, have you told Lina yet about your plans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve had the chance, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have spoken to her through one of those mirrors\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana was referring to the demon powered relay devices set up all around the Temple.  Perfectly harmless, or so I\u2019d been assured.  But they delivered voice messages only and only in tandem; actual conversation was impossible.  \u201cOh, those things are so impersonal.  No, I\u2019ll have to see Lina face to face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlight then, sounds good to me.  Tell Lina I said hi and I\u2019ll be expecting to hear how much her hatchlings have grown when you get back!\u201d  said Heliana, apparently thinking that I\u2019d meant that I was leaving to see her right now.  However as she spread her large wings and lifted her large body into the air with a mighty leap from her thick haunches, I thought that visiting my former lair mate was actually an excellent idea.  Hopefully the guard at her nook wouldn\u2019t give me any trouble\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I too leaped into the air, spreading my wings to catch me and support my weight on the wind.  I climbed, angling towards that characteristically leafy perch where the beetles Lina and her offspring required for their diets were farmed in bushes transplanted from her verdant homeland.  As I flew, I was already imagining with joy those tiniest of tiny dragons, hardly larger than a dog, rambunctiously chasing each other through the leafy overgrowth and their mother\u2019s cozy lair, all of them poofing and teleporting like mad though their double sets of wings had yet to emerge.  However, I also thought that I\u2019d rather not see Lina\u2019s clutch father Ein - short for Ein\u2019theil - there if possible.  Though it seemed that Lina had largely forgiven him for his cheating on her - with a human male of all things - I hadn\u2019t, not really.  I supposed it was for the best, seeing as their species was endangered, but still, the sight of Ein made me angry inside, all the more because I had to hide it from Lina to be pleasant.  It\u2019d be better if he was away during my visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the universe rarely rewards us with our preferences.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of one of the nesting guards, I found Lina\u2019s mate Ein\u2019theil guarding the entrance to the lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026. Hi Darzhja!!\u201d said Ein\u2019theil, trying to sound friendly but clearly coming off as nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Ein\u2019theil,\u201d I replied, trying to keep myself calm. I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to remain calm had his human \u2018partner\u2019 been with him. From what I\u2019d heard, ever since the scandal, Ein\u2019theil had made an effort to distance himself from the human, and Lina along with her mentor had made sure that the mage apprentice would remain \u2018pre-occupied\u2019 with his studies within the mage tower to be able to visit often, of which I was glad. \u201cWould it be all right to come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there was no trace or scent of the offending human, Ein\u2019theil nonetheless shifted his gaze evasively. \u201cEr\u2026about that\u2026\u201d he stammered, \u201cUm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hapless, guilty look always irritated me to no end, and always made me wonder if he was hiding something. I lowered my head down at him and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo its nothing like that. I just wanted you to know that she\u2019s\u2026got, special visitors!\u201d He choked out from under my shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted again. I wasn\u2019t going to allow Ein\u2019theil to start procrastinating again. Yet right then there was a couple of poofs and a pair of tiny humanoids with wings, even smaller than the half-lings, appeared in front of me. I cocked my head sideways. Like the faerie dragons, Sprites were amongst the rarest of the humanoids, so rare that many weren't even sure they even existed, and surely a pair of Sprites was the last thing I had expected to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave Linal\u2019leil\u2019s mate alone you big monster!!\u201d screeched the tiny humanoid, the female one, fluttering up between my eyes to face me. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re here to eat her little ones I\u2019ll make you go \u2018poof\u2019!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know whether to be amused or contemptuous at the tiny humanoids threat, considering that she was about the size of a human child. \u201cS-sister\u2026\u201d squeaked the male humanoid, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a good idea to provoke something that big\u2026\u201d Clearly, the male Sprite looked petrified, in quite a similar fashion Ein\u2019theil always seemed to be anxious around me, while the female seemed to be too brave for her own good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!!\u201d cried Ein\u2019theil. \u201cXanna, Isidiel\u2026\u201d gestured Ein\u2019theil to the two fairies, \u201cThis is Darzhja. She\u2019s Lina\u2019s best friend amongst the Knights\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female fairy instantly perked up, \u201cOh!! Then any friend of Lina is a friend of mine!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, that\u2019s good enough for me. Yet if you don\u2019t mind me asking, from where did you make Lina\u2019s acquaintance?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy grandfather discovered her egg when he was a boy and she grew up with the rest of us Sprites in the Agogo Forest. We didn\u2019t hear that much from Lina in the years since she\u2019d left, as we hardly let any visitors or news from the outside into the forests to begin with, until about a month ago when Ein\u2019theil came to our forest to tell us that Lina had little ones. Therefore, grandfather sent me and my brother to travel all the way here to help her out on behalf of the clan\u2026\u201d Xanna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I answered. \"Well I thank you for coming here to help Lina!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-so\u2026she\u2019s not here to eat us?\u201d said the male Sprite, Isidiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave the tiny Sprite an odd look. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sprite male didn\u2019t look too reassured. It was Ein\u2019theil who broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnyhow Darzhja, you\u2019re always welcome to see the little ones. Sorry if I acted all panicky at the gate. Just wasn't sure how you'd react when you saw those two without you knowing they'd be there. As for the little ones are having their nap right now, so be careful all right.\u201d said Ein\u2019theil. He then curved his gaze toward the two sprites, \u201cAnyhow, why don\u2019t you two help me fetch some glowing scarabs for the little ones?\u201d suggested Ein\u2019theil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re as good as caught!!\u201d squealed Xanna. \u201cCome on brother!!\u201d she cried, pulling her brother by the wing. \u201cR-right behind you sis!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and made my way inside. When I took a moment to think about it, Ein\u2019theil had made a shockingly thoughtful gesture brining them along. It was loathing to say it, but perhaps he wasn't as bad as I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, I could only make my way halfway inside before the quarters became way too cramped. Yet I was able to extend my neck through the leafy, and rather allergenic undergrowth to find Lina with her little ones. I always made sure to be extra careful, worried at how easily the tiny and fragile hatchlings could be badly hurt with but a single sneeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina was perched upon the center of her nest, giving me a big smile when I entered. Her four little ones were asleep against her side, dozing underneath her translucent wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!! Its so wonderful to see you!!\u201d said Lina with a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extended my neck to gently nuzzle her, careful not to stir the sleeping hatchlings at her side. When awake, the four of them were unbelievably hyper and out of control. The last time I had visited, little Tink\u2019erl had teleported straight into my nostril and gotten stuck; by some miracle I hadn\u2019t sneezed or else we\u2019d have had a real mess on our claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I see you\u2019ve met Xanna and Isidiel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmmm\u2026 They\u2019re a bit odd, but they seem pretty decent for humanoids,\u201d I admitted. It only occurred to me then, that while Lina was one of my closest friends, I still knew very little about the circumstances in which she grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina giggled, \u201cWell, Xanna\u2019s always been the one to boss her brother around. Its amazing how much they\u2019ve grown up while I\u2019ve been away. Of course, I still remember when Arie\u2019del was trying hide me from the clan elders\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArie\u2019del, you\u2019re talking about the leader of the Sprites I take it?\u201d I assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Things happen so quickly amongst the humanoids don\u2019t they?\u201d admitted Lina.  \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll still be alive by the time the little ones are old enough to come with Ein\u2019theil and I to visit the forest,\u201d replied Lina. It was astonishing and a bit sobering when I thought about it. Lina and I were young dragonesses, coming into our own as adults, while the humanoids who had lived the same number of years were either old or dead. Like Markus, for example, whom I had first met as a young man when I was a fledgling whose wings had barely emerged, and through my sparring career had helped him build up a fortune in the arena business, and was now a retired, wealthy old man, while I was just beginning my own professional career. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, enough with that mushy stuff!! Are you going to do something fun with Lorath over the holidays?\u201d she asked, the mischievous gleam back in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, I am!! He\u2019s invited me to Damescara for the millennial ceremony!! Heliana's coming too\u201d I cried excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!? That sounds like quite a lot of fun. As for Lorath, I bet he probably has some private villa on the Cliffside he\u2019s planning on taking you to\u2026\u201d she whispered with a titter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild cascade of kinky fantasies poured through my mind, leaving my thoughts cloudy and faint. \u201cOh\u2026that would be very nice\u2026\u201d I purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I take this to mean that when you come back from the holidays that I should not be surprised to her news of you taking up the large breed nesting grounds?\u201d she teased. Immediately, a fresh wave of fantasies burst through my mind, my tail wagging back and forth. \u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t plan on having little ones, at least not until I become a full Knight, but if that circumstance were to come about with Lorath during the holidays, it wouldn\u2019t be quite so bad at all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're really thinking ahead aren't you Darzhja? I'm happy you like him so much. Still think Fangorn\u2019s more your type though,\u201d she added teasingly yet also somehow forebodingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not\u2026\u201d I snorted crossly and far more violently than I intended. Even though I\u2019d been steady with Lorath for the past few years now, Lina always loved to tease me about Fangorn precisely because the admittedly handsome yet infuriating drake irritated me so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I really hope you have fun while you\u2019re there Darzhja. I really wish I could come too, but as you can see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her gaze toward the little ones, both lovingly and wearily. I curved my gaze back to her sleeping little ones, those tiny, fragile little lives, utterly dependent upon the care and love of their mother. Seeing Lina care for little ones made the notion of me doing the same much more tangible in my mind. Yet Lina would be spending the vast majority of her time within her little nest for the next half-decade at least; until they were old enough to be transferred to the fledgling grounds where they would begin their education to become Knights of New Alveri.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, I was happy that Lina had managed to find contentment with her motherhood. Despite a rather flaky personality not to mention his single, scandalous affair with his mage partner, Ein\u2019theil admittedly had made a genuine effort to be there both for Lina and the little ones he helped bring into existence. Thus, as I left and said goodbye to Lina, I hoped that I would at least manage to find a similar contentment when my own time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about Lorath again, purring as I flew back to the lair. Indeed, Lorath was definitely was the one. Yet I could never quite shake the feeling or the worry that things might not go the way I had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last week before the holiday month of Octilis - simply the eighth month of the dragon moon calendar - was excruciatingly long and tedious.  The days I spent standing guard outside the front gates of the Holy Temple crawled by and every time I twisted my neck to look at the water clock in the nearby gatehouse, the large arm seemed to scarcely move.  Shadia, sensing the upcoming jubilation, seemed to go out of her way to ensure that it was balanced out by an overabundance of pain leading into it.  For my own personal torment, she put me against Heliana in the sparing pit for close combat no less than twice that week.  Normally I\u2019d wear her down into submission with repeated tail and wing strikes, utilizing my superior stamina and speed against my stockier opponent, but Shadia in her wickedness decreased the size of the rope circle set in the sand so there was no room to maneuver.  I had to grapple with Heliana and combat her weight with my size and muscle.  Thus, while normally it would be I having to succor and lick Heliana\u2019s bruises after such times we were forced to spare, this week we comforted each other.  And that, I supposed in retrospect, was not so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the dawning of the new month, I groaned myself awake and twisted the kinks out of my long neck.  With a hind paw, I scratched at my still-sore shoulder where Heliana had bashed me good.  Some of the scales there had been deformed by the force of the impact and would not lie down straight with the others, leading to irritation.  Hopefully I could find a dragon cult member around with a set of pliers and a strong arm to wrench the nuisances free.  Heliana rested against my back, her soft warm bulk by now feeling pleasant to snuggle into during the night.  I supposed it was only fair considering that I\u2019d provided much the same service to my last lair mate.  Carefully, I extricated myself from the heavy Silver and trotted downstairs to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold water awakened and invigorated me as well as easing some of the residual pain from yesterday\u2019s sparing.  I was not the only one in the common shower.  Drakka of many colors and breeds were steadily filling the rough granite chamber, a sense of excitement and anticipation shared among us all.  There were many new faces, new drakka just joined two months ago at the annual selection ceremony; something I hadn\u2019t had due to my unusual acquisition by the Holy Knights.  I still hadn\u2019t yet learned all their names.  Other faces were missing and one in particular I wished I could still see prowling these halls.  Thereesa had graduated over a year ago to become a full fledged Knight.  Her magical prowess with runes and cryptography set her apart as a prodigy and there had been many awards handed to her during the ceremony.  I\u2019d been so happy for her then, despite the fact that in a dragon\u2019s sense of time, she was still a very new friend.  I heaved a sigh as the cascade of water poured down on me from the dwarf-made chute.  Despite her initial advances and constant teasing thereafter, she was a very good friend and I wished I got to see her more often.  Lina too if truth be told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, however, one dragoness in the shower I\u2019d have rather seen gone.  That venomous - litterally, she had venom in the quills layering her body - bitch Tsarra lifted her head and sneered at me when she entered the room.  I lifted my lips and showed her my fangs.  She just did an about face and showed me her vent, remaining in the position while she showered.  I tried not to let her irascibleness get to me.  This was supposed to be a happy day, the first of a whole month of celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the sense of commemoration hit me anew as I padded down into the common room after shaking myself off in the shower.  Humans were decorating the walls with heavy cloth sashes and banners, blood red, trimmed with gold filigree.  On the wall next to the exit to the landing platform, three men were busy painting a mural depicting some sort of of scene from history.  It was in its early stages yet, but as with all things related to the holiday, it favored tones of red and orange.  I found myself eagerly looking forward to what the skilled hands of the humans would produce.  As much as I wanted to stop and ask what it was that they were paining, I had an appointment to keep.  I walked around the corner of the mural and built myself into a run as I approached the edge of the platform beyond.  I leaped and then spread my wings later, enjoying the rush of the momentary free fall.  The air was delicious, clean and cold as I winged my way to Lothar\u2019s quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake still hadn\u2019t told me when exactly we were leaving or what the plans were in any detail.  I\u2019d poked and prodded, but he seemed to want to keep it a surprise.  I wasn\u2019t much a fan of surprises myself, but I was willing to trust that Lothar knew what he was doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath\u2019s quarters were set slightly higher in the mountain side than the communal drakka recruit den and on the opposite side of the caldera.  One of five such complexes in total, the officer\u2019s quarters shared a single entrance on the interior side of the mountain as well as an anterior one which led into the bowels of the labyrinthian complex of tunnels below.  When I alighted on the platform, what I saw was a dim corridor, dwarf straight, though obviously large enough for two dragons to walk abreast.  Off the sides of this unerringly straight cubical hallway were the officer\u2019s apartments.  Each portal was inscribed with a draconic name above and each apartment entrance had an identical twist in the entrance to ensure privacy.  A recent addition to the hallway were the gleaming demon mirrors.  In addition to their normal functions, these were instructed to display the apartment owner\u2019s face if they were present in their room and remain empty otherwise.  The way Lothar made it sound, the magic seemed highly convenient, but every time I looked at a mirror and realized that there was an <i>entity</i> inside - no matter how mechanical or uncomplicated - gave me a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath\u2019s chamber was four portals down and on the left.  I noted that he was present and slipped inside.  Compared to someone important like Lady Scabia, Lorath\u2019s chambers seemed remarkably spartan.  There were shelves with objects and knickknacks - some magical, some not - lining them, a sooty pit in the center to light a fire - smoke escaped through an air vent in the ceiling.  There was space enough for three large dragons to lay around it, though there was no furniture; such as dragons have \u201cfurniture.\u201d  A small opening in the opposite wall opened into a private sand pit and an adjacent portal opened into his sleeping chamber.  In the three years I\u2019d been steady with him, I\u2019d shared that chamber with him exactly once and largely by accident after we\u2019d both imbibed entirely too much wine.  It was a fuzzy, though secretly cherished memory by me; however, I sometimes wished I\u2019d taken more advantage of that slip when I\u2019d had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake lifted his head when I entered, a man sitting on a stool in front of him turned his head in surprise.  His shaved head and tattoos set me at ease, another dragon cult member.  \u201cDarzhja!\u201d  greeted Lorath, forgetting entirely about his prior human guest.  \u201cGood to see you.  Happy Festivus!\u201d  cried the blue drake, using one of several terms to refer to the holiday month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not pay the tattooed human much mind myself.  Among dragons, it was his place to remain quiet until addressed, even though I\u2019d obviously interrupted a previous conversation.  I bowed a little and clasped my wings tight to my body - it was appropriate to show some respect in another\u2019s lair.  \u201cHappy Festival Days to you too.\u201d  I said, moving more into the room.  As I was arranging myself opposite the cold fire pit in the center of the room, Lorath surprised me by introducing the human seated in the chair before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Sir Danielson.\u201d  The man, who\u2019d stood when I entered the room, bowed low.  \u201cHe\u2019s been informing me of the status of the preparations I\u2019ve made for our Holiday in Damescara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d  I purred, more interested in Lorath than the man before his claws,  \u201cPreparations that you still haven\u2019t told me anything about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath smiled a dragon\u2019s smile.  \u201cAll in due time, dear one.\u201d  He made a show of drawing a deep breath.  \u201cAnd might I say that you smell absolutely exquisite this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath, whose distinct sulfurous tang elicited more visceral reactions than purely cerebral pleasure from me, smelled like one who had not had time to leave his stuffy chambers in a long while.  Because of this, I decided to tease him, \u201cI\u2019m sure I smell like a breeze of fresh air in here.  I believe that your human guest will soon keel over in the fumes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man cleared his throat and although I could detect a whiff of sweat under his collar, he said, \u201cI assure you Mistress, I am perfectly content and healthy - it was frequently important to declare one\u2019s state of health to dragons as human beings were rather delicate creatures in comparison and a dragon\u2019s eye could not often detect the nuances in posture or coloration which indicated stress or illness - I\u2019ve developed quite a tolerance to dragon-smell during my years here at the Temple and I say that my overall constitution is stronger for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flatterer, like most in the church.  And like most dragons, Darzhja was happy to indulge in even such general praise and reassurance; something of a guilty pleasure in these more modern times and a remanent of times in which such servileness was required in order not to be eaten.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the fact that Sir Danielson was a human - and therefore the effort to get to know him would be wasted due to his short lifespan - I felt a peculiar interest in the man standing between two large scaly predators as an equal; mostly.  I lowered my head closer to his level and breathed the man\u2019s mammal stink of oil and sweat and unseemly secretions.  It was a little difficult to say, but I guessed that he was tall for a man; he was taller than my elbow when standing, and that was more than could be said of some.  Sir Danielson was broad-chested and muscular in his shoulders and arms as well, but not overdeveloped like a smith.  This plainly was a fighting man, albeit currently without the usual accouterments of weapon or armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour constitution is not in question here\u2026 Sir Danielson.\u201d  I said, taking a moment to recall his name.  Human names had a tendency to wash over me and off like water.  I turned to Lorath.  \u201cWould you care to introduce me to your guest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake inclined his head.  \u201cSir Danielson is a close associate of my clan as well as the Cult.  His family has served for generations, traceable until a mere 800 years after the founding.  His family have specialized in serving dragon families, both in domestic and protection capacities.\u201d  Although he\u2019d yet said anything about Danielson himself, I was already deeply impressed.  While individual humans came and went like the rain, their liniages had far more weight on a dragon\u2019s mind and certainly it could be said that some human lines were more productive than some dragon lines.  \u201cSir Danielson himself has loyally served us with his sword arm and his wits for more than half his life.  I can easily say that he\u2019s contributed more than his fair share to our collective wealth.\u201d  While he spoke Danielson crossed his arms and shifted his weight as if slightly uncomfortable having his doings recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson bowed again to me, lower than the first time.  \u201cLord Lorath is too kind to his humble servant by far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you too modest.\u201d  And although physical contact between dragons and humans was somewhat taboo - unless initiated by the human - Lorath gave the man a friendly snout bump against his shoulder; against which the man swayed only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning slightly, I asked, \u201cSo what have you and your patron been up to here this morning then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson spread his arms, \u201cWhy we\u2019ve\u2026\u201d  then he paused, looking uncertain.  He looked over his shoulder to Lorath and the drake gave him an almost imperceptibly small shake of his head that he probably thought I didn\u2019t notice.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing matters related to his, and your,\u201d he added hastily, \u201choliday in Damescara.  I can assure you that everything has been taken care of.\u201d  He swept his hands out in front of him.  \u201cMy son, Beneford, is waiting at the flat for your arrival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlat?\u201d  I asked, interest peaked.  But Lorath growled at Danielson and the man shut up tighter than a clam.  He tugged at the collar of his shirt and sweated some more.  Clearing his throat he pointed and said,  \u201cYour scale looks rather rough on your shoulder there, Mistress.  Shall I attend to them before you depart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how I wanted to pry more information out of Lorath\u2019s assistant, but the grating scale - the edge of one digging into the relatively tender skin underneath - did indeed require some attention by delicate hands.  In the end the desire for proper grooming outweighed my desire to spoil Lorath\u2019s surprise.  \u201cYou may approach, Sir Danielson and thank you for the offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is my pleasure, truly, Mistress Darzhja.\u201d  Said Danielson and went to grab a small leather case off one of the low shelves.  I lay very still, almost completely on my side while the human crawled up and on me.  He knelt with his knees on my forearm and hand against my warm bronze scales as he extracted some pliars and a file.  Humans tend to fidget so much that had there been creatures of similar smallness compared to them, this procedure might have been difficult for them.  Fortunately for Danielson, however, dragons usually find it easy to remain perfectly still for long stretches of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snaked my head up at Lorath without moving the large bulk of my body.  \u201cFlat?\u201d  I repeated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family has a private residence in Damescara.  Surely this doesn\u2019t surprise you?\u201d  said Lorath, obviously trying to brush the slip off and subtly putting me off revealing the extent of my ignorance as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning slightly, I allowed the ploy to work.  \u201cSo what\u2026\u201d  I grimaced as Danielson grasped a large shoulder scale, as large as his own palm, and tugged, hard and sharp.  I felt the broken scale come free with pain and relief like loosing a sore tooth and he pressed a cloth to my side to absorb the trickle of blood.  \u201c\u2026 About your brother\u2019s wedding?  Seems a fine time to have a pairing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, it is.  They have decided to hold it on the 25, near the end of the month.\u201d  I nodded, that would be when the celebration would be approaching its climax, but not so close as the celebration itself would take priority.  \u201cHowever, there\u2019s been a slight complication.  Axel Xion has announced his intention to attend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head.  On my shoulder, Danielson was using his pliers and a pick to move surrounding scales back into order and smooth them.  \u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d  Axel Xion, as everyone in New Alveri knew was one of the four trade princes who collectively controlled nearly all the private wealth in the empire, furthermore, he was the only one of the four who has survived the devastating terrorist attack on the city.  It was also interesting to note that of the original four, Axel Xion was the only non-dragon trade prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath shrugged and sighed.  \u201cPolitics.  Slytherilia is not at all fond of Axel Xion and her family shares her opinion\u2026 or rather she shares her family\u2019s opinion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBlack dragons being speciesist,now that\u2019s a surprise,\u201d</i>  I thought sarcastically.  \u201cThat\u2019s hardly fair.  What is he again, orc or something?  That\u2019s no reason to exclude someone from a wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually he\u2019s dragonborn.\u201d  Lorath corrected and I swallowed.  It didn\u2019t make any difference theoretically, but it was well known that dragonborn as a race harbor fairly intense animosity towards dragons in general.  Maybe people on both sides have tried to quell the feud, but still the hate was there, even if it was more a smolder at this junction in time than a blaze.  Lorath continued, \u201cAnd the issue is more complex than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d  I asked, again feeling woefully naive about the nuances of Lorath\u2019s world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath hissed through his teeth.  \u201cAxel has been cutthroat in his business dealings the last few years.  He really took advantage of the aftermath of the attack to expand his own trade clan.  We\u2019ve all been on the defensive with the loss of our patrons and in-fighting over who would lead next.  He used to be restricted to the textile manufacturing market and recently began to dabble in overseas trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he has a near monopoly on out-of-empire trade and has been expanding steadily into overland trade as well.  He\u2019s got his claws in everything nowadays, from mining to cattle and even magical research.  Some of the more conservative derail him for moving wealth out of dragon hands, while many also feel that he is a champion of humanoid equality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Danielson snorted, clearly declaring which side of the argument he was on.  He took out his file from the pouch and began trimming the scales for a more a more elegant look. It would have been easy to see this Axel as a villain from Lorath\u2019s description, but I\u2019d lived my life in the lower tiers and seen the suffering of the poor, dragons and humanoids alike.  Despite the squalor, it was actually pretty rare for a dragon to starve.  There was almost always a use for a dragon, and the desperate could resort to selling teeth or toes to magicians for money.  Humanoids didn\u2019t even have that measure to rely upon and I\u2019d seen them wither away in the streets.  Therefore, I took a neutral position.  \u201cHe sounds like a complicated humanoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is, and like most persons with power, he has his own controversies.  Some won\u2019t even admit that he\u2019s a real trade prince.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAxel rose to power quickly by banding together several wealthy investors into a large fund of which he was placed in charge.  It can be argued that none of the wealth is really his\u2026  But I don\u2019t think that really matters.  It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to gather it all up into a pile and sleep on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes rolled playfully, however the thought of my small pile of gems in the Temple bank underground expanding into a room filling hoard made me salivate more than a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s quite a tale, if you want to know more, you ought to read his auto-biography.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiography?!\u201d  I scoffed.  Biographies on humanoids in New Alveri were usually written after they were dead.  How else could you have enough material to work with otherwise?  \u201cAnways, what\u2019s Loken to say on the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s unsure, but I think he\u2019ll insist on sending him an official invitation eventually.  We can\u2019t afford to isolate our clan from his at this time, I think.\u201d  Lorath said thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, for me, this was all much too over my head to consider and I was tired of trying.  Danielson dabbed at my shoulder again with the cloth and then stepped off my forarm.  \u201cEverything laid smooth?\u201d  I asked while lifting my head to inspect his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfectly, Mistress.\u201d  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once we had finished with our preparations, Lorath and I headed toward the front gate of the Temple. As always, one always had to check out with the sentry there before heading off, whether it be for a mission or for this case a holiday. Unfortunately, yet perhaps not surprisingly, the irascible, stalking but admittedly very good looking bronze drake guarding the entrance was Fangorn. I figured that by now he would have found some other recruit to pester, but if anything he'd become even more of an irritation, which forced me to conclude that he had some sort of personal vendetta against me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we passed underneath, Fangorn was doing his best impression of a statue. \u201cGood morning Fangorn\u2026\u201d greeted Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Lorath, Darzhja\u2026\u201d he answered. \u201cHello Fangorn\u2026\u201d I replied, with as neutral a tone I could muster. Fortunately, Fangorn seemed content to remain silent, in which not a small part of the reason why was because Lorath was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath tried to start a conversation. \u201cYou never shared to me what you plan on doing for the holidays Fangorn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn seemed to lighten up slightly. Lorath had somehow kept up a friendship with the irascible Bronze Dragon and I could only wonder how he could manage such a miraculous feat. \u201cI\u2019ve been kept on active duty throughout the holiday. After all, someone still needs to keep watch and maintain public order while everybody else is out cavorting without a care in the world\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that none of us are quite as dedicated or patriotic as you are Fangorn\u2026\u201d I said with a roll of the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn snorted, looking as if he wanted to say something more, but deciding not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are we cleared to leave sir?\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed visibly. \u201cActually there's something you should know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d I growled harshly. \u201cWhat you should know is that you should keep alert if you\u2019re headed to Damescara right now\u2026\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for telling us that Lord Obvious, but I think we can take care of ourselves thank you very much\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean Darzhja. What I\u2019m trying to say is that, well, I\u2019m not allowed to give too many details, but my department has been investigating the New Alveri attack, and that with the hoidays, this would be as prime time as any for them to stage a second attack, and that certain pre-eminent individuals are responsible for it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense Fangorn\u2026\u201d I snarled. It was very like Fangorn to talk in circles, likely in an attempt to confuse me and expose just how \u2018uncultured and ignorant\u2019 I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, let me put it in terms that even you can understand. Again, I can\u2019t reveal any specific details, but based on data I\u2019ve analyzed and my own personal opinion, I think its better that you canceled the trip\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCancel the trip?\u201d I snapped, \u201cBy the Ancestors you\u2019ve got to be joking!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath raised a wing to hold me back, which I was thankful that he did or else I would have pummeled Fangorn right then and there. \u201cFangorn, I can understand your concern that the gathering of my clan would constitute a certain level of risk, but I am obligated to attend my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be, but its probably better if you didn\u2019t take Darzhja along\u2026\u201d he growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t stand any more of this. I spun toward Fangorn and slammed my claw against the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!! I see how it is now!! The only reason you\u2019re doing this is because you despise Lorath and jealous of the fact that he is a kind and considerate drake while you\u2019re nothing but a stalking, perverted wretch!! All you ever do is bug me and make my life miserable!! Since you are so fond of your conspiracy theories, why don\u2019t you go back to your cave and sulk where nobody can see you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think me so petty Darzhja?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!! I do Fangorn!!\u201d I snarled, wings unfurling, \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve been doing ever since I arrived at the Temple!! I don't know what you have against me and I don't care to know, but just because you like to be boring doesn\u2019t mean I have to be, so if you\u2019re so determined not to let me go, I dare you to try and stop me!!\u201d Fangorn's eyes went wide, and for a moment I actually thought he did want to fight right then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome you two, lets not start a fight here\u2026\u201d said Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Darzhja, I know its true that I\u2019ve put you through a lot of crap. Yet\u2026the truth of the matter is that\u2026I\u2019m telling you this because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you what!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I care about you Darzhja!! More than anyone else in the world!!\" Fangorn shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA choked, high pitched noise came out of my throat, hearts beating a million times per second as I could only stare at Fangorn, whose eyes glowed with a mad, desperate intensity. I didn\u2019t know whether to hit him, to scream at him or cry. More than anything else, I was frightened. After all his posturing, Fangorn had finally cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? W-why do say this now?\" I stammered. Before I could stop myself, I lifted my claw and smacked Fangorn across the face with my open claw. Fangorn just stood there and took the slap, not moving a muscle and as if he did not feel the sharp, piercing sting. <br>\r\nYou\u2019re such an idiot Fangorn!! If that\u2019s really the truth, then you sure have a nasty way of showing it!! If you were even a tenth as nice as Lorath is I probably might have liked you, but you\u2019re not!! You\u2019re a jerk and you haven\u2019t tried to show yourself as otherwise!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn continued to stare at me dumbly and just take it. For a moment, I even felt bad for him. That\u2019s when I realized it. He didn\u2019t act high and mighty because he thought himself superior, but because he was a recluse who had few friends and insecure of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath walked forward to confront Fangorn forlornly, \u201cLook Fangorn, you\u2019ve been a good friend to me for a long time, since we were both lairmates. You were there for me after my grandfather and uncle died, so I know that you are sincere in your sentiment of your warning. Yet, it dismays me to see you acting so hostile and unbalanced. I know you\u2019re better than this. If you had concerns, why didn\u2019t you say anything before rather than wait until this inopportune moment to put us in this awkward position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Fangorn looked as if he wanted to say something more, but Lorath stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough Fangorn\u2026\u201d retorted Lorath, \u201cI know you\u2019ve got your problems, we all do, but leave Darzhja out of them understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn took a deep breath, looking defeated. I thought I\u2019d be happy to see Fangorn finally give up, but somehow, I felt empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, you\u2019re both free to pass now. I apologize for my behavior earlier. It was immature and unbecoming of me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have a safe and happy festivus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn sounded shockingly and even despairingly sincere about that last point. <br>\r\n\u201cI wish the same to you Fangorn,\u201d answered Lorath,  but his heart didn\u2019t seem in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath turned back toward me, with a grin that looked forced, \u201cSorry to keep you waiting Darzhja. Lets\u2026lets just go\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could do was nod back. I couldn\u2019t find it within me to nuzzle him or whisper something sweet to rub it into Fangorn; it would have made a toxic situation worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn stood there like a statue once more, staring at those two fly off and away. Once again, just like every time that he tried to express himself, everything went terribly wrong. Yet this time, when he\u2019d laid himself all out, the bottom had fallen off. Yet it wasn\u2019t Lorath\u2019s or Darzhja\u2019s fault; the fault was entirely his. Time and time again he had failed, and this time it seemed that he had failed for good. It was sadly ironic, because he\u2019d graduated close to the top of his class, acknowledged as a superior fighter, a great organizer, a quick thinking tactician, and a keen mind for academics, yet now he finally realized the reason why he was still doing guard duty while others in his class, like Lorath, were headed for greater responsibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a jerk\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Lorath nor I said anything for about a minute following the awkward encounter with Fangorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Fangorn could actually be right about a possible attack upon Damescara?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected Lorath to say something reassuring as he always did, but he seemed equally at unease. \u201cIts certainly possible. We cannot rule out the possibility\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet the way I see it, even if there was danger of an attack, I\u2019d be going anyhow. I\u2019m not going live in fear of shadowy assassins. I came with you so we could have a fun time together!! What better way than to show those who hate our civilization that no matter what they do, we will hold on to our traditions and take part in festivities!!\u201d I answered. As far as I was concerned, all that stuff about Axel Xion, shadowy attackers, family intrigue and politics could go to the powers below. Perhaps that made me blissfully ignorant, but it was better than to live in a shadow of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath smiled back, seemingly reassured, \u201cThat\u2019s one way to look at things. Not that I disagree. Maybe it is better to just forget all ones worries of the world and just have fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI murred contently, leaning up against him. By then, we were at the outer walls of New Alveri when someone called out to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja!! Lorath!! Over here!!\u201d cried a voice. When I turned, I saw that it was</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the last gate set in the outer wall of the city of New Alveri - where Lorath and I had to show our identification one last time before exiting the city - I found a familiar face I had not had the chance to see in quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj, the sky swallower captain whose job it was to guard the eastern gate, sat on his perch above the ground level portal, as huge and impressive as ever.  My feet felt light as I danced my way over through the crowd of other dragons and humanoids at his beckoning.  \"Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes, you overfed brown serpent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classy as ever, eh, Darzhja.\"  The very large dragon brushed off casually.  \"I see the Knights haven't taught you any manners yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent my legs and dropped into a crouch, tail high.  \"But they've taught me to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj's chuckle sounded like boulders grinding together.  As he slipped off his wide perch, the traffic below gave way naturally to his great bulk.  Though it seemed unlikely, Kaj appeared even larger on the ground than above.  He all but towered over me, his shoulders reaching the height of a horse over my own withers with a chest twice as broad as my own.  He was a worthy specimen of his kind and definitely worthy of his title, which was practically the highest a technical \"civilian\" could achieve in the city militia.  \"You've grown.\"  I observed with a tone that could be construed as either compliment or ridicule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj decided to take the former.  \"Thanks.\"  He said and bowed his great head a little.  He raised his claw and pressed a knuckle against my breast, \"You have too, Small Fry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked, twisting my head away, all but preening,  \"What can I say, the Temple serves us an excellent diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laughed and Lorath took the opportunity to step forward.  I realized with a start what this might look like to him.  Hurriedl'y I sought to make his introduction.  \"Kaj, this is Lorath, Lorath, Kaj.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj, though snorted, \"Oh, Darzhja, I know who Lorath is.  An outstanding junior Knight if half the tales I've heard are true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who could mistake the formidable size of the Guardian of the East Gate?  You were the Edifice of the Tartan Pass, if I'm not mistaken?  During the west Empire skirmish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj beamed at mention of his past exploits.  His large round eyes drifted away momentarily  as he recalled, \"Held the pass alone against the Sardishian Calvary.  For a month, I sat in that valley, eating charred horse meat and not suffering one to pass and live.  Eventually, they just gave up and decided to hike over the mountain, but by then, our own ground forces were able to flank them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had known of the story, of course, but right now, with the misty look in the large dragon's brown eyes, and perhaps still frazzled by Fangorn's warning, it struck me anew what it must have been like.  And the exploratory force from Sardish to the far west of Nod was routed only 50 years ago.  Suddenly, danger seemed to be near and present, however much I wanted to deny Fangorn the pleasure of rattling me and spoiling my vacation with Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of me still thought that this was the intent of Fangorn's plea, but I had to let go of my suspicions for the moment because both males were looking at me.  Realizing that I'd spaced out for a moment, I was pressed for an answer.  I coughed and then looked up, ruffling my wings slightly and said, \"So what are your plans for the holiday, Kaj?  Me and Lorath are heading out to Damescara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Damescara.  I haven't been there in a century.\"  Kaj lowered his head though and looked at Lorath in a new light however.  Ever so subtly, his wing shifted to a protective stance over me.  \"You two be careful down there.  The water dragons there are fiercely territorial and like as not to kill you if you trespass on their reservation.  I learned that the hard way myself when I tried to take a bath in the ocean!\"  Kaj shook his head sadly, \"And I'd thought I'd finally found a pool big enough to stretch out in.  Ruined the whole trip.\"  I laughed and sat on my haunches as Kaj addressed my first question.  \"Well, as for little old me, the Guadian of the East Gate can't just shirk off his duties\u2026\"  I was slightly crestfallen to hear that my old mentor too would not be able to join in the holiday month, but then he went on, \"But I managed to swap a week at the end with an old pal of mine.  That's my favorite part of the month anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's great!\"  I exclaimed, giddy for the behemoth who would have time to celebrate and probably get drunk on barrels of wine as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if trailing on the edges of my thoughts, Lorath spoke, \"If you find yourself without enough to eat or drink during the holiday, feel free to look up my clan here in the city.  They'll treat you well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kaj looked surprised.  \"Are you sure?\"  he asked, humbled.  It was well know the appetite of a sky swallower, especially one of such generous size as Kaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell them Lorath sent you.  And please feel free to splurge.  This is a holiday after all!\"  Then he said more quietly.  \"Besides there are always so many leftovers afterwards anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin spread on the brown dragon's face.  \"I can promise you that you won't have that problem this year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe laughed, though I wondered just what force of nature Lorath had frivolously invited to his family and business parnters' tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shared some more small talk and caught up with each other some more.  Kaj was delighted to hear how far I'd progressed as a recruit, already with a successful mission under my belt and furthermore with a job guarding a gate.  The much larger gatekeeper beamed and was set to practically gush tips and \"tricks of the trade\" before Lorath saved me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend, I'm so happy we got the chance to meet, but I'm afraid if we stay any longer, our whole itinerary is going to be ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj looked down at me and Lorath in turn.  And although the size disparity wasn't so bad between Kaj and Lorath as say me and Lina, Lorath looked so small and frail compared to Kaj's towering bulk.  It was little wonder he'd earned a title such as \"Edifice.\"  As he spoke, he winked at me.  \"Well, I can see that you two lovebirds are eager to be off.  I won't keep you any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Kaj lowered his great, multi-horned head very close to mine and all but wrapped a huge wing around us.  I could see nothing but rich brown leather, red tinged with veins through the sunlight.  Kaj said very quietly, but very seriously, \"You be careful out there, Darzhja.  I'd die if anything happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight returned, banishing the moment and leaving me stunned, wondering if what had happened really did happen.  Then I saw Kaj moving away with Lorath and had to leap after them.  Kaj could barely fit through the portal he guarded, hunching his wings close to his body and lowering his head under the jagged tips of the raised portcullis.  Lorath walked a fair distance behind the large dragon's waving tail, and of course, their passage and mine caused a small traffic jam in the constant flow of wagons and people in and out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, as always, I felt exposed, what with the safe walls which usually constantly surround me absent.  The vast flat horizon, speeding out over a golden ocean of fields seemed to glare at me, offering impossible distances and impossible danger.  The sky too seemed too big somehow and I almost felt like it would swallow me up should I arrogantly step up into it.  I tried to hide the slight shiver in my legs, but couldn't.  I'd faced down a small army of mercenaries, and yet couldn't shake this stupid fear of open places.  Pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaj sat in the dirt outside the city and scratched at his neck like an overgrown dog.  A few scales the size of dinner plates fell to land in the road.  A human with a pike scrambled out to collect them for Kaj who would undoubtedly sell them for a few silvers later; and tip the man who retrieved them of course.  Out here, he was still huge, but lost some of his building-like stature.  I suddenly realized that the wilderness was vast enough to swallow up even one as enormous as Kaj.  My shaking got worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few last goodbyes, me and Lorath threw ourselves up into the air.  I was in a hurry not to show Lorath what the outside world was doing to me.  We spiraled up, gaining altitude on rich thermals that smelled of crushed wheat.  We danced about each other for a while and then when the air was chilly about us, Lorath lead the way, following the broad east road which would lead to Damescara and the ocean beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first segment of the journey away from the city was uneventful.  With my training, I was prepared for the long hours of flight, though perhaps less prepared for the tedium.  My fear and growing anxiety as the towering bluffs of New Alveri disappeared behind me helped keep me from being completely bored however.  We traveled past dusk to make up for lost time.  Bonfires on the ground alerted us to the first way station.  I wasn't looking very forward to landing, but at the lodge, I was in for a pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The waypoint could have been called a small town, in fact Lorath told me that it was not uncommon for the bigger ones - like the one we were currently gliding towards - to house in excess of four thousand humanoids. The key feature that distinguished the way point from any other town was the landing arena. For all it's humanoid habitation, there could be no doubt that this place was designed to meet the needs of traveling dragons first, house smaller beings second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arena was highly visible, even in the gloom of night. It was ringed with bonfires in a highly specific pattern that Lorath told me was common to all way stations: two gently curved rows and a smaller curve at the bottom; horns and a nose ring, which to a dragon was synonymous with dinner. And honestly, after a full day of flying, the thought of fresh bloody beef before me was greatly welcome. It sat in the middle of the settlement. Around the flat, lit arena were the largest buildings, dragon taverns and stalls for sleeping. Away from these hulking structures, the size of the buildings gradually decreased, eventually leading out into the fields and pastures which liberally filled New Alveri's breadbasket. Though, after only a day of flying, I was already bored with the sight of never-ending fields of wheat and corn; less so with equally endless pastures filled with plump cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust rose in a cloud around me as I alighted heavily on the trampled earth of the arena. Graciously, I folded my aching wings and hung my head doggedly waiting for Lorath, who was still circling overhead, to land. Before he did, however, there was already a large shape moving out of a tall, barn-like structure towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hunched my shoulders, but my nose belayed my cautious first reaction. I lifted my head and smiled, \"Greetings Heliana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large silver walked briskly over and rubbed noses with me briefly, then she scolded me with a harsh look. \"You were supposed to be here hours ago! I was sick to death waiting for the two of you! Where's Lorath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath alighted gently on his hind legs and let himself down easily, holding himself up with two careful flaps of his wings. He scarcely marked the ground under him as he did so; show-off. \"Did I hear my name just now?\" he asked, smiling at the heavyset drakka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I could tell that Heliana was struggling to hang onto her affrontment\u2026 trying and failing in the face of the comely young drake. \"I was just telling Darzhja how you and her almost stopped my hearts worrying about you.\" She said, though from her tone of voice I thought she'd pretty much already forgiven us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath stepped forward and affectionately touched Heliana on the shoulder with his wing. \"I'm sorry we're late. But I am glad to see you safe and sound here. I hope things haven't been too unpleasant here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana rolled her eyes slightly, but she certainly didn't flinch away from Lorath. \"Well, I have to say that the station has better accommodations than I was expecting, and they had an excellent beef stew.\" she said thoughtfully, and even licked her chops once without thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"Well that sounds excellent. I could really go for some thick meaty st-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana's tail flicked in front of my nose, \"Well, then I'm sorry to say that there'll be no stew for either of you. They stopped serving dinner an hour ago.\" She lifted her nose in the air and snorted, \"Serves both of you right, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was actually crestfallen with the prospect of going to bed hungry, but Lorath just thought it was a joke. He harumphed and said, \"I think we'll both live. Now why don't you lead us in since you've had time to settle in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026 I suppose I can do that. Anything for you, Lorath.\" And she licked her chops at the blue drake as a way to tease me. I gave the heavy silver the evil eye as she led us out of the circle of flattened earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana's thick tail waved ahead of me as she lead us to a large outdoor counter adjacent to one of the large barn structures. Red paper lamps hung from the rafters overhead, illuminating the slight, off-green form of who I could only imagine was one of the innkeepers here at the station. The angle of the dragon's face and its proportions spoke feminine, but when the innkeeper spoke, I was surprised to hear a masculine baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking for lodging? Unfortunately they're all checked out...\" the stationkeeper said with a bored sounding voice, not bothering to look up from his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No lodges!?!\" I called out in dismay, wings unfurling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you two had arrived here earlier than there would have been rooms available!!\" said Heliana heatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you absolutely certain that there are no more rooms available?\" asked Lorath calmly. \"Not for an esteemed member of the Dak'saird clan and his guests?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper finally shifted his gaze up at us. \"Ah!! If it isn't Lord Lorath!! I admit it has been quite some time since I've seen you last, not since we learned you became a Knight!! It would seem that you have developed a peculiar taste in drakka since then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tilted my head sideways and uttered a slightly hostile, inquiring growl, unsure if he meant it as a veiled insult or not, as did Heliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant unique of course!!\" he replied placatingly. It didn't quite satisfy me, but I was willing to let the issue slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you against Sidor. These two are Darzhja and Heliana, both of whom are up and coming Knights,\" answered Lorath pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you both!!\" He then sifted through the long flat sheets of leather parchment with deft claws, \"In any case, now that I think about it, perhaps there is one more room available that I overlooked....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you greatly Sidor,\" replied Lorath, grinning contently, \"Anyhow, so, how has business been going at the station?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, the holidays have provided us a nice boon of profits, given the number of guests coming from New Alveri. Axel Xion and his mob had been growing increasingly aggressive in trying to buy control of the waystations. He's already taken down many of our usual suppliers along the route. I dare hope that your brother's marriage with the Shadowfang heiress can reverse this worrying trend...\": he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, ever since the New Alveri attack, Xion has sought to take full advantage of the vacuum. Of course, were I in his exact same position, I'd be trying to do something similar, though perhaps not giving the impression of being quite so eager to profit from tragedy...\" added Lorath. Heliana and I stared at one another, shurgging. While Heliana's family were merchants, neither of us could really begin to comprehend these sort of matters. The two of us were Knights; dragons whose duty was to protect the Alverian Empire from her enemies through our prowess in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll definitely bring up these matters before father and the rest of the clan, rest assured Sildor. Now then, its been quite a long day, would you mind showing me and my guests to our quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSildor, the innkeeper, perked up in a pose of almost exaggerated erectness, \"Oh yes!! Right this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was a rather short one, and I couldn't help but shift my gaze a bit nervously at Heliana. There was only one room, and the two of us drakka. The resting station wasn't particularly large, with just a few torches and a central resting chamber. \"I apologize if the accomodations aren't quite so spacious, Lord Lorath,\" said Sildor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. I'm just happy to have lodgings for the three of us at all....\" After all, it was only meant as a transit point, and thus not much had been placed for luxuries. <br>\r\nLorath looking rather sheepish between the two females, both of whom were larger than he, exclaimed \"Well, I hope the two of you don't mind sharing the room with me tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, since Heliana and I had been lairmates since Lina had left, it wasn't as if we weren't familiar with each others presence, but Lorath hadn't been part of the equation either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like we have much of a choice either...\" added Heliana, trying to sound ambivalent but I could tell she looked thrilled with the prospect. \"Fine by me... just for tonight though\" I added, for emphasis, perhaps a bit more forcefully than I intended. While it was extremely unlikely that Heliana was actively trying to steal Lorath's heart away from me, privately I was a little concerned that Lorath had no problem at all with sharing both me and Heliana, and the fact he'd introduced us both collectively to the innkeeper instead of emphasizing me exclusively as his guest of honor. Perhaps it was more Lorath being his usual generous self and not wanting to put Heliana in a position of feeling left out, but I did vow that once we got to Damescara that his attention would be devoted fully to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, all three of us were too tired to really make too big an issue on the sleeping arrangements. Thus, I snuggled up next to Lorath and closed my eyes, as did Heliana, in which the compartively slender drake found himself squeezed between the bulk of the two drakka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath looked a little bit apprehensively at the two females squeezing against him from both sides, both of whom had begun snoring quite noisily. Regardless of whatever else happened, this was going to be a holiday unlike any other.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dark Blue.  That's all I could see.  As I awoke, I was filled with disconcertion until I realized the obvious.  It was only Lorath's wing covering my face.  \"Ugh\u2026\"  I sighed groggily and carefully moved the blue drake's wing away from my eyes.  My other two roommates were clearly still sleeping, judging by the soft snoring still filling the bare wooden stall; though in Heliana's case, the din she produced wasn't what I would have called \"soft.\"  I lifted my head a little and was rather shocked by what I saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath, his slender shape smushed between the two larger drakka, had rolled around completely on his back in his sleep.  At first I felt sorry for what must have been an uncomfortable position, but the more I looked, the more I saw that he was clearly favoring Heliana in his awkward recline.  His chest rose and fell slowly, his claw resting on Heliana's well rounded withers, as the rest of him was cozily nestled against the silver's admittedly soft flank.  A scowl formed on my lips when I saw that he was resting his hind feet on the strong outward curve of the still-paunchy silver's abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, although I was miffed that Lorath would choose - even unconsciously - to snuggle with Heliana over me - although to be fair in these cramped conditions, a lot of the blue drake was still resting against me - what angered me the most was that I couldn't confront him with this.  I knew exactly what he'd say.  He'd say, \"I was sleeping, I didn't know what I was doing.\"  And Heliana would do what she was best at, diffuse the situation with a joke at her cost, likely along the lines of mentioning how she was a much better pillow than I was, due to the rampant softness under her scales.  And was it really wrong of Lorath to want to be more comfortable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my eyes away.  Now I was doubting myself.  I wasn't the sort of drakka to hang on to useless anger, so I decided to allow myself a petty revenge and let the matter slide.  I stood abruptly, yawning, which resulted in Lorath fumbling off of Heliana and awakening with a shock as he hit the scratched and pitted wood floor beside me.  \"Umph!\"  he grunted and lifted his head to look around blearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry, Lorath!\"  I said with mock dismay.  \"I'm so clumsy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath was still too sleep muzzled to notice my sarcasm, which I found both gratifying and aggravating at the same time.  \"No worries, no worries, my Dear.  I'm fine\u2026\"  he punctuated his sentence with a huge yawn with showed all his rows of sharp teeth.  I unwittingly received a blast of rank morning breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waved a wing in front of me, moving away.  \"Ugh, Lorath, go scour your teeth or something before we all pass out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake just smiled at me and turned in a tight circle to exit the open chamber, stretching his finely crafted wings out behind him the moment he passed through the portal.  I had to acknowledge in my heart that I'd already forgiven him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lorath began to wash his mouth and face in the handy trough outside the door, Heliana began to stir, awakening reluctantly as was her habit.  I moved over to her and rubbed her shoulder with a paw lest she slide back into slumber as she was prone to doing.  For all her dietary reform and exercise and her dramatic improvement in physical prowess, the silver dragons remained more than a little chubby, and I could feel it on her shoulder as I shook her.  I thought it likely that she would probably remain like this, especially since she hadn't managed to drop even a half stone in the last six months.  And as I saw her eyes flutter open and a grin spread on her face, crinkling her somewhat fleshy cheeks completely oblivious to what I saw just moments before, I thought I didn't mind that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana, either because she was comfortable in being herself around me or because she was used to filling the role of the quirky friend, said, \"I smell cattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, hard.  Because it was just like Heliana to mention food in her first breath of a new day and because suddenly I had the mental image of Lorath sleeping on top of Heliana when she'd been much heavier a few years ago like a mattress.  I thumped her across the skull playfully, \"Always thinking with your stomach.  You know, if anyone should be thinking of food at this early hour, it ought to be me and Lorath.  We actually missed a meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana got up, grumbling and rubbing the top of her head though I knew I hadn't hurt her.  For good measure, I prodded Heliana on the side of her tummy with my wingtip, saying,  \"You be careful, girl, or you are going to undo all the hard work you did over the holiday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana glared at me and then burst out laughing.  Grinning, she sidled up to me and said, \"Alright, I'll be mindful of my <i>diet.</i>  Ugh\u2026  But you know that you ought to be careful yourself, Darzhja.  Who knows what feasts Lorath is going to be showering you with all month long while I'm with my own little middle class family?  You may be bigger than me by the time we're set to head home to the Temple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked and pushed her away with a wing.  \"If that is the case, Shadia will work our tails back into shape within a fortnight.  You can be sure of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana toothy grin faded into a half-smile.  Rarely did she find anything at all about the frightening Shadia to be funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both walked out of the bare room and washed our mouths and faces with water.  It was delicious and cold, pumped out by a stablehand as we quaffed water by the gallon.  As I thanked the lad cursorily and set about scouring my teeth with the white sand from a handy tub, I heard a loud voice nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?!  This is nearly double the price per head that I paid last year!\"  I immediately recognized the voice of the effeminate innkeeper who Lorath coerced into giving us our tiny room for the night.  I wandered over and quickly saw that the blue drake was ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tavern side of the large building, behind the kitchen stood the innkeeper who was conversing with an orc with a greying mane sitting on a tall wagon.  The innkeeper's slight frame was such that the two of them were nearly eye to eye.  I slid up next to Lorath and watched the orc respond.  \"My price of corn and hay has gone up and so I have to increase my prices, Sildor.  You know it's nothing personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from the way the dull green drake was shaking, it was clear he was still outraged.  He all but shouted at the orc in a voice that would have set his harnessed bull to flee if not for some soothing strokes from the young orc seated next to the seller.  \"I didn't see Reiloth handing over this much for his cattle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc raised a meaty arm and rubbed the back of his balding head in a way that I knew meant that he was harboring some guilt in the matter.  \"Reiloth has a special discount.  Xion is compensating me for selling to his partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  shrieked the smaller dragon and now the bull did start to move of its own accord.  The orc pack leader tugged hard on the reins to keep his animal under control.  \"You can't be serious.  This is going to put me out of business.  How can this be legal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before I knew what was happening, Lorath was striding forward.  \"The simple answer is it's not.\"  said Lorath and both Sildor and the orc turned to face the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc cocked an eyebrow, cautious as he should be between two dragons.  \"And what say do you have in this matter, Stranger?\"  he asked not impolitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Lorath of the Dak'Saird clan who owns the lease on Sildor's inn.  His business is my business also.\"  said Lorath, all but strutting.  Sildor shrank aside before the blue drake, and suddenly, Lorath appeared very large in my eyes.  \"What is happening with your cattle, Herdmaster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' that hasn't happened before or won't happen again.  Prices on my feed have been raised.  I simply can't sell my cattle for the same price.  No matter how much you dragons drool over them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath cocked his head, \"And don't you wonder at all who owns most of the corn and hay you're buying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSildor spoke up, \"Axel Xion!  That's it!  He wanted to buy my lease just last year, even offered me a better interest rate, but I wouldn't have him.  I wouldn't have anything to do with his underhanded business tactics!\"  cried the innkeeper, obviously now hamming it up in front of Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake just spoke thoughtfully, \"And now an obviously engineered price hike on beef\u2026  Herdmaster, this discount you mentioned\u2026  It wouldn't be that its about the same amount as the amount you've had to raise your prices would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc seemed genuinely to be thinking about this for the same time.  \"Actually, now that you mention it, its about as you say, give or take a few drachmas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSildor turned to Lorath and spoke in beseeching tones.  \"Master Lorath, its obvious that Axel Xion is forcing me to either let him buy me out or go out of business.  Isn't there anything your noble trade clan can do for a humble innkeeper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSildor's flattery disgusted me, but Lorath hung his head, and said grimly.  \"If this is true, then Axel Xion is engaged in unscrupulous business practices.  It may even be illegal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSildor's face lit up and he shook out his wings, \"Then I can buy my cattle at the normal rate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath turned and I could see from the sidelines that his face was dark with thought.  Perhaps he was trying to gauge just how much of his clan's power he could exercise here, given his own somewhat distant affiliation and unofficial standing.  Finally he decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Written by Shalion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments of thought, Lorath spoke in an authoritative tone that I was actually surprised to hear out of the thin blue drake. \"I believe it is clear that Axel Xion is trying to put Sildor and the other tavern keepers here who won't cooperate with him out of business.\"  Now he looked directly at the greying orc on the wagon, \"Dak'Saird will pay for the difference between this year's and last years cattle. Same as Xion.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe orc was indifferent. He threw his hands up at said.  \"Make no difference to me.  So long as my expenses are covered.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLorath turned to Sildor as the herdsman began to nosily creak away on his bull driven cart.  He lowered his tone, though being a dragon, he was still quite audible, \"Sildor\u2026\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe slight green drake lowered his head subserviently, \"Yes, Lord Lorath?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You should know that while I promise that we'll be looking into this, and it's important to us to keep our foothold in the waypoint, you should keep in mind that this isn't free money and I can't tell you how long we'll be able to subsidize you. Someone higher up may decide to overrule my judgement in this affair, so be prepared for that.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe hopeful gleam which had infected the green drake's eyes became more subdued, but Sildor seemed mature enough to handle the decision. \"I understand, my Lord. But I hope that you understand as well that Axel Xion is a menace to us simple common folk and we don't have a lot of options.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLorath nodded his head grimly. \"I do understand and that's why when I get to Damescara, I'm going to let my clan know the specifics of what is happening out here personally.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat seemed to assuage any doubts that the innkeeper had.  It moved me that this drake had such confidence in Lorath, although it wasn't too surprising.  Lorath seemed to exude a natural aura of competency\u2026 though it also helped that his features were cut so fine as well.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI sidled up alongside the blue drake as he left the innkeeper to shout orders to his humanoid staff as they wrangled the fresh cattle into the pen behind the tavern kitchen.  \"You handled that very well.\"  I observed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Perhaps... But only if my order isn't immediately dismissed when Sildor goes to collect his reimbursement.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That won't happen.\" I assured, though I had absolutely no grounds to base this off of. \"You're important in the clan. They'll go along with your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath grunted assent, but from the way he hung his head, I thought he had some lingering doubts. We rejoined Heliana by the water trough - now gone grey with our washing in it - and I filled the silver dragon in on what she missed. Heliana showed a considerable amount of outrage when she'd heard what happened. \"Axel Xion...\" she said, her whole body quivering with anger, \"That's just like a big corporate mogul to go stepping on the commoners to rake in a little bit of extra profit\". Her eyes popped though when she remembered whose company she was currently sharing. \"No offense to you though, Lorath.\" she added sincerely.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe blue drake just grinned, \"None taken. I'm not a corporate mogul as you put it. I'm just a Knight like the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI couldn't help but think that was a little untrue. Lorath's family was among the richest and most powerful in the empire. Not even joining the Knights could erase that background and indeed it proved to have its uses as clearly seen just now. And then Lorath had seems pretty quick to step up and exert authority on behalf of his clan. Would I be able to leave behind such wealth and power?  I was afraid to answer myself, which of course was in itself an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of talking about Axel Xion.\" I declared as Heliana and Lorath started to build into a tirade against the trade prince whilst we reclined around the water trough.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLorath looked at me with a knowing glance, but if he thought he knew where my thoughts were roaming, he was wrong, \"Darzhja's right. We really ought to be going. We don't want to arrive late to our next stop. Ancestors help us if Heliana misses dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" complained the silver as we laughed, but I threw a wing over her withers to stop her pouting. Once we finished our quick bath, the three of us bid the innkeeper farewell and took off back into the sky. The flight to the east was very similar to the first days flight. Row upon row of farmland extended infinitely below us. As we passed overhead, the people would wave at us and point with a sense of wonder and awe. Unlike in New Alveri, it wasn't often that such rural folk would ever see dragons in the sky, and it was heartening to know that we were appreciated. The further we went, I could feel more and more in my bones the sheer size and majesty of the Empire that we knights had been sworn to protect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the air began to grow warmer and more moist, to the point where it almost felt like I was inside the wash room back at the Temple the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana panted visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I remember why I decided to become a Knight. To escape this blasted humidity,\" she panted, as water dripped from her as if she just jumped out of the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, its not that bad...\" gestured Lorath. \"You've got to admit that at least it never snows as it does in New Alveri...\" he added. Then again, neither myself nor Heliana were part water dragon like he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the late afternoon though, the weather had mellowed somewhat, though by that time I had grown hideously thirsty. However, I grew hopeful when more and more dragons were beginning to appear in the sky, and as it turned out, up ahead was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flying over long distances was new to me, but fortunately my Temple training had me in good enough shape to keep up with Lorath and Heliana.  It continually amazed me, as we flew in a straight direction, to see more and more land stretch out under me, seemingly without end.  The fact that it was nearly the same patchwork quilt overlay of fields and pastures the entire time helped emphasize the illusion of endlessness.  But I knew that the land did eventually end.  As the air grew thick and close, and the people far down below stooped over fields of hot peppers, eggplant and okra, sheltered under hilariously wide brimmed straw hats that nearly hid their whole bodies from my vantage point, I caught my first whiffs of salt tang in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd been four days since we left Sildor and his inn.  Four days, and four way stations and over a thousand miles with the autumn winds at our backs.  I'm afraid to say that my reaction, upon first tasting the scent of the sea was less than modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that smell!\"  I roared over the tearing wind in my face.  I fell more than a tail length, breaking my position in front of the other two smaller dragons.  \"Is that the sea?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath called to me as I flapped erratically below him, and there was a chuckle in his throat as he spoke, \"Yes, Darzhja!  But we are still a few miles off from it still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salty tang to the air filled me though it was but a trace in the atmosphere as yet.  I sniffed great draughts, trying to gather it all into my nose.  The freshness, the clarity.  Stories of sea surf, shells and underwater dragons, which before seemed merely words on the page of a book to me now took on fresh life.  And that was before I even saw the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana sank a little and let her tail drag across my back as she passed.  The contact sent a shiver up my spine.  \"Look over there, Darzhja, to the south of true east.  You can see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, between two lines of green covered hills I did see it.  As first, I thought it was a flat plain poking over the horizon, yet not even the plains of New Alveri surrounding the lonely mountain on which it was constructed were so flat.  The level of the horizon was sharp enough to balance a dwarves level.  And furthermore, it was blue.  Granted, my first impression was silver, but that was only the sun reflecting off the surface of the water.  underneath the shimming was a dark, rich blue.  I was simply awestruck, and my condition only worsened as the blue sliver expanded larger and larger until the entire eastern half of the horizon was dominated by the silver shimmering waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Lorath now taking the lead, I fell behind Heliana, the air current broken so I could focus on taking in the landscape which was so utterly new to me it was almost alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to recover enough of my facilities again to be able to be sufficiently amazed as we came across the sight of Damescara itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city lingered long on the horizon as little more than a grey smudge.  It took several hours of flight at high altitude to be able to resolve the many tall buildings in the center.  However, most of the buildings in the city were no more than a few stories tall, although its sprawl was at least three times that of the staggeringly high New Alveri.  Thus, it was not until we were practically on top of the city that I could take in its full granduer.  Lorath took us on the circuit of the city twice.  Something he later called the \"grand tour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably the first thing I noticed about Damescara was the lack of planning.  Unlike the strictly ordered tiers of New Alveri, the streets of Damescara were an organic sprawl that reminded me of the way a tree branch spreads out from the core of the trunk.  Damescara was obviously a <i>living</i> and it was still growing.  There were city walls, like back home, but these seemed mostly for appearance only at this point as there was a mighty stretch of buildings that extended far beyond them in all directions the water allowed.  I say this because  plowing to the south side of the city was a mighty river which dumped its contents over the side of cliff of black stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cliff was an oddity to be sure.  Most of the landscape leading towards Damescara had been soggy marsh.  But here, the land rose in a great hill which was broad if not overly tall, at least compared to New Alveri standards. Lorath would later tell me there was a legend that it had been raised by magic, but the presence of other such hills along the coast led me to believe it was simply a natural phenomenon.  The hill cut away sharply at the sea, as if a giant claw had divided the hill in twain and dragged the latter half into the ocean to keep for its own.  I could see why this place was chosen for a city.  It was naturally defendable, especially from the marshlands surrounding it.  In addition, the river generated a wide delta which jutted away from the cliffs a long ways.  It was heavily farmed and also provided handy shelter for the legion of ships moored in the shadow of the wall of black stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath, with his claw, pointed out the ancient keep which still stood despite having been burned out and partially demolished several times over the millennia.  The many fountains that abounded in the city were also to be cherished and the vast warehousing district at the base of the cliffs and even extending a ways out into the water were in many ways the heart of New Alverian commerce and our only (peaceful) contact point for the rest of the world.  But the most comely feature I found in the city were the cliffs themselves which naturally housed the vast majority of the city's draconic population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamescara housed barely a tenth of the dragons who lived in New Alveri.  However, the dragons who lived here had taken pains not to be overshone by their cousins in the capital.  Holes in the side of the cliff abounded with landing platforms built to jut out from the cliff ace.  The matieral of choice was marble, which despite the expense was striking against the black backdrop of stone.  Dragons eyed us from the openings into their chambers, and a few gave a friendly wave of their wing.  Conciuous of being observed, I forced myself to be more composed as we flitted past the many openings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDargons, and I noted a disporportionatly large number of blues and silvers, darted between the cliffs and the sea and the dock district as well.  There were dragons fishing as well as operating as mobile cranes for unloading ships.  Dragons also carried the city's own goods up through the air to the city proper above and beyond the black wall.  I took it all and far more in with silence, afraid that when time finally came for me to open my mouth, I would be unable to stop myself from gushing.  I needn't have worried, because after our two circles about the city, Lorath led us away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took me several minutes to realize that Lorath was not leading us to stay in the sea side cliffs, even when we had left the lowest of them behind us.  In fact we flew to the north and were sailing now over some more wet farmland and drained pasture.  I was close enough to smell the patties now, as we'd dropped in height to less than twice the height of a tree now.  And still Lorath led us on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was begining to think how inconvenient it must be to live so far from the city proper when our party was suddenly intercepted from above.  A large blue drakka, much larger than Lorath, though not as large as me, dived down among us and scattered us.  Clearly it was a challenge.  \"Fly no future!\"  she roared throatily, \"Identify yourselves and state your purpose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis drakka was obviously ready to fight and though three against one seemed poor odds, I did not doubt for a moment that she had unseen assistance, likely circling far above us.  Flaberghasted at first by the sudden appearance, it took a few moments for my training to kick in.  Fortunately, Lorath caught himself immediately in the air and dipped a wing to circle the new female.  Though the fire was hot in my throat and my claws ached for something to tear into, Lorath seemed blithe as he glided slowly around her.  Just as well I wasn't leading the group then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura'lii, Surely, you recognize Lorath of the clan?\"  The drake called, displaying his flank and belly to her as he flew past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, this Azura'lii retracted her previously aggressive flying posture and lowered herself to our height.  She glided smoothly alongside us as we angled back into a group.  I thought she might apologize for scattering us like we were no more than a flock of geese, but apparently she thought her response was appropriate.  \"You are late, Lorath.\"  Was the first thing out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath sighed loudly and beat the air with his wings.  \"Not even a hello, cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drakka harumphed audibly over the rush of wind.  \"Do not forget that you are a Knight, <i>cousin</i>.  Do not suppose that family ties can be turned on and off at it pleases you.  You decided what was more important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that cold introduction, she plummeted from us and darted expertly under the tree cover.  Lorath came over to me so that our flapping wings were almost touching.  \"I sense some unresolved family issues.\"  I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath hissed through his teeth.  \"Don't worry about it, it's nothing important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his reassurances, however, I was quite keen on learning as much as I could about the family from which Lorath hailed.  Even if, by joining the Knights, he had technicaly severed all his previous bonds.  I wondered briefly if it hurt to leave a family behind.  I thought it must.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Written by Bmao)<br>\r\nWe followed Azura\u2019lii through the small canopy of trees, and when we emerged from the trees, I first caught sight of the Dak\u2019saird estate. All by itself, it could have been a sizable town. The cliffside in which it had been constructed was not dissimilar from the city we\u2019d just left, though on a much smaller scale.  It had also been completely smoothed out for it lacked the slightest dent or imperfection. Similar to the Cliffside of Damescara, the estate possessed numerous smooth outcroppings facing the ocean.  On the higher ones, I imagine one could see the top of the port city rising over the trees to the south as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you actually live here?\u201d I choked out with disbelief turning to Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually this used to be the winter residence for our clan, as our primary headquarters were in New Alveri, but those were destroyed during the attack, so since then we\u2019ve made this place the clan headquarters,\u201d explained Lorath. If this had been merely a \u2018winter home\u2019 beforehand, then I could scarcely imagine what the primary headquarters would have looked like.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed upon a sanded ledge, and was directed under a large golden archway into the estate itself. A pair of smallish drakes guarded the main entrance to the estate, but both had a steely convicted look in their eyes that one could easily find in the guards to the gate of the dragon temple.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, they didn\u2019t give us trouble as they\u2019d been expecting us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I remembered the moment I stepped inside those golden archways was my jaw literally dropping to the ground with an audible clang. Arrayed before me in all its profligatry, were walls made of pure crystal in which one could nearly see their reflection upon. Smooth and ululating, like the esophagus of some unimaginably enormous beast, the crystal lining of the hall seemed to shimmer in the sunlight spilling into it.  I could see rainbows inside each curve.  At the time, I thought it must be magic, later I would learn that the crystal had been painstakingly melted into the walls with dragon breath; no humanoid had a hand in making it, Lorath would tell me with some small pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026as you can tell,\u201d said Lorath, tilting his head away in no small amount of discomfort, \u201cMy clan has always been quite fond in displaying their riches.\u201d I had grown up in a life of poverty, where one had to share a room with all the other orphans and had to stretch out a slab of meat over a week, and here it seemed that Lorath\u2019s clan had far more wealth than they knew what to do with.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be sure that your\u2026guests just look but don\u2019t touch understand?\u201d growled Azura\u2019lii, and in a manner that seemed to emphasize the difference in her social status from mine.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then curved her gaze down one of the halls. \u201cDanielson!!\u201d she growled. A small human clad in a plain brown robe scampered across the hallway. \u201cYou called mistress?\u201d Squeezed between all the gathered dragons, he seemed pitifully tiny indeed. However, I recognized the name, and realized it must have been either the son or some other younger relative of the human I\u2019d met back at the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEscort my cousin and his girlfriends to the greeting room!! I need to go get my scales polished before the banquet!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mistress\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Azura\u2019lii strutted out of the chamber. In my opinion, she would have fit right in with Tsarra\u2019s clique of stuck up whores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled under my breath as she left. \u201cDarzhja!!\u201d hissed Heliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath grunted, \u201cActually, Heliana\u2019s assessment of my dear cousin is fairly accurate. I apologize that she was unwelcoming, but she wasn\u2019t always like that. Now, I\u2019m not going to bore the two of you of the details that made her that way, but I assure you that not all my family is like that, my older brother Loken and my father are much more welcoming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting hall was a gigantic underground chamber with multiple tiers.  Real sunlight poured in through a massive crystal skylight above. Raised upon the central tier was a middle aged blue drake, whom I could only guess was Lorath\u2019s father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI greet you, honored father\u2026\u201d bowed Lorath after he had stepped before the central dais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stepped forward to embrace his son. \u201cBy the Ancestors its great to see you again my son\u2026\u201d he answered and to my surprise, his voice was rather youthful and alive, if a bit weary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was getting worried that you weren\u2019t going to make it tonight for the banquet!!\u201d continued the new trade prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I apologize for the delay\u2026\u201d said Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also see you brought you honored guests along! Care to introduce me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, Heliana, this is my father Lord Lo\u2019rek; father, these are my friends from the Knights, Darzhja and Heliana\u2026\u201d said Lorath nodding his snout to each of us in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts good to meet you My Lord\u2026\u201d I bowed. Hopefully, I didn\u2019t look silly doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you as well Lady Darzhja\u2026\u201d answered Lo\u2019rek. I wondered briefly about the similarity of names of Lorath and his immediate family.  Perhaps it was some sort of tradition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mentioned something about a banquet right?\u201d cried Heliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, a \u2018celebration of the return of the prodigal son\u2019,\u201d answered Lorath\u2019s father with a deep chuckle in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors, yes!!\u201d she shrieked, flapping her wings enthusiastically.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be sure to leave some for us Heliana\u2026\u201d I quipped, not so subtly nudging her on the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another drake came forward to nudge Lorath on the side. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be, if it isn\u2019t the almighty Holy Knight!!\u201d growled the drake, but more in a teasing manner.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello esteemed older brother\u2026\u201d answered Lorath in overly proper Drakine, not so subtly feigning courtesy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath\u2019s brother, Loken, shifted his gaze playfully toward the two of us, \u201cLooks like you finally picked up some drakka little brother, a rather odd taste if I may say so myself.\u201d His gaze began to drift\u2026 \u201cPersonally, I prefer the more petite types\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted smoke out of my nostrils, \u201cWant me to beat you till you\u2019re a new shade of blue?\u201d  I said with silky ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would be utterly inappropriate, but honestly I couldn\u2019t help but feel that this philanderer needed a good kick in the balls. However, as I\u2019d learned to my detriment with Fangorn, he might take a perverse pleasure in this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you could Darzhja, but I\u2019d rather not have to go through the trouble of scraping his bloody remains off the pantry. Seriously brother, you\u2019re still going on about your conquests when we\u2019re about to have your wedding ceremony?\u201d cried Lorath.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoken gave a casual shrug with his wings, \u201cHey, don\u2019t get me wrong. Sly\u2019theria can be a cute drakka when she doesn\u2019t have that dark cloud over her head. I mean, I\u2019ll try to make the whole thing work and make her happy, but\u2026you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \u201cBah!! I\u2019ll deal with it when the time comes\u2026 anyhow, your guests look quite hungry, perhaps we can talk more at the banquet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Lorath toward a large ledge overlooking the Cliffside. Upon a huge raised table was an entire zoo worth of ornately prepared beasts, from water buffalo steaks, two-second flamed deer, roasted pig on a stick, steamed porpoise, every non-humanoid animal imaginable. A myriad of human servants were busily preparing the final touches to the meal.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAncestors take me\u2026\u201d moaned Heliana, her eyes glazed and her jaw salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dragoness was at the head of the table. She was rather plump, like Heliana was nowadays, but radiated an aura of kindness similar to my friend. \u201cGo right ahead, there\u2019s plenty for everyone!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana looked like she was ready to explode in happiness, as she immediately dug her head into the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you were right to overcook dearest,\u201d said Lord Lothar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed contently as she nuzzled with him. \u201cLorath!! Its so wonderful to see you again\u2026\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend really likes to eat doesn\u2019t she?\u201d she snickered. Lorath curved his gaze awkwardly, \u201cActually, Darzhja my date. Heliana\u2019s her friend from the Knights\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drakka then turned to me, \u201cOh!! I apologize!! How silly of me!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided not to hold it against her, \u201cNice to meet you as well Lady\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzur\u2019iel!!\u201d she answered. I tilted my head sideways. \u201cYes, I know you might find it a bit odd that the females of our clan start with Azure, long tradition. More importantly, I hope that my son has been treating you well, he can be rather timid at times but I\u2019m glad he\u2019s finally found someone he likes\u2026\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel my stomach flutter somewhat, \u201cWell, I\u2019m really glad to hear that. Honestly, I\u2019ve felt rather nervous of coming here but the people here seem nice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed around at the assorted guests, and I couldn\u2019t help but get the sense that I didn\u2019t quite belong.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get to know everyone in due time!!\u201d she cried cheerfully. \u201cIts been nice meeting you Darzhja!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lorath was glad to see that Darzhja and Heliana were getting along nicely with the clan (except for Azur'lii of course, but then again his iracible cousin didn't got along with few people in any case). He'd been rather worried at how well Darzhja in particular would fit in, and her manners at the porchside had a lot to be desired, but there was a sort of rustic charm about her. It was refreshing that she didn't pay heed to the nuances and <br>\r\noften stifling etiquette of the merchant clans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was chatting it up with his mother, who was rather fascinated to hear of her lifestory of coming from the orphanage and rising to become a Knight. While she was chatting it up, this gave Lorath an opportunity to bring up a few issues concerning Axel Xion with his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, could I speak to you for a moment?\" asked Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father lifted himself from his dish of steamed porpoise to address him, \"What is on your mind my son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel Xion is slowly taking over our holdings in the countryside. He's driving our clients out of business by skewing the prices on their supplies. I've already promised Sildor that I would subsidize him until we can get the situation sorted out, but if this keeps up then eventually we'll be placed into big debt and he'll either get bought out by Xion or be forced to close down...\" explained Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...yes, a truly vexing matter,\" cried Lo'rek, \"I think you have the right idea of subsidizing our clients for the time being. Xion might be trying to undercut us, but his pockets are not very deep.  Xion is far from the first uppity humanoid merchant we've ever faced. Its true that humanoids like him can get money quickly, but because of their impatience and lack of discretion they can lose it just as quickly. Furthermore, compared to the wealth of the Dak'saird Clan, which has been established for millenia, this upstart will find himself short of cash eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The theory is sound, but we have not been able to buy him off or negotiate with him. You are right father in mentioning that humanoid merchants come and go, but Axel Xion is far more ruthless than any humanoid merchant we've faced in quite some time. Considering the way he has ruthlessly exploited the aftermath of the New Alveri attack, I'm beginning to get suspicions that he might have played a hand in it. Rather than letting him do more damage to our enterprise I say we should act proactively and take him down as soon as we can,\" said Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand the sentiment, but that would only gain Axel Xion notoriety. He may be on the offensive now, but soon the humanoids will realize the type of fraud he is. At worst, all we need to do is wait a few decades before Xion dies of old age, and without this charismatic individual at the helm, his empire will start to fall apart, and we'll be there to claim his holdings. I do admit that this will affect our finances adversely for the short term, but your brother's wedding to the Shadowfangs will further improve our financial situation and minimize whatever scheme will wither before long...\" father assured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but I still have a bad feeling about him. I believe that it would be a good idea to revoke his invitation for my brother's wedding, nor allow any individuals from his affiliated companies access to the wedding either.\" explained Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, his father wouldn't have any of it, \"What message would that send to the humans? That the Dak'saird clan is admitting that it is vulnerable and that it fears the ambitions of a short-lived humanoid? Aye, if he really does have these violent tendencies, it might be in fact better to invite him so we can get a better idea of his intensions. As the old saying goes, keep your friends close but your enemies closer,\" he cried. His father had a decent point. If Xion was away from the wedding, then he would be out of sight and free to do what he wished, and furthermore it would clearly signal that the Dak'saird clan was now openly hostile to him. If one could pretend that they were still on good terms with Xion, then he might grow complacent and would make it more likely that he would slip up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me if I have been too forward,\" said Lorath, bowing down in apology, \"As you are the clan leader, the decision ultimately lies with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath supposed that he should be happy that father was even willing to hear out his concerns in the first place. As he had joined the Knights, it meant that legally he was no longer a member of the Dak'saird Clan and that he would have no say in how the clan conducted its business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so, but I find great value in your input my son. You have a no nonsense view of the world and don't take anything for granted. Its a pity that you decided to join the Knights...\" sighed father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath groaned, he wasn't about to have this talk again. While his parents hadn't been outright hostile about him joining the Knights, they certainly had been reluctant about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've gotten over that,\" said father, as if reading his mind, \"Its your dream to pursue, and I'm glad that you have found fulfillment in it. Yet...if for some reason that anything were to happen to me, then your older brother would be in control of the clan. While he is entitled to the position in terms of rights, personally, I'd feel more secure if you were there to advise him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath immediately cut his father off, \"Look father, I don't want that type of power, and that's why I became a Knight. I've set down roots there and made many close companionships, and I would prefer not to have to leave that behind. Besides, you'll life a long and healthy life, and by that time Lo'ken would be able to step into the position and by then he'd have a capable heir as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the real question was what would happen if if something were to happen to father right now. As it stood, there was no way that Lo'ken would be able to lead the Dak'saird clan, due to his brother's profligatry and his preference to want to stage parties rather than actually govern.  Back when grandfather was alive and seemingly would continue to go on forever, that really hadn't mattered, but now it was down to father, Lo'ken and himself. Personally, he hoped that it wouldn't have to come down to it, but if it did... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his ponderings were interrupted with a loud burp. It had seemed that Lo'ken and Heliana had emptied the vat of firewater, and were both rather tipsy now. Furthermore, all the food was pretty much devoured; apparently mother had underestimated the extent of Heliana's appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lorath's dismay, Lok'en, being the smaller of the two, was the one who was far more drunk. Father let out a sigh, but not really having expected anything different, \"Lorath, could you take your brother to his room so he can recover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father...\" sighed Lorath. Like he had done many times before, Lorath grasped his brother so he wouldn't stumble around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left, he turned to face Darzhja, who appeared rather disgusted at his brother's behavior, while also a bit disapproving of Heliana as well. \"I apologize for the inconvenience Darzhja, but could you escort Heliana to one of the guest lairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guest lairs?\" cried Darzhja, rather confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she needs a place where she can get sober. I'll definitely make it up to you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm holding you to that!!\" she cried, in a way that almost sounded threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath called one of the humans over, \"Could you show them where one of the guest rooms are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well my Lord...\" the human bowed, \"If you would please follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then curved to his brother, who was now drooling from his jaw. \"Come on brother, you need to rest. Can't be looking like this for your wedding you know...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was overwhelmed by the many scents of cooked food almost the moment I stepped outside onto the wide, open patio.  The long table, carved to comfortable height for a reclining dragon of average build all but groaned under the weight of food on it.  And these were not simply giant cauldrons of beef stew either.  There were delicacies here that I'd never seen before; in fact almost all of the dishes were unrecognizable.  It was a carnivore's banquet though, as most of the dishes consisted mostly of meat, but the sauces they were cooked, steamed and poached in were pungent and varied.  Heliana beside me couldn't close her mouth at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although the sight of the food was welcoming, the assembled blue dragons were less so.  I was actually scared out of my wits meeting Lorath's family.  What if I said something wrong?  What if I came across as foolish or simple, just because I didn't have the sort of entitlement that Lorath had grown up with?  What if I made such a bad impression, Lorath didn't want to be seen with me again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that I needn't have worried so.  The first person I was introduced to was Lorath's mother.  She was a kindly dame, much older than Lorath's father and I would later find out that he was her second mate.  Azura'lai was down to earth, homely and welcoming and seemed genuinely interested as I began to tell of the long tale that led to my becoming a Holy Knight.  And she wasn't alone either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found I had a small audience around hanging on my every word.  So much so, I hardly touched my food as I recounted my trials and adventures.  I looked at the guests in turn, trying my very best to remember them, for they would surely remember me.  A silver drake with a characteristic blue streak down his spine stuck out first in my mind.  He had inherited the comely looks that seemed to flow in the males of Lorath's family. His name was Alastair and it turned out that he hailed from a lesser branch family from Lorath's.  \"We and the other two lesser families fill out most of the niche rolls for Dak'Saird.  Courrier work mostly, but also private guarding and advising.  You might have seen my older brother Alastein outside the portal where you landed.\" he told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and agreed when he gave me a description and I couldn't help but think what a tight nit group Dak'saird must be.  Even though he personally had no change at the prestige of the controlling family, he didn't seem to mind at all giving his whole self over to the betterment of the clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to Lorath's mother, there were two other drakka listening to my tale.  One was Azura'lii's professed sister.  \"Though not of the same sire, mind.\"  she told me.  \"Azura'lii's clutch unfortunately suffered a blight almost as soon as they were out of the egg.  She was the only survivor, bless her heart.\"  She told me not to mind her half-sister's rudeness, as she had certain \"trust issues\" as she put it.  While Azura'lii's sister was positively bubbly, the other drakka watched me with a steady glare, saying little the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat drakka's name was Azurel'lia and she had distinctive silver markings on her face, like human freckles.  She seemed self conscious about them and turned her head away when I pointed them out.  I'd embarrassed myself, I knew, but I'd thought they looked stunning.  I would learn much later that she was the product of an affair between Azura'lai and an adventurous young drake from the city while she'd been with her first spouse.  It was perhaps little wonder why she was a little more subdued than the rest.  During that dinner, however, she had a tendency to eye Heliana, who was making out like a fiend at the platters upon platters on the table and had a tendency to ask me more slightly embarrassing questions about my eager companion than myself.  I suppose I should be grateful her attention was elsewhere.  She had a cold logic that rubbed me the wrong way.  At least Azura'lii was straightforward about who she didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't pay much attention to anyone outside my little group, but I was forced to when it was very apparent that both Heliana and Loken had gotten more inebriated than was seemly.  I saw Loken sidle up beside Heliana as the great silver plucked thick slice after thick slice onto her heavy wooden platter for the umpteenth time.  I'd seen him down the last of the fire brandy when Heliana hadn't been looking and when he exhale, the vapors were plainly visible on the air, making for a very different sort of flame.  His eyes were half lidded and he swayed slightly where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed a wing up Heliana's generous flank.  \"Did I mention that I like a drakka with shome meat on her bones?\"  he slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana for her part started at the physical contact, but she sidlided up closer once she realized who it was and what he'd just said.  \"Well, I\u2026 You are too\u2026 kind\u2026 really\u2026\" she flustered, hiding an obvious grin behind her wing.  But then she seemed to have a sober thought that straightened her back and made her step away.  \"Hmph.  I remember you mentioned to your brother that you liked the petite type better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all but cause the drunken Loken to stumble.  He caught himself, though and withdrew his questing wing.  \"Oh, Heliana, that was just a joke.  Besides\u2026 I can say with absolute honesty that you look\u2026\"  His eyes crossed just the slightest bit.  \"R-ravishing!\" he exclaimed with not a little animalistic growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeliana for her part was too inebriated to resist.  I could see the reservations melting out of her and she stepped closer.  Almost immediately, Loken's tail moved over to carress the swell of Heliana's tummy.  I saw red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\"  I said to Azura'lei and the others as I got to my feet and began to pad around to the other side of the table, more than ready to shed blood if I had to.  Lorath saw me, though and with a panicked look in his eyes raced over to prevent my bloodlust\u2026 or perhaps prevent an incident.  I wasn't sure which was more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath did an admirable job separating the two and got his brother half holstered on his withers while I gathered up a slightly more resisting Heliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026 Hey, where's Lo-lo-Loken going?\"  Heliana asked with some amount of fervor.  She might have still thought she was going to get lucky with a handsome drake, but I wasn't about to let her honor be spoiled, especially not to the philandering male who was supposed to be wed in less than a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to go get a cold shower and a long night's rest, honey.\"  I said calmly as I escorted Heliana to our guest quarters deep inside the cliff ace.  Fortunately for me, Lorath had had the foresight to assign me a human servant who led me and Heliana to our chambers.  I was too occupied with keeping Heliana from wandering off after \"Mr. Hansome Blue\" to even ask the poor lad's name, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, poo\u2026\"  muttered Heliana with a long face.  I almost felt sorry for her, but then she'd rather made a pig of herself at the banquet, so I wasn't bashful in pushing her through the dimly lit cave's opening and instructing her to lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to forget about Loken and his unfulfilled promise when she hit the stone floor.  She rubbed her belly absently with both forepaws.  \"Oh Darzhja, that was such a great dinner!\"  she exclaimed and rolled onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Heliana, I know\u2026\"  I said, but the only answer I got was soft snoring.  I couldn't help myself.  I started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to her and rest my back comfortable against her.  I thought I couldn't resent Lorath for not missing a good thing when it was right there.  Heliana made quite the nice pillow.  I fell asleep and dreamed of blue and silver bodies drifting in a vast sea.  One was exceedingly familiar, and he welcomed me down into the dark depths.  I sighed with pleasure and was gone for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, I was already surprised to see we had an attendant.  He'd been waiting for us while sitting on a stool out in the corridor.  His face was familiar, why it was the servant from last night, but there was something more as well.  I'd been introduced to this human, and his face bore a striking semblance to someone else I knew.  I lifted my scaled lids slowly, waiting for it to hit me; why my human name be so hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the servant, he slowly turned the pages of a leather bound book he was studying.  On its cover there was the crest of the Dragon Cult.  \"Danielson?\"  I muttered, mouth feeling dry and sticky.  I'd consumed my own fairshare of the firebrand last night as well and hadn't escaped some of the after effects.  Of course, I didn't envy Heliana at all when she'd finally wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human closed his book with a snap and stuffed it into the pocket of his long sleeve.  \"Mistress Darzhja!  Glad to see you awake.  I trust you have had a pleasant rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI licked my chops and gave a great toothy yawn.  Danielson averted his face and I felt bad for showering the lad in what must have been rank breath, even for a dragon.  I muttered an apology and yawned again before rubbing some crust from my outer lids with the back of a paw.  \"I didn't get the chance to say so earlier, but I met your father in the Temple before I left.\"</span></div></div>",

He's very stingy with his letters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and lowered my head down closer to his level, my body still resting against the bulk of a snoring Heliana behind me. \"From what I saw of him, he was doing well. He helped arrange my and Lorath's vacation here and Lorath seems to have a great deal of trust in his competence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraising the value of a Dragon cultist's work was the best way I knew of to praise them. This man surprised me a little by not retreating into the ever repeated, \"You are too kind's and Thank you's\" Then he surprised me even more when he said. \"I'm glad to hear that. For my part, I thought you did a marvelous job out there. Everyone was hanging onto your every word. I knew it wasn't a bad idea for you to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" I asked, curiosity piqued. I nosed my face a little closer to the standing human. If I rested my jaw on the floor, we could just see eye to eye, though my snout was just as long as the man's whole body. \"And do I owe you any thanks for my being here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI intended to put him a little off nerve; just a little. But he responded strongly. \"None that you need to voice, My Lady.\" he said with a low bow. \"To look upon your elegant form is thanks enough. Besides Bronze is such a nice change of pace from all the blue and silver, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but purr. \"Oh my, you do know how to flatter a drakka.\" I said with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed and it was a rich sound from the man's belly.

Especially if there were a couple more like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I do have a favor that I wish to ask of you,\u201d he asked, sounding more serious though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d I inquired. One of the reasons why humans all too often went out of the way to praise dragons was in hopes that the dragons would reciprocate. This could mean anything as trivial as proffering a loose scale to lending part of their hoard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you are unaware, today marks the two thousanth anniversary when Father Nodalisk and his nine disciples exorcised the blood mages. I was hoping that you would do us the honor of participating the commemoration ceremony at St Jarico\u2019s basilica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I was a bit confused about Danielson\u2019s request, but when I took note of the human\u2019s robe I realized what he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St Jarico's Basilica? That would be where the former Blood Mage cult was located correct? That would also make you a priest from the Dragon Cult!\u201d I replied, intrigued. \u201cA cleric of the Followers of Nod would be the more proper term,\u201d Danielson corrected. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a cleric and a priest, but basically the easiest way you can tell a cleric apart from the common priests in that we don\u2019t have to keep our heads shaved any longer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but snort with amusement. Frankly, I had always found the almost desperate piety of the shaved headed priests rather amusing.  \u201cLorath did mention something about a commemoration ceremony when we were headed off toward Damescara, and he did say something about attending in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to get into the inner sanctum without the presence of a clegymember, so not everybody could get access,\u201d answered Danielson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I didn\u2019t doubt that Lorath wouldn\u2019t have been able to get in anyhow, given the influence of his clan. That being the case, I found it a little odd that Danielson would specifically bring the matter up. I couldn\u2019t help but get the sense that Danielson was testing me somehow, withholding information until I solved this mental riddle. Behind me, Heliana murmured something in her sleep; she wouldn\u2019t be waking any time soon, nor would Lo\u2019ken or likely the rest of the Dak\u2019saird clan for that matter. After the excessive banquet, none of them would probably be able to attend the ceremony on the morning of first day, so it would probably be only Lorath and myself. Looking back upon it, Lorath had been having some very feverish discussions with Danielson\u2019s father, and my gut feeling had told me that it hadn\u2019t all pertained to vacation plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered my neck to stare directly into the human\u2019s eye. \u201cPerhaps it is a hunch, but I gather that you\u2019re not only here to ask me about attending the ceremony now is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost humans would have flinched at my display, but to his credit Danielson did not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guess correctly Lady Darzhja. I cannot give you the exact details here, but the name of the dragon who brought up this matter is a dragon by the name of Lord Ral\u2019pherinox, a famed engineer who is affiliated with the Dak\u2019saird Clan, and its regarding the matter of Axel Xion,\u201d said Danielson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the name of the infamous tycoon instantly made me aware that this was actually quite a serious and potentially quite dangerous matter. From what I had seen of Axel Xion, he had left a rather negative impression and wouldn\u2019t have been all too displeased if this uppity rascal were to meet an untimely demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this was the matter that Lorath was conversing with your father about back at the temple no doubt?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Lorath came into the room. He was already wide awake and seeming ready to head off for the morning ceremony. \u201cThat\u2019s right Darzhja. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you any of this beforehand but Danielson\u2019s matter is of a very urgent importance. Again, I can\u2019t give any details until we\u2019ve met with our client, but basically we\u2019re hoping to take Axel Xion down\u2026 I know that this seems rather sudden, and you\u2019re not obligated by any means to accept until you\u2019ve at least heard our client\u2019s testimony, but nonetheless I was hoping you could help us Darzhja.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought long and hard about it. I couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat betrayed that Lorath wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about this sort of thing, and that basically by accepting that it meant that the vacation was basically over. Yet at the same time I could understand why they would keep it under wraps, and there was also an opportunity to get some real action. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We arrived at a small shrine sequestered at the outskirts of Damescara, resembling more the cave of a typical draconic family\u2019s home than a church. Thus, there was a rather quaint feel when I entered, in which the only evidence that it was a church were the murals and the presence of the humanoid priests. I followed Lorath closely and a bit to the left down a long, wide pathway which bisected the chamber. Danielson walked between the two of us, careful not to accidentally get kicked or smacked by Lorath\u2019s slightly swaying tail. On either side, there were various human worshippers, none of them seeming particularly well off, dressed in simple peasant clothing nor were they particularly clean, but I felt heartened of how they lightly bowed their heads in reverence when we passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not all the attendees were at ease with what the Ancestors had blessed with them at the moment. Up at the front of the chapel was a thin, middle-aged fire drake whose head was lowered in respect to a large statue of Gyramond. After finishing his prayer, the drake lifted his head and let out a resigned sigh, as if he expected nothing else but more disappointment and despair. I felt for him, wondering if there was anything I could do to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to lift his head and perked up a little. \u201cOh\u2026Hello Lord Lorath, Sir Danielson,\u201d he gestured, \u201cWhat would bring you here today? Surely, you could be attend the grand ceremony at the St Jarico\u2019s Basilica\u2019s shrine now could you?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could, but I prefer to be able to conduct my prayers to the Ancestors with a measure of solitude instead of the huge public frenzy,\u201d answered Lorath. \u201cMore importantly though, Danielson and I have been looking into the disappearance of your son and the possibility that it may be linked with wrong doing on Axel Xion\u2019s part, and thus I brought somebody here that could help us achieve this task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin fire drake craned his head upwards to gaze at me skeptically, \u201cThis dragoness?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d clarified Lorath, \u201cShe is someone you can trust. I\u2019ll tell you a  more after the conclusion of the ceremony\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well Lord Lorath\u2026\u201d bowed the fire drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the ceremony itself, it actually wasn\u2019t much different in terms of style than the prayers Lady Ramoth had led in the orphanage once every weekend morning. I lowered myself to the ground as low as I could, as did Lorath and the skinny fire drake, so as to allow Danielson to be able to stand up on the podium and be visible to all the human worshippers as he led the prayers. The list of prayers I gave to the Ancestors was usual; to be able to find Blaze, that the orphans would remain protected, that I would be able to protect the denizens of the Empire from her enemies, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the ceremony was done, and that we were able to get to a place free from any prying eyes and ears, we began to discuss in length the plot to take down Axel Xion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, now that the ceremony is over, perhaps you two could introduce yourselves to each other\u2026\u201d said Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Darzhja, a Knight in training from New Alveri\u2026 I\u2019ve come to understand that Axel Xion has troubled you in some way, and as Lorath pointed out earlier, I\u2019m here to help out,\u201d I introduced. In all honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure how much I really could help, as I wasn\u2019t necessarily the sneaky sort of dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pleasure to meet you Lady Darzhja. I\u2019m Ral\u2019pherinox of the Redforge Clan. Our family has served the Dak\u2019saird\u2019s overseeing their engineering and construction projects for many generations\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re a builder then?\u201d I cried, tilting my head sideways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I design all the blueprints and arrange the logistics,\u201d he clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!! Alright\u2026\u201d I replied, still not really comprehending what he meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow Ral\u2019pherinox, perhaps you would like to share your story of how your son went missing with Darzhja\u2026\u201d said Lorath in a comforting manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heaved a long painful breath. \u201cVery well then. Its\u2026its regarding my son, who has been missing for the past three years now. Ral\u2019pherinox, who shares my name\u2026 I was raising him to one day take my place as the chief engineer. He\u2019s a very smart young drake, naturally inquisitive and took to the craft with energy and enthusiasm, yet we had a terrible argument one day. He told me that he was interested in taking a very lucrative position for Axel Xion\u2019s Guild when the business mogul went and purchased the colloseum from the Firestone Clan, and that they needed his talents for the renovations. I told him that it would be betraying our sponsors, and that if he worked for Axel Xion I would cut all ties with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I regretted the incident, and headed toward the Guild offices in hopes I could apologize. A representative told me that he didn\u2019t wish to speak to me, so at first I assumed he was still angry. This was only about a couple weeks before the attack, but when the attack came, once again I attempted to contact them, but they gave me the same answer, and that in addition that he had signed a clause saying that he wasn\u2019t allowed to contact me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Even I know that you have to be at least 65 years old before you can sign a contract like that without the consent of a guardian!!\u201d I burst out. That put him around the same age as Blaze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he was kidnapped then\u2026\u201d I spoke with absolute certainty. \u201cLike Blaze was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I began to suspect as well, so I came to the Dak\u2019saird\u2019s to see if they could find anything, and thus we\u2019ve been working to solve this case ever since\u2026 Yet anyhow, tell me about this Blaze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explained to the middle aged drake about how Blaze had gone missing during the New Alveri attack, and my involvement with dealing with egg smugglers and how it could be connected to the disappearance of his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused my gaze back toward Lorath and Danielson. \u201cLook, I know I\u2019m not the smartest dragon around, but I know when something isn\u2019t right. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get Blaze back, and if Axel Xion was involved with this I\u2019ll make sure he pays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson came forward, \u201cAnyhow, let me explain where you come in. I\u2019m sure that you already know that Axel Xion is sponsoring a fighting tournament at the Coliseum,\u201d he started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!! The tournament commemorating the battles against the blood mages right?\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct Darzhja, I was hoping that you\u2019d be willing to register as a combatant, or do I even need to ask?\u201d he finished rather teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath was right in that he really didn\u2019t need to ask. I loved wrestling, of matching strength upon strength, the thrill of competition and striving for the top. \u201cI\u2019m always up for a good fight, count me in!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet how will participating in the tournament actually take down Axel Xion?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain Darzhja,\" began Danielson, \"If Sir Ralphernox\u2019s son went missing around the area of the coliseum, we also suspect that there would be evidence of his criminal activities as well. I\u2019m going to be leading a team to discover evidence of Axel Xion's wrongdoing's within his archies, yet we need a way of getting in without seeming suspicious, so with you being a fighter, why, you'll also need a competent handling crew correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!! I think I understand. The more opponents I beat in in the ring, the longer your team can investigate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely, Darzhja. In addition, with your increasing success as a fighter, Axel Xion might start to take an interest in your fighting skills and perhaps discuss the possibility of you joining in with whatever he is plotting and that he might also reveal his future plans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll pretend to go along with him and then you\u2019ll be able to find incriminating evidence against him? Then, this evidence can be presented before the Knights, and then Axel Xion will be arrested, and also we\u2019ll learn about where Axel Xion\u2019s people have taken Blaze and Lord Ral\u2019pherinox\u2019s son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\" said Lorath, \"As for my role, you remember how Axel Xion had been invited to my brother\u2019s wedding right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re planning to get him there?\u201d I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully, but leading up to the wedding we\u2019ve been trying to give Axel Xion the impression that we want to cooperate with him,\u201d added Lorath. \"A lot of business is done during these types of social gatherings, and once we present all this incriminating evidence against him, he\u2019ll then have no choice but to cooperate with the condition of turning over all his business to us and revealing his entire plot in exchange for house arrest, or public execution. Either way, once these crimes are revealed all of his investors will leave him and all the dragons who were employed by him will quickly disassociate themselves from him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAncestors hope we would be that fortunate,\u201d said Ral\u2019pherinox, \u201cDo keep in mind that he didn\u2019t become as powerful as he has by being stupid. He might smell a plot and attempt to counter against us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight bit of doubt crept into my mind at the aged dragon\u2019s warning. I knew full well that ever since the New Alveri attack Xion had already evaded all the best efforts of the Knights and the Merchant Princes to stop him. Yet one thing I had learned when I was young, and reinforced during my time as a Knight was that one could not afford to hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say bring it on!! The quicker we get started the quicker we can take him down!! Where do I go to become a fighter!?\u201d I demanded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lorath responded to my enthusiastic reply with a slightly hesitant voice and an eye that wouldn't quite meet my own. \"There's just one major problem with getting you into the arena, however. All of the tournament positions have been filled years in advance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years?!\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath shrugged, \"It's only to be expected, really. Everyone's been looking forward to this celebration, for some it's been over a century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let my wings sag across my back and I cocked my head, looking at Lorath beside me. \"Then why even bring this up, if it's hopeless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came from my other side where Danielson stood upon his speaking box. \"Ah, but it's not as hopeless as it seems, my Mistress. There may be no more positions open for the tournament, but it is possible to join nevertheless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI canted my head down at the small man. Lorath beamed in a way that suggested he already knew this part, but across from me the esteemed Ral'Pherinox seemed as ignorant as I at the moment. \"And would you care to explain how this might be, Danielson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human priest and servant of the Cult smiled broadly up at me, showing off his many flat white teeth. \"It is possible for you to take one of the current fighter's positions, My Lady.\" My eyes opened wider, I think I liked where this was going. The human continued, \"You see, the fighters are all honor bound not to fight one another before the tournament; in fact, they are discouraged from even meeting each other. But they may still get into fights with nonparticipants before the games begin\u2026 and this is where things get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I don't need to explain a dragon's sense of honor regarding things like ritual combat, but a certain amount of drakine 'common sense' is written right into the rules of the tournament. Each of the participants went through a lengthy weeding process long before this tournament even had a designated arena. This was to ensure that no weaklings were present to embarrass themselves when the real fighting began.\" I nodded silently. To my dragon-sense this was less an inconsideration to the average participant than a way to avoid embarrassment and shame later on\u2026 and also to do better service to the bloodlust that most dragons feel regarding this most ancient and revered sport. \"Now, this isn't an explicit rule, but the guidelines mention that a participant who is \"shamed\" before the tournament may be disqualified and it would then be necessary to find a replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my keen sense of ritual combat, I thought that I already saw where this was going. However, there was another problem, \"Wouldn't they pull a new replacement from the list of dragons who just barely didn't make the last cut, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson made a Cult gesture with his finger, 'right on the nose.' \"Usually, that would be exactly the case, however, if a participant were to come to shame through losing to a recognized and public fight, well\u2026 this is were things get murky. Because of the fact that there is another prescedent in the guidelines that allows for 'heroic citizens' to enter the tournament, should they be short on fighters for any reason. And which do you think is more preferable to the judges, one of the dragons already disqualified, or one whose already proven strong enough to take down a contender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRal'Pherinox snorted derisive purple smoke. \"To think that one can simply walk up to one of these barbarians, knock them down and take their place.\" It was clear that the older drake expected more from a religious holiday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson raised a hand in plea, however, \"No, Master Engineer, it is not like that at all. In the act of provoking a fight with the sole objective of entering the tournament in that specific manner, the challenger automatically disqualifies him or herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if the participant is the one that provokes the fight? I\u2019ve seen a lot of fighters who like to bully and pester the population for no good reason other than wanting to throw their weight around. If I stand up to such a fighter and prevail wouldn\u2019t I get into the tournament?\" I asked, eyes slanted while my tail curled behind me in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson turned his odd flat face towards me again. \"Certainly, but considering the prestige of the event the participants aren\u2019t likely to throw away their spot by some petty misdemeanor, especially this close to the tournament itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how are we going to start a challenge with them?\u201d I cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I was thinking of staging an incident instead. With the help of my fellow priests, we can rile the participant where he starts harassing us, and Darzhja would come to defend us from their harassment\u2026\u201d said Danielson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fairly feasible, but would that not place you and your priests in significant physical danger?\u201d said Ral\u2019phernox. That was a point; humanoids were extremely fragile in comparison to dragon kind, and if things went wrong it could easily prove fatal for one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it means taking down Axel Xion, then we\u2019re willing to take that risk\u2026\u201d said Danielson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but how can you be sure that they will take the bait?\" he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This close to the tournament, we don't have very may realistic options, and its the best plan I have got,\" answered Danielson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there another way that doesn\u2019t have to risk the lives of innocent humanoids?\u201d I wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other way would be to put the participant in such a position where their honor would be questioned and they would have no choice but to accept our challenge,\u201d said Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we would need some sort of grievance that would put the participants honor into question I take it?\u201d cried Ral\u2019Pherinox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d finished Lorath. \u201cI'd come up with an alternate plan, one that would not put Danielson\u2019s priests in physical harm, would guarantee a challenge and psychologically rattle the dragon in question to the point where it would guarantee a victory, but the way of going about it would have completely new complications that I'd much rather avoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted my gaze dubiously at Lorath, who tapped his claw anxiously on the stone floor. \u201cIf it would guarantee a challenge we do have to consider the option now do we?\u201d cried Ral'pherinox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would indeed, yet I would prefer not to have to use it\u2026 In fact I would rather not say at all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw tightened as I glared at Lorath, \u201cPlease tell me Lorath, I'd rather hear it than have things constantly hidden from me\u2026 Like the Master Engineer said, if its a chance to stop Axel Xion and also find his son and Blaze, then I'd like to hear of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Darzhja?\u201d replied Lorath with a great deal of trepedation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me...\" I growled impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath shifted his gaze at Danielson and Ral\u2019pherniox, \u201cWould you please leave us for a few moments if you would?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded solemnly, before turning away out of sight, so it was only myself and Lorath now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarzhja, you\u2019ve heard of Sir Cronos have you not?\u201d began Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I have!! He\u2019s only one of the most famous fighters in all of Nod!!\u201d I cried. Anybody with any sense of being a fighter in the ring would have known of the 'Drake of Steel', of his prowess, his wealth and his larger than life, cocky persona. He'd travel to the furthest corners of the globe searching for the strongest fighters, and would detail his exploits through song and lore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you bring him up though?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDespite his fame, his advancing age makes him but a shadow of what he once was, and that this is to be his last fight in any case. So, I believe you would be able to prevail in a challenge I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm flattered you think that I'm that skilled, but he has to accept the challenge in the first place right, and that you have a scheme that would give him no choice but to accept?\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d answered Lorath. \u201cSo let me flesh out the scenario. During his younger days when he was in his prime, winning tournament after tournament, Cronos was also infamous for his sexual exploits in every city he went, and furthermore that he sired countless hatchlings with various mistresses throughout his career as a fighter. He never provided for any of them either, instead using his money to ensure these mistresses remained hushed up and never going public. As for where you come in Darzhja...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually on second thought its probably shouldn't say anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've already said all I need to hear!!\u201d I wailed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... you want me to go up to Cronos and claim that I'm one of bastards he sired during his fighting career, and call him out on how he never took responsibility and that I had to be raised in an orphanage. People...people would find that a nice juicy drama to bite into wouldn't they? Who wouldn't pay loads of gems to see that fight? Of the vengeful daughter coming after him to make him pay for his sins! They'd believe it also, because he's a Bronze Dragon like myself and that I'm certainly young enough also wouldn't it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Darzhja, I should never have brought it up\u2026\u201d said Lorath. His apology felt hollow though. I felt dirty, like I was being used. Yet I had demanded that Lorath tell me of this alternative, and he had told me even though he had warned me about it. What was worst was the notion that it could actually be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted my head away, \"No Lorath its not that...I...I... I just need time to be alone for a while...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I left Lorath and the rest of them after that, needing to think.  I felt hurt by Lorath's suggestion of such low tactics, even though he hadn't exactly sprung it on me so much as I myself had insisted he tell me the alternative to our fragile human allies placing themselves in mortal danger.  Outside the smallish humble church set into the windswept hillside, I walked through the other worshippers, not seeing them.  I spread my wings, and above the treetops, I saw that it was still morning, bright and sunny and cruelly inconsistent with the way I was feeling just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI circled aimlessly for a while, climbing until the air was thin and cold, but not really going anywhere.  I wanted some distance between Lorath and myself, but was still aware that I was in an unfamiliar countryside and would be easily lost without him.  I breathed deeply, relishing the chill on my wings and scales.  I passed up into a cloud and the world vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater beaded on my skin and ran in rivulets from my jaw to my shoulders and down my long sleek body.  breathing was as much drinking, but it was the best tasting water.  I set my wings and drifted through the pale blankness, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Axel Xion needed to be taken down was no question; not when he had Blaze\u2019s blood on his dirty hands not to mention that of countless other dragons. Logically, I knew that Lorath\u2019s plan was the best chance to get into the tournament and take down Axel Xion. While Danielson and his crew\u2019s determination and courage were admirable, I didn\u2019t want them to throw their lives away so easily. From a dragon\u2019s perspective, humanoids were all too often perceived more as an amorphous mass in which their individual lives seemed insignificant and exceptionally fragile. A human should not have to die just to maintain a dragon\u2019s image and ego, especially not when there was an alternative. Yet what Lorath was asking me to do though\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Cronos had been one of my idols while growing up. He had been the epitome of strength and honor, chivalrous in victory and also congratulatory to his opponent during the rare times he lost. Yet now, apparently, this hatchling hood hero was a lecher and a cheat behind the scenes. In a way, I should not have considered this particularly surprising; after all, having been raised an orphan I was by no means naiive, but it was nonetheless a blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, I resented the fact that Lorath had to be the one to sully one of my idols, and that I felt dirty of having to blackmail Cronos in such a manner. Yet the fact was that maybe it was my fault that I had decided to make Cronos one of my idols. After all, it had been an open secret that Cronos had attracted a crowd of drakka wherever he went; in fact when I had been very small I\u2019d had these silly fantasies of how I would marry the fighter and be his bride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet being a fighter myself, I felt I had a good grasp on their psychology. They liked to show off their power quite a bit, and Cronos demonstrating his prowess not only in the ring but with the drakka seemed all too likely. It was sadly easy to envision him siring a bunch of hatchlings and leaving the poor mothers with nothing and completely disassociating with them. That\u2019s how so many dragons had ended up in orphanages; like myself for instance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore disturbing and infuriating was the small but frightening possibility that Cronos truly was the drake that had sired me. If so, what made me angry wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact he had abandoned me and my mother, but the fact that he had done so when he clearly had the means to support us and hadn\u2019t while all the while had used that same money to hush it all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also the possibility that these allegations weren\u2019t true, at least concerning myself, and that I\u2019d just be outright blackmailing him to get into he tournament. Yet again, if I didn\u2019t do that, I\u2019d have to sacrifice human lives into the tournament, or worse if I did nothing Axel Xion would continue to scheme against the Empire I was sworn to protect and many more could die because of inaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a sigh, gently tilting my body around so I was floating upside down. The cloud I was in enmeshed me almost like a security blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a fighter, a warrior, a knight. I was trained to fight an enemy whose sinister designs were clear and not bothering to hide their ill intensions. Seek the enemy, fight them and then either gain victory and glory or death and defeat. All this shadowy intrigue and backroom dealing wasn\u2019t who I was. That was what dragons like Lorath dabbled into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen that side of Lorath now, I realized that I had become smitten with Lorath without really analyzing his inner character. All that meant was that Lorath, like every other dragon in the world, had his share of personal flaws and that I needed to understand him more as a person now as the relationship got more serious. Because I had no doubt in my hearts that Lorath genuinely cared about me, and that he ultimately wanted to do the right thing. Or rather, I desperately wanted to believe that was the case, that he truly saw me as something more as the same way I saw him and that I wasn't just being used by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, I felt a shift in the wind come from below. I twisted my body in that direction, and my eyes widened when I quickly spotted Lorath\u2019s distinctive blue hide half hidden by the mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are Darzhja\u2026\u201d said Lorath. We began to circle higher up in the air so we wouldn't lose each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to apologize for having to put you in this sort of position,\u201d he said. \u201cFor planning this sort of scheme behind your back and then expecting you to go through it..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts not necessarily your fault Lorath. I suppose I just wasn\u2019t prepared psychologically as I believed, that the manner would be simple and without complication. In fact, I appreciate that you considered my feelings before telling me the plan you had in mind. To tell you the truth, I'm aware of the fact I'm not as...what's the word, keen on my surroundings as I could be. I see the enemy, I fight them straight on and don't really think too hard on why they are the enemy. I couldn't have thought of any of this nor would these things have occurred to me before,\u201d I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath let out a grunt, \u201cIn a way, its probably better you are the way you are, and I mean that in a good way. You have a very clear sense of right and wrong, and a strict sense of honor. I really felt bad that I had to put you in the sort of position where you'd have to potentially compromise these values. I really don\u2019t want to feel and I don\u2019t want you to feel as if I\u2019m just using you as just a pawn in a bigger scheme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a breath. The thought had crossed my mind a few times now. Perhaps it was an inherent mercantile trait within Lorath, having been part of that lineage that stretched back countless generations. Yet Nod needed all sorts of dragons for the Empire to survive, whether they be fighters like myself, magicians like Lina or Thereesa and planners like Lorath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAxel Xion needs to be stopped, and compared with allowing him to remain free risking my reputation is but a small thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you'll agree to the plan?\u201d cried Lorath, looking wary again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I shall...\" I vowed, \"Yet promise me one thing Lorath\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it...\" answered Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise me that you\u2019ll always be truthful with me. You\u2019ll always be truthful even during those times you believe I may want to hear it, because it will hurt me more if you lie to me. So long as you tell me the truth, I can live with whatever outcome comes out of it, but if you lie to me I\u2019ll never forgive you\u2026\u201d I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath closed his eyes, and then stared back at me. \u201cWith my Ancestors as my witness, and with you, I\u2019ll always be truthful with you Darzhja, and may the powers below take me if I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly felt a huge weight lift off my wings after he said that. Now, I didn\u2019t have to doubt him anymore, as I flew forward and placed my head against his in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lorath\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm embrace, one of trust and understanding more than one of romance, but I appreciated that more. After a while, we separated, and the two of us stared at one another again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Darzhja, after putting you all through this, its only fair that I should have to make it up to you during the festival\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So you\u2019re going to be asking me out then?\u201d I replied, sounding intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, that is why I invited you to the festival is it not?\u201d he answered, smiling encouragingly. I couldn\u2019t help but respond with an elated grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll go with you Lorath\u2026\u201d I answered with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, here is Cronos' estate Darzhja,\" said Danielson, indicating it with his finger. \"Even though I'm your 'fight coordinator', I won't be able to be seen officially as such until you actually manage to get the spot in the tournament. Once you are finished, contact me and I'll inform Lorath of what took place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielson walked away and blended back into the ubiqutous crowd of humans, as I headed toward Cronos' estate. Being a dragon of considerable fame and fortune, there was a couple of guards awaiting the entrance of the lair, which was nestled along the cliffside. I took in a deep breath and then decided to approach, it wasn't necessarily the fight with Cronos that I was worried about, but whether I had the guts to carry through with the plan I wondered if I would have the guts to be able to carry out the plan that Lorath had designed for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than three quarters of a century ago, apparently, Lorath had explained that Cronos had had a rather serious affair with a drakka named Prideth, but that Cronos' philandering ways had destroyed this relationship between the two. Nobody had known exactly what had become of Cronos' favorite lover after the fallout, as Cronos' press corps had deliberately obscured the affair in order to preserve the fighter's reputation, but there had been rumors that she'd been heavy with a clutch at the time, nor was anybody sure if she was even alive anymore. Admist the uncertainly, gave Lorath the opportunity to construe the scheme which I could pass myself off as Cronos' daughter, and leave him no choice but to accept my challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also a bit ill at ease by the fact that Lorath or even Danielson couldn't be here with me. The town was quite unfamiliar to me, even though I had Danielson as a guide to get me to Cronos' lair. However, if Lorath was seen as a conspirator then it would unravel the entire plan to get into the tournament and take down Axel Xion before it even had the chance to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look drakka, autograph time is over. If you want to see Cronos you'd have to see him in the tournament; not that the likes of you would have a ticket that is,\" the guard on the left snorted dismissively. \"However, I suppose that you are pretty enough that you might be able to gain entrance in that manner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my claws into the dirt, ready to launch myself at them right then and there, but I forced myself to be calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never lower myself to such a degree, and besides, Lord Cronos will not be in the tournament, on account of the fact that his daughter will be taking his place,\" I answered, attempting to sound as cool as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I've never heard of Cronos having a daughter...\" the second guard answered, still dismissively but also sounding a bit curious now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he hushed up my mother, Prideth, after she threatened to expose his affairs with other drakka after he told her that he would not be taking responsibility. So I, Darzhja, am here to call him into account... and shall challenge him in the ring so that I may take his place in the tournament. I will meet with my father, even if I must have to go through you two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as strong as I was in a fight, I was by no means intimidated by these two admittedly imposing dragons. However, having been fighting since I was out of an egg, I easily tell between the look of a professional and those who simply tried to intimidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards glared at me, \"You've got more guts then sense drakka, making a claim like that. I ought to have you arrested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared back, \"I'd like to see you try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard made a move toward me, yet without batting an eye I twisted around, knocked him off balance and sent him sprawling on his side. The other guard, rather than challenge me, could only gape with astonishment. Obviously, neither of the two males had imagined a female being so capable in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think you're trying to clamor for attention, but by the Ancestors I can see you can certainly fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard called forward a human serant, whom I followed into the lair. Compared with Lorath's estate, the lair in which Cronos dwelled was spartan in comparison. However, lining the wall were murals depicting the great bronze dragon's victories in battle, crowing triumphantly to the crowd as he was pinning his dazed, opponent, while below each mural encased in a crystal case were the accompanying trophies. Hanging above them were huge posters made painstakingly of leather and vinyl, posters that would have been placed at the entrance of the stadium promoting the big fight that was yet to come. This was the Cronos I had grown up idolizing, back when I merely wanted to be the greatest fighter there ever was, and before I'd gained my true purpose as a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts were pounding against my chest when I heard the weary sounds of grunting and exertation. I followed the human servant around a corner, out onto a large ledge overlooking the oceanside. It was, in fact, an outdoor gym of sorts, complete with a sand pit,  dragon shaped dummies that could have easily been decades older than I was with scratches, claw marks and chips. Yet in the center of that sand pit was Cronos, the Drake of Steel, himself. Only, it wasn't the Cronos that I had seen in the murals, not the Cronos immortalized in bronze statues. I could see the technical skill which he performed his signiature moves, despite his age, yet it wasn't so much the lack of physical prowess but the way his moves almost seemed half hearted, revealing an old wyrm that had seemingly lost his purpose with the weight of the world on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that the old dragon seemed to notice me. Almost deliberately, he shifted his gaze toward me. I couldn't help but be frozen by his gaze, almost as if subconsciously I was telling myself that this dragon actually was my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I little bit too old to be the target of a drakka like you?\" he cried with a light smile, in a way that might have meant to be teasing but reflecting more a weary nostalgia than anything else. Even now, he was a very imposing fellow, with none of the fat or flabbiness typically associated with dragons his age, with a hint of the dashing handsomeness that would have attracted countless drakka to his lair about a century or so ago, though his scales certaintly lacked the luster that say...Fangorn's would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI puffed a bit of smoke out of my nostrils to refocus my thoughts, \"Indeed, you are...Cronos, or should I say, father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thick, preganant pause before I continued, \"My name is Darzhja of New Alveri, Prideth was my mother you know... I was only told that was the case, since I grew up in an orphanage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but feel a little dirty of having to say that to his face. I expected him to immediately start to become hostile or insult me for being a liar or a blackmailing slut, but to my surprise, his expression suddenly grew haunted, as if he were staring straight at the judgment of the Ancestors themselves. \"Prideth...\" he said with a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been told that I was an abusive drake who cheated on drakka and dumped her out. I do not deny it, I cast your mother out because I was selfish and believed myself to be the living embodiment of Gyramond himself. Trust me, not a day goes by that I could go back to that day and wish I could have done something different. Thus, as I grew older I realized that the Ancestors would one day judge me for the sins I committed then, and thus here you are Darzhja, to wreak vengeance upon your miserable wretch of a father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis self deprecation caught me off guard. This was not the cocky, invincible dragon I had idolized, or even the vain, disdainful old wyrm I'd prepared myself for, but a dragon who'd realized the scope of his sins and could never escape them. Moreover, it sounded like a dragon who had somehow become convinced in his mind that I was indeed his daughter, even though logic would argue that the chances of that being the case were quite small, and that his gaze was not necessarily seeing me but a reflection of that particular dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not desire that kind of revenge? What I want is to take your place in the tournament...\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old bronze dragons eyes began to glow with life, \"Is that so Darzhja? With words like that I suspect you'd be here for a fight!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puffed his chest out, seeeming more energized and full of purpose in this fight with no witnesses than in the actual tournament itself, \"It would be a honor to do battle with you Darzhja, daughter of Prideth!! Do you have the strength and courage to take your father's place in the grand tournament!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my claws into the dirt despite the whole awkwardness of him actually calling me daughter. By now I had scrapped the whole plan of actively shaming him and making him relive the whole moment of cheating on the dragoness I'd claimed to be my mother oer and over, but instead found myself playing into this whole narrative. Better to have him as a possible ally than a dragon who would hold a grudge, even if it did mean I really did have to pretend that I was actually his daughter as he envisioned it in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the will of the Ancestors, we'll just have to find out then won't we?\" I answered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chronos stared me down, eyes heavy with the weight of three quarters of a millennium's worth of pride, victory, guilt, shame, but never defeat; at least until now or so I hoped.  His eyes, which were a deep ochre not unlike my own, though hazy with age, seemed filled with a depth I had not anticipated in an old fighter.  When I responded to his question with an exuberant cry of my own, I felt something, almost like a connection to the dragon who I was currently lying to and yet had believed me without a second thought.  I couldn't stand to think of the lie, so I had to push it out of my mind entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me then, offspring of mine.\"  said Chronos as he began to walk back into his estate.  As a dragon of his wealth and stature, there were already three or four humaniods at attendance at the entrance back into the interior of the cliffside.  He mumbled something down to them and they went scrambling off in different directions both down the main passage and the smaller servant ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we started walking through the old fighter's estate, I asked, \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old dragon chuckled, \"Well a fight in my private gym doesn't mean so much.  We have to make this public.  There's a field up on top of the cliff we can use.  My neighbors will be witnesses to your challenge as well as anyone else who's around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted affirmation as we began to ascend a long set of stairs. My blood had been primed for battle right then and there, it was a bit of a shock to be delayed even a short time.  Of course, I knew that a veteran fighter like Chronos would have no such trouble summoning the rage and strength he would need without notice.  I had to keep my concentration.  But right now, it felt less like I was preparing for battle than walking with a mentor in the winding halls of the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly we ran into another dragon on the way up.  This one seemed to have half the bulk of Chronos, but was only a little shorter than him.  \"Hello, Chrysthaline, old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka frowned, \"I thought we already had a talk about sneaking through my side passages...\"  she glanced over Chronos' shoulders and glared at me, \"Especially with young drakka in tow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, that was over two hundred years ago.  This is an entirely different matter.  It's a matter of honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me one of your bastard egglings has finally come back to haunt you.\"  trilled the older drakka.  The hallway was deathly silent.  \"No... really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.  This is my daughter, Darzhja, by Prideth.  She grew up in an orphanage in New Alveri and only recently learned of her heritage.  She's come to challange me for her birthright by ancient custom.\"  Said Chronos, almost pridefully, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka clicked her tongue.  \"You old battlehorse.  You don't have to solve everything by fighting.  Just give the youngling her share of inheirtance and let that be that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shoved my way forward so that I was beside Chronos.  \"I'm not here for money.  I'm here to challenge him for the right to fight in the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakka looked at me levelly, suddenly seeming shrewd and snake-like.  \"Unorthodox, but potentially worth more than gold... if you honestly think you can win that is.  Such a young thing, but you've got meat on you.  There's a resemblance to your father in that regard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know if that was a compliment or an insult.  \"We're going upstairs to settle the matter right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysthaline looked at me with half lidded eyes, \"Oh, then I mustn't miss this historic battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her voice was dripping with sarcasm, Chronos seemed pleased to have run into Chrysthaline.  As we moved up the last section of stairs, he followed her and watched her tail as she walked.  I couldn't help but feel almost certain that these two dragons have known each other intimately in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage open up onto a high ledge that was hardly a tail's length down from the grassy top of the cliffside.  We climbed over it.  scarcely a minute had passed before two more dragons landed down on the knoll.  One was another bronze, the second was a blue water dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regilius!  Myranzi!  I'm glad you two could come on such short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bronze dragon, who was larger at the shoulder and the waist than Chronos, rumbled, \"I'd be skinned before I miss seeing you knocked down by your own bastard child, Chronos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos just laughed and then turned to me.  \"We have our audience then...\"  he heaved a sigh then met my eyes with sudden intensity.  \"Darzhja, you have the right to chalenge me by brithright.  Name your prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I claim your right to fight in the blood festival tournament.\"  I cried.  I saw the other dragons' eyes widen, though Chrysthaline just nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your terms are acceptable.  Now let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos didn't waste anymore time on ceromony.  He threw himself into a charge, his claws tearing into the turf.  He was very fast for such an old dragon, but I was faster.  I sidestepped him without trouble.  However, he kept going right past me.  He dove right over the edge of the cliff and opened his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're losing the high ground, drakka.  Better get after him.\"  said Regilius from my right.  Gritting my teeth, I ran ahead, spread my wings and went after Chronos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure why I'd been expecting a wrestling match on the ground, though there was yet time for that.  Perhaps I'd just assumed that as a young drakka, I'd have the natural advantage in the air over him and that he'd realize this as well.  I grew suspicious right away of Chronos' choice to take to the air and followed him cautiously as I fought for hieght advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coastal thermal carried us high over the knoll and we circled inside of it, each of us straining for height.  Chronos's massive wings ripped through the air with strength, but after a year of training with the Temple, I was just as strong.  I gained the advantage without tiring myself overmuch.  With Chronos below me, I began to drift over.  I could strike from above and ride him down to the ground where the impact would stun him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was about to close my attack, however, Chronos rolled over in midair with alarming dexterity.  He breathed a gout of fire up into my face.  I quickly banked to the side to avoid the worst of the flames and then was startled to see Chronos above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe impacted with his chest on my shoulder, Chronos' great weight bearing down on me.  He went for my wings, but I grappled up at him, sacrificing lift to get a clawhold on him.  We snapped at each other in a violent embrace.  Then Chronos bashed my right wing good with his own.  It buckled and we began to fall, spinning as we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly my rigorous Knight training enabled me to keep some semblance of direction as we fell turning head over heels.  Chronos pulled a deep breath for fire at point blank, but I punched him in the throat and forced him to swallow it.  The old fighter, however was full of tricks.  His best years may have been behind him, but his technical skill was superior to mine.  I must have turned the wrong way, or perhaps he subtley coerced me into it, but I found myself with him holding my neck and right wing tightly with him behind me, unable to reach him with my foreclaws as we continued to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what comes next, right, lass?\"  he said into my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled in response.  He was going to ride me down to earth like a battering ram, just as I'd been planning to do to him.  I struggled for a moment or two, but I could tell right away that he had me good.  \"I...\"  I gasped into the on rushing wind, \"...I think I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stroke of inspiration, I reached around with my tail and bashed it against Chronos' left wing.  He recoiled and I extended my own wing, fighting the older drake for control of the fall.  The result was that we began a corkscrew spin, tails first.  Looking below, the ground was dangerously close for such a manuver, even if we weren't attatched to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos realized this and with a vicious snarl, he released me and sought to catch the air again with his empty, flapping wings. I gasped relief at the release, but I too was desperate to catch myself before a bone breaking fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both hit the ground hard.  I managed to skid into the knoll, tumbling a couple times; a stray breeze managed to find its way under my wings and I used it as much as I could to angle out my fall.  Chronos, however, stuck more inland and did not seem to fare as well, landing more like a meteor.  It didn't seem to faze him however as he extricated himself from the shallow depression his huge body had made in the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You oaf, if you damaged my solar, it's coming out of your hoard!\"  cried Chrysthaline from the sidelines.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos just shook her off with a laugh, though.  \"My hoard could suffer a little dimishing dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began heading towards me while I was still recovering,  My rough roll had bruised one of my wings pretty good.  However, it seemed that Chronos did not intend on another air battle this round.  \"You remind me of your mother, Darzhja.  She was unconventional in her fight style as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Did you two fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos paused in his advance, \"Did we fight!?  Ha, she was as vicious a female as they came in a fight.  Scrappy and tough, but beautiful as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle to hold onto the righteous anger that I was supposedly feeling, but I did manage to shout a question as we began circling each other.  \"Then why did you leave her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos didn't lower his head, but his eyes did falter.  \"I didn't leave her.  She left me.  It was no secret I saw drakka on the side...  lots of drakka.  After half a century, I'd thought she was fine with it.  I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos' admition was honest and guiltridden and it was easy to sympathize.  Though it hurt me, I needed to push that aside and focus on the anger I needed to win.  \"You <i>were</i> wrong.\"  I emphasized,   \"And what about all those other drakka?  How many more of me are there out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could respond, I leaped across the distance between us, claws forward.  I raked him on the a foreleg and we began to snap at each other.  We did this for a few moments, and then Chronos released a gust of wind with his wings, kicking up dirt into my eyes.  Fortunately there wasn't a lot of loose soil on the knoll, so I saw his teeth coming.  I didn't see his tail, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an agility that was astounding for a dragon his age, his tail imapacted right upon my neck and then all in one motion tried to wrap it around in a chokehold. My first impulse would have been to immediately try and push myself out of the grapple, and had I not gone through my training that was what I would have done. It was a move that Shadia had pulled on me quite often, yet one that Bronze Dragons didn\u2019t normally have the flexibility to pull off, and thus I gambled that his grasp would be tenuous. Instead, I struck out with my own tail; I didn\u2019t really intend that it would do any damage, but because of his odd position he would recoil and give me a split second to get loose. The maneuver worked, as I backed myself away and gazed back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the tension in his eyes. \u201cTo answer your question Darzhja,\"  he said as we began circling again,  \"The fact is I do not know\u2026 none of the others cared what I was doing on the side but Prideth\u2026 she was the only one who called me out on it.  She was the only one who cared enough to, I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was the only one to call you out?  Or maybe she was the only one you cared to notice!\u201d I retorted, digging my claws into the dirt. Chronos grunted, tossing his head as if to rid himself of this uncomfortable question, before charging forward recklessly to slash at me. He didn\u2019t attempt any kind of deception, thus I dodged to the side and turned to face him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it seemed that Prideth was still a sensetive topic for the old dragon.  However, why did he even bring up the subject?  I wondered.  Maybe Chronos <i>wanted</i> this pain.  Maybe some part of him wanted me to punish him for his past sins.  The thought made me hesitate, but upon seeing Chronos turn to face me again, I recalled just what sort of dragon he'd been in his younger years.  Maybe he could do with some punishing.  \"Getting slow in your elder years, old wyrm?\"  I jeckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos bristled, \"Come a little closer and I'll show you how slow I am, lass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped forward, tail carefully raised.  \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos grunted and loosened his wings, raising his tail defensively.  He kept his knees bent as he prepared to counter me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't attack.  Instead, I said, \"Did Prideth leave any of those old scars on you, Chronos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos grimaced, his stance changing altogether.  \"More than you know.\"  he muttered.  Then, he actually raised a claw unconciously to touch a long knotted scar that ran down from the left side of the base of his neck to his breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my teeth and seized my chance.  I leaped at Chronos, slamming my outstreatched claws into his shoulder.  He went down under me, though he beat at my face and flanks with his wings.  He struggled under me and while it was difficult trying to pin a slightly larger opponant - though he was only slightly larger than me - he really didn't seem to put up much of a fight.  I was almost dissapointed really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half-heartedly trying to push me off, Chronos let out a grunt, grinning pridefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you have me my daughter\u2026\u201d he said almost casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed I do\u2026\u201d I replied, keeping my gaze focused upon his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable showing!! She truly is your daughter my old friend!!\u201d said Regulus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026yes\u2026indeed,\u201d agreed his smaller, web-clawed counterpart Myrzanti, \u201cWhile her fighting style could definitely use some more polish, I say she\u2019ll have quite a showing in the tournament\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite\u2026anyhow Darzhja will you please let me up?\u201d said Chronos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean I have your spot in the tournament?\u201d I wanted to emphasize. Though I was pretty sure that he was beaten, I wanted to words officially out of his mouth so he couldn\u2019t claim he had technically never said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClever drakka you are Darzhja. Yes, you shall take my stead in the tournament,\u201d he cried. Slowly and cautiously, I released my hold on the dragon who I claimed to be my father. He wearily pushed himself back to his feet. Now with the adrenaline rush fading away, his age started to really catch up to him, as he was huffing and puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved forward to lend a claw in case he needed it, but raised a claw to hold me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now\u2026 no need to rub it in my daughter. There\u2019s still some vigor left in the body of this old wyrm\u2026\u201d he replied. Off to the side, Chyrsthaline rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t let that oaf fool you Darzhja. He\u2019s broken the hearts of too many drakka with that stare of his.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but snort in response, \u201cOh, I\u2019m well aware about that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph\u2026that\u2019s what they all said\u2026\u201d she replied ominously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing slightly, I turned away from Chrysthaline.  \"Is there anything else that needs to be taken care of, Chronos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos, still puffing, sat down on the scarred surface of the knoll.  His tail curled around to wrap itself about his right foreleg in a characteristic manner.  \"Hrmh... nothing that you need to worry about, daughter.  The human padfoots shall run the necessary papers to the tournament office.  They shall be alerted to the change shortly I imagine.\"  Chronos release a boistrous laugh. \"Not that they'll enjoy the sudden paper work this close to the start of the tournament.  Nor, I imagine, losing a famous old fighter such as myself in return for some unknown upstart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could voice my opinion, Chrysthaline laughed, \"Nobody was looking forward to your fat ass ambling its way into the arena, trust me.  I think they'll consider it a blessing from the Ancestors to have a reason to replace you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos rumbled and growled as he turned on the female.  Regilius and Myrzanti looked at each other and chuckled knowingly.  Just as Chronos looked like he was about to spit fire in her face, he lost his compusure with a smile, saying, \"You think I'm fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a corn-fed sow.\"  said the drakka with a wink and then she brushed her cheek against Chrnos' neck in a little more than friendly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was begining to feel a little uncomfortable, Regilius stepped beside me and ushered me away with a wing.  \"Young lass, I hope you have an inkling of what you've just gotten yourself into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed, \"A chance for honor and glory.\"  I said aloud, and added to myself, 'and a chance to get close to an industrialist tyrant and probable kidnapper of hatchlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, and you shall have that chance now.\"  But the heavy set old bronze lowered his head close to mine and added quietly in my ear, \"But truth be told, Chronos will be perhaps the least of the challenges you will face before the championship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move a step away from Regilius, who smelled like he'd just gotten through two or three casks of wine.  \"Well, I don't necessarily need to win the whole tournament to earn fame do I?\"  Although the idea certainly was appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegilius seemed taken aback, as if the idea of aspiring to anything less than final championship was unthinkable. \"Well, yes, I suppose, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrzanti stepped in, he was so quiet, I hadn't even heard him approach my other side.  \"But the glory and fame earned by winning the tournament is ten-fold compared to even second place.  And only the champion's names are written down on the Bloodstone to be remembered for all time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard, loner, wilding or yes, even orphan, it doesn't matter who you were before winning a tournament.  If you manage to claw your way to the top, you become immortal.  It is the ultimate glory for any fighting drake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or drakka.\"  I added in automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegilius coughed, \"Erm, yes, of course.  drakka too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, I was joined by a third party, except this one was human. Looking down, I saw Danielson puffing, clearly having raced up the steps from the ground level. For a humanoid, his stamina was admirable. I waited a few moments as he bent over, hands on his knees and caught his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this human?\" Regilius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" I said hurriedly, \"He's um... my thrall, yes. His name's Danielson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm... You're doing quite well for an orphan if you can afford your own thrall, Darzhja.\" observed Mryzanti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a nervous laugh, \"Oh, well, you know he came cheap. A little touched in the head, you see.\" The look from Danielson could have melted lead, but honestly I didn't know what to say. I was unpracticed in lying, and I didn't want it known that I was a Knight of New Alveri. I could tell though that none of the gathered dragons believed that story for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust that he\u2019s reliable and dedicated though, for none of my human associates come running all the way up here at full sprint just to be at their lady\u2019s side. Why, I believe he must have been enthralled by your incomparable beauty my dear daughter!!\u201d said Chronos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Chrysthaline let out a dismissive scoff, but Danielson let out a laugh. \u201cI admit that was part of the reason my Lord Chronos. However, I sensed Darzhja was a very hard working and dedicated individual, and that she also respects me and my efforts, along with a number of my colleagues who are not present right now but also feel similarly,\u201d he answered, as graciously as he could. I felt heartened by his compliments. Indeed, Danielson and humans in general worked very hard, bound by their limitations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Then I must say that you are fortunate to have such loyal peons at your side my daughter!!\u201d replied Chronos, \u201cWhy, I can never get mine to get anything done in due time!!\u201d I quickly snuck a sympathetic glance at Danielson for being called a \u2018peon\u2019 and apparently Chronos\u2019 casual disregard of humans in general as an amorphous mass whose sole existence was to do dragon kind\u2019s bidding. Danielson just shrugged; apparently he\u2019d expected as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I believe you and your minions will fit in here with us in no time at all!!\u201d said Chronos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFit in? Wait a moment, you\u2019re actually asking me to live with you now?\u201d I retorted incredulously. Regilius and Myrzanti also snapped their heads toward Chronos questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course my daughter!!\u201d he replied, placing a friendly wing around my back. \u201cBy taking my spot in the tournament, I will have to legally adopt you and having you around the premises will not only make this easier, but also help build up attention from the media of this monumental event.  Secondly, though I might not be the drake that I once was, I still have a number of tips I could give you to help you train and prepare for the tournament. Why, by the time I'm done with you my dear, with your loveliness combined with the techniques of the Drake of steel, none would be able to stand before you!! As for quarters you\u2019d have your own private lair and washroom along with reasonable accomodations for your servants!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA drakka being able to bathe in your complex without being watched? There\u2019s a big fat lie\u2026\u201d snorted Chrysthaline, almost certainly speaking from personal experience. I too was quite familiar with that uncomfortable feeling of being watched from hidden places, no thanks to a certain unbalanced, perverted, irascible yet heart-stoppingly comely bronze Holy Knight who would not be named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos snorted, \u201cNormally I\u2019d just have to admit you\u2019re right, but this is different considering Darzhja\u2019s my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled myself away, desperately wanting to get back on task, \u201cIn any case, I thank you for the offer but I already have a place to stay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos shifted a glare toward Chrysthaline, as if that was the reason I was reluctant to stay, but then calmed himself to gaze back toward me. \u201cI understand the desire to want to stake out on your own, but to be perfectly honest, this old drake would feel much more content to have you around Darzhja. More practically, I assume that as an orphan your finances are rather limited at the moment, at least until you\u2019re awarded your prize money at the end of the tournament. So until then, instead of having to rent out a lair at one of those Dak\u2019saird Clan lodges, and during the tournament those rates are certainly going to increase, you\u2019d have much better living quarters free of charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a moment to consider this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, I suddenly understood what Chronos\u2019 real intent was on trying to get me to stay at his lair. First of all, he wanted to live out the fantasy he had of actually being a father, after years of living a irresponsible carefree lifestyle, and to be honest part of me wanted to know what having an actual father felt like. More dangerously though, was that by referencing the Dak\u2019saird Clan lodge that while he probably didn\u2019t know that I was actually working with Lorath, it was also clear that he had come to some sort of realization that there were a few holes in my story and that he wanted to keep me around so he could know my true intensions, that it wasn\u2019t only to find my long-lost father and gain glory. The longer I stayed with him, the more likely he\u2019d discovered what these intensions were, and to be honest from his position I couldn't blame him for wanting to do so. Certainly, Chronos could not know I was involved with Lorath unless I wanted to take the risky step of trying to get Chronos in on it, and since I'd told him I was an orphan he rightly assumed that my finances would be limited, and accepting the offer should have been a powerful incentive. At the same time, by deciding not to accept the offer, I could end up insulting Chronos, after he had agreed to allow me to take his spot in the tournament, and alienating him and making him an enemy was also a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, I had to decide what would allow me to continue my mission working for Lorath to expose Axel Xion. Personally, I couldn\u2019t decide, but what I also knew that the success of the mission was also dependant upon how freely Danielson could operate. Furthermore, I didn't feel confident enough to give this decision and back them up with reasonable assertions without potentially compromising more of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanielson,\u201d I asked, bending my head down to his level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am undecided, therefore, I would like to know what you think I should do, stay with my father or continue to live the way we\u2019ve been living, where you\u2019d only have to serve me,\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would actually ask the opinion of a human on this issue?\u201d said Myrzanti, puzzled at the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would. I would not have made it this far in life if Danielson wasn\u2019t so touched up in the head as to decide to follow me. Therefore, I believe it would be generous to give him a choice to speak on my humans behalf,\u201d I replied. After all, Danielson was Lorath's servant, not mine, and given that Danielson was operating with Lorath's authority, by extension Danielson's decision to stay with Chronos or not was actually Lorath's. On a personal level though, I already trusted Danielson to a level I never had with any other human, percisely because he was so essential to the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo humble as always, Danielson lowered his head and replied, \u201cWell my lady, you are free to disagree with my humble opinion, but I believe it would be more beneficial to\u2026.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As an orphan, they were not bequeathed to me for generation after generation, but I had to earn their trust, so therefore I would ask if you allowed them free access to the complex, and to be able to travel throughout the city to visit friends and relatives at the time of their choosing.\u201d I replied. Now that I wouldn\u2019t be able to speak with Lorath directly for an indefinite period of time, I\u2019d have to rely on Danielson and his crew to communicate with him, and this was the only way I could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course!!\u201d answered Chornos, \u201cAny friend of my daughter is a friend of mine!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you Lord Chronos,\u201d Danielson responded with a bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, since we\u2019re all become buddy-buddy, maybe now would be a good time to get those bruises looked at?\u201d snorted Chrysthaline. I curved my gaze toward my wing, which I had unknowingly been holding up somewhat gingerly since I\u2019d crashed onto the ground, along with a myriad of other bruises I\u2019d sustained. Bronze dragons, known for their physical prowess, were known for their ability to ignore pain, and I was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u2026right\u2026 Chrysthaline dear, will you please take a look at her?\u201d said Chronos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then, but you make sure that someone patches you up also Chronos all right?\u201d answered Chrysthaline. \u201cRigilius, make sure that oaf doesn\u2019t leave your sight during treatment\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now, I got over my voyeuristic phase more than 150 years ago,\u201d chortled Chornos. I couldn\u2019t help but form an image of a young Chronos sneaking behind young females with a crooked grin, very much like a certain perverted bronze dragon I knew back at the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d asked Danielson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrzanti angled his head downwards, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the records room so you can help us sort out Darzhja\u2019s registration into the tournament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, I shall entrust myself under your care...\" answered Danielson, taking a seat upon Myranti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then!! Darzhja my daughter, once all this is hopefully cleared up I will see you again tomorrow for a day of hard training!!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be counting on it!!\" I cried eagerly as he made his way off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left me with the aged female Chrysthaline. I did my best to hide the unease I felt being with her. I got the sense that Chronos had done so as a way of learning more about me and my intensions, and that Chrysthaline\u2019s somewhat toxic nature would cause me to let something slip. Therefore, I decided to take the initiative instead, \u201cSo, how long have you known Chronos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a long time,\u201d answered the drakka, \u201cSince the beginning of his fighting career in fact. I\u2019d studied to become a cleric, but Chronos spotted me one day after one of his fights and offered to hire me as his personal physical therapist\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but let in a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you also one of his lovers?\u201d I asked nervously. Honestly, I wasn't sure why I'd chosen to blurt out that particular question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously\u2026\u201d she sniffed with an eye roll, \u201cWhile I am very good at my craft, you don\u2019t know how many times after I patched him up after a big fight he\u2019d immediately want to shove his cock in me afterwards\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you just let him do it? You never felt\u2026degraded whenever he did it with you?\u201d I snapped. I couldn\u2019t help but feel increasingly irritated as Chrysthaline shared her sexual exploits with a drake that was by all accounts my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking me this? Wait, you\u2019re a virgin aren\u2019t you? A drakka who comes from an orphanage? That\u2019s almost unheard of!!\u201d she cried with some great deal of amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my face heat up, \u201cJ-just answer the question\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes. If you\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve made myself quite a decent fortune tending to Chornos\u2019 various \u2018ailments\u2019, much more than I would have made at a standard practice,\u201d she replied, extending her neck as she pointed out the size of her estate. \u201cYour father might be a cheating wretch, yet by the Ancestors he was like Gyramond himself in the lair!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet how could he attract so many drakka, knowing that he was cheating the whole time?\u201d I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of the reason Chronos was able to attract so many young drakka was not only because he was quite a studly specimen of a dragon, and by the Ancestors he was quite handsome back then, but also because he\u2019d hire those drakka to perform his tasks. He\u2019d pay one drakka to do promotion of his fights, another to set up his training course, at any one point he\u2019d have something like 5 or so drakka. In fact, your mother started the same way as well, but she worked harder than anybody else and was the only drakka who was willing to be a sparring partner for him. She was determined and tough, but also surprisingly naiive and foolish, very much like you in fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about all the bastards he sired?\u201d I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about them? If you must know, there were a great number of drakka who actually wanted little ones, and what better way to ensure they\u2019re going to hatch healthy and strong by having Lord Chronos, the Drake of Steel, sire them? So they\u2019d work for Chronos for about five to ten years or so and earn money, then get themselves knocked up, and then head somewhere out in the mountains and build themselves a nice secluded lair to raise their little ones without the distraction of a male. For those that didn\u2019t necessarily want them, Chronos would also pay them off. Again, your mother was the exception than the rule\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think my mother was a fool then by thinking she could change Chronos?\u201d I asked testitly. I was curious about this dragoness I had never suspected was my mother, but I also needed to know where Chrysthaline stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest yes, but I do think it took someone like her to actually change him. After she left him, all the other drakka worked out their contracts and he never hired anybody else. I was the only one who has stayed all these years\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did he keep you around?\u201d I wondered. Chrysthaline glared at me as if I\u2019d grown a second head, before she lifted her head into the air and let out a screeching laugh.  \"For business reasons obviously. Even though we don't get cozy like that anymore, your <i>father</i> does seem to realize that without me he would have squandered all his gems. As for you Darzhja, daughter of Chronos, I do suspect you have your own reasons for taking his spot in the tournament. Maybe its just me, but you don't seem the type that would bask in vain, selfish glories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved my jaw slightly, trying to think of some sort of reason but then thinking better of it. Unlike Lorath, I was a notoriously bad liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as Chronos continues to pay me, whatever your business is not my concern, yet be careful young drakka. Too many young dragons have fallen prey to this game of shadows, including your mother...\" said Chrysthaline. I tried to keep my gaze passive, but to be honest I felt like a lost hatchling now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that finished, I was led by one of the servants to a guest lair. I had expected it to be lined with fine jewelry and cloths as it was at Lorath\u2019s yet the lair was rather Spartan. Essentially, it was a larger version of the dorm back at the temple, being mostly bare except for a few trinkets, but also possessed an exercise machine. Yet whatever misgivings I had about the venture, it was too late anyhow. I had to see through my task to the finish, and I had to hope that there was something left to save at the end of it. Lorath had warned me about the risks, yet I had stubbornly asked him to take this chance to be able to expose Axel Xion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how bad I was at maintaining a deception, there was little chance I would be able to keep up this lie for long. Eventually, Chronos would figure out the true reasons why I decided to take his place in the tournament. As I laid myself down on the cot, the only way I could be able to wiggle myself out was if I truly played out the part of Chronos would imagine his daughter to be like, so much so that eventually this falsehood that Lorath had helped me come up with to get into the tournament would become true.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had ended up staying with Chronos for a couple of days before I managed to get back into contact with Lorath. It was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations for getting a spot in the tournament Darzhja. From what I\u2019ve heard from Danielson, its sounding like Chonos is really buying that you are his daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really is. Chronos is being far more accommodating than I imagined that he would be. He\u2019s been kind to me, and warm and\u2026 he truly believes that I am his daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath let out a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that you'll be staying with your 'father' then? I think it works out better for us. Its more... professional...\" said Lorath. While Lorath was in fact my drake friend, I was starting to feel more than a little awkward being a guest at his place, especially with those relatives of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn all seriousness Darzhja, are you thinking of him as your father Darzhja?\u201d asked Lorath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Lorath long and hard. \u201cI\u2019d never had a powerful senior male figure into my life up until now, and in many ways I looked enviously on others who do. There is a big part of me that does wish that Chronos is in fact my real birth father, and its agonizing for me to contemplate finding out for sure that I would not be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse is the fact that I am essentially deceiving him; playing with his very soul, and then pulling the string on him\u2026\u201d I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath let out a sigh, \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t think that things between the two of you would go as deep as they had. One might almost say that the mission to get you into Chronos\u2019 compound has been too successful. That being said, don\u2019t forget your mission Darzhja; and that is to find information about Axel Xion and connect him to the attack on New Alveri.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorath gave me a hug. \u201cThings will turn out all right Darzhja. Instead of worrying about what\u2019s already done, lets think of the opportunity we have here. Since Chronos holds you in such regard, you would be able to ask him so much more about the whole situation, find out about his contacts. In fact, we might even be able to bring Chronos on board with the investigation and help hunt down Axel Xion\u2019s network.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being able to get Chronos in on it, so that I would no longer have to lie to him any longer, filled me with a fresh sense of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are things coming along on your end?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn schedule. Heliana and I have continued to investigate and make additional contacts throughout Damescara. You worry about preparing yourself for the fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right then. Take care of yourself then,\u201d I replied, giving him a hug. I then returned to Chronos\u2019 estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!! You\u2019re back Darzhja!\u201d said Chronos in his fatherly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I\u2019ve managed to find out who your first opponent is going to be for the tournament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be an easy one,\u201d said Chronos, looking troubled. \u201cAs you know, the tournament is arranged to be a best of sixteen tournament. If I am going to be bluntly honest, the reason I was still in the running at all was out of respect for the dragon that I used to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were ranked rather lowly\u2026\u201d I realized glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos shuddered. \u201cRanked fourteenh out of sixteenth. That means you would automatically be placed against the 3rd best fighter in the first round.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew how these sort of tournaments worked, in which the best fighters would be placed against the worst ones to start out with, enabling the tournament to weed out the weaker fighters and usually leaving the best for last. For Danielson and his team to be able to get into the colloseum itself and begin uncovering the needed evidence, I had to at least win two, or ideally three fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen whoever my opponent is will be in quite the surprise. Who wouldn't want to be amazed at seeing an underdog rise to the top!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos smiled. \u201cWhen you put it that way, I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where was I? Oh yes. Your first opponent is an old pupil of mine. Sauroth the Punisher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father\u2019s expression grew grim and protective, and I shuddered inside. Sauroth the Punisher was one of the most powerful professional brawlers in the entire Kingdom, not to mention one of the meanest. He was also said to be the sort of dragon who gathered dragonesses to himself. That only gave me extra motivation to beat Sauroth, to put that philanderer in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he is the dragon that I will have to face, then I will face him. You were once his teacher were you not? Can you teach me the best strategy how to beat him?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ll prove that I am a worthy successor to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. So listen up. There\u2019s a number of techniques that Sauroth is known for, and if you\u2019re going to be ready, you\u2019re going to have to work hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst!!\" I dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, over the next several days leading up to the tournament, I spent the time training mercilessly. My fath... Chronos was a strict trainer, and I expected nothing less from the dragon known as the 'Drake of Steel'. He did not insult me the way Lieutenant Shadia did, but he was constantly demanding and methodical in how he trained me, not to mention endlessly patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say Darzhja,\" said Myrzanti, one of Chronos neighbors, \"I have not seen the old wyrm this motivated in years. You've been a good influence on him, and frankly I think he would have had a happier life had he raise you from the egg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you Myrzanti,\" I answered. Everyone now truly believed that I was Chronos' daughter. Surely, I hadn't actually managed to fool all of them. Or maybe, maybe they knew that my plan to pretend to be Chronos' daughter was a farce, in that I need not have to pretend at all. I definitely could not go on like this, trapped in this sort of lie. It made it difficult to focus, and deep in my heart, I knew that I would have to reconcile this with Chronos before the fight began, otherwise that sort of conflict in my heart would consume me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as time passed by, I noticed not only the growing pride, but also a great fear from the old Drake. An anxiety that I could not quite place, something haunting in his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Chronos, beforehand, he had pretty much resigned himself that he was likely going to lose to Sauroth, being as old and slow as he now was. Sauroth was the younger, faster fighter, and it would be seen as a changing of the guard. However, now that his daughter had taken his place in the tournament, he was suddenly afraid. Sauroth was the sort of dragon that he had used to be before Prideth; dallying with one female after another. Yet Sauroth was particularly bad to females, and the thought of Sauroth trying to punish his daughter, being as young and pretty as she was, made him want to tear his scales off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarzhja\u2019s considerable skill in the ring aside, this sort of sordid life as a professional mercenary and wrestler had not been one Chronos wanted for her. It had been why he had not trusted himself to take care of her from birth, because when a dragon like Chronos had been in the business for that long, one tended to accrue many enemies... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Darjhza and Thereesa did their thing a meeting was taking place in the main tower of the Temple.  Four dragons and five humanoids were bickering about current events.  Pairs arranged them.  It started with an Earth Render and a Dwarf, then a Golden Mane and a Human, after was a Juggernaut and an Orc, last were a Screeching Ridgeback and an Elf.  The last humanoid was a rather large Dragonborn sitting on a throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what we be doin now?\u201d  The human asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell if we know Kleave.\u201d the Orc responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just it, we don\u2019t have a clue to what we need to do.\u201d the Ridgeback replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour one to talk.\u201d  The dwarf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHay, enough with that!  My partner did everything in his power to help your family Ortho.\u201d  The elf retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould both of you Shut up for a second!\u201d the earth render roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Juggernaut did was look at the earth render for a moment and everyone backed off.  However it all continued seconds later with a whole lot of nonsense.  This lasted to long, so thought the golden mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you all stop and listen!\u201d He roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did just that.  The dragonborn then got up and walked to the center of the group.  Everyone bowed at him and together spoke \u201cSir Xion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise, we need to get this started.\u201d the dragonborn said.  All did as he said.  \u201cNow first thing on the list is the up coming War.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWar?\u201d a few of the party members gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s coming.  We need to be prepared for it.\u201d Xion said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means we need more Knights?\u201d asked the Orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d  Kleave asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, really Kleave.\u201d  The golden mane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways\u2026\u201d Xion interrupted.  Yes it kind of does, all though, that in it self is a dilemma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Kleave said again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again the golden mane sighed.  \u201cHow we\u2019re partners is beyond me Kleave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDitto Jarico.\u201d Kleave replied with a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Xion sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation finally got itself on track and the nine spoke of potential strategies, current paths, a lot of what ifs, and a lot more that lasted for quite some time.  When the mention of the recruits came up, all agreed that none of them were ready for war.  They just had to suffice with what they had all ready, little as it may be.  The reasons why it so small is cause of the attack cutting a lot of them out and many of the remainders were charged with missions.  The fiasco with the eggs didn\u2019t help either.  When it seemed as if the meeting was over Sir Xion stopped them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to talk of one more thing Knights.\u201d  He said.  All paid close attention to him.  \u201cWe need to find our selves replacements for the Head Knights we have lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right Sir Xion but how are we supposed to do that?\u201d the Elf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe old fashion way Zora.  We start looking.\u201d  Xion said.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a total of two humanoids and three Dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped and started to uproar.  They all knew what that meant.  A total of fourteen head Knights.  That\u2019s seven dragons and seven humanoids that made the Head Knights, which basically means that Sir Xion just said an extra dragon was gone, but none of them knew whom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get into such a rut.  Compose yourselves My Knights.\u201d  An old feminine voice came from behind the throne and out from the darkness came a rather old Seraphan slowly walking to the group.  The third dragon will be my replacement my Knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Alvana.\u201d gasped everyone as they bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Alvana is the leader of the Holy Knights and as you my have guessed, Sir Xion is her Rider.  Once Lady Alvana and the Xion Family was respected by most and fear by all their enemies, but these two beings are rarely seen now a days.  Once one of the strongest beings alive now at the end of her rope, dieing, simply out of old age.  How she maintained her memories let alone her sanity is beyond comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Knights, hear me.  This cannot be the end.  Please do not give up.  I am dieing, that is true, but none must waiver.  None can afford to.  Especially at a time like this.  She gazed upon them all then to just the Dwarf and Earth render.  \u201cOrtho and Colzumn.  Two of the most stubborn beings I have ever seen in my life.  You two have made a difference in this world that neither one can see and you proved that anyone can indeed become a Knight, and Ortho\u2026\u201d The dwarf looked up at the old dragoness.  \u201cI know what your planning, and I need to say.  That is the most blasphemies thing you could ever do.  Live! Live for your family\u2019s sake.  She ended it with a smile.  Her gaze moved to Jarico and Kleave.  \u201cYou two\u2026  You two are absolutely nuts.  Don\u2019t ever change.  The two just bowed in response. Her eyes moved to the Juggernaut and the Orc.  \u201cGolgrin, It would\u2019ve never worked out between us.\u201d  The Juggernaut just tilted his head.  \u201cReally?  Nothing?  This whole time, I\u2019ve been trying to make him laugh or at least crack a smile.  Come on Golgrin smile, just once, as a dieing wish.  The dragon just looked down, looked as if he was unsure about himself.  \u201cAs for you Phoebus, work on him, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will Lady Alvana.\u201d  The Orc replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the last pair and simply said.  \u201cHorrora, Zora, as the women of this party, I wish of you, to take care of these so called men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do.\u201d  Both said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seraphan slowly moved over to Sir Xion.  \u201cCome with me Axel.  I wish to speak in privet.  Everyone may leave now.\u201d  And everyone did just that.  Once Lady Alvana and Sir Xion were alone she laid down with Xion in front of her.  \u201cI wish to ask about the recruits\u2026</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t mine losing, however you took it further then that, Insulting me the way you did. How can people call the Knights Holy, with beings such as you?\u201d I snarled. all the humanoids around us by this point were just watching the show, and the Knight heard little whispers here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe insulted her?\u201d \u201cI thought the Holy Knights didn\u2019t do such things?\u201d This one can\u2019t be a Knight?\u201d and more was said by the humanoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone please.\u201d the knight said.

I had to teach her\u2026\u201d but he was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarjza is always like that, you could have just beat her to a pulp and she wouldn\u2019t mine.\u201d one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait? This is Darjza? The Darjza you recommended to the Knights?\u201d He asked looking at a human I now recognized as Markus. I was so relieved to see him alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, DD is more then qualified.\u201d Mark said. \u201cKnight? what did you do to make her so mad at you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough Markus. Please.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the humanoids looked over at me, seeing I wanted a rematch. All of them backed off. The Knight wondered why in till he to looked at me. \u201cOh.\u201d He said as he looked down and was about to say something else but I lunged forward and clawed the side of his head, tearing off a chunk of his helmet then jumped back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn away from your opponent again and there will be more of that.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight looked up at me and was about to attack but something more interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Grayish blue dragonborn, a rather large horn coming from the tip of his snout. He stood out from the rest with his armor shining in the light, his wings acted as a large cape. The both of us was about to fight when I heard him yell out, \u201cWhat the hell was that Squire!?\u201d We both stopped before even attacking and stared at the dragonborn. So did all the humanoids. Everyone near him gasped and quickly moved away. I looked at the Knight for a moment and saw him trembling. I\u2019m sure everyone else did too. \u201cWhat are you doing!?\" the dragonborn roared. \u201cThis is no time for meaningless brawls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir Ingrid but\u2026\u201d The knight started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d the dragonborn asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was helping these\u2026\u201d the Knight started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell aren\u2019t you out looking for my recruits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Knight only looked over at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this hatchling one of them?\u201d the dragonborn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think not.\u201d the Knight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that.?\u201d the two of them were talking as if I just disappeared and was no longer there. \u201cPardons but are you the boss of this guy?\u201d I asked, interrupting the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am girl.

What breed of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Fire-Lord</u>:  You are a bit scrawny for a typical dragon and almost half the normal size standing at a mere nine feet at the shoulder.  None dare mock your skinny frame or over-sized wings however as the bulbous sacs to either side of the base of your neck contain liquid, molten death.  With your breath weapon, you can lay waste to your foes from afar, but be careful, even your supply of fire isn't indefinite.  Those huge flames sacs take a lot of nutrition to sustain, however, giving you an appetite equal to a quite large dragon.  Elaborate coat markings of black, red, orange and even yellow give this breed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.  A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.  And that suits them just fine.  Always solid black, you are a hunter of the night and while you can see into the blackest abyss, your eyes are sensitive to bright lights without the time to acclimate.  A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Nettled Reaper:</u> You have a fantastically dangerous appearance with a body covered in venomous quills.  Down the neck, across the torso, limbs and tail, colorful quills protect your body and advertise a warning to would-be dragon slayers.  Known for a foul temper and easily provoked, the quills on the tail are loose and can be launched a projectiles with a simple flick.  Lacking a breath weapon, your venom nonetheless is potent to render even a large dragon unconscious in minutes and will kill humanoids outright.  A fair flyer, you lack speed for the disturbance your quills cause, but make up for it in maneuverability.  You are also smaller than the average standing about 15 feet at the shoulder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But where your rivals are blood-thirsty, you understand there is no honor to be won in slaughtering the weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the fun begins!  What breed of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Geminate Drake:</u> They say that two is better than one and this is a truth with which you are intimately familiar. As a Geminate drake, you have never had to worry about being alone because, as with all members of your breed, you were born as a twin. Geminate drakes reproduce in twos, no more, no less and each set of twins is intimately linked throughout their lives. The depth of the connection is such that Geminate twins are often referred to as a singular being and the custom is to have a single name consisting of two parts for each pair of drakes (for instance, a set of twins might be named Mal\u2019Drak with one twin being named Mal and the other named Drak). Pairs of Geminate drakes are usually inseparable; they hunt together, sleep together, live together and usually take mates together. All of this is due to a strong mental link between each dragon, the strength of the link varies from pair to pair ranging from the simple sending and receiving of messages to merger on the extent that it seems that there is a single entity occupying two bodies. Sibling rivalry is rare to the point of extinction, but famous cases have emerged in history; always it has ended in tragedy. Geminate drakes can typically be found roosting in mountain ranges, the dryer the clime, the better. As for size, the typical drake tends to be on the large size, dwarfing land bound beasts and mortals. While not exceedingly strong or fast or possessing fiery breath of significant note, your strongest strength lies in your constant companion and your ability to fight as the ultimate tag-team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.  Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.</span></div></div>",

That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.

Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Seraphan:</u>  A more majestic breed of dragon you will have difficulty finding on the planet than the Saraphen. However, this breed of dragon is almost never glimpsed by earth-bound mortals. The sky to a Saraphan is more than a convenient way to get around, it is there one and true home. The average Saraphan, in fact, only touches the ground when it dies; they are born, live and breed all in the soaring heights above the clouds. Though it may be rumor, some Saraphen are said to grow to magnificent sizes, such that their wings from tip to tip would cover an entire estate. What is not rumor, however, is the clear fact that for their size, the Saraphen weigh extremely little, able to float on the breezes as the feathers that cover their bodies. You might wonder what it is that you eat if you never set your clawed feet on the ground, well the answer also lies in the sky for unlike any other dragon, you feed off the glory of the sun herself and in the distant heights above the clouds, you never have a want for food. Always a stunning, glowing white, a Saraphan is a glorious specimen of dragonkind sporting not one but two pairs of feathered wings, in fact, most of your kind tend to look down on other dragons who spend only part of their time in the sky and rarely ever enter into your lofty domain. As for other beings\u2026 well, have you ever paused in your stride to avoid stepping on an ant? I didn\u2019t think so. While not truly aggressive, a Saraphan will never back down from a proper challenge, attacking with their claws, complete mastery of flight and vastly superior speed. Also, the Sarahen tend to hold grudges as well as the angels to which they are often compared. There is no getting off their shit-list once a Saraphan has decided that you have wronged them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is a continuation of sorts of Darzhja's timeline, featuring Fangorn:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind flowed across his body as Fangorn Irontail swept through the skies over New Alveri, the grant capital of the vast Draconic Empire.  Down below, the vast myriad of humanoid races, millions upon millions of them lived out their short and content lives, counting on dragons like Fangorn to protect them from threats. Fangorn was far from alone in the skies either, for many of his kind flew by from one place to the next, with tradable goods, ferrying human passengers, or simply flying for the sake of flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Fangorn himself, why, he was a Holy Knight of New Alveri, an elite brotherhood of warriors chosen by The Ancestors to protect the Empire from its enemies. Like his had descended from a long distinguished line of bronze dragons, serving the Holy Knights of New Alveri since the very beginning. Both his father, also named Fangorn, and his mother Jariziya were from a long line of Knights, and from the day he had broken out of his shell, Fangorn was to become a Knight. One would think that every once and a while, Fangorn would have doubted the fact that his fate would be decided at birth, but he never did. He took great pride in that fact, and indeed being a Knight and fighting the enemies of the Empire had fascinated him from an early age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fangorn grew up, he made his parents proud. When his father had died when Fangorn was young, he redoubled his efforts. He was always at or near the top of his class in all he tried, in battle tactics, combat, scholarship and leadership.  He was well regarded by his peers, and by the time he had matured into a powerful and muscular young dragon, he was on the fast track to become a general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he found that his expected fast promotion didn\u2019t come as quick as he planned. For the first half decade or so, Fangorn would find himself guarding gates and conducting routine patrols, far from the great battles he envisioned. At first, Fangorn imagined that these seemingly menial tasks were meant to humble him, to prevent him from growing cocky, but then he started to wonder if there was something missing about him, but just could not quite identify what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew over a section of town that was in the process of being rebuilt. Ten years ago or so, it had been blasted sky high, by a group that had still not been identified. Tens of dragons and thousands upon thousands of humanoids had been killed or injured in that devastating attack. Fangorn had helped out during the attack, evacuating civilians and helping maintain order, but felt he should have done more. If there was an attack, would there not be an enemy to punish? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was being investigated, his superiors had said, continue your normal duties and wait for further orders. So, being the loyal knight, Fangorn obeyed, and obeyed... and obeyed. But by the Ancestors, it was frustrating. So frustrating. So it frustrated him to no end that he was still stuck performing patrols like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the culminating event of that day, when he had met a dragoness named Darzhja. An orphan dragoness, she had lost her friends and family during the attack; and had walked right up to the gate and demanded that she be made a Knight immediately, otherwise she would fight him until she did. That had been nonsense, how could anyone just walk up to the gate and ask to be made a Knight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the willful dragoness had proceeded to do just that, challenging Fangorn to a brawl and leaving him with a painful gash, and then by the Ancestors, she had been rewarded for it by being anointed into a Knight! Worse, Darzhja was then put on the fast track, being assigned important missions outside the capital that were well beyond her rank. Right now, she was on a mission in Damescara, investigating corruption in a gladiator ring that involved a potential backer of the attack on New Alveri. That should have been him! Not that upstart dragoness!! He couldn't help but resent that; that she would be rewarded for misbehavior while his loyalty relegated him to such low duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of that, he had to reluctantly admit, was that she had decided to form a relationship with a dragon that he had once considered his best friend, Lorath, a dragon from a long time merchant clan. Oh, how she would rub it in his face, of how Fangorn was rude and vain, while Lorath, on the other claw, was kind, agreeable and better looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a grunt. She would find out the hard way about that charlatan, of how he took dragonesses one after another. Surely, he would break her heart, and leave her humbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn wondered why he cared what happened to her in that regard. By the Ancestors, he should have gotten over his irritation over Darzhja by now, but he found that he could not. Because there was always something about her, something he could not identify, that... simply made her fascinating to behold. She stuck out from everybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him hoped that she would come back just so Fangorn could have another shouting match with her. If for no other reason to break the cycle of monotony he'd endured now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set now. The end of his patrol. Time to return to the temple now, another day in the life of a Knight. So, the large bronze dragon whipped around in the sky, and when he landed, he saw that...</span></div></div>",

I have completed my rounds of New Alveri, and will document the days events for record keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dully went over the events of the day; a few petty crimes that the humanoid soldiers dealt with easily, but the most noteworthy being a pair of fledglings deciding to take a fight out into the streets and stopping them from destroying humanoid property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one of those days eh?\" said Barrigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors yes,\" sighed Fangorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the corner of his eye, Fangorn suddenly caught a large shape heading straight toward the landing pad. His body stiffened. Was it an attack? Yet when his gaze narrowed, he recognized the dragoness coming forward. It was Darzhja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have got to be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness, without so much looking as to where she was going slammed onto the landing platform, uplifting bits of rock when she landed and making the surprised humanoid scurrying for cover. Her momentum kept hurling forward, forcing Fangorn to spin around and stop her from crashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja! What by the Ancestors were you thinking? You know better than to just come crashing in to a landing zone!! You could have hurt the humans!!\" he bellowed. Only later did he realize that this was precisely the wrong way to address her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething didn't look right though. Her eyes were filled with fury... and pain, similar to what he had seen during the attack on New Alveri itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFangorn, if you\u2019re here to call me names like you usually do or give me the run around of how I'm breaking this protocol or that, I don\u2019t want to hear it!!\u201d she snapped. Without pausing, Darzhja turned to a large faucet of water and began drinking feverishly. How long had she flown without stopping? She looked terrible. So Fangorn took the time to let her recover first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangorn took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? You're not supposed to be back from your mission. Where is Lorath? What became of the investigation?\" said Fangorn. Normally, one would send a messenger first to announce their imminent arrival, but Darzhja was never known to follow protocol, though in this particular case, Fangorn was greatly concerned of the possible reason as to why she had done so. Something had gone wrong, terribly wrong; so wrong that perhaps she felt she could not trust the normal messengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorath... he's not coming back to the knights...\" said Darzhja with a low growl. Fangorn's eyes widened. Lorath had been his lairmate and his best friend with the knights. While they had had a falling out, if Darzhja had come back alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened? Is he?\" said Fangorn, his heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's taking over for his clan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible, both his father and his older brother have precedence...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're both dead,\" said Darzhja, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? So there was an attack on Damescara then? How did that happen?\" bellowed Fangorn, his wings unfurling. His once dull day had now become anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarzhja turned her head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja,\" said Fangorn, forcing himself to calm down, \"How about we get inside? If things are as severe as they are, lets inform our superiors immediately so we can discuss what happened in a more secure setting. My mentor Lord Ragnor has been paying attention to the case and needs to know what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarzhja stared long and hard at Fangorn. Fangorn suddenly realized how bad things had gotten between the two, that when it came to things of such magnitude, Darzhja was hesitant to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I trust you? <i>Sir</i>?\" she said, glaring at Fangorn and placing bitter emphasis on his rank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words stung far more than he ever imagined. Did she despise Fangorn so much that she would rather see one of the major cities of the Empire burn rather than even contemplate seeking out his help? If so, then Fangorn blamed himself, because if he had to think about it, he had treated Darzhja rather badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darzhja,\" said Fangorn, \"Lorath was still my friend, and if something has happened to him, I still feel that I have a right to know what's going on. Furthermore, I know we haven't gotten along at all, but... when something like this has happened, we need to let our superiors know about it. My mentor Jereforth has been investigating the case as well. I can help.\"</span></div></div>",

Are you a Wizard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but my brother could very well do something for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he a\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA wizard? Some people believe he is.\u201d  The stranger said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing, not daring to believe there was hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  The small man, at least relatively speaking, seemed suddenly anxious, \u201cI guaranty he is!  But before anything, do you think you can do me a favor?\u201d  He gestured meaningfully with his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay in the middle of the road facing the stranger, with tall trees all around me and a canopy growing overhead. A trail of destruction spread off the beaten path behind me, trees broken in half or knocked down all together, as if a huge force had plowed through, which in fact was the case.  As it happened to be, I was quite an enormous creature as such things were measured here on the Earth. The stranger was standing in front of me, tied up to a thick tree with stout ropes.  He was looking at me and waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one of my claws I cut the ropes holding the human to the tree and saw him fall on his knees out of exhaustion. At that point I wondered why humans turn on each other so easily, but then after a moment thinking on it, I realized it was most likely the same reason why my own race had done so to me. Looking at the human in front of me, I was skeptical but at the same time curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think this wizard can give me back my home?\u201d I asked glancing up at the sky; or at least what was visible through the thick canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked up as he stood and figured out what I meant. \u201cI\u2019m dead sure of it.\u201d it said with a humble smile towards me.  \u201cThink we should get going, Dragon?\u201d the human said after a brief pause.  I realized I\u2019d drifted off slightly, staring at the strange clouds and thinking how strange it was that I was underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, however if you please, don\u2019t call me Dragon.  It feels as if you were belittling me. I have a name, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human took a step back, overly cautious. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2018bout that, it\u2019s just you didn\u2019t tell me your name yet. Um\u2026 Mine's Isaac\u2026 Isaac Xion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I scented his fear I backed off, not wishing to intimidate the tiny creature. \u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ve been dealing with these other humans for a while now. They just don\u2019t seem to take the time to listen to my words\u2026\u201d I sighed as I explained to Isaac. \u201cI am Nodalisk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for me to stand back up. For one, all the cuts and bruises I\u2019d accumulated from running through the forest, hadn\u2019t started to heal yet and then the fact that I never had the chance to actually stand  straight and look around with the trees all around forcing me to crouch and stoop. I was still quite sore for the awkward run, and yet at the same time, getting to my paws felt wonderful, as if the simple act of just standing there was making me stronger in the wake of my recent trials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Nodalisk?\u201d I hear Isaac say from near the ground. \u201cWhat of your\u2026 er\u2026 Worshipers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just made a very good point. However, for a moment, no matter what I thought up, the future for those humans I left behind seemed grim. \u2018Wait a moment,\u2019 I thought, twisting my head down to look at the scraggly bearded man, \u2018how did he know about them?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 If I stayed with them, they would eventually realize I\u2019m no god and perhaps try to kill me,\u201d  I said, pretending like I didn\u2019t notice the discrepancy in our conversation, \u201cAnd since I left them, they are most likely following me right now and maybe going to kill me once they caught up\u2026 How did you know they were people of worship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was how you said it. You sounded annoyed and, just guessing, not much would annoy a dragon of your stature.  Men of faith, especially the villagers nearby, I heard are total nut cases.\u201d He chuckled at that for some reason. \u201cHell, I know they're crazy. I\u2019ve been here for almost two days because of them. I was supposed to be an offering or something\u2026 most likely an offering to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply nodded at his logic.  It was nice being around someone who was not absorbed in verses out of a dusty old book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill the people behind you and be done with it?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hissed and the pearl white feathers around my neck ruffled at the thought, \u201cI\u2019ll rightly defend myself, if I\u2019m caught, but if there is no need to kill, I don\u2019t.  It\u2019s as simple as that. Besides I doubt that any human would dare try hurting a Seraphan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Seraphan?\u201d he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d I questioned I thought my brilliant coat of feathers and two sets of wings would have given me away immediately\u2026 then I remembered that I didn\u2019t quite fulfill the second descriptor anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's just... you\u2019re the first I\u2019ve seen, ever. It\u2019s rare to even glimpse at one, yet I\u2019m a few feet away from one. From you\u2026\u201d  Isaac\u2019s eyes grew wide as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going crazy like the others as well?\u201d I asked, my tail lashed to the side and began curling around the trunk of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Of course not.  It\u2019s just amazing is all being so close.  It is said to be a sign of great luck to even see a Seraphan No wonder those people thought of you as a god\u2026\u201d he replied, clearly eyeing my plumage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Isaac, let\u2019s be off.\u201d I said beginning to trot off down the road.  I felt uncomfortable with the man\u2019s eyes on me like that. Stopping for a moment, I looked behind me and saw the damage I had done in my haste, then back at the road ahead of me. It was quite narrow for me but it seemed I could fit in either direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn which direction does your wizard live?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat way.\u201d He pointed behind me. \u201cAlthough, that way leads right past the town whence you came. I really don\u2019t want to run into those people again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d I full heartily agreed with him. \u201cSo then, what of the other way?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe city of Bellwood. That\u2019s where I was headed before I was forced to\u2026 Stay put as it were.\u201d Isaac answered. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs of now, I just want to lose my Followers.\u201d I said with a little sarcasm. \u201cSo that means as of now, our only two choices is either this Bellwood place or past that Village we both were at before. Well I know half of those villagers are behind me right now breaking their way through the forest, so backtracking could be safe, I think. It might even throw them off our trail altogether\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way, I do suggest we hurry it up. I mean you just said those nuts are following you right?! And exactly how long have we been standing here talking?\u201d Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\"  I said, lifting my nose to the direction we would travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Edited by Shalion at the Author's request*</span></div></div>",

Scared of the villagers the other way. \u201cMay I ask one more thing of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d I ask as I stopped and looked to Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I have a ride.. Please?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated at that question. Didn\u2019t know how to answer it and when I didn\u2019t answer him after a moment he started to explain why he asked in the first place, maybe thinking he said something wrong to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell because of our size difference I\u2019ll be a lot slower then you, that\u2019s all. I mean, well, if it offense you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop.\u201d I said without meaning to sound so strong. It was a little annoying though, I mean did I really need to repeat myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d He said with a cracked voice. He then proceeded to curl up in obvious fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes as I turned to him, not caring if I knocked over anything in the process. \u201cWow, really that\u2019s all I can say. A second ago you were fine around me. You think I\u2019m like lesser dragons? That I\u2019d kill you, even after I said I wouldn\u2019t kill needlessly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter. Now hope on\u201d I said extending one of my claws and placed it down in front of him. I saw him cringe a little but he did clime on. I lift my claw off the ground and gazed at Isaac. \u201cyou think you could tell me why your so afraid of me all the sudden?\u201d I ask plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been scared this whole conversation, Sorry.\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries I think, we just met after all.\u201d I said happily, hiding the fact, that I was hurt, yet at the same time, I did understand a little. After all, who in the right mind wouldn\u2019t fear the unknown? Plus the fact that I was bigger then one of those things they lived in. I placed him on my shoulder and he walked a little ways to the middle of my upper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAah, Nodalisk?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy go to Bellwood? You said back to the village maybe safer right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do know both ways will lead to problems but in all truthfulness, I too don\u2019t want to deal with those people back there.\u201d I said as I turned back around and proceeded to walk again. \u201cHe got over it pretty fast.\u201d I thought happily. \u201cNow then, if you don\u2019t mine. If you want to talk, climb up to my head. It\u2019s hard enough to hear something so small even if it\u2019s right in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made great care not to leave a trail, of course that was a lot harder then I first thought. The road itself was rather large for humans but for me, a whole other story. I needed to squeeze through these trees without touching them and they were just tall enough that the sun couldn\u2019t help me much. At least I\u2019ve stopped bleeding by this point. Another is that it took me about an hour to get use to walking. I kept tripping on my own feet every now and then plus of course he asks me about it. I was thankful that he done what I asked of him and climbed up first and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I take it you never walked this far before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI barely walked at all.\u201d I said. His look I imagined was that of confusion. \u201cYou said it before, We Seraphan are rare to even have a glimpse at. Why you think that is?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet for a moment. The only sound that was heard was my footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone that said saw one, the Seraphan was always spotted in the sky\u2026\u201c he said. \u201cWait one guy said he saw one dead on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take him long to figure it out. Showed me he can solve puzzles well enough. \u201cThe Seraphan live twenty-four seven, up in the sky!\u201d he yelled. I laughed at his revelation, making him trip up and almost making him fall. I felt him scurry back to the middle of my head. \u201cClose one. From this height I could die.\u201d I heard him say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI apologized and I was a bit impressed that he still wanted to be up there. Considering he kept asking me question after question and I kept giving him riddle after riddle in till I found the amusement was gone from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough Isaac, please.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, I guess I\u2019m satisfied with what I got. Thank you Nodalisk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour welcome\u201d I replied.  I then felt Isaac heading down my neck. \u201cWait Isaac, if you please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and as he climbed back up he said \u201cWhat\u2019s up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much longer in till where out of this place?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be out of the forest in about a day or so maybe more. I know that it\u2018ll normally take me a week on foot, butt\u2026\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haft to keep walking like this for a day?\u201d I complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what, you mean this isn\u2019t you just walking?\u201d he said. I thought this was your normal way of walking, I mean you just said before that Seraphan never come down to earth so I simply thought that this was your walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave a path for them to follow.\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou been walking this way for a few hours, right?. The sun is past noon and I see or hear no one. I think we\u2019re fine. Relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. What the hell was I doing at that point? It was foolish, so I did what he said of me and relaxed. I spread out my legs and my overall mass was definitely wider then the road I stood on. I bent the trees on both sides of the road. I then proceeded to walk normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot faster this way. It could take us mere hours now!\u201d he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I was leaving a trail of bent or broken trees in my wake. \u201cI hate the forest.\u201d I stated out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just like Isaac said. After three more hours we finally made it out of that wretched place. Just to be out in the open made the burns I got on my sides from the constant rubbing of the trees was worth it. Isaac was on my back walking up to my shoulder as I looked up to the sky. It was dusk at that point. I sighed and slowly laid down. \u201cSo, I think I\u2019m going to rest for a bit.\u201d I said to the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, first could you let me down?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d I sighed as I put up a claw for him. He climbed on and I put him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you care to take a look.\u201d Isaac said. So I did. He was pointing to a mountain with lots of tiny lit up holes all over it. \u201cThat there, is Bellwood. I\u2019m heading there for the night and most the morning. Is that ok Nodalisk? I mean I\u2019m asking if I could go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed in annoyance. \u201cPlease stop that. You don\u2019t have to fear me. Your not my slave Isaac. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sorry.\u201d He said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for telling me however.\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac just nodded and headed to Bellwood as I laid there tired of all the walking. I just watched the tiny thing grow even smaller in my vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac Xion??? What a strange creature he is.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> I pondered on the human for a while, thinking that I knew nothing of this world.  He was asking so much on what Serapham were and talked little about himself.  \u201cHe\u2019s hiding something.\u201d I thought.  At the moment all I was able to do was think.  I didn\u2019t feel at all sleepy, exhausted yes, but not sleepy.  I\u2019ve come to realized that I didn\u2019t get to much sun either, ever scents I crashed on land I\u2019ve been mostly covered by something, so the sun was doing vary little for me. \u201cDamn.\u201d I sighed.  \u201cI can last till mourning.\u201d I thought as I wondered how I lived through all the crap I had to deal with for the past few days.  It was just one thing after another.  But enough on that, it be another story I\u2019ll tell some other time.  I looked around me, happy to find that most of where I laid was open, barely a tree in sight.  Just the forest behind me.  It was night when I decided to get further away from it, however I found it even harder to get up.  Wondering why didn\u2019t stop me and I walked a little ways, mainly just to get away from the trees.  When I felt far enough, I laid back down.  An hour of me just staring off into space past by in a blink but I finally fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke to find myself soaked.  Water was coming from the sky.  It was puzzling to me at first but I soon spotted clouds overhead.  I do in fact know that clouds have water within them.  I flew through a few in my lifetime.  Anyway.  It was refreshing to feel something from home but it was lasting longer then I wanted.  After twenty minutes of being drenched, it took its toll on me.  Too much of a good thing.  \u201cYour mocking me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said in frustration.  A moment of silence past by\u2026 I Roared!  It was the loudest I have ever been in my life.  I then proceeded to claw the ground beneath me, vigorously.  Over and over again, in till I wiped myself out.  I moved a little to the left then collapsed half way in the pond I made.  I passed out after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke back up when the sun\u2019s light peeked through the mountaintops.  The clouds and the water were gone say for that newly constructed pond and found that Isaac wasn\u2019t back yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Isaac left Nodalisk he found himself walking a great distance.  For some reason, he started running as if his life depended on it.  Running like that with no signs of stopping.  It took him a mere hour to get to Bellwood.  At the front gates, wheezing to catch his breath, sweat stunk the air around him and his legs in pain from over use.  One of the two guards placed at the gates came up to Isaac and said the typically clich\u00e9 thing any guard would say. \u201cHalt, who goes there?\u201d  Isaac rolled his eyes before looking at the guard coming up to him. Still breathing hard he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Edward\u2026 Ingrid I Must see\u2026 I must see\u2026 The lord of\u2026 Of Bellwood\u2026 Straight away.\u201d  The guard just looked as Isaac with disgust and said the other typically clich\u00e9 thing a guard would say.  \u201cState your business.\u201d  Before he gave his answer he took a breath and started to breathe normally. \u201cI need to speak to the Lord directly, it\u2019s urgent!\u201d  He yelled.  The guard hit Isaac in the gut and he when down on his knees.  \u201cLearn your place nave!\u201d  The guard sighed and started back to his post.  \u201cTHE DRAGON IS GOING TO KILL YOU ALL IF YOU DO NOT LET ME IN!!!\u201d Isaac screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the Lords throne room. It was raining outside by now. Lord Theodore sitting on his throne, Isaac standing in front of him but across the way. \u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d the Lord said bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand my Lord, I do. However please trust me, I Beg you.\u201d Isaac replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you because you said all it wants is some gold.  Gold, a human currency.  An expensive human currency.\u201d Theodore stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook my Lord.  I understand why you think I\u2019m lying but please, I\u2019m trying to save your people.\u201d Isaac pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Guards\u201d he yelled. As they came in the room he then said.  \u201cTake him away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they grabbed Isaac to pull him out of the room and Isaac screaming, saying to not do this and that, everyone went pale.  The reason was because everyone in the city of Bellwood heard the most gut ranching roar any of them have ever heard; Even Isaac almost pissed his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that Nodalisk?!\u201d Isaac thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that the dragon?!\u201d one of the guards yelled in Isaac\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking a little Isaac said. \u201cI believe so\u2026  You think your willing to help now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun was half way up in the sky.  That\u2019s when I saw him, walking back, but with other humans behind him.  There was something the humans were carrying.  A crate of some sort.  It took then four humans to hold it up.  I saw Isaac say something that made the others stop.  He then ran to me.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked as I moved my head to the ground in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so loud Nodalisk.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.  Look, I\u2019ll tell you everything later but for now I\u2019m Edward Ingrid and you want that crate\u2026 Please help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at him coldly. \u201cWhy?\u201d I ask more forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Master!\u201d he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you\u2026\u201d I started saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you did, you wanted more, but that\u2019s all they had, please take it and spare them!\u201d He yelled. It was obvious that Issac wanted the other humans to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting what he wanted me to do.  So this was the type of person Isaac was.  I looked at the other humans and decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

First off I didn\u2019t know what was so important about that crate that Isaac wanted me to lie for. The second thing was the humans behind him, scared out of their minds. I deduced, part of that was my fault. However, was my fit last night really that loud? Then there was Isaac himself. Fine with me one moment, afraid of me the next, lying to his own race after that. Was he lying to me as well. This whole time? I didn\u2019t know. I decided to tell the truth. Mainly because Isaac lied to me, wanted me to lie for him, and I realized that I trusted him to quickly. After all, it\u2019s only been a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople of Bellwood.\u201d I spoke with the calmest and softest voice I could muster. \u201cI am Nodalisk.\u201d The humans scared out of their wits but slowly calmed down as I spoke. \u201cAnd I\u2019m simply passing by trying to get home. As to whatever my companion has done to you to make you all walk here and be frightened of me. Whatever it was. I Am sorry for what he has done.\u201d At this point all the humans calmed down enough. Isaac on the other hand had an opposite effect. He slowly became nervous over the course of my apology. As if he thought I would help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about last night Dragon?\u201d Lord Theodore hesitantly asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assuming your talking about my little spat.

Banishment would be too easy, of course death would be too harsh, all he did was lie after all, yet how he scared my people and I\u2026\u201d he looked up at me and continued. \u201cDragon, ahh. Nodalisk, if you would be so kind as to hand your friend over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what pray tell are you going to do to him?\u201d I asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe will be imprisoned.\u201d He replied plainly. \u201cHe will live, he will get out one day, but he will suffer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at Isaac then back to Theodore and lifted my hand away from Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Nodalisk, what are you doing? Wait! Stop! I just wanted to help! Please Nodalisk!\u201d Isaac begs as a pair of the other humans walked up, grabbed him and started to drag him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but to feel sorry for Isaac, think that prison was overdoing it a bit. Some of the other humans who fainted woke up and Theodore ordered them to help carry the crate back to Bellwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just laid there, watching the tiny creatures grow smaller in my vision, pondering the facts. One is, I need Isaac. So far he was the only one who wanted to actually help me, and I just let him go. \u201cDamn it.\u201d I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac was being dragged back to Bellwood. His thoughts running past his eyes as he realized what he just did last night. He started to mutter to himself. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s a dragon, guessing he\u2019s prideful cause what he said bout his name and guessing scents he let Theodore take me, he is most likely honor driven. Great\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up prisoner!\u201d one of the guards dragging him along yelled. \u201cIf you can speak, you can walk yourself.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you would let me go then?\u201d Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Hell!\u201d the other guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen keep dragging me.\u201d Isaac argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lord? Could we just kill him and be done with it?\u201d Isaac cringed at the thought, not really wanting to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Theodore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardons My Lord but why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore turned to look at the guard talking to him. \u201cBecause of his friend, you fool.\u201d the guard went wide eye for just a second, knowing he meant Nodalisk and the Lord continued. \u201cHe was defending this man, means the dragon wants him for some reason. Why it gave him up is beyond me truthfully.  Prisoner, if you care to answer me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Knight.\u201d Isaac said loudly, making everyone stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you say it\u2019s a Knight?\u201d Theodore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst I say stop calling him an, it. You\u2019re belittling him and he hates that.\u201d He said as he stood on his own and I know this for a fact. \u201cTwo, I say Knight, figuratively. What I know of him so far is he is both prideful and honorable.\u201d Isaac then started walking on his own to Bellwood, realizing that he should stop playing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid in the middle of nowhere, soaking up the sun\u2019s heat. Bellwood in front of me, the forest behind me, my wounds slowly healing. Thinking that I needed to move as soon as possible, do to the group that was following me. I had about a week or so before they reached me, that is, if Isaac words were true. First things first, I needed to gain my strength back.  I noticed the humans still asleep as my eyes wondered the lands.  When I realized that Theodore left his own people behind I began to think that Theodore wasn\u2019t any better then all the other humans I met, say for Isaac.  Isaac couldn\u2019t be the same.  He was the only one who spoke to me as if I was an equal to him.  Suddenly I heard a scream and looked down to find one of the humans awake.  \u201cAm I really that terrifying to humans?\u201d  I ask as more woke because of the first cries of terror.  Instead of an answer I get screaming and running.  \u201cI guess so.\u201d I said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Bellwood prison, Isaac sat in the middle of a cell, smiling evilly.  \u201cNow this, I can work with.\u201d he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork with what?\u201d a boys voice said from the cell next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac jumped a little.  \u201cDamn!  Thought I was the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed a little.  \u201cNo worries sir, just trying to think of a way out myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help with that.\u201d  Isaac said as he got up and started rummaging through the little clothing he had on and found himself a pair of lock-picks.  \u201cSo, rather young voice to be in prison.  What you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey think I lied to them.\u201d the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac chuckled a little as he started picking the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething funny.\u201d the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in here because I lied to them.\u201d Isaac said.  \u201cThough, the people of Bellwood must be idiots, if lying is a cause for imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care to much if they are, I just know I can\u2019t keep my Master waiting any longer then he half\u2019s to\u201d the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA master\u2026 Interesting.\u201d  Isaac said as his cell door just opened.  \u201cWell then, your turn stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour quite trusting, sir?\u201d the boy said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a kid, that\u2019s really about it.\u201d Isaac answered coming up to the cell next to his.  \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name anyways?  I\u2019m Isaac.\u201d He asked while he started on the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac worked.  A figure from the cell\u2019s shadows started to emerge.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lockpick snapped just as the latch on the door turned.  Isaac cursed under his breath as he pulled the iron ring on the heavy wood door of the cell; without the thinner pick, the larger one he used to hold down the lever mechanism was useless.  Out of the cell walked a young man, a boy really, in Isaac\u2019s judgment, but he carried himself as if he were far older.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Tobias.\u201d Said the young man.  \u201cThanks for getting me out of there.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac would have responded, but he was occupied with looking at the boy\u2019s strange garments.  Despite the boy\u2019s sun darkened skin, he wore the dress of a noble, and certainly not any noble that Isaac was familiar with.  His silken suit was pitch black, the collar of his coat decorated with white thread forming a bat wing pattern.  The shirt he wore under his coat was dark orange, bronze perhaps.  It too was heavily embroidered with numerous divots in the front where it was exposed, scales maybe?  The color theme reminded Isaac of something one might see at a Harvest festival, though the richness of the fabric and the embroidery was far beyond the rags people typically wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide-eyed, Issac finally asked, \u201cWho\u2019d you steal that getup off of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias, who was almost as tall as, but not quite, Isaac smoothed the front of his shirt with both hands.  \u201cI didn\u2019t steal this.  It\u2019s mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac, who himself was dressed in little more than undyed linen and some rabbit hide boots smirked at the young man with a knowing grin.  \u201cRight\u2026  I\u2019m sure you found those in an irrigation ditch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias was looking around the small room outside the locked cell doors, apparently not interested in further discussion of his garments.  \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not sure of the way they brought me down here.  There were quite a few corridors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Isaac moved with his back to the stone arch which led to the cells.  Peeking around the side of the wall, he saw that he rough hewn passage beyond was lit with sputtering torches spaced so widely that there were gulfs of blackness in between them.  Save for the drip of water in the distance, the corridor seemed empty.  Turning back to Tobias, Isaac whispered.  \u201cSeems to be clear.  Just follow me and don\u2019t get in my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias nodded and began to walk quietly behind Isaac as he sneaked into the stone passage.  In truth, Isaac had no idea where he was going, they\u2019d put a sack over his head as they\u2019d led him to his cell.  It was obvious, however that they were in some sort of tunnel complex under Bellwood, or at least Bellwood\u2019s keep.  There was no telling how large the system was.  It ran, in part, into at least one natural cave, which was fortunate because Isaac figured that he could follow the path of the dripping water back to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid behind him moved with an easy grace, his steps quiet, but not as quiet as Isaac\u2019s.  The conman stole a look back to the pretender.  \u201cKid\u2019s got some gall trying to pull off a costume like that.\u201d  He thought, \u201cIf he\u2019d waited a few more years, he might\u2019ve made it.  At any rate, he might make a decent diversion if I run into any guards\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path split, one lit and one unlit.  Isaac, smelling the air from the lit shaft detected a mild odor of woodsmoke and soup.  The Kitchen.  The conman took the other path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias whispered from behind as Isaac put his hand on the wall and walked into the velvet black.  \u201cWhy are we going this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to go back into the keep, or do you want to get out of here?\u201d  hushed Isaac.  The boy fell silent as he felt his way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the earth was eternal night.  It seemed, after a while that the blackness was almost solid and threatened to crush him on all sides.  Isaac was afraid that this was what a tomb felt like.  Footsteps ahead.  Isaac froze and Tobias walked into his back.  The boy cursed and Isaac reflexively elbowed him in the gut, knocking the wind out of him.  Tobias staggered back and Isaac turned and put his hand around his mouth, listening.  The steps grew louder.  Tobias stopped struggling and went slack as he heard the noise as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorchlight emerged from around a corner, as if recreating the world as it neared.  Isaac was as relieved as he was terrified.  Still holding Tobias, he pressed himself to the wall.  \u201cIf there\u2019s one, I\u2019ll get around behind him and choke him.\u201d  He thought.  \u201cIf there\u2019s more, I\u2019ll toss the kid into them and run like hell.\u201d  Isaac saw shadows on the wall now.  He hardly dared to breathe.  It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The kid did, in fact, make a decent projectile as it turned out.  Isaac pushed the lavishly dressed youth forward into the oncoming guards, knocking one of them down completely.  It was bad luck that it hadn\u2019t been the one carrying the torch, the prison escapee would have preferred the cover of velvet dark as he ran back down the tunnel.  It was still dark, however and he stumbled on the wet, slippery ground, he swallowed back a yelp as he twisted his ankle.  Eyes squeezed shut \u2013 though it didn\u2019t really matter if they were open in this tunnel \u2013 he held his ankle as he cam up on one knee. He sighed softly.  \u2018I suppose I had a good run, at least.\u201d He thought with absolute certainty that he would soon be caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps up the corridor.  \u2018I wonder if it\u2019ll be hanging or the axe\u2026\u2019 thought Isaac, praying that he wouldn\u2019t be drawn and quartered or burned alive.  However instead of the guards he had been expecting, he saw first the polished boots of Tobias.  Looking up, he saw the young man framed by three men, two of similar age to Tobias and the third older and more battle worn.  The \u2018guards\u2019 were not in uniform, though they wore dissimilar leather armor covered with crude chain links beneath their tunics; it was the sort of armor one would find cobbled together by some backyard rustic blacksmith.  \u201cWha-\u201c  Isaac managed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias looked down at the conman with his twisted ankle and wordlessly extended a hand.  Isaac glanced at it and then took it.  When the older man was on his feet, however, Tobias drew back his fist and socked him squarely on the jaw.  Isaac saw lights brighter than any torch.  \u201cNow we\u2019re even, Isaac.\u201d Said Tobias shaking his hand as the older of the three new men caught Isaac and saved him from falling onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man holding Isaac looked to Tobias and asked, \u201cWhat should we do with him, Sir Drakling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring him along, Christopher.  He got me out of my cell and that\u2019s more than I could have done on my own.\u201d Said Tobias.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked from one man to the next, mouth hanging agape.  It was difficult to phathom that the kid had been telling the truth, but plainly these three men were loyal to him.  \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry, Tobias.\u201d  Said Isaac<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias ignored him.  \u201cHow did you three get down here anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man on Tobias\u2019 right snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s quite an unbelievable tale, M\u2019lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias looked to the other man on his left as the former was still in a fit of laughing, \u201cSince Jacob\u2019s brain is obviously being eaten by cave mites, would you mind telling me what happened after I was incarcerated, Michael?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was the one holding the torch.  He scratched at his patchy, immature beard.  \u201cIt is an interesting story, like Jacob said.\u201d  He turned to face Tobias as they continued stepping down the unlit path, \u201cFor starters, did you know there is a dragon outside of Bellwood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t\t*\t\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then what happened next?\u201d Isaac asked with avid interest as he continued to lean on Christopher\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark tunnel seemed to extend into infinity, but Tobias\u2019 three guards seemed comfortable enough as they led the former prisoners back the way they\u2019d came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously, we had ourselves more than the shock of our lives when we blundered into the fellow while we were looking for the cave entrance in the woods.  We didn\u2019t know what to do, but we eventually figured out he wasn\u2019t feral.\u201d  Jacob paused to lean to the side and soc Christopher in the shoulder, \u201cBut not before the mighty dragon slayer here went and tossed his sword at him!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher groaned and put his square face in his palm.  \u201cI\u2019m never going to hear the end of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael picked up the tale, \u201cIt just bounced off his hide anyway\u201d he said with a wave of his hand,  \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to mind too much, though and he told us his name was Nodalisk, so we gave him ours. We told him how you\u2019d been taken down into the prison, Tobias, and he seemed really interested in that. He told us he lost a friend down there too and then led us to the cave exit. He said if we run into an Isaac, tell him sorry and something else I can\u2019t remember.\u201d  Isaac looked at the young man speaking crossly, but didn\u2019t say anything, \u201cAnyway, that dragon has got a pair of legs on him, he easily kept pace with the horses and we were running them.  However, I wonder why he just didn\u2019t fly over here. Would\u2019ve been a lot faster.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t fly.\u201d Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not, we all saw his pair of wings.\u201d Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Seraphan.\u201d Isaac replied. The other four men paused in their stride to look at him with curious glances<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Seraphan?\u201d Tobias asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a race of Dragon that lives in the sky, never touching the ground and I think have two pairs of wings, right?\u201c Surprisingly it was Christopher who answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah they do.\u201d Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing... I never heard of anything like that.\u201d Michael added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them started walking again.  \u201cIs he still here?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. But when we left him to go into the tunnels, he was talking about trying to convince the Baron of Bellwood to let you go.\u201d Jacob said. \u201cI think your friend is pretty soft for a dragon.\u201d He said this looking heavily back at Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather die then?\u201d asked Christopher at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways.\u201d Michael said, breaking in between the two other body guards. \u201cAfter we entered the cave, we started wandering around in the tunnels searching for a backdoor as it were, and then ran into you. You thought we were guards I take it.\u201d  Michael said, winking at Isaac, \u201cThat\u2019s why you threw Tobias at us and started running yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked down in shame.  He couldn\u2019t remember what it was like to have people you could rely on, people you could trust with your life.  These people, especially the three younger men, really seemed like they trusted one another, even when they were bickering and socking each other.  Isaac couldn\u2019t help but noticed how Jacob and Micael were especially chummy with Tobias.  \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d said Isaac quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias put an arm around Isaac, \u201cAt any rate, we\u2019ll all soon be out of here and you\u2019ll have your freedom too, Isaac.  I won\u2019t forget that it would have been easy for you just to have left me in my cell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was about to say something, but the tunnel suddenly came to a fork.  The opening was small and secretive, but it was not the rough hewn passage that continued on into the dark.  It was carved stone and opened into a small alcove in which there was the bottom of a spiral staircase; it would have been easy to walk by without seeing coming from the other direction.  Four of the group continued down the main way but stopped as Isaac jumped off Christopher\u2019s shoulder and hopped to the small, narrow arch, placing a hand against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tobias asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t go yet.\u201d Isaac answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to figure something out first.\u201d Isaac said. \u201cJust get out of here you all, all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four just looked at him. \u201cChristopher, you go with him, OK\u2026\u201d Tobias instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac started to protest, and Christopher looked upset to be sent away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it your figuring out anyhow? What\u2019s more important than getting out of this weird little town?\u201d Tobias asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere just isn\u2019t something right about this place...\u201d Isaac said.  The strangeness had been in the looks people had given him in town and in the queer architecture of the houses and the lavish stone buildings.  It almost seemed to hang in the air, even down here in the dark caverns under the town.  \u201cFive years ago, Bellwood was nothing but an oversized logging camp, but now there\u2019s a keep, high walls and stone buildings everywere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know how that\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure your friend doesn\u2019t wait too long Isaac.\u201d Christopher said putting an arm under Isaac\u2019s shoulder and supporting his ankle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNor us.\u201d Added Tobias with a significant glance to his elder bodyguard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac and Christopher looked at each other and then started off up the stairs while the rest of the party kept going down the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Edited by Shalion**</span></div></div>",

The only reason they could see, Michael had taken the torch with Jacob and Tobias, was that the white marble of the walls spiraling upward glowed with a miniscule luminescence.  It was obviously enchanted.  Such was not unheard of, but even a simple glow woven into the stone would have cost a fortune.  The dark still hung around the two men as the hobbled upward, one supporting the other, but they could at least see the wall itself rather than be enveloped in total black.  Christopher looked at the smooth white stone with apprehension, but Isaac only focused on climbing; almost as if he knew where he was going.  It seemed extremely convenient that no city guards were placed on the hidden stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really here to discover any mystery, are you?\u201d Christopher asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Isaac answered without bothering to look at the other man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 Why the hell am I here!?\u201d Jacob yelled a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go if you want.\u201d Isaac replied. \u201cHowever I really am curious on how Bellwood was build so fast.  And I knew as soon as I saw this stone that there was something up here.  Something good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher sniffed and ran his hand along the cool stone as he continued to climb.  \u201cProbably\u2026 And I do have to agree with you about the town. I never even heard of Bellwood till today.\u201d Jacob replied.  They both kept climbing.<br>\r\n*          *          *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was very agitated with Lord Theodore, Baron of Bellwood\u2019s stubbornness. He just wouldn\u2019t see reason. I didn\u2019t know a whole lot about human laws, but it rankled that no matter what I said or how I explained the situation, the man refused to even consider releasing Isaac into my custody.  It was as if Theodore just wanted Isaac to keep.  I rested my head on the ground as I lay between the trees, feeling wretched.  \u2018I should never have let Isaac go with those men\u2026\u2019 I thought miserably.  I\u2019d been mad at my little pet companion, but I never realized that he might be taken so completely out of my control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that time that three of the five humans I\u2019d been expecting since I\u2019d returned from my last misbegotten session with the Baron emerged from the miniscule hole I\u2019d found in the woods behind Bellwood. Two of them sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob, please wait here for the others.\u201d Said Tobias as he climbed carefully over the rocks, he\u2019d spotted me almost immediately, but then a huge, white feathered dragon was rather hard to miss.  \u201cI\u2019d like to meet with this other dragon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two humans walked up, the one I knew from before, but the other was new.  It had to be the trio\u2019s missing friend, he was certainly dressed well enough for a noble, though I\u2019d been expecting someone far older than a mere human boy.  Tobias approached me standing tall, however even as his companion slouched and avoided my gaze.  He seemed remarkably comfortable around a dragon many, many times his own size.  \u201cGreetings.  You must be the one called Nodalisk, correct?\u201d  I nodded slightly, \u201cI am Sir Drakling and it is a pleasure to meet another glorious member of your species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted a feathered eyebrow.  This kid has met another dragon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*          *          *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to \u2018Sir Drakling\u2019s\u2019 explanation of his origin and his current mission to the capital city of Lyrond with avid interest.  Another dragon out on the frontier with a whole village of humans under his command\u2026  Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that?  Then I remembered what had happened the last time I\u2019d been in a figurehead position.  It was an interesting tale, especially since there didn\u2019t seem to be much evidence of other dragons elsewhere in this country dominated by tiny bipeds.  It occurred to me that perhaps I should seek out this \u201cLord Ladonius.\u201d  Then I remembered bitterly the stumps where my first pair of wings should have folded.  I\u2019d be at a fatal disadvantage if this bronze proved to be territorial as it was said that terrestrial dragons often were.  He was male too, so it seemed even more likely that this boy\u2019s sponsor would gut me and slash my neck open as soon as look at me.  I had better hopes following Isaac to his distant brother\u2019s as I\u2019d set out to do in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, this Tobias was regal and very courtly and flattering in his speech.  He gave me the proper respect I deserved, but didn\u2019t cower when I looked at him or made a sudden movement.  It was an exquisite change of pace.  Perhaps Tobias could train Isaac a bit for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had been sitting by the opening in the stone for a long time.  Tobias was entertaining me with a native folk story featuring a dragon whose tail had been stolen by a large catfish.  When he had finished, however, one of his companions interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking too long.\u201d Said Jacob. \u201cI\u2019m going back in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three humans looked up at me. \u201cWhy not Nodalisk, Isaac is your friend too, right?\u201d Michael asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know at the moment, but if he wanted to stay in there, I think it must be at least important.\u201d I said. The three just continued to stare at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know much of Isaac do you?\u201d Tobias asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much\u2026 but we only met about a week ago.\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe think Isaac maybe a Conman Nodalisk.\u201d Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Conman?\u201d I asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three humans just sighed.  My tail began to lash and accidently felled a large tree when they told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*          *            *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac and Christopher came panting to the top of the spiral staircase at long last.  As they stood at the top, they found themselves facing a solid stone wall.  They both stared at it.  \u201cNow what, genius?\u201d  asked Christopher heatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac just put his hands forward against the stone unbelievingly.  How could they have climbed all this way just to face a wall at the end.  He shoved against the stone.  \u201cNo one builds a magic glowing stairwell that leads nowhere\u2026\u201d  he said, straining against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher growled at him, but then slowly set his shoulder against the stone too.  He could see the logic in Isaac\u2019s statement.  Slowly, with a noise of stone grinding against stone, the section of wall pushed outward.  Both men stopped when they had enough clearance to slide through.  Isaac found himself looking into a small windowless room with a heavy oak door at the far end.  He was in Bellwood\u2019s treasury.  Isaac\u2019s jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, now that he looked at it, there wasn\u2019t all that much to the treasury of Bellwood.  In fact, the place was almost empty.  There was a book shelf against one wall with a collection of books with years listed on them: tax records.  On the opposite wall was a bare wooden desk and chair with a set of scales on it as well as a basic alchemical set Isaac recognized for testing the purity of gold.  A few coins lay scattered on its surface.  Isaac looked around frantically.  He spotted a couple likely looking coin purses on the book shelf as well as two more lined up at the back of the desk, but each was smaller than a tomato.  \u201cWhere\u2019s the gold?!\u201d he hissed.  Christopher just sighed, waiting for his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Isaac spotted it, the chest from before.  The one with the ransom he\u2019d demanded from the townsfolk under false pretenses.  He hobbled over to it.  Getting on his knees, he lifted the heavy cover and saw the large sacs within.  \u201cBingo.\u201d He said.  But when he lifted one, the sackcloth tore as they were wedged in the box very tightly.  Rather than the glittering of gold coins, out spilled nothing but sand.  Isaac\u2019s eye twitched, he felt like he was going to lose his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theif\u2019s hands shook as the contents of the weighted bag slipped through his fingers.  Christopher strode over and kicked the sand across the floor.  \u201cSatisfied, now, Isaac?\u201d asked Tobias\u2019 guard, \u201cBellwood\u2019s bankrupt.  The Baron probably borrowed a ton of money to get this place off the ground.  They\u2019ll have his head on the gate outside this time next year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d said Isaac, in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Said Christopher, putting a hand on Isaac\u2019s shoulder, but Isaac pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be right!  It takes more than a loan to raise walls and a keep.  There has to be something, there has to be...\u201d  he turned back to Christopher, \u201cHow the hell does Bellwood do so well with this little?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather know why there is a secret staircase leading down into the tunnels from here.\u201d Christopher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to look around Isaac saw something totally out of place in the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just it. For what I know of Theodore over the past few days. He\u2019s not one to keep trash laying about.\u201d Isaac said as he moved to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s most likely something precious to him.\u201d Christopher said as he followed Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to actually take it I think. At least for a bit.\u201d Isaac replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher sighed as Isaac picked it up. \u201cRight, shale we go now?\u201d Chris asked but Isaac just stood where he was. \u201cIsaac?\u201d he asked. Isaac was turning it slowly right and left. He didn\u2019t seem to hear Chris at all. Isaac, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Christopher asked as he walked up to Isaac. As he walked around the man he felt something. It was a faint feeling but it was definitely there. Dread. \u201cIsaac. We need to go.\u201d Chris said grabbing Isaac\u2019s arm then pulling him to the secret passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac finally snapped out of what ever he was in and with the sword in hand, he followed Christopher. \u201cOk, your right, lets go.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the both of them crossed through the door in the wall, they heard the wooden door across from then unlock and heard the voice of Theodore on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEscape\u2026 Hell!\u201d Theodore said as he opened the door.  Isaac and Chris already moving down the secret stairway.  \u201cWhat the Hell!\u201d Theodore yelled.  the two guessing he saw the mess Isaac made.  \u201cWhere is it!? Where is It!?  Where the Hell Is My Sword!!?\u201d the two heard him scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you it was precious.\u201d Chris said and Isaac just laughed as both moved as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry bout that Nodalisk.\u201d I heard Tobias say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just laid still and silent for a moment.  \u201cDid he lie about helping me get home?\u201d I asked looking down towards the humans before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Jacob said bluntly.  but that\u2019s when Michael punched him in the face. \u201cAhoch, My nose!  Damn it Michael!\u201d  Jacob put his hands on his face in pain.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d I barely heard him say.  I also heard Tobias laughed the whole time, but quickly compose himself after so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNodalisk.  There really is no way of telling what a conman will do for his friends.  Sorry.\u201d Tobias said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly known him for a few days\u2026  Oh well. I guess I really have no choice in the matter.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tobias who spoke next.  \u201cHe needs to trust Isaac, in order to get home.  Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just nodded.  Suddenly we heard bells start to ring over Bellwood.  I and everyone else instinctively looked over at the city.  \u201cYou three think they were caught?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they were I\u2019ll be pissed off.  That means we now need to plan out a rescue party.\u201d Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Christopher could be caught so easily.\u201d Michael stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Isaac is with him.\u201d Tobias added.  \u201cand he did sprain his leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026  Isaac hurt himself and you let him go?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we did.  Nodalisk.  Isaac is one who won\u2019t change his mind so half-assed.  He would have found a way to do what he wants.\u201d  Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost con-men are like that actually.\u201d Tobias added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then,  what do you think I should do?\u201d I asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside Isaac and Christopher ran into a little trouble with a few guards that caught up to them.  the pair stood in front of four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou good with a blade?\u201d Chris asked Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dabble in it from time to time.\u201d Isaac replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s gunna half to do I suppose.\u201d Chris responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four guards lunged at them.  Three of them went after Christopher.  They knew from the brief talk the pair had, Chris was better with a sword then Isaac.  The three attacking Chris didn\u2019t take long to fall on the ground.  Moving gracefully and dispatching three out of the four guards with what looked like one fell swoop.  the fourth fighting Isaac had a harder time then he thought he would.  Isaac holding his own well enough but couldn\u2019t do much other then that.  He stopped when Isaac saw the guard\u2019s head fly off.  Then seeing Chris behind him Isaac fell and took a breather.  His joints already hurting from that short time fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets go Isaac.\u201d Christopher said lending a hand to Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Isaac answered as he took Chris\u2019s hand and was pulled up by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started running.  after a couple minutes Chris suddenly realized that Isaac was keeping up with him.  He didn\u2019t bother stopping but he did ask Isaac, \u201cHow are you running normally Isaac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac stumbled a little now realizing himself Chris was right but kept running.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess adrenalin maybe?\u201d He questioned himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were waiting just a little longer when two humans popped out of the secret entrance to Bellwood. Tobias and his group all greeted each other with Hellos, what happens and a short explanation from Christopher.  Isaac just looked at me smiling.  I on the other hand stared back at him with immense disapproval.  The four others noticed me and Isaac but Chris interrupted the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to spoil the moment for everyone but we need to leave now. he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, Theodore knows of this passage and I\u2019m certain he is headed this way right now.\u201d Isaac added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we best be off.\u201d Tobias said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone and I agreed.</span></div></div>",

And everyone knows you can be counted on to keep your promises.  It's better to make friends than enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.  Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Earth-Render:</u>  You are a unique class of dragon.  Rather than living in high mountain lairs, your kind prefer to burrow into the earth.  That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.  You hide has a pebbly texture and comes in various shades of brown from clay to light green. Your head is smooth and no spur or weapon lays at the end of your tail, but your large fore claws are good for more than just shoveling earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sky-Swallower:</u>  So named because when you take to the air, your wings seem to swallow the sky to lesser earth-bound mortals.  An enormous breed of dragon, your strength is matched only by the Juggernaut, and your sheer size by none.  You and your kin have often been mistaken for small hills while you lay dormant in hibernation.  You bulk is such that it can literally flatten a small village under it.  All that bulk means a big appetite, however, so big in fact, that you have to spend the majority of your year in a state of hibernation to conserve energy.  But the more food you can get your giant claws on, the less time you have to spend sleeping and the more time you can spend chasing down loot!</span></div></div>",

The first time you had tried meat, it seemed like a delicacy... it was something to savour for a life-time.<br>\r\nYour first BONE on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you dear.\" Your father replied.<br>\r\n\"You too. The kids didn't give you much trouble did they?\"<br>\r\nYou mind quickly switched to the deer you were currently eating; it's soft fur... tender meat... blood still dripping... the tough bo-BONE! Avoid! AVOID!<br>\r\nYour sudden shock caught the attention  of your entire family, causing you to blush furiously in embarresment. You could even heard the sound of your siblings as you try to resume your meal.<br>\r\n<i>\"You win this round...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see...\" Your mother sighed.<br>\r\nYou think they've switched to conversation to you...<br>\r\nBut then she giggled as she walked towards you.<br>\r\n\"Hmhm, don't worry though, that just makes you so much more cu-\"<br>\r\nA roar in the distance had cut her off, causing hers, and your father's, eyes to widen in shock.<br>\r\nThough you and your Siblings had nothing but curiosity for this sound; none of you knew what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact... you're still not even sure what happened...<br>\r\neverything in between's been a blur...<br>\r\n     ...panic, screams... the glare from an unknown face...<br>\r\n                                                                        ...escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and bring yourself awake after remembering that dragon's gaze it had on you, sending shivers through your spine just by thinking about it.<br>\r\nNothing had changed since you had dozed off; same old tunnel... same old rock...<br>\r\nYou take another look back. Your father always wanted an escape tunnel... but your not sure if this is what he had in mind...<br>\r\nYou try to get back to digging your way forward, but your body's still numb from your previous work, even after the nap.<br>\r\nSo you give up that idea and go back to sleep; it'd take a lot more work to get through here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...How long have you been down here anyway...?</span></div></div>",

With your breath weapon, you can lay waste to your foes from afar, but be careful, even your supply of fire isn't indefinite.  Those huge flames sacs take a lot of nutrition to sustain, however, giving you an appetite equal to a quite large dragon.

Down the neck, across the torso, limbs and tail, colorful quills protect your body and advertise a warning to would-be dragon slayers.  Known for a foul temper and easily provoked, the quills on the tail are loose and can be launched a projectiles with a simple flick.  Lacking a breath weapon, your venom nonetheless is potent to render even a large dragon unconscious in minutes and will kill humanoids outright.  A fair flyer, you lack speed for the disturbance your quills cause, but make up for it in maneuverability.  You are also smaller than the average standing about 15 feet at the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.

Your adaptability and ingenuity in combat always keeps your foes guessing what you're going to do next!  Nothing excites you more than cleverly outwitting a clumsy opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.  A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.  And that suits them just fine.  Always solid black, you are a hunter of the night and while you can see into the blackest abyss, your eyes are sensitive to bright lights without the time to acclimate.  A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Fire-Lord</u>:  You are a bit scrawny for a typical dragon and almost half the normal size standing at a mere nine feet at the shoulder.  None dare mock your skinny frame or over-sized wings however as the bulbous sacs to either side of the base of your neck contain liquid, molten death.

Elaborate coat markings of black, red, orange and even yellow give this breed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Crovey:</u>  The Crovey are a species of dragon with a reputation almost as dreadful as the feared Deathwing and whose reality is definitely more horrifying for the average mortal. The ancestral home of this breed of dragon is a vast underground cave complex, which exists under an equally vast mountain range commonly referred to as Umbra veil (Land of Shadow) by the dwarves and other beings. The Crovey, if you ever get a chance to see one, are slender of build, almost sickly and possess a short wingspan, which is more suited for short bursts of flight or assisted leaping than prolonged gliding. Boney spurs at the elbows aid in self-defense and another spur at the end of the tail curves upwards as the dragons are known to strike over their heads rather like a scorpion. They lack the ability to breathe fire so it would seem on the surface that they would be forgettable. However, living in the dark these hardy fiends gained a unique ability to sense the life force of others at a distance, and even to feed upon it directly. Similar to a pit viper\u2019s sense of the body heat of its victims, the presence of life \u201cglows\u201d for the Crovey in the dark of their world. With time, their auras have grown incredibly malleable and they are able to extend it at will far from their bodies, thus are they able to feed on the life force of others, assuming the dragon can overpower the spirit, of their intended prey. If a Crovey cares to be subtle, their prey can begin to weaken and die without ever knowing the dragon was present at all. The Crovey do not eat, but do require a steady source of fresh water. They can feed on any form of life, even cave mold and fungus can be sustaining in times of famine, however, living creatures usually have the most abundant life force.</span></div></div>",

I doubted that but he just kept going. He told me what I had to do but I wasn\u2019t paying to much attention to him. His chatter finally ceased after about an hour.

While your foes go to and fro about the land, you carefully lay your webs and draw the trap ever tighter all without them ever realizing it.  The shadows suit you comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sea Stormer:</u>  While your kind don't actually live in the sea, long have you been associated with the surf and the pounding waves.  Weather just has a way of worsening when you are around and often, just the sight of you flying nearby is a reason to harbor the ships and close the storm blinds.  You don't spend much time in the water, but usually nest in seaside cliffs and dine primarily on fish caught at sea.  Of course, there is little wealth to be found at sea, unless you are looking for ships.  Instead of breathing fire, you can fill a very large sac at the base of your throat with water and expel it at high pressure.  Your kind have often been blessed by farmers looking for rain, but equally you have been blamed for creating cyclones and water-spouts...  Typically your kind comes in a light blue and white matching sea foam.  Pearly horns jut back from your head and fins at the end of your tail aid in both sky and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.  Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Faerie Dragon:</u> Despite being the smallest breed of dragon, there are none who take your kind lightly.  About the size of a large horse, your lithe, colorful body is supported by two pairs of elegant and overlapping wings resembling that of a butterfly.  Foes shouldn't be fooled by your innocent appearance, however, as with every flap of your wings, mind-altering dust escapes and quickly befuddles even the stoutest dragon. If that weren't enough, while all dragons possess deep and powerful magic, your magic crops up much more often and occasionally, you can even will specific effects into being, particularly if you are in danger.  It is also a known fact that your magic is tends to be most in tune with plants, simple beasts and the tiny folk whose forest home you share.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.

A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.  Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.</span></div></div>",

Better by far to be friendly... and back-stab your enemies when they least suspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part... What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sea Stormer:</u>  While your kind don't actually live in the sea, long have you been associated with the surf and the pounding waves.  Weather just has a way of worsening when you are around and often, just the sight of you flying nearby is a reason to harbor the ships and close the storm blinds.  You don't spend much time in the water, but usually nest in seaside cliffs and dine primarily on fish caught at sea.  Of course, there is little wealth to be found at sea, unless you are looking for ships.  Instead of breathing fire, you can fill a very large sac at the base of your throat with water and expel it at high pressure.  Your kind have often been blessed by farmers looking for rain, but equally you have been blamed for creating cyclones and water-spouts...  Typically your kind comes in a light blue and white matching sea foam.  Pearly horns jut back from your head and fins at the end of your tail aid in both sky and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Earth-Render:</u>  You are a unique class of dragon.  Rather than living in high mountain lairs, your kind prefer to burrow into the earth.  That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.  You hide has a pebbly texture and comes in various shades of brown from clay to light green. Your head is smooth and no spur or weapon lays at the end of your tail, but your large fore claws are good for more than just shoveling earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Faerie Dragon:</u> Despite being the smallest breed of dragon, there are none who take your kind lightly.  About the size of a large horse, your lithe, colorful body is supported by two pairs of elegant and overlapping wings resembling that of a butterfly.  Foes shouldn't be fooled by your innocent appearance, however, as with every flap of your wings, mind-altering dust escapes and quickly befuddles even the stoutest dragon. If that weren't enough, while all dragons possess deep and powerful magic, your magic crops up much more often and occasionally, you can even will specific effects into being, particularly if you are in danger.  It is also a known fact that your magic is tends to be most in tune with plants, simple beasts and the tiny folk whose forest home you share.</span></div></div>",

In the shadows your swell and your prey will never sense you coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part... What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.

A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Nettled Reaper:</u> You have a fantastically dangerous appearance with a body covered in venomous quills.  Down the neck, across the torso, limbs and tail, colorful quills protect your body and advertise a warning to would-be dragon slayers.  Known for a foul temper and easily provoked, the quills on the tail are loose and can be launched a projectiles with a simple flick.  Lacking a breath weapon, your venom nonetheless is potent to render even a large dragon unconscious in minutes and will kill humanoids outright.  A fair flyer, you lack speed for the disturbance your quills cause, but make up for it in maneuverability.  You are also smaller than the average standing about 15 feet at the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Crovey:</u> The Crovey are a species of dragon with a reputation almost as dreadful as the feared Deathwing and whose reality is definitely more horrifying for the average mortal. The ancestral home of this breed of dragon is a vast underground cave complex, which exists under an equally vast mountain range commonly referred to as Umbra veil (Land of Shadow) by the dwarves and other beings. The Crovey, if you ever get a chance to see one, are slender of build, almost sickly and possess a short wingspan, which is more suited for short bursts of flight or assisted leaping than prolonged gliding. Boney spurs at the elbows aid in self-defense and another spur at the end of the tail curves upwards as the dragons are known to strike over their heads rather like a scorpion. They lack the ability to breathe fire so it would seem on the surface that they would be forgettable. However, living in the dark these hardy fiends gained a unique ability to sense the life force of others at a distance, and even to feed upon it directly. Similar to a pit viper\u2019s sense of the body heat of its victims, the presence of life \u201cglows\u201d for the Crovey in the dark of their world. With time, their auras have grown incredibly malleable and they are able to extend it at will far from their bodies, thus are they able to feed on the life force of others, assuming the dragon can overpower the spirit, of their intended prey. If a Crovey cares to be subtle, their prey can begin to weaken and die without ever knowing the dragon was present at all. The Crovey do not eat, but do require a steady source of fresh water. They can feed on any form of life, even cave mold and fungus can be sustaining in times of famine, however, living creatures usually have the most abundant life force.</span></div></div>",

Placing the girl on the ground and prodding her towards the Orc camp, I told the worshiping warrior that the human was to be taught how to lead a force and that if any harm happened to befall her, I would destroy the entire camp and butcher any survivors.

What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Screeching Ridgeback:</u> As a rare kind of social dragon, what you lack in brute strength, size and speed, you make up with an ability to cooperate with your fellows.  Growing up in a mountain colony, you learned that while individual strength is important, you also learned how to be a team player.  Of course, you yourself aren't satisfied with being in the background are you?  Otherwise you wouldn't have a story to tell!  You don't breathe fire, but instead can emit a piercing screech that will travel for miles and allows long distance communication with others of your kind.  At close range, the decibels you can generate are disabling and potentially fatal for humanoids.  Larger dragons might be more trouble but you can certainly disorient them and who knows what you can accomplish by working together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.  Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.

I gazed long at the settlement, watching the tiny creatures scurry back and forth.  Pointless, meaningless lives.  In a sense it was like watching fish in a tiny pool.  Those tiny beings down there, sheltered in the confines of their artificial home had no concept of the vast world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees, the wind, the sky.  All beckon to me so that it was a challenge to even remain still and concentrate.  I took the thought into my mind that I could decimate the village, eat my fill of livestock and have an afternoon\u2019s worth of amusement as well.  My head lowered and I lean more against the stout tree at my side, I could feel the roots straining under the ground as I press my formidable weight against the ancient tree.  Burning the village too would be pointless, something that my brother would revel in as well.  I resolved not to destroy the village, if only because it is something my hated sibling would enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was already tired of thinking of him.  He was far away now and no longer a part of my life.  My life\u2026  I had never been out completely on my own, I realized with a grim certainty.  I\u2019d been flying for my life for so long, survival had been the only goal.  Now what?  I turned my head back the way I had come and realize that the mountain at my back marked the end of the last dragon\u2019s territory whose domain I\u2019d so recently passed through.  He\u2019d informed me that beyond his domain, the land was hostile, populated by tiny thieves who delighted in stealing dragon eggs, slaughtering  infants and emerging from the ground like ants despite every attempt to exterminate them.  In other areas, they were properly tamed, but not there, he had said.  Not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot properly tamed\u2026\u201d  I thought slowly, the idea building up in my mind like a rising tide.  I knew I needed territory and seeing as not an inch of proper real-estate was left unclaimed in all the lands I\u2019d visited in my years of traveling, perhaps I could be the one to begin domesticating these \u201cwildlands.\u201d  After all, I had no eggs nor young vulnerable to tiny thieves and assassins.  The idea that an insect, even a multitude of insects no larger than the small claw on my hand could pose a threat to me was laughable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I sat and turned my head back to the settlement tucking into a fertile valley between the towering mountains.  It\u2019s wooden shacks and campfires took on new meaning in my eyes.  Perhaps my territory could be rich indeed someday\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thumped my tail in a fit of amusement at the insane notion.  Still\u2026 it was best to take my time settling myself into my new territory.  The long centuries, millennia if I was lucky, stretched out before me.  I could afford to wait and I knew my patience was a gift that the rest of my misbegotten family lacked and didn\u2019t value.  I would make full use of it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spread my wings and felt my bronze scales rippling over my sleek and powerful form.  Barely out of adolescence, I had come into my body since my expulsion and it had hardened and grown powerful during the course of my travels.  I had nothing to fear in all the wide world, even other dragons would give pause before challenging me.  But my strength was only a fraction of the power I could and would wield.  If this was to be my new home, I would take the time to understand its intricacies as I took the time to study the patterns of migration of deer and other game back across the mountains and across the desert whence I came.  The most potent weapon of all was information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing my hindlegs, I lifted up my chest and sprang into the air, cupping the wind with my wings and lifting myself up.  My legs smoothed against my body and my tail lashed, balancing me as I turned to face the wind.  The sensitive membranes of my wings told me how the air was moving and about the tiniest changes in temperature.  I flapped, lifting myself higher and away from the trees.  I saw a hawk rising in front of me and followed until I could feel the thermal lifting me higher; I set my wings and soared.  I closed my eyes and reveled in the sensation, the air rushing past my face, the loving support of the wind under me.  It felt good to rest, it felt good to <i>rest</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes and circled for a while, just for the fun of it.  The green valley under me was indeed fine country.  I could only imagine what good food-beasts might be found here.  But I couldn\u2019t let my belly take charge, as much as I\u2019d like to believe otherwise, this valley wasn\u2019t my own just for looking at it.  I scanned the valley, looking for the village\u2019s outlying buildings and shacks\u2026 looking for potential prey.  I didn\u2019t have to search long before I found what I was seeking.

It gave me time to decide which direction from which to strike.  I was well practiced in hiding myself on my approach.  The trees surrounding the small field with give me cover once I was close enough.  I tucked my wings close and jetted down, angling them so I spiraled in.  The g-forces of my descent made my heart rush with excitement.  I did not flap or brake, but re-extended my wings so I came rushing in over the trees.  I was a little high coming in sacrificing concealment for a better margin of error.  The human unfortunately was turned in my direction as the trees gave way instantly to plowed earth under me and it began to run.  It stung a little that my ambush was not perfect, but it would make no difference, the tiny biped moved so slowly, especially in comparison to a fleeing deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part was not killing him.  I slowed as much as I could by angling my wings upwards, it was a delicate maneuver when simply coasting.  I stretched my hand forward and caught the human in my palm.  It shrieked, in pain or fear, I could not tell.  I flapped  and lifted us both away.  I think my tail accidently brushed against the wooden building on my way out, but I didn\u2019t particularly care.  The human was creating an ear shattering din with its wails.  It took everything it had in me not to squeeze it until it was silent.  I resolved to carry the noisy thing far away where I could conduct my business in peace.  I tucked it to my chest and flew, cradling the dirty, struggling thing to my chest for ease of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the better portion of an hour, I found a likely ledge, though it was a bit too small to be comfortable.  I landed awkwardly, bracing my wings against the mountain\u2019s face to break my fall.  I let the human drop and set about folding my wings.  The beast immediately tried to run, though there was nowhere for it to go except over the ledge.  I sat myself down, my tail draping over the edge for the lack of space.  Then I did what I did best, I waited.  It didn\u2019t take long for even a beast as dumb as a human to figure out it was trapped.  While I waited, though, I noticed the human\u2019s strange appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I had taken for its filthy hide which had caught between and befouled the scales on my palms was actually some sort of loose material worn over the human\u2019s skin which itself was as naked as a newborn mouse\u2019s.  It\u2019s horried flat face was even more ugly in person, lacking a nose altogether save for a tiny protrusion rather like a cancerous lump in the middle of its face.  Lacking hair everywhere save for a mop on its head, it was easy to see why they would wish to cover themselves.  I hoped I was not wasting my time trying to understand such pathetic creatures and yet the rumors of wealth accumulated by the vast numbers of these things drove me on.  I stuck to my original plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time after the human had stopped trying to climb down the sheer ledge, it refused to look at me.  As if not acknowledging my presence would somehow change its situation.  I snorted hard enough for the warm air to ruffle the thing\u2019s shaggy head of hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it turned, I spoke in the most recent slave dialect I\u2019d learned.  The one used most commonly on the other side of the mountains among the tiny populations of properly humbled and domesticated bipeds.  \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d I asked in a low voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps I\u2019d picked up a variety with no more sense than a rutting pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, at least I had myself a decent snack\u2026  Before I parted my jaws, I thought I heard some sort of garbled mumbling.  \u201cDid you say something?\u201d  I asked in my gruff baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the human spoke, it was in a voice unpleasantly high in pitch to my ears.  Also, despite the fact that I knew the words that it spoke, the dialect it used was foreign and hard to decipher.  The gist of the creature\u2019s lament was: \u201cP-please don\u2019t eat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes and tried to speak slowly so that it would understand.  \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted to eat you, I\u2019d have done it on the way over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps my words came across as threatening for the human cowered again, scurring to the far side of the ledge and pressing its back against the wall.  It hid its face between its knees and the human\u2019s face became obscured by the unkempt mop of hair.  A low grumble echoed in the confines of my throat.  I\u2019d been prepared to break down hostility and aggression.  I wasn\u2019t sure how to handle such overpowering fear.  My tail lashed and struck the side of the mountain, causing a small rockslide which slid down into the valley below.  Perhaps I should eat this one and try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I gave up, I extended my neck, deciding to get a good sniff of the human.  I was not, after all, even sure they were fit for eating.  I pulled in draught after draught of air into my long, proud nose.  I smelled dirt ingrained deeply into the human and the scent of seeds \u2013 perhaps pumpkin \u2013 on its hands.  Sweat, both fresh and stale was pungently emanating from the rags it wore about its person so that I was filled with the impulse to cleanse it with a good burst of flame.  I tried desperately to find something good about this creature, but the stink was almost overpowering.  Underneath, however, the skin emanated a sweeter odor, much different than the hot, sulfurous smell of a dragon.  It was different too from the scent of a deer, less mossy and softer, more subtle.  I inched my neck a bit closer, intrigued.  The human only reacted by bundling up tighter, but this only increased my curiosity as it tried to hold in its scent.  The tip of my nose was very close by the time I finally detected the human\u2019s gender.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the scent of the human male was as meek as a drop of milk diluted in a bucket of water compared to the musk of another male dragon which capable, by pure biology, of filling me with an intense, uncontrollable anger and bloodlust.  I felt not the slightest threat from the unfledged male cowering barefoot against the sheer wall of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain of what to do, I withdrew my head.  This alone seemed to ease the boy\u2019s sobbing.  \u201cWhy do you cry so, Human?\u201d  I asked because I was honestly confused in regards to his behavior.  \u201cI told you I am not going to eat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man lifted his head and removed the shoulder length black hair from around his face with a sweep of his hand.  The tears left clean tracks down his dirt-stained cheeks.  His voice cracked as he spoke, \u201cT-then I\u2019m to become\u2026 a slave?  T-they do that from t-time to t-t-time.  Collect new slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI deduced instantly that the boy must mean that dragons came over the mountains periodically to collect fresh blood for those dragons who decided to keep slaves in the lands beyond.  That was important news in itself.  I\u2019d have to figure a way to stop them doing that if this land was to be my new territory\u2026 or at least charge them for it.  But I\u2019d have time to dwell on that later.  I seized the moment, deciding to try to assuage the human\u2019s fears despite the fact that the word \u201cslave\u201d was fairly appropriate for what I\u2019d like him and his people to become.  \u201cNo, I am not going to take you over the mountains.\u201d I said, trying to avoid the whole \u2018slave\u2019 discussion.  I tried to phrase an idea as I would to a young drakeling, \u201cI brought you here for a very important reason.  I want your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human\u2019s eyes widened and I interpreted the expression as shock.  \u201cM-my help?  W-what could\u2026 I possibly do? I-I\u2019m just a simple farmer\u2019s son.  I d-don\u2019t know how to do\u2026 anything.\u201d  The words tumbled clumsily out of the boy\u2019s mouth, his voice cracking again.  It was all I could do to understand the strange inflections and slurs the boy used in his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused for a time, deciphering the human\u2019s words and making sense of them with what I knew of the slave language.  A mountain wind gusted and though I felt its pleasant coolness against my scales, it seemed to have an adverse effect on the young man who curled up tightly, clutching his rags about him.  I studied the way he reacted as if observing a bug through a glass.  When the wind finally stopped \u2013 though the human kept shivering \u2013 I said, \u201cAll things in time, Human.  Tell me, would it please you to become a very powerful man\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His knees were shaking with the cold.  \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what that would even mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny grin tickled the corner of my mouth.  Perhaps the boy was not a stupid as I\u2019d previously guessed.  Seeing his discomfort made me decide to move the location of our \u201cdiscussion.\u201d  It would be unfortunate if this human died of cold and I was forced to abduct another only to start this non-sense all over again.  I began to stand and once again, the boy cowered against the cold stone of the ledge back.  \u201cStop that foolishness,\u201d I said, shaking my wings out and warming them with a couple slow flaps.  When the boy lifted his head again, I spoke.  \u201cYou look very uncomfortable in this cold.  Let me take you somewhere warmer.\u201d  I was already reaching out my clawed hand, but stopped when the boy flinched.  I sighed and put my paw back on the ground, mantling my wings behind me.  \u201cThere\u2019s only one way off this ledge.\u201d  I said, patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grimaced and I thought he would burst into tears again, but he remained at least partially composed.  \u201cYes\u2026\u201d he admitted after a few moments, \u201cBut must you carry me like last time.  Your scales cut me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy nostrils widened as the boy lowered a portion of his raggedy outfit and I saw a couple linear slashes across the young man\u2019s thigh, fresh blood leaking from them and unintentionally making my mouth water.  I forced myself to focus.  \u201cI\u2026 am sorry if you were injured.  It is\u2026 difficult to be gentle with one so small as you.\u201d  I said and the words were more difficult than I imagined.  I was lucidly filled with the absurdity of talking so easily with something so lowly as this tiny biped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood up finally and looked me up and down.  His eyes were still unsure, but seemingly willing to accept the circumstances for the time being.  \u201cI\u2026  I can imagine that.  But\u2026 could you remember that to me, you are very, <i>very</i> big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion of the relativity of size was quaint, but I\u2019d already bored of it.  I stretched out my paw again, slowly this time.  \u201cMay I hold you?\u201d  I asked, \u201cBefore you die of cold?\u201d  The young man stepped forward and we were soon on our way further up the valley and further away from the human\u2019s kinfolk.  If the boy said anything during the flight I could not hear it for the rushing of the wind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My weight caused my talons to sink deep into the soft turf as I flapped my wings madly.  It was a difficult task to land without using one\u2019s front legs.  Still flapping to keep my body upright, I lowered the young man with a single hand to the ground, where he promptly tumbled down onto his side.  For my part, the burden released, I sank down heavily to the side.  The shock of my impact knocked the boy down again as he was struggling to rise.  The human was already lodging complaints against the rough treatment, but I paid them no mind.  I was testing the wind again with my wings in preparation for flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the human realized what I was doing.  \u201cWait!  Are you just going to leave me here, Dragon?\u201d  the boy shouted and I found the evaporation of his former fear amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here.\u201d I boomed, using my usual voice over the sound of my wings.  \u201cOr I may not be able to find you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want you to find me!\u201d  yelled the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted, emitting a plume of smoke that was quickly dispersed by the breeze from my wings.  \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d I said, \u201cBut remember you are very far from home, and also, I\u2019ll have fresh meat here when I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t wait to observe the boy\u2019s respond and I launched myself into the sky.  This was to be the boy\u2019s first true test.  On the ledge, there were clearly no options for the human but here there was at least the appearance of a choice, however illusory it actually was.  I knew little of human ways, but I knew they relied heavily upon tools they fashioned and wielded with their hands.  With nothing here for the boy but the clothes on his back, I surmised that surviving long enough to make the journey back to the village on foot would be next to impossible.  I needed to know that the human would prefer to rely on myself rather than attempt to make it on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for me to locate potential game.  It always did when I was new to a territory.  I spent several hours trying to find evidence of passing deer \u2013 I knew they were here from the scent I\u2019d caught in the clearing and elsewhere \u2013 but to no avail.  As dusk settled, I turned my efforts to more exposed prey on the rocky feet of the mountains, not because the failing light bothered me, but because I was concerned about how long the human would wait.  I searched the rocks and crevices with my powerful vision  soaring high all the while.  At long last I spied a mountain goat, muscular and fat with long spring grazing.  He was walking in the open; clearly the game around here was not used to dragon predation.  I was willing to take swift advantage of that fact.  I dove and grabbed the bleeting ram with my claws, easily snapping his neck between my long finger and my short rudimentary thumb in a simple, practiced motion.  I was careful, however not to accidently disembowel the creature with my talons; nothing irked me more than wasted entrails.  I was sorely tempted to begin eating on the way back, but I didn\u2019t know how the human would react to a partially devoured carcass, in fact, I realized I knew nothing of human eating habits save that they did, in fact, subsist on meat as well as grains, vegetables and other plant-things they grew in the dirt.  So despite arriving here across the vast plain on the other side of the mountains on an empty belly, I decided to carry the ram whole back to the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was ravenous by the time I arrived.  Landing was easier considering I could simply toss down the carcass as I landed.  I looked around, the trees surrounding me were as clear as they were during the day, but everything was very quiet.  Perhaps I would have to find a different candidate after all.  With a non-committal snort, I lowered my head to begin eating, but heard movement behind me.  My tail moved reflexively, but I changed its direction enough to avoid killing the young man, instead cleaving a sapling beside him in twain with the serrated arrowhead at the end of my tail.  The boy jumped far too late to have mattered if I\u2019d wanted to kill him, landing on his belly where he lay panting for several moments.  Turning my head around on my neck, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked from me to the ruins of the twelve-foot high sapling and said nothing.  I waited for him to get to his feet and wander over to the fresh kill.  \u201cMountain goat?\u201d  he asked stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answer the obvious and assuming that the human would not have the presumption nor the gall to actually question what I was able to catch, I said,  \u201cYou may pick what you like, but the liver is mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his teeth clenched, the boy was still staring down at the goat with its head twisted about the wrong way as if it might at any time come to life and attack him.  \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026\u201d the boy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven my patience was wearing thin.  \u201cYou are hungry, no?\u201d  I asked, again trying to prompt the human to some sense.  When he \u2018nodded\u2019 with his head in the strange gesture I\u2019d since learned to associate with the affirmative, I added, \u201cThen eat your fill and I shall have the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked from the dead goat\u2019s clouded eyes back to me, \u201cBut\u2026 I h-have no knife, nor any fire to cook with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled at the human\u2019s helplessness.  \u201cFine.  Let me help you.\u201d  I said and, with a single sharp talon, gutted the goat releasing the sweet smelling entrails.  I spat a small glob of sulfurous mucous from the twin sacs at the base of my neck and it ignited upon contact with the air.  When it was burning with dense, oily light on the ground, I said, \u201cThere:  fire and fresh meat.  Help yourself\u2026\u201d  But when I turned my head, the boy was collapsed in a heap on the grass, in a dead faint.  I covered my face with a paw and realized that this was going to take longer than I thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTell me more about this\u2026 what did you call it?  \u2018Funckin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s pronounced Pumpkin, Puh.\u201d The human lad explained about his staple crop.  The human syllables were difficult on my thin, scaly lips, particularly, \u201cp\u2019s\u201d and \u201cm\u2019s.\u201d  \u201cAnd they are large, round\u2026 well pumpkins.  We plant them this time of year and they are ready to eat by harvest.  We make the sweetest pumpkin pies you\u2019ll ever eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy waxed at great length about the virtue of pumpkins and how their soil and secret growing techniques ensured that they produced the highest quality gourds year after year.  It was so interesting, I felt like curling up and reminiscing on it quietly, perhaps for a decade or so.  Despite the human\u2019s dull conversation, I listened attentively, partly because I knew that it was one of the few areas in which this \u201cfarmer\u2019s son\u201d was exceedingly proficient and also because he had already given me heaps of valuable information about the village and how the humans organized themselves in their \u2018society\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trickiest part of the whole affair had been keeping the tiny little beast alive.  It was extraordinarily picky when it came to food, to the point where I believed it would sooner starve to death than rip into a nice, fresh carcass; bizarre creature.  The boy did eventually eat, suggesting that I \u201cfillet\u201d a large \u201csteak\u201d off the hindquarters of the food-beast.  My talon proved to be too thick for the task, however, and I only managed to further tear up the carcass and traumatize the lad.  In the end, I was forced to relinquish my favorite part of the animal, the liver which the boy roasted on a stick over a fire he built out of branches piled over my fiery Phlegm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then assisted the boy in crafting a crude \u201cshelter\u201d by bending over a small tree while he secured some of the branches.  I\u2019d heard enough tales of unwary dragons murdered in their sleep by their tiny servants so I had no intention of sleeping with the human.  Before I took flight from the clearing, however, the boy expressed his concern about wild predators.  I tried to assuage his concerns by lifting my leg on a nearby tree.  After nearly losing his liver at the apparent \u201cdragon stink\u201d I assured the boy that my musk would keep smaller predators at bay.  Considering the odiferous nature of my mark, he seemed content to believe me.  Thus I flew off to find a safe roost, not really knowing if my boast of protection were true or not.  Certainly a smaller <i>dragon</i> would not approach my mark, but a bear or a wolf?  I honestly didn\u2019t know.  Surely they would sense that something large and dangerous was in the area, but then again, dragons did not visit these parts often as evidenced by the lack of caution of the local prey.  That night I tucked my head under my wing and slept like a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went hunting again first thing in the morning as a single goat, even one that was muscular and fat, was but a mouthful to me.  I was able to return to the clearing before midday, another ram lodged between my jaws and a mother with her calf in each of my front paws.  I was content to see my companion had not, in fact, been eaten by wild animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human ate again, this time able to retrieve his \u201csteak\u201d with a stone knife he had fashioned in the time I\u2019d been gone.  As I was wondering where the strange object in his hand had come from, I realized that the boy had also managed to clean and organize his sleeping area of debris and also weaved the branches together in a certain way that he explained was to make the roof more resistant to water as well as keep in more warmth.  And more, the young man had collected a small supply of roots and mushrooms \u2013 I learned the names for these as he pointed to them \u2013 as well as a supply of firewood.  His clothing was even more ragged than the previous day, and his legs stained to the knee with mud, but strangely he seemed almost cheery.  It was a very distinct transformation.  Perhaps there was more to a human than first met the eye.  After eating, we talked until the sun had set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during those first few hours of conversation that I realized that I had not picked perhaps the best person to educate me about human society.  The boy said that he only went to town about once a month with his \u201cPa\u201d on his \u201cwagon\u201d pulled by \u201cOl\u2019Daisy.\u201d  However, as I prodded, he revealed an adequate supply of information for my purposes.  Over the course of that second day as well as the next, I gathered from the boy the structure of power in the village as well as the general shape of the feudal system which dominated  the entire region.  Apparently the village was just a tiny offshoot of a large human nation the boy referred to as Lyrond.  \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a proper lord.\u201d The boy said, \u201cWe just have Sir Ronald.\u201d Sir Ronald was what the boy referred to as a \u201cknight\u201d and that he was a \u201cvassal\u201d of a more important human named \u201cLord Dominic\u201d whom the human peasant had never even seen before in his life and yet explained he was forced to give 10% of his pumpkins to each year.  \u201cThat\u2019s the tithe.  We pay it in return for the lord\u2019s protection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet you say that dragons come over the mountains and take people away every couple years or so?\u201d  I grumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had scratched the back of his head,  \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing you can do about dragons really\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned without letting the boy see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the third day now, the novelty of this \u201cadventure\u201d as he called it had apparently begun to wear thin.  After his long lecture about the pumpkins and the \u201cdelicious\u201d things that one can make with them, he asked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, Sir Dragon, I have been a-wonderin when you\u2019re going to be takin\u2019 me home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been drifting into a light doze, but the boy\u2019s question aroused me.  I moved the side of my head closer to him and looked at him with one wide, slit-pupiled eye.  When I\u2019d determined that he was sufficiently cowed, I said, \u201cSoon, perhaps tomorrow.  I have much to think about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a long time.  The camp fire burned low, but the boy did not move to put more wood on it.  The trees swayed gently in the breeze around us.  The human boy broke the quiet,  \u201cWill you be killing a lot of people when you return?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head back towards him.  Never once in the past three days had he asked a question of my motives or my purpose here.  He\u2019d been compliant and forth coming in my interrogation and satisfied with small talk about the weather on the plains beyond the mountains and the nature of the beasts who lived there to fill the small hours.  I didn\u2019t know what to think about the question, but I answered truthfully, \u201cI may, but I would rather not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy twisted his hands like snakes in his lap and looked down at the ground,  \u201cDo you think you might not kill my family or burn down my Pa\u2019s house or the barn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed at the wretched state of the human beside me.  \u201cI promise not to kill your family or destroy your funckin farn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human snorted at my mangling of his speech and relaxed at last.  He tore into the last of his steak on his stick and I spread my wings to depart for one last night.  Tomorrow, I was sure, would be an exciting day for the both of us.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to be well rested and not weighed down with a belly full of meat in case there was to be fighting done.  However, I did not expect there to be any bloodshed today\u2026 except possibly one human, depending on how pigheaded he was.  Stretching my wings, the leather between the long, bat-like digits drew taut in a gust of sprightly mountain air.  It tickled the tiny hair-like scales that covered the surface of the membrane and gave me the information I needed about the capricious air currents.  I threw back my head and drew in a great draught of the air into my lungs.  On a whim, I expelled it in a massive roar that echoed far up and down the valley.  Before me, on the opposite side of the vale, an avalanche started from the still frozen heights and tumbled down to the brown rocks below.  The sight filled me with satisfaction.  This would indeed be my territory\u2026 my home\u2026 at last.  The winds lifted me up and carried me far from my perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasted no time on pleasantries.  My blood was hot with excitement and I was ready to start what I\u2019d come here to do.  The lad emerged from his makeshift den, I noticed that somehow he had managed to clean most of the dirt from his skin and had straightened his hair somewhat.  As I touched down, he braced himself for the shockwave in the ground and then raised a hand, saying \u201cGood morning, Sir Dragon.  What\u2019s fo-\u201cThat\u2019s as far as he got before I reached out and grabbed him  around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started screaming again, so I paused in my preparations for flight to say, \u201cI thought you wanted to go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man stopped wiggling between my fingers, each of which was thicker around than his waist.  \u201cTruly?  You are taking me home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed raggedly.  Why humans insisted on repeating the obvious, I\u2019ll never know.  Or perhaps it was just this one.  \u201c\u2026At least for a short time.\u201d  I said.  \u201cYou must not appear as you are when we are to meet Sir Ronald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-meet Sir Ronald!?  But-\u201c  His words were cut off by the rushing air as I jumped into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about an hour\u2019s flight to arrive back at the outskirts of the village from whence I had first plucked my unwilling minion.  I flew low over the trees to avoid the freezing heights for which the human was ill equipped and hugged him to my chest to further warm him.  Still the passage was apparently trying for the lad for when I touched down in the woods outside his home, he was shivering and his hide had taken on a strange blue hue about the cheeks.  I was intrigued by the human\u2019s capacity to change color and wanted to inquiry more about its abilities, but I knew I had made a huge ruckus crashing in among the trees, breaking several beneath my bulk as I landed.  I loosed the human, but kept him penned between my chest and an outstretched leg.  He seemed to prefer the warmth as well and made no attempt at a premature escape.  As he was rubbing his hands together, I said, \u201cYou will go inside and change into the best set of clothes you have.  You\u2019ve told me that important humans dress nicely, so you must appear as important as you can.  Clean yourself as well\u2026\u201d I added, I still had not accustomed my nose to the rank stink of stale sweat that permeated the air about the young man like a miasma.  \u201cAnd be quick about it.  Do not force me to come in after you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy swallowed.  \u201cI\u2019ve been gone four days.  My folks will be sore as ferrets in a sack when they see me.  They might not let me come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen lie to them.  Or tell them the truth.  It matters not.  Just make sure you come out if you want to avoid having the roof ripped off your house.\u201d I said, eager to be off and execute my plan for conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked away, seeming to appraise my forelegs which blocked his escape route.  He spoke, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m feeling very unsure, Sir Dragon.  You\u2019ve been asking me all these questions, but I don\u2019t even know what you plan to do or what I\u2019m supposed to do.  You haven\u2019t even told me your name, or asked me mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lips slipped up from my rows of fangs at the little beast\u2019s impudence.  But I lowered them, smoothing the skin on my muzzle, trying to remain calm.  It was \u2013 perhaps \u2013 a reasonable comment on my treatment of him.  I tried to imagine what it was like to be in his position, but empathy was not a skill that came naturally to me; or any dragon really.  I rested my chin on my leg and tilted the side of my face down towards the young man who was standing firmly despite being surrounded by more than three-thousand pounds of dragon-flesh.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the boy asked, clearly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teeth flashed again and I said with a slight hiss, \u201cTell me what your name isss, if it\u2019s ssso important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human lad seemed off-put by my sudden escalation in \u201cin-humanness\u201d but answered, \u201cT-tobias.  Tobias Harrison.\u201d  Staring up at my slit eye with its angry yellow iris, it must have taken some courage to ask, \u201cSo, what is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t react with anger at the impudence of the boy.  Rather, I chuckled, the sound rumbling out from deep inside my chest.  When I finished, I said, \u201cI have several names\u2026 Tobias.  And none of them are for you or any other human to know.\u201d  Besides, I reflected, the human with his lack of nose and the sophisticated vocal apparatus of the dragon would never be able to pronounce any of them.  I saw something shine in the lad\u2019s eyes, some emotion I was unfamiliar with, so I added in recompense, \u201cYou may continue calling me Sir Dragon, if you wish, or just Sir, or My Lord.  If I decide I need a name amongst your kind, I shall tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough\u2026 Sir Dragon.\u201d Said Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed and I gestured with my nose towards the farm where Tobias lived.  He finally remembered my task for him and I moved my leg as he turned to run through the trees towards the cottage.  \u201cReturn with all the haste you can.\u201d  I reminded him as he disappeared between the trunks. I curled up, completing the destruction my landing had caused to the forest with a few corrective swipes of my tail to the broken trunks partially under me.  I kicked them aside so I could rest more comfortably.  The small clearing I\u2019d made would take years to repair.  I wondered if anyone save me would even remember this place in time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shaft of sunlight coming down from the hole I\u2019d punched in the canopy above created crisp shadows which moved as the morning progressed into midday.  The sun on my back slowly warmed my skin and I felt my anger slowly warming as well as the minutes flew by.  I realized that I had no concept of the length of time it would require for a human to change their outer protective layers.  What if I had asked something of the boy - Tobias, I remembered - that would require most of the day?  But somehow, I just felt that he shouldn\u2019t be taking this long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt noon, I decided to uphold my promise.  whatever had happened, Tobias was going to wish he\u2019d done more to keep his preparations short as I\u2019d instructed.  Branches bent and snapped against my plated shoulders as I pushed my way through the forest.  My armored skin hardly registered the abuse, but I knew I would pay with the discomfort of sticky sap later.  The trees crowded around my massive form like the bars of a pen, but my strength was such that I pressed with both my front legs against a forest behemoth, pushing against it with the raw power of my back and hind legs until the roots emerged from the soil on my side and the whole tree began to lean.  I stopped once I had enough room to pass.  I\u2019d probably condemned the tree to an early death in some future storm, but I had no desire to slay something that had grown huge and ancient just as dragons can become huge and ancient with enough luck and cleverness on their part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy claws sank deep into plowed soil as I spied the farmer\u2019s cottage.  From Tobias\u2019s description, I knew that the parallel furrows in the ground were important for planting and the proper distribution of water, however, there was no way for me to cross the field without flattening the design and leaving my giant tracks in my wake.  I consoled myself with the fact that I wouldn\u2019t be here if Tobias had returned to me on time and proceeded onwards towards the little wooden dwelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI studied the strange artificial structure as I plodded across the muddy field.  It was true, most dragons, including my dam and sire were naturalists, meaning that they lived very close to nature, hunting, sleeping and being content with the life of a sky-born predator, never seeking for themselves anything more grand than a nice warm cave or den.  Other dragons, many of whom I\u2019d roosted with temporarily as I\u2019d journeyed in my exile were opulent to the extreme, digging out massive complexes in the mountain or constructing large open air plazas which were easily accessible and more easily constructed if they didn\u2019t offer the same kind of security as a mountain stronghold.  I\u2019d seen several wonders, at least in passing; most dragons were willing to accommodate a lone male for a couple days as long as one didn\u2019t overstay their welcome.  Thus, I was not dazzled by the humble structure.  I noticed the logs that made up its outer walls and the bundled hay of the roof.  It all looked... exceedingly flammable.  I imagined that once I was the master of this place, I might encourage the construction of more sensible stone houses with tile roofs such as I\u2019d seen in other lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was just outside the human dwelling, the size of which was hardly larger than my ribcage, I was surprised at the lack of activity.  I could smell the human presence, at least five distinct odors at cursory examination.  Did they imagine that if they ignored me, I would leave?  I huffed a thin stream of smoke from my nostrils.  The fastest way to get them out of the house was surely to cough up a small glob of fire onto the roof... but I\u2019d promised Tobias I wouldn\u2019t destroy his home...  I settled for grabbing the thatch roof as I\u2019d warned him I would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting on my haunches, upper body uplifted for the task of opening the little wooden den when there was a loud crash from inside the house and sudden shouting.  I caught snippets of \u201cNo!\u201d and \u201c...rip the roof off!\u201d and then \u201cDragon!\u201d  A human female was crying and then there was the bawling of multiple younger humans.  There was another crash and a wooden thud then fast steps on the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door at the foot of the cottage bust open and a stout silver-haired human, taller and much wider at the shoulder than Tobias rushed out roaring.  In the man\u2019s hands was a very large crossbow complete with double wings and an iron winch for drawing it back as well as great axe slung on his back.  Tobias had mentioned that his father had been a successful war veteran in his youth...  the man took aim.  I began to turn my body, ready to stomp this little ant into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA window burst open on the second level of the cottage and Tobias\u2019 upper body emerged.  \u201cStop! don\u2019t do it!\u201d he was shouting and I realized he was looking at his father.  I paused, holding my claw in the air.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I moved my hand just in time, catching the large bolt in the fleshy pad between my thumb and first finger.  With the range less than fifteen feet, the heavy crossbow packed enough power to punch through the scales on my palm.  Ruby dragon-blood - distinct for its particles of metallic sparkle - welled up around the wound.  Hissing more from shock than pain, I eyed my opponent evilly.  The human clearly knew what he was aiming for.  If I hadn\u2019t blocked the projectile, it would have punctured my neck-heart, the muscular complex of valves under my throat whose purpose was to keep me conscious while suffering high gravity forces resulting from fast speed aerial maneuvers.  Injuring it would likely not have killed me outright, but would have resulted in excessive bleeding and a high possibility of losing consciousness as well as incapacitating me in general for at least a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality of injury resulting from this insect raised my fervor.  My tail moved for my while I was studying the effect the human weapon had had on my hand.  The sharp arrow head came down, blade first and as wide as the human was tall, as the silver-furred human was winding up his contraption.  With surprising nimbleness, he dodged, dropping his crossbow which crunched with a satisfying <i>twang</i> under my tail.  Rolling, Tobas\u2019 father came upright with his great axe in his hands.  It was baffling what he thought to accomplish now that his projectile weapon was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was running towards my underbelly and after studying him for just a moment, I lifted my tail and brought it back down, flat side first like a club. The human dodged, but the impact on the ground clearly threw him off balance.  It didn\u2019t matter either way, however.  I had moved my claw in anticipation for his dodge and now I grabbed his about his stout midsection.  One arm remained free, but his weapon was pinned against his side.  The fight was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias was now yelling for me not to slay his father from his window.  I raised the little human attacker, still struggling against my grip and cursing all the while, to face his son.  One part of me imagined closing my hand until Tobias\u2019 father was reduced to paste between my fingers.  I might not have resisted temptation if I wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice the time I had spent habituating Tobias to my presence.  Lowering my head to be level with the second story window of the house and with Tobias.  \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, your father\u2019s life is forfeit.\u201d I said, gesturing with my nose and shaking the stout human a little for emphasis; he pounded his fist against my finger and even tried biting on my scales, still cursing and promising retribution if I laid a claw on his family.  \u201cThe only reason he remains alive at this moment is because you and I have unfinished business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!  Leave my son out of this, Beast!\u201d shouted the man in my claw and I wished I had a means of silencing him except the obvious permanent way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias yelled from the widow with surprising force.  \u201cShut your talk hole, Pa!  You\u2019re making it worse!  I told you there was nothing you could do, so be quiet now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father\u2019s eyes bugged open and I deduced that Tobias had never spoken to him like that before.  \u201cSir.\u201d the young man said, addressing me now. \u201cPlease spare my Pa, he\u2019s old and stubborn as a mule and won\u2019t listen to reason when it spits in his face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my claws weren\u2019t skewering the older human, he son\u2019s words were from what I could tell of the expression on his face.  Still, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t abide a human trying to kill me and living.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias\u2019 face screwed up as if he were about to burst into tears, but then he spoke with a sudden resolve,  \u201cA trade then, Sir Dragon.  My life for his.  I\u2019ll be your servant for the rest of my life if only you\u2019ll let him go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTobias!  Don\u2019t you g-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said to shut it Pa!  It\u2019s my decision.  I\u2019ll tie you down to the wagon and ship you to the capital if that\u2019s what it takes to keep you alive!  You\u2019ve done enough already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older human subsided into silence and even ceased his struggles.  One wouldn\u2019t be able to tell by looking that he was in the clutches of an enormous dragon; he was in his own world of conflicted hurt, rage and compassion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father locked me in the attic when I told him where I\u2019d been for the last few days and what I was going to do.  J-just hold him for a minute.  I\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d The young human disappeared from the window and I was left outside sitting awkwardly on my haunches with a human who\u2019d tried to kill me in my paw for several minutes.  I looked down at the scruffy man, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my gaze.  I had nothing to say to him and he evidently had nothing for me either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some more excitement from inside the cottage, an argument between one of the females inside and Tobias.  Eventually my erstwhile companion emerged from the house.  The silver-haired man began to struggle again, not in order to kill me, but seemingly to kill his son.  \u201cMy Regiment cloak!  and my Uniform!  You get your cheeks out of those before I tan your arse, boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias did not fill out his father\u2019s clothes very well, but the quality of the fabric was in another class entirely from what I had seen of these farmers so far.  Fashioned of thick wool died a dark green fringed with brown, the uniform was decorated with brass buttons and emblems as well as several emblems attached to the outfit with needles behind.  Tobias removed these and reverently placed them on the window sill.  I hoped that the dress would not have implications for Sir Ronald beyond my intentions, but there was no doubt that Tobias was dressed sharply enough to be my mediator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Tobias\u2019 offer went, I was still uncertain.  I had been expecting continued service from the young human already, so it seemed that he was getting something for service already offered, but I did not want to waste anymore time discussing the matter right now.  I lowered Tobias\u2019 father to the ground, but did not release him yet.  \u201cI cannot allow a dragon-slayer to live in my territory, but we can discuss the matter later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias nodded, deliberately not looking at his father who had fallen silent with his son\u2019s cold refusal to answer.  \u201cAgreed.\u201d he said and walked over to my free paw.  I opened it and he climbed on, staying gratefully clear of the arrow which punctured it.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be welcome home again soon, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help but notice the enormous amount of trust Tobias was putting in me nor the level of sacrifice already demanded of him.  I wondered if there was more to his motivation than simply keeping his family safe.  I released the older man and he strode stiffly into the cottage before slamming the door so hard that the hinges broke and it hung askew.  More cursing erupted from inside.  I lifted the young man to my chest, mindful of his placement in regards to the bolt lodged in my flesh and made ready to fly.  Strangely, I was stirred to say, \u201cThis will end in your favor, Tobias.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the lad responded, \u201cI know... M\u2019lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wings snapped as they drew taut.  The wind from my wings cause the small metal bits Tobias had taken from the uniform to tumble to the dirt as we departed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone knew where Sir Ronald lived, according to Tobias.  The lad had explained that the knight\u2019s estate was once an outpost when the area had been pure wilderness.  It was still pretty much in the middle of nowhere and as close as anyone would willingly live to the so-called \u201cDragon Wastes\u201d as the human boy termed my country.  Considering its history, it was not surprising to find that it was the only fortified structure for a hundred miles in any direction.  Tobias had said that a chest high stone wall encompassed the estate, one of the first additions when the area had first been colonized to the old outpost.  Tobias knew nothing of the interior of the estate which was not surprising given his own limited contact with the other villagers.  He only knew that, in case of emergency, the estate was the place to gather should the village itself become unsafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up high, it was easy to see that whatever defense the estate offered, it would not be adequate to fend against a dragon, even one much smaller than myself.  Behind the wall, there were subdivisions of the fields, two seemed to be in use for planting while the rest of the space had animals roaming across it, horses mostly, but also some sheep; they were left to intermingle.  As for the estate building, Tobias had described it as though it were the peak of opulence and I supposed it was\u2026 for a frontier shack.  Three stories tall, the wooden building was cleanly built  and had only small windows.  The manor was expansive, though I doubted there was, in fact, enough room for all the humans in the village in case of true emergency.  The roof was not thatch at least.  I occupied myself as we flew off to the side with the image of the place burning to the ground and a more suitable den being constructed in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I touched down in the woods outside the wall, I could not help but let out a hiss as Tobias jostled the bolt in my hand as he jumped down.  He muttered an apology I barely heard.  When I was down, I crouched, my paw to my face and gnawed at the bolt, worrying it with my teeth like a splinter; which was an apt comparison.  However while the shaft quickly split, the head remained buried in my palm.  I cursed the fact that I had not eaten the man who\u2019d caused me this pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh\u2026\u201d  I heard Tobias say and immediately, I wanted to vent my frustration on the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I snapped, smoke curling from my nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy display was enough to make Tobias back off a few steps.  \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve got blood on me\u2026 your blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted with a sharp intake of breath, immediately focused.  \u201cCome here.\u201d  I said with some urgency and the boy complied.  With a quick sniff, I smelled the blood \u2013 my dragon-blood \u2013 splattered over his dress trousers.  The bright red glistened as if freshly spilled, the metallic specks sparkling despite the gloom under the trees.  \u201cHold still.\u201d  I said and extended my tongue.  If it was unnerving to have a large, hot \u2013 and probably smelly \u2013 tongue the size of your body slick across your legs, the boy shut his eyes and showed no sign of it.  In one stroke, the trousers were left completely clean, if a little damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias shook the loose pants which were the right length, if rather large about the waist for him.  He said with wide eyes,  \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, I thought they were stained for good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted again and said out of hand, \u201cLike seeks like.  My blood knows where it belongs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lad rubbed his chin which was scruffy with incomplete growth of his brown hair.  \u201cThey say that a man who drinks dragon blood with become twice as strong as an ox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, \u201cThey say a lot of things about dragon blood.\u201d  I turned my gaze down on the small human and raised a claw, pushing against his chest with the smooth side of one talon.  \u201cBut all you need to know is that if I hadn\u2019t just removed my blood from you, it would have poisoned you by nightfall.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you have a fever tonight just from that little exposure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias quickly removed his hands from his trousers.  \u201cReally?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, I was more than happy to assure him.  \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d  I lied.  I knew for a fact that my blood was not poisonous to humans\u2026 in the traditional sense of the term.  But dragon-blood had deeply misunderstood properties and it was just best to leave it were it belonged.  Dark were those who tinkered with it, be they alchemist, mage or even dragon himself.  Besides, humans did not need another reason to attempt to kill dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to begin elaborating what I wanted Tobias to do, when he spoke first.  \u201cI saw you having trouble with Father\u2019s bolt.  Would you mind if I tried to remove it for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the boy guardedly, but then laid my palm out for him.  I knew that with his tiny little hands, each of which was far more nimble than my own clumsy paws, he stood a good chance of removing the biting splinter where I\u2019d failed.  Tobias hopped up onto my claw and knelt beside the wound, cautiously distance of the small pool of dragon blood at the base of the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d the boy soon cursed after a quick tug on the remaining shaft.  He cleaned his hand with alacrity, using a small handkerchief.  \u201cMy father used a steel serrated edge.  I\u2019ll have to make a small cut to get it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave it.\u201d I said, \u201cI can deal with it later. Let\u2019s-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias interrupted me, yelling over my deep, forceful voice.  \u201cPlease!  Let me help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answered by relaxing my shoulders and peering off into the woods.  I noticed however, when the boy drew the sword at his hip from the decorative scabbard.  My eye widened in surprise.  Again noticing my reaction, Tobias said, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I have\u2026  It\u2019s just a decorative sword, but my Pa sharpens anything in the house with an edge on it.  Just look away a moment, I\u2019ve done this before\u2026\u201d  I rested my head on the ground away from the operation.  I heard Tobias mutter under his breath, \u201c\u2026on deer carcasses.\u201d  I sighed raggedly and closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt pressure as Tobias first tried cutting against the scale, but evidently my armor defeated the blade because he withdrew without tugging on the bolt head.  He then manipulated the cut and I felt a fresh stab of pain as he inserted the blade along a crack in the scale.  It was a monumental effort to keep my hand still.  No one had ever treated any of my wounds since I had emerged from my egg.  It was an alien experience and, surprisingly, a little frightening.  \u201cJust hold still. I\u2019m pulling it out!\u201d  shouted Tobias.  I clenched my teeth and saw stars beneath my heavy eye lids.  I hissed and growled and pulled my hand away, but Tobias was already clear.  I saw him chuck the bloody bolt head into the woods and wipe his hands again on his cloth.  I took a few deep breaths and flexed my hand, the pain was already fading.  The blood, though liquid, densely clung to the small wound and it would scab nicely.  The single broken scale would fall out and be replaced without any visible sign in time.  I grunted in acknowledgement to my improved state.  \u201cCome close and I shall tell you what you are to do\u2026\u201d  I said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tobias approached the front gate following the wall to his left.  He felt foolish tramping through the forest undergrowth in his father\u2019s war regalia.  How many people had his father killed while wearing this?  \u2018None,\u2019 Tobias chided himself, \u2018It\u2019s a ceremonial uniform.  He never wore it into battle.\u2019  He pushed a branch out of the way from his face.  Even with the dragon far behind, he still felt as if it were breathing on the back of his neck.  He rubbed his palms together; they still felt slick, as if the blood of the dragon had left some residue on them.  However, no amount of rubbing would clean them.  Tobias lifted the back of his hand to his forehead.  Did he feel warm?  Was he feverish?  The young man hoped he wasn\u2019t poisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias stopped walking and forced himself to take a few deep breaths.  He closed his eyes and leaned against the trunk of a tree.  The last few days had been more exciting than the rest of his life put together.  Despite his youth, he felt as if his nerves were becoming frayed.  What was he doing?  He was planning on marching to the front of the gate and just asking to be let in?  What sort of plan was that?  Tobias wondered why he was even listening to that crazy, ungrateful dragon who just expected him to do everything he commanded out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026But he knew why, deep down.  Because the dragon was offering him something that his father and the pumpkin farm never could.  Tobias was willing to sacrifice everything to escape the path that had been set for him by his father, no matter how nebulous and uncertain the reward happened to be.  Tobias forced himself not to think of his father as he pushed his way through the last of the branches.  He didn\u2019t want to face the gateman in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026And where did you say you lived, there lad?\u201d asked the solitary gateman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the second time that he had asked the question and Tobias gritted his teeth, biting back a smart remark.  \u201cThat\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter.  I have an urgent message for Sir Ronald.  I need to see him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall man leaned down a bit to be more level with Tobias.  He grinned conspiratorially, \u201cHey now\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just tell me that message and I\u2019ll make sure ol\u2019 Sir Ronald hears it in full.\u201d  The Gateman obviously thought that this \u201cmessenger\u201d was some village brat trying to play a practical joke.  Such behavior was usually overlooked amongst the youth, expected and sometimes encouraged in fact; at least among the males.  Tobias didn\u2019t know if there was anything he could say that would convince the man that he was not playing a joke.  The dragon\u2019s plan had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly a flawed plan from the start if the dragon expected that an ill-fitting uniform from the last great war would be enough to get him past the gate.  Still, Tobias felt that somehow the failure rested on his shoulders as well for not performing to expectation.  Another man, perhaps, one smarter and taller than he would have managed to get past the very first obstacle.  Tobias groaned.  \u201cSir, don\u2019t make me do something that I\u2019ll regret.\u201d He said, pleading with the Gateman with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gateman took a wary look to the decorative sword at Tobias\u2019 side.  Casually, he rested a hand on his own sword hilt, unadorned and all business, and peered off into the forest behind the young man.  \u201cJoke\u2019s over.  I think it\u2019s time you call your buddies and go home, young\u2019in\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias stared at the ground.  \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d  He gave the signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been waiting in the woods for the shrill whistle longer than I had been expecting.  How much time did Tobias intend to spend yammering with the humans guarding the gate?  I was eager to make my appearance at last.  Of course I didn\u2019t expect Tobias to get past the gate without some prompting of the guards.  However, I was uncertain that my existence remained unknown.  I may have been spotted at some point since my arrival and certainly I had not been very cautious in my flights today.  If it were the case that rumors had reached the estate already, a sudden \u201cmessanger\u201d emerging from the woods would likely be given some credit, or at least ushered in hastily for questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the leadership of the human community remained ignorant, however.  I stretched my wings, breaking branches above me.  I flexed the large flight muscles stretching down my rib cage, attaching my wings to the support of my breast bone.  I was ready for my debut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlapping my way forward low over the tree tops, I burst forward over the fields of the estate, roaring my claim of the area.  Beasts and humans alike scattered, running for shelter.  Spying a slow moving old mare, I angled myself down, landing hard and snapping the horse\u2019s back in the process.  I let my tail drag in the dirt and walked heavily, leaving footprints for all to see.  I lifted the dead horse and savagely bit off its head, letting the blood go where it would across the ground.  I roared again, loud enough to shatter three windows in the wall facing me.  I did not stay to meet an armed human response party, instead lifting off, carrying the treat of the plump mare with me.  I thought that the men at the gate would be more interested in what Tobias had to say now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew a fair distance, eating the delicious horse on the way.  The humans would need to take horses to find me in a reasonable time, but Tobias knew where we had arranged to meet.  It was better than remaining close and encouraging an attack rather than parley.  On a rocky hill, I found a shelf of stone protruding from the treeless prominent.  I was tired of breaking my way through branches anyway.  Settling down, I had my fill of horse, but was left wanting.  Those herds of flesh-beasts danced through my thoughts as I waited.  Especially the big, fat slow moving ones with the black and white hides.  I licked my chops; there would be a future for beef and dairy farmers in this province.  I closed my eyes, listening to the sounds of the forest.  I knew it was going to be a long wait this time.  I would soon find out if Tobias would be a capable enough servant to keep around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dragons are very capable of remaining still for very long periods of time.  In fact, most large dragons hibernate for extended periods throughout their lives.  The heart slows, breaths become deeper and more prolonged.  The eye lids droop down but don\u2019t close entirely.  I closed my water lids for comfort\u2019s sake, making the world blurry, but eliminating the need to blink every so often.  I preferred to listen.  My muscles relaxed, my body becoming still as stone, but feeling as though I were drifting slowly, perhaps rotating slowly through a vast loop.  Time stretched out ahead of me, but I remained lucidly aware of my surroundings.  Sometimes while doing this, I fancied myself a rock on a hill, watching the world and the creatures fly by, the trees reach up to the sky and then fall.  The sensation of permanency was soothing.  I could not imagine what it would be like to lead a mortal life, with death hanging over one\u2019s head, the only prize for a marathon of hardship and suffering.  Not to say that I couldn\u2019t die or wouldn\u2019t die someday, but for me, that day lay centuries, perhaps millennia in the future.  It was safe enough to consider myself immortal for the time being, even very old dragons often had the illusion of continuing forever\u2026 they usually went insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting as I was, it was not long before the sun set.  The night then past with the same accelerated momentum.  My scent should have repelled the local wildlife, but once a fox came sniffing about, scurrying from rock to rock in an orange blur.  With a great amount of finesse, it hopped onto the back of my paw like it was nothing more than a strange, bronze boulder and leaped to a higher shelf, disappearing soon after.  I felt where it had planted its paws on my skin until morning came.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the light, I felt the urge to stand and stretch; an older dragon might have been able to remain days, months, even years in the trance.  I yawned massively, spreading my wings until they brushed against trees to either side of the small hill.  I hadn\u2019t slept, not truly, but the meditation had provided me with some rest.  I supposed I was foolish for thinking the humans might arrive in the middle of the night, but then I hadn\u2019t wanted to be unprepared should the knight\u2019s men have interrogated Tobias and decided to ambush me rather than negotiate their surrender.  I wondered what Sir Ronald thought of my terms.  I hoped I had crafted them well, considering my knowledge of humans and the incomplete knowledge of the man Tobias was able to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Ronald had received this fiefdom as something of a joke apparently.  He had disgraced himself in the war, something to do with being fooled by a spy and getting a lot of men killed\u2026 I didn\u2019t understand Tobias\u2019 description.  At any rate, he retired early rather than face dishonorable discharge.  Because he was a nobleman by birth, Sir Ronald was not the sort of man who can simply disappear or be gotten rid of, nor was he the sort to desire ambiguousness even after his incompetence had been demonstrated on the field.  Thus he was appeased by being made lord of this frontier village.  Apparently, he wasn\u2019t well pleased with his charge.  He had little to no contact with the villagers and almost never left the estate except to go hunting in his own private woods where it was forbidden for others to walk on pain of losing their left hand.  It was well known, even to those who weren\u2019t veterans, that Sir Ronald was a coward at heart.  With these facts in mind, I had crafted the terms to the man who would become my subordinate or perish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the morning when I heard them coming, heard the hoofbeats pummeling the earth and felt them through the pads in my feet.  I had been looking for the little fox who had continued hanging about the area, but upon detecting the humans, I stood and walked back to the stony outcrop.  I reclined my body for maximum display given the direction they would have to approach.  I would be elevated for the interview, my long tail draping the distance from the shelf to the ground.  I planted what I thought was a serene expression on my face and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I\u2019d instructed, the party was small and on horseback.  The first human I saw was Tobias, leading the others behind him. He was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They wore green cloaks over leather armor and were obviously skilled in woodcraft.  The first volley caught me by surprise.  The hail of steel-tiped bolts rained down on my, punching clean through my wing membrane in several places, leaving tiny holes that barely bled.  Of more concern were the ones that hit my body.  Most were deflected, naturally, by my scaly hide, several, however punched in where they hit at the right angle or lodged themselves between scales.  The needle pricks were barely flesh wounds, but made me want to rush forward and set the forest ablaze around the tiny men who\u2019d dared attack me\u2026  but Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped down as I\u2019d originally intended and heard the second volley bounce off the rocks where I\u2019d been.  I fell a good fifteen feet and landed with a deep thud that I absorbed with all four legs.  I found myself in the midst of several horsemen who immediately turned to flee.  They had only swords with which to defend themselves, not lances.  They\u2019d been a decoy and nothing more.  Turning my head, I saw Tobias\u2019 pony bolting into the woods.  The thing would likely break a leg in its blind fear and end up killing its bound passenger as well as itself.  I stretched forth my tail around the beast and herded it to my claw.  I grabbed it, kicking and screaming and tore the saddle away by inserting a claw under the belt around its chest; some horse meat came away with the tip of my talon, but the point was that I succeeded in freeing my servant unharmed.  As I was placing Tobias on the ground, my claws were too large and unwieldy to free him without hurting him, I took another volley of bolts in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two more stuck in against the heavier plating along my spine and ribs, but the sensation of the bolts hitting me was still unpleasant.  I was done being nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to the air as a screaming phantom, I leaped very high into the air with a single pump of my wings.  I fell, holding the membranes out to slow my descent slightly, expelling huge volumes of burning, oily goo onto my enemies ahead of me.  Despite living near dragon country, it was obvious these men had not faced down the deadly wrath of one of my caliber.  They broke rank as the flames swept through them, burning men and catching the undergrowth and older trees aflame.  I would not suffer any to live however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few men remained, firing their crossbows as fast as they could reload them, either brave, or unaware that their fellows had abandoned them; probably both.  Bolts would bounce against my breast as I charged.  It was quick work.  The men almost always paid attention exclusively to my claws or my snapping jaws; they never watched the tail.  The battle, such as it was, was over in moments, but I was not done.  I leaped into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pointless to chase crafty woodsmen in the woods, especially if you were so large that the trees mostly blocked your path.  I had no intention of chasing them.  Instead, I flew in a circle around the area where the men had retreated, setting fire to the forest as I passed.  Bolts came up through the trees once they realize what I was doing, but they almost never hit their target and when they did, they didn't have the power to punch through my scales.  Delightful screams issued from the burning woods.  Those who managed to return to the rocky hill found my claws and hungry maw waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not wait to devour the corpses despite the fact that I was indeed peckish.  I swallowed only a couple limbs, the parts I had managed to grab with my mouth during the fighting.  When I was sure that the men who\u2019d attacked me were all reduced burned or bloody carcasses, I returned to Tobias who\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I walked stiffly over, the bolts where they pierced my flesh stung more now that the battle rage was passing.  I didn\u2019t ask if he was injured because clearly he was, in addition to the bruises, I could smell blood on him.  I said, \u201cDo you need help with your bindings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias nodded and then started coughing.  It was then that I noticed the milky sheen of smoke in the air.  The fire behind me was now raging well beyond my capacity to control even if I were so inclined as to attempt to put it out.  I didn\u2019t particularly care, though.  What would burn would burn and only a freak rain storm was likely to stop it now.  Though the air was merely a bit dingy to me - dragons, naturally have a good resistance to smoke - apparently it was rough on the human lad as it was on deer and other soft mammalian creatures.  I needed to get my servant away or he would soon perish.  It irked me, however, that I needed to waste time before exacting my revenge on the coward Sir Ronald who foolishly thought to be rid of me with a mere ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered my upturned claw to Tobias.  \u201cI cannot free your little hands.  See if you can use the edge of my talon to break your bonds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias nodded without speaking, his face pressed into his cloak.  He brought his hands, and the saddle, up and began rubbing against the sharp edge of my talon.  I kept it still as he worked.  Eventually the bonds were cut free, but by then the smoke had grown even thicker.  Tobias\u2019 hands dropped weakly to his sides and he was coughing constantly.  Carefully, I cradeled the young man into my claws and carried him upwind and out of the fumes as swiftly as possible.  Below me, the forest was an inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging around, I winged my way back south towards the estate with all possible haste.  I felt every puncture in my wing membrane along the way, but the leather was strong and didn\u2019t rip despite the numerous little holes.  I would need them stitched later and I did not look forward to having the bolts removed my flanks and back either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I landed just inside the cleared fields of the estate, an alarm was raised, but I didn\u2019t care.  Tobias had improved somewhat on the flight over here, but he still looked pale and coughed occasionally.  I set him on the high stone wall and looked him directly in the eye.  I had only a couple moments.  \u201cI want you to witness as I claim this territory.  After today, you shall be the new Knight of Devonshire and I shall be your lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias\u2019 eyes were wide as I made the proclamation.  Behind me, armored men were running to the stables.  The startling passed momentarily, however and was replaced it was a cold determination.  \u201cThis land will be yours, M\u2019lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked, \u201cI already knew that.\u201d  Then I turned, leaving Tobias on his perch on the wall and faced down whatever defense the humans were trying to muster.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I glanced at the manor, lovingly crafted of planks and carved wood, embodying several human generations\u2019 worth of history.  The only thing that stopped me from burning it to the ground was the fact that most of the wealth of the entire region was holed up inside  and would be lost if I were to set it ablaze.  I knew that Sir Ronald was inside there, however, probably curled up in some hole.  \u2018How loyal were his men to a known coward?\u2019  I wondered as the humans at the stables were finishing their preparations and getting on their barded steeds.  Would these men throw themselves before a dragon\u2019s fury while the man who had sent them stayed hidden inside?  I stepped forward as the horsemen were gathering themselves.  They lowered their battle lances, each no less than twelve feet in length, each with more than enough power to punch through dragonscale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting them down, I spoke before they began their charge, speaking loudly enough to be head clear across the field.  \u201cHas the brave Knight Sir Ronald come to rid the land of the dragon menace?  Perhaps all that armor obscures my vision, but I do not see him among you, horsemen!  Don\u2019t tell me that the brave, honest Knight placed all his faith in a few crossbows while he was violating the law of Parley.\u201d  I said in a scathing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horsemen charged in a staggered line.  Seeing as Sir Ronald was the only one here rich enough to afford a full suit of plate armor, these men were dressed mostly in hastily clad leather with chain shirts thrown on top.  The one at the fore of the charge seemed better equipped, his lance was longer and he had steel boots and pauldrons in addition to the simple garb afforded the men.  It took a long time for them to cross the field towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they reached me, I jumped clear over their heads, assisting myself with a couple quick pumps of my wings and landed on the far side of the same field, digging treches into the grassy earth as I came to a stop.  The man at the fore barked some order and the horsemen broke into two groups, left and right.  They were going to try to flank me, perhaps even encircle me.  What they didn\u2019t realize was that a pair of wings beat any mobility advantage their four-legged beasts afforded them.  Poor, foolish humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke again as they ran towards me.  \u201cI suppose the great and important Knight has better things to do than meet his adversary on the field of battle... though I thought that was sort of the whole point of being a Knight.  Was I misinformed?\u201d  I jumped again and landed on some sort of partial shelter put out to shade and water the vanished livestock.    \u201cI can do this all day, though I think I shall soon grow bored of it.\u201d  I said with a mock yawn.  \u201cDon\u2019t run your beasts to death now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses were already tiring, they had been run at a full gallop while carrying heavy, armor-clad men since the start of the fight.  Several were foaming at the mouth as the men pressed them.  I leaped, gliding lazily until I came to a rest a short distance later, the horses were noticeably slowing.  \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Sir Ronald show his face I wonder?  Why does he send other men to die in his place?  He has a habit of doing that I hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a response.  The man leading the horsemen in circles about the estate yelled, \u201cStand still and fight, you monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the man directly.  Though he was a good distance away, I could see the fire burning in his auburn pupils.  I raised a paw to my mouth as if in shock, \u201cBut if I did that, you would all die, I think.  It is not my wish for you to waste your lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were uncertain looks passed around the horsemen.  The one to the leader\u2019s right leaned over and said to him in a voice I\u2019m sure he thought was private, \u201cRichard, let us regroup with Sir Ronald, there\u2019s no point in us being out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, you fool, that\u2019s just what it wants!  Half of you, go around the other side of the manor.\u201d  Answered the man in charge.  The men did as they were commanded, though they obviously lacked enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one group heading around the property clockwise and the other in the opposite direction, I would have been forced to fly to opposite sides of the estate in succession.  While within my capabilities, I decided to be a little more forthright.  I set claws wide on the turf and lowered my shoulders aggressively as I faced the second group, apparently ready to charge and finally meet lances with my claws and teeth.  Fools, fools.  Though I had but a little fire left, it would have been sufficient to break their charge and send their horses into a panic.  I didn\u2019t do that, however.  Instead, at the last moment, I whipped my tail out whilst turning.  the blade went down and dug into the turf.  I pulled the arrowhead along, leaving a decently wide furrow in the soil behind as I leaped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard called out, \u201cStop you fools!\u201d  but it was too late.  Half the men\u2019s horses stumbled on the narrow trench, their legs breaking.  They went down, throwing the men off at high speed or worse, tumbling on top of them.  The groans of the injured and the screaming of maimed horses reached my ears.  The remaining horsemen quickly dismounted to help their comrades and put horses out of their misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew, winging my way back behind Richard\u2019s reduced formation.  I called down from the air, \u201cStop this senseless fighting.  Bring me Sir Ronald.  I have no interest in harming the rest of you.  Bring me the villain who broke the common rules of Parley.  Bring me the coward who hides in his house while sending men to kill me.  Don\u2019t spend your lives on such a wretched man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard turned his horse about to face me where I\u2019d landed.  Defeat hung heavy in his eyes, seeming almost to be a weight that threatened to break the man.  He finally realized that he had no hope of success here.  He then...</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d made a fool of him this day, but it couldn\u2019t have ended any other way, the men had no ranged weapons and we were in a wide open field.  The advantage of flight alone was enough to make this fight one-sided.  I landed a good distance away and this time, Richard and his horsemen didn\u2019t charge.  I spared a glance to the spectator I left on the wall.  Tobias was watching with a wide grin on his face, clearly impressed.  I was happy to deliver as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the moment of uncertainty, I spoke again loudly, my voice ringing clearly across the distance separating us.  \u201cGo inside and fetch Ronald from his hole.  I will give him one last chance to accept my terms of surrender.  He has five minutes before I begin ripping the house apart log by log.\u201d  I sat on my haunches and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, ever so slowly and without a word to his companions, Richard, my brief, but ineffective combatant turned his steaming horse about and trotted it to the nearest door on the manor.  Dropping off his horse, he clomped his way inside without bothering to close the door behind him.  The rest of the men stared at me, their glances meek and full of fear.  Of the men who\u2019d fallen into my trap, six were on the ground nursing injuries.  One was either dead or knocked out cold.  Seeing as these men too would shortly be coming under my command, I decided to speak again.  \u201cYou all remember tonight when you are home with your families that I could have easily ended all of your lives today.  I am not the sort who throws away life without cause, unlike other certain individuals who would rather kill than negotiate.  I am not here to burn or terrorize.  I\u2019m here to make a home for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man shouted, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make your home somewhere else, Dragon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned toothily, \u201cA fair question, but one that could only be answered with a selfish answer.  I came here to prosper and nothing more.  Is that any different from most humans?  We are not so different I think.\u201d  Ah, I had progressed far in my days of human interaction.  The sweaty men looked almost half convinced by my words.  Let them return to their miserable little hovels, I\u2019d say anything to keep them docile for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard spared me from further speechmaking.  Half assisting, half pushing a man out of the house, I finally laid eyes on Sir Ronald.  The man was actually not much to look at.  I had been half expecting him to be larger than the normal variety of human, as dragon elders grew to massive size in the scope of time.  If Sir Ronald were larger, however, it was only in the size of his middle.  He did not wear armor, in fact he was dress in nice silk robes, richer and shinier than even Tobias\u2019 now ruined uniform.  A long black mustache adorned his wide, sweaty face and his eyes darted about to and fro.  He almost knocked over Richard when he saw me, attempting to flee back into the manor house.  The taller man stood firm and push his liege-lord forward.  I got to my feet and walked forward a few steps.  Richard was all but restraining the man now as they argued feistily under each other\u2019s breath.  I stopped short and said, \u201cI would have my charge witness this negotiation.\u201d  I gestured to the wall where Tobias sat watching the entire affair.  \u201cBut only if I receive a guarantee of his safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men wrestled, Richard\u2019s hands on Sir Ronald\u2019s shoulders.  They were both hissing at each other.  Sir Ronald grew still and Richard shouted, \u201cSir Ronald guarentee\u2019s Tobias\u2019 safety.  But if you will, come no closer and allow us to approach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an answer, I rested easily onto my belly.  The once pristine lawn was torn to shreds by the fight I\u2019d had with the mounted men.  Sir Ronald was an incalculable fool for deciding to stay and fight.  If he had truly been intent on resisting me, he should have taken his men into the woods and waged guerilla warfare on me as I tried to assert control on the region.  Never mind that now, I\u2019d take an easy victory as well as a hard one.  The humans approached, Tobias from the field, Richard and Sir Ronald around the house.  The horsemen who were able to walk gathered closer as well\u2026 but not too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small twist of my hand, I invited Tobias to come and sit on my wrist.  The two noblemen stood at a more respectful distance.  I had an odd inclination to call for chairs and refreshments, but I thought that might be too much for my two opponents to handle.  Besides I wanted nothing between me and Sir Ronald.  My wings were mantled carefully as they had been this morning on my shelf of rock in the forest; I supposed the image might have been ruined somewhat by the black feathered bolt shafts protruding from my hide at various angles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Ronald stood with his arms crossed.  He didn\u2019t look at me, but rather at the grass between my feet.  I started, \u201cDid you even listen to the terms I had Tobias deliver for me before beating him into a pulp?\u201d  My voice came out harsh, I was actually more upset now about the young man\u2019s bruises than the steel headed shafts embedded in my flesh; the men who had done that had paid their debts already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Ronald was quiet for a long time.  I realized after a few moments that he was shaking, his hands bundled into fists, either from fear or anger; probably both.  Richard sighed and spoke for his lord in a way that suggested he had done it before.  \u201cAfter your\u2026 \u2018display\u2019 in the yard, we quickly let Tobias in and he gave the terms you offered\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat brat is a traitor to his own kind!\u201d  Sir Ronald burst forth.  Tobias winced and my teeth flashed, bit Sir Ronald continued, \u201cThat\u2026 that mongrel had the nerve to come into <i>my</i> house and say such things to my face!  He deserves to have his fingernails ripped out and his hands crushed!  He\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard grabbed the chubby noble by the shoulder and spun him around to face him, the lieutenant\u2019s eyes darting to my parted fangs.  \u201cNow is not the time\u2026 my lord\u2026\u201d he said amongst more hushed words.  Sir Ronald seemed to calm somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight brushed off his suit as easily as his apparent temper.  \u201cI found your terms to be unacceptable.  There is nothing in the village charter that allows succession entirely from the rest of Lyrond.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was growing tired of talking to this arrogant human.  There was only one way for this to end, the man had to know that.  \u201cIs that why you deemed fit to send two-dozen crossbowmen to my place of Parley this morning instead of appearing yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe laws of Parley do not apply to beasts such as yourself!\u201d  Sir Ronald shouted.  He seemed ready to launch into another tirade, but I noticed that Richard seemed immediately distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty-four men\u2026\u201d he muttered.  Quick as a flash, he rounded on the Knight-noble and interrupted his hot words.  \u201cWhich part of the woods did Brian go hunting in this morning?\u201d  he asked Sir Ronald with a deadly intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Ronald\u2019s eyes were darting about again and he seemed to forget all about the towering dragon in front of him.  \u201cWhy\u2026  why the east woods of course.  Why do you ask such a thing at a time like-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard gathered his fist and struck the Knight soundly across the cheek with the exclamation \u201cLiar!\u201d  Sir Ronald fell flat on his back and Richard planted his knees on his chest.  Tears were streaming from Richard\u2019s eyes as he lifted his face up to mine.  \u201cTell me, Beast.  What became of the men who attacked you this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face was an emotionless slate as I said, \u201cI left none alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe howl of anguish started with a whisper, \u201cThen my son is dead\u2026\u201d  A low moan, like an animal dying began in the tall man\u2019s chest and raised to a terrible roar.  Richard\u2019s eyes were wild as he turned back to Sir Ronald lying under him.  \u201cYou sent my son to fight a dragon!  You Bastard!\u201d  The blows came then one after another, Richard seemingly trying to plant the Knight\u2019s head into the ground.  I watched, feeling as though I were miles away from the scene.  I was wrong, there was another way for this to end after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Ronald lay in a bloody heap on the ground, his face broken beyond recognition.  Richard had continued beating the once proud noble long after it was clear that he was dead.  Tobias had once tried to get the lieutenant to leave, but a look had sent the younger man away.  When the tall man had finally spent himself, he departed wordlessly, blood dripping from his knuckles.  He went to his horse and rode away.  Others of the horsemen took their cue and rode out the main gates as well, but some remained curious as to what would happen now that the most powerful man in the village had been killed in plain sight by his own lieutenant and a dragon held the seat of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned my neck down, to meet Tobias at eye level.  I sighed, \u201cIt is done.  I am now master of this land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias glanced at Sir Ronald\u2019s body, but quickly looked away.  \u201cYou did it easily, M\u2019lord.  I\u2019ll make sure that everyone knows exactly how it happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted in the affirmative.  \u201cThe hard part now will be in keeping it.  You will assist me in the task, Tobias.\u201d  The lad only continued looking at me with open admiration.  \u201cGo now into the manor house and gather the staff from their hiding places.  Organize them to begin emptying the place of anything valuable.  I will begin dismantling the house tomorrow.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias was excited, \u201cShall you build a grand palace in its place, M\u2019lord?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rumbled noncommittally.  I continued as if he had not asked the question.  \u201cTake fresh clothes from there, any you like, as well as anything you would like for yourself or your family.  Get a horse as well, you will be traveling a lot tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tobias was becoming overwhelmed with my list of orders, he gave no sign.  He simply took everything I was telling him in even stride, repeating the list to himself.  I was waving for him to be off on the tasks I\u2019d assigned him, but he lingered.  His eyes were a little watery as he asked, rubbing his hands together again, \u201cSir\u2026 is now the time to speak of my father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled softly, thinking of the man who had first put a bolt in my flesh the previous morning.  I almost told him no.  However, something in Tobias\u2019 pathetic expression and the way he rubbed his hands together inclined me to say, \u201c\u2026He cannot stay here.  The man has too much incentive to kill me or seek revenge somehow.\u201d  I leaned closer, my big amber eye close to Tobia\u2019s body.  \u201cIs he a sort that would accept banishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias swallowed, perhaps regretting bringing the matter up.  \u201cNot willingly, no.  But he\u2019s spent a lot of time on the road before settling here in the village.  I think he would do well enough, especially if he knew his family was safe behind him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hummed deep in my throat.  My instincts still cried out against letting a man who had injured me walk away free, but this way, I ensured Tobias\u2019 continued loyalty.  \u201cHmm\u2026 Then see to it he gets a good horse and some money.  Tell him I shall not suffer his presence in the valley by next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias\u2019 face was screwed up with emotions.  He said in a voice so tight it squeaked, \u201cT-thank you for your mercy, My Lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI puffed a bit of smoke from my nostrils.  I was hungry for using up so much fire this morning.  The smoke from where it still burned rose to the north, but the wind was blowing it away from here.  \u201cSee about your errands, Tobias.  And send someone out here to remove the bolts from my hide.\u201d  I grumbled, turning my head away to let him know that the discussion was over.  Tobias scurried away into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ease of my victory, I was still weary for all the happenings this day.  Not wanting to search for the runaway livestock. I took advantage of the carcass of a plump former nobleman while I waited for a surgeon to appear and tend to my wounds.  It turned out that Sir Ronald was no different from his peers in this final regard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I rested in the yard as the humans scurried about their tasks.  At first most seemed to mill about aimlessly, their usual routine completely upturned.  It only took the humans living on the estate a short time to get used to taking orders from Tobias however, especially after he had found some nice clothes for himself in the house.  The valuables in the house turned out not to be very impressive.  Most of it consisted of various pieces of art, including framed pictures as well as a couple fine tapestries.  Bolts of silk emerged as well as spices and casks of wine from the cellar.  There were two chests of wealth which came at last from the manor.  It was explained to me that the larger of the two \u2013 it was so heavy it needed to be carried by Tobias and another larger man \u2013 constituted the village\u2019s treasury as well as Sir Ronald\u2019s personal wealth; which the late knight had considered largely one and the same.  Aside from the meaningless documents enclosed was a sizable quantity of jewelry and faceted gems; stacked below on the bottom of the chest were bars of gold.  The small chest was filled to the brim with gold coins stamped with the profile of a large cheeked human female.  This was the tithe to be sent to Lord Dominic at the year\u2019s end, or would have been sent, rather if the village hadn\u2019t come under new management.  Most of the rest of the things that came out of the manor were worthless to me.  Numerous sets of clothes for both male and female, taxidermy animals, lanterns, oil, towels and a dazzling supply of various sundry and minutae of daily life in the manor house.  It was well known what was going to happen to the house shortly and after I instructed Tobias to begin distributing the various supplies freely among the servants, the humans began to be exceedingly through in cleaning out the house to the point where they were carrying out things obviously pried off walls and ceilings.  I claimed a rich, golden chandelier for myself and let the humans sort out the torch holders, washbasins, chairs and tables.  More than once Tobias intervened to break up a fight.  With a dragon looming in the field behind him, it never took him long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for my injuries, the horse master came forth from the house and serviced me.  He worked with a cold professionalism after a brief introduction.  Grey haired and bespeckeled, the gentleman seemed almost as confident working on a dragon as his horses and livestock.  I warned him too of the \u201cpoisonous\u201d nature of dragon-blood, but he only grunted in response, intent of his work of removing the bolts.  If he was rougher than Tobias had been, he was more efficient and cleaner with his work.  He washed his instruments in a bucket and left.  I didn\u2019t say goodbye, but the surgeon lingered in my mind more than the various other humans who came forth and attempted speech with me from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was apparent that I was not about to fly into a rampage, the humans proved to be as curious as cats.  Tobias was busy and was not able to intercept all of the humans who came forward to ask silly questions or just to stare.  Usually all it took was the setting of my gaze on them to make them bid a hasty retreat.  For the more persistent, silence was a better tool.  Once I shielded my face with my wing against a boy younger than Tobias who just would not take a hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the evening, the house had become a gutted husk, even the windows removed and left as open gaps.  Tobias sent the artwork, bolts of fabric and more fragile bits of the valuables I\u2019d claimed to his house along with the gifts for his family; the two groups clearly marked.  I curled around the two chests of riches, the core of my new hoard.  I felt a deep sense of satisfaction in their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias returned to me by horseback after seeing the wagon of treasure back to his house.  I thought the return home might have proven emotional for the lad, but as he rode up he was grinning, not even showing much sign of fatigue.  Power seemed to suit him well, it seemed.  I lifted my head to let him know he was acknowledged.  He started, \u201cI have your things locked safely in the basement for now.  I also spoke to the town crier.  He\u2019s spreading the news of what\u2019s happened around the village.  Everywhere is abuzz with your defeat of Sir Ronald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rumbled in my throat, \u201cIt was knight-lieutenant Richard who slew Sir Ronald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias seemed taken aback that I did not accept the \u201cglory\u201d of befelling my enemy.  \u201cI\u2026 I know that, M\u2019lord.  But I placed more emphasis on your own victory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled and tore at the ground with a claw.  The horse under Tobias shied away, but he kept it under control.  \u201cI told you to spread the truth.  Let everyone know that Sir Ronald was killed by a grieving father whose son had been sent to his death by the man.\u201d  Tobias still had much to learn evidently.  I wanted as little emphasis on my own actions as possible.  If the village could accept authority from an unseen coward in his manor, they should be able to accept it from an unseen dragon\u2026 at least in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I will, Sir.  I will revise the story at once!\u201d  Tobias said, turning his horse about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a paw, \u201cNot quite yet.  I want you to summon a wood worker here first thing in the morning.  I want to disassemble this place while making the most of the wood left from it.  I will also need to speak to a quarryman for I will have much need of stone in the future and also someone who can help with excavating this hill.  Send them all to me in the morning and don\u2019t bother sending them if they can\u2019t be civil with me.\u201d  By that I meant if they couldn\u2019t cope with speaking to a three-thousand pound dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, M\u2019lord, first thing in the morning.  Shall I see about sending you some livestock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about the dead soldiers I had left up in the forest.  I didn\u2019t want to burn through the meat supply during this period of turmoil, but the bodies were likely burned beyond all virtue by the still raging fire.  \u201cDon\u2019t send something too large, a pig or a sheep will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good.\u201d Said Tobias, again turning to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.\u201d  I intoned and my servant came about willingly once more.  \u201cI have one last task for you tonight.  I want you to locate Richard and see how he fares.  He would be useful in reorganizing the militia if he were willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do that, M\u2019lord.  I know where he and his wife live.\u201d Said Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI purred my pleasure.  \u201c\u2026make sure he does nothing rash, Tobias.\u201d  I said with a heavy glance.  The man had seemed dreadful after he had learned about his son\u2019s demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias seemed to take my meaning, \u201cI will, M\u2019lord.\u201d  The young man, now my second in command and for most intents and purposes new lord of the village, walked his horse across the lawn and into the darkening night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I took a few deep breaths.  Collecting stone was not a task for the faint of heart even when you had the strength of a dragon.  Below me, a few stone cutters set to work with sledgehammers, accurately breaking the stone slab into chucks that could be moved by hand into the ox wagon.  Another similar chunk and the men would have enough stone to occupy them for the next week.  I beat against the stone with my tail to begin a new crack\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that the wood from the house, even with separated with care, did not go as far as I would have liked in constructing my new home.  I planned to start with an open air amphitheatre which I intended to use for greeting guests.  I told my woodworker, a burly man whose bare chest was covered with course black hair, to build it large enough to accommodate myself and up to one other dragon of similar size.  It would be built into the earth, the wood used to form shelves for humans to gather to speak to me.  I would sit at the center of the structure.  I desired stone for the bottom of my amphitheatre because I didn\u2019t want to tread the dirt into mud under me.  There was a small source of stone known to exist in the forest, but no actual quarry had been formed.  I learned shortly after I commissioned the work that the men around here were not willing to work for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the chest of gold coins bought the willing labor of three quarters of the men in the village, provided that I perform some of the hardest labor myself in breaking in the new quarry as well as felling a few trees.  Transportation of materials remained a problem since, despite the size of my frame, I was actually very limited in my ability to carry and fly with large weights.  My frame was quite heavy in and of itself; most of my lifting ability was used in just getting my body off the ground.  The men who had oxen to spare made a large sum of money in those first weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spreading of Sir Ronald\u2019s hoarded wealth went leaps and bounds towards improving my image in the eyes of the villagers.  Most were still too frightened to approach me directly, but those who I had contact with \u2013 usually the people who stood most to profit from providing me their services \u2013 quickly acclimated to contact with their new lord.  In addition, crops were still sown,  and the herds maintained \u2013 even most of Sir Ronald\u2019s livestock was quickly recovered.  The village was quite active this summer as the men labored on my first structure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for myself, I slept in the open air on the grounds of the estate that was rightfully won.  I took my two chests of wealth, however, high into the mountains and hid them in a hole so elevated no human would ever reach it.  I hunted more than I ate livestock, commanding the herdsman to expand the herds as quickly as he could, particularly the succulent dairy cows whose soft flesh I had to forgo for now.  The fields suffered mightily for my treading on them, even after I\u2019d largely smoothed the damages I\u2019d caused the day I invaded the property.  I grew to walk along certain trails which later I would pave and line with trees and flowers.  The quantities of manure I produced helped the grass recover as the summer progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village itself, I never visited, for which the villagers were likely grateful.  I did spy on them from above, however, no longer attempting to hide myself.  Often they would point at me from below.  Sometimes, the youngest ones would wave.  With the men largely occupied on the construction at the manor, many of the village\u2019s woman took the charge, working in the fields and tending the animals.  The blacksmith even began teaching his own daughter the trade, which was huge news in the town apparently.  There were simply no men available for the apprenticeship.  The portion of the population who had fled the village when I\u2019d taken over eventually returned, looking for paid work.  Some vagabonds were drawn in as well, seeking an escape from poverty.  More coins emptied from the smallest chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Richard, he eventually became the commander of the militia under me.  He was silent on the matter and hardly left his house actually, for several months after the day his son died.  He came to me in the middle of a lonely night in July.  His beard was long and unkempt and in his hand was an unsheathed sword.  He told me that he had to either kill me or forgive me.  We talked the night long and when the dawn came, it found Richard gone, his sword planted in the earth at my feet.  Later he would admit that I had the right to defend myself and that the true fault lay with Sir Ronald for goading Brian into challenging me with nothing more than a handful of other men and an ambush strategy and with his own son for thinking he could accomplish the task.  Afterwards, Richard tended to drink heavily on the weekends, but otherwise was a capable commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as I was taking the title \u201cLord.\u201d  It seemed fitting that I knight both my chief servants.  Richard became known as Sir Chestworth.  Tobias, on the other hand, took a new surname and became Sir Drakling.  He gave me the new name with a small twisted smile and I rolled my eyes and allowed him his perversion.  I questioned him several times on the choice of the new name, but he never gave me a straight answer, usually saying something along the line of \u201cnew station, new name\u201d or wanting to leave the association with farming behind him.  It did not escape my attention that Tobias did not return to his home, but rather rented a room in the village inn.  It seemed that despite gifting them a sizable fortune from Sir Ronald\u2019s estate, he was still not on good terms with his remaining family.  After all, he had essentially forced his father out of his home.  That man\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown to me, but I cared little save that he was no longer a member of the village.  In time, I came to believe that Tobias felt that he was no longer worthy of or had somehow stained his father's name.  However, he grew to like very much the name \"Drakling\" and the overtones and associations it afforded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the paving stones of the amphitheatre were in place and the tiers constructed with care in a lavish, but functional style with twisting, snake-like stairs twisting and converging from top to bottom \u2013 I sacrificed capacity for elegance \u2013 I commissioned several artists to begin carving the stone, the wooden tiers and handrails with delightful images of dragons breathing fire, dragons in flight and wing motifs.  It was vain, but I found the style suited my tastes.  I also called for the forging of large lamps to hang from poles and the crafting of tables and chairs for the human occupants; I found myself wishing I had saved some of the furniture from the manor.  I also adorned the place with large clay pots holding small trees or flowering plants to add some color.  I thought about ordering a massive rug for myself, but figured that my weight and my scales would wear it out too quickly.  The carved stone, set in a shallow bowl was fine enough for my resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late summer as the artists were putting the finishing touches on my theatre.  The christening ceremony would be held next week and Tobias and Richard would be officially knighted by myself in front of all of the trades people and important folk of the village.  I summoned Tobias to my side a fair distance away so we were out of earshot.  He was dressed in all in black as was his taste nowadays.  His coat open at his chest was stitched with a wing design over a bronze shirt.  I reminded myself to speak with him about his choice in fashion sometime in the near future.  \u201cTobias.\u201d I said.  I never used his surname to his face and certainly never called him \u2018Sir.\u2019  \u201cI have an important mission for you that you must undertake as soon as we have the ceremony next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to serve, My Lord.\u201d Said the young man with a deep bow.  \u201cHow can I be of assistance?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I knew it was only a matter of time before the other humans would respond to my taking of the village.  If nothing else, they would be enraged by my refusal to pay their tithe.  There was not a lot of trade on the forest trails leading from the village back to the larger human nation; the village itself was completely self sufficient.  However, the fact that there was now a dragon in charge of Devonshire would not be long contained regardless.  I knew it was likely that Lord Dominic, the man to whom Sir Ronald had pledged fealty already knew about what had happened to his small province and possibly was already gathering a retaliatory force.  I had to legitimize my claim in terms that the humans understood or face inevitable open warfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias gathered together some of the brighter minds in the village to help me craft and put into writing a proclamation of succession.  The village of Devonshire, an unremarkable dot not included on most maps would become its own tiny country on the edge of the Dragon Wastes.  While I had simply taken the village because I was strong enough to do so and had a mind to domesticate the people here for the benefit of myself and dragons in general, my strongest argument on paper was that the nation of Lyrond provided inadequate protection against dragon predation.  With a little help from Tobias and several new friends he had made over the course of the past months, they raised a general outrage over the many missing people who had been taken over the years.  I alone could offer protection against the other dragons across the mountains.  Thus, a week after Tobias and Richard had been official knighted in a grand ceremony to break in the new amphitheatre, I had my proclamation signed by the majority of the who\u2019s-who\u2019s of the village.  It made sense after all, a dragon would be able to protect them from other dragons.  With the village bustling and the year\u2019s taxes largely refunded to the people, not a soul was left in Devonshire who mourned the passing of Sir Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the paperwork signed and sealed, there was nothing left but to get the message to Lord Dominic.  I felt apprehensive about sending my star servant back into the clutches of danger.  I thought a lot about flying him through the passes myself to meet with the Lord, but I did not know the way \u2013 and couldn\u2019t be directed by a human I held in my claws \u2013 and furthermore, I did not want to create a panic in the city which would likely create more rabble rousers than the disappearance of one tiny hamlet alone.  \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  Tobias said.  \u201cI\u2019ll have Jacob, Christopher and Michael with me.\u201d  The young Knight was referred to his three bodyguards, two of which were formerly close friends.  \u201cBesides, Lord Dominic is high nobility.  His kind take things like diplomatic immunity far more seriously than brutes like Sir Ronald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still uncertain, but it had to be done, and a human matter such as this was best left to human hands.  \u201cWatch yourself, Tobias.  I would hate to have to train up a replacement.\u201d  That was as affectionate as I got with the young man.  He understood the joke and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be careful, Sir Dragon.\u201d  He said.  \u201cBy the way.  Who shall I say is the new lord of Devonshire?  Sir Dragon does not sound very serious on paper, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned and looked away for a while.  I supposed the time had finally come.  I would have to define my identity with these tiny folk.  It was a shame; I enjoyed the nebulous fear and respect of being known as \u201cthe dragon\u201d amongst most of the people.  I spoke.  \u201cYou are right, Tobias.  Tell Lord Dominic that the area known as Devonshire is now under the rulership of Lord\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was not idle during the months that Tobias spent away.  The estate of the late Knight was, piece, by piece, landscaped and turned into a lovely park.  Cobblestone paths wound their way through trees I carefully removed from the forest and had planted for aesthetic effect.  Around the many turnabouts and dead ends, I placed many towering pines so I had my desired privacy among several possible hiding places.  Despite the vastness of the estate for a mortal man, in the end, it was little more than a garden for me, but I was well pleased with it when it was finally complete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all of the estate was given over to my private garden, however.  In the northern section, the old stables still stood along with the small house where my herdsman and his family lived.  He raised a new generation of cattle for me, but it still wasn\u2019t enough.  Where there had been only five animals before, there were now twelve, but eating even one would severely affect their population growth, or so the herdsman constantly informed me.  The sheep and pig populations were healthier, but slowly declined as I ate them one by one and the herdsman\u2019s efforts were concentrated on the cattle.  Horses ran about as well, but I was prohibited from eating them as well as they were too valuable as draft animals for the constant construction going about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarry that I had broken in did not quiet even after the construction of the amphitheatre and the cobblestone paths for my garden.  With wealth flowing about the village like water, the wealthier citizens took into their minds to have real cobblestone streets for the village center as well as a new stone church.  While I was weary of breaking new ground, or stone rather, for the humans who worked at the quarry, the quarrylord was actually willing to pay me a large sum of money for the service.  Seeing as my chest of coins was reduced to a scattering of bits which rattled around the bottom, I took the job and continued my labor.  As I exposed new stone, the quarry enlarged and yet more stone was able to be procured without my direct aid.  The foundations of the church were laid in September, a month before the harvest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the same time, a team of prospectors traveled into the town.  They caused a sensation in the village with their plans to strike and open an iron mine in the vicinity.  The blacksmith had long since run through his usual yearly supply of iron which had to be carted in over the mountains, and even with recycling of metal bit and pieces that cropped up from Sir Ronald\u2019s manor, he was hard pressed to turn up even a set of horseshoes.  Richard informed me that the blacksmith had \u201cinvested\u201d quite heavily in the new prospectors, which I took to mean, he gave them money to start their enterprise in return for future compensation.  Richard told me that it might be wise for me to do the same seeing as I was so interested in improving the industry and construction of the town.  I was hesitant though.  My coin supply was mostly gone, so an investment would mean turning over a significant portion of my large chest of gold bars and jewels.  I had not been planning to dip into that egg of wealth, especially so soon.  \u201cI don\u2019t suppose they would accept payment in artwork and bolts of silk?\u201d  I asked Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not, as it turned out, but I matched the blacksmith\u2019s contribution anyway and the duo struck a path into the hills with a team of newly purchased donkeys.  In time, I would not be disappointed with my \u201cinvestment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the space of the estate now in use and suiting my expectations for the moment, I began turning more and more thought to a permanent den.  If I one day attracted a mate, she would not be satisfied to lay in the open, even in a pleasant garden such as I\u2019d fashioned.  Unfortunately, the hill itself was largely clay as I\u2019d discovered early on with my futile attempts to dig out a subterranean domicile.  After a large portion of the hill collapsed on my head after just twelve feet in, I realized that I would have to construct a home elsewhere.  It was probably for the best.  The estate, though indeed isolated from the rest of the village would probably still be too close to other humans to really feel safe, especially with young children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChildren\u2026 if there was one thing I desired more than a land to call my own, it was the need to see the skies above the valley filled with little bronze wings.  In that way, I could best contribute to the legacy of my people.  I sighed though, at the thought.  It seemed very far off.  I had not even seen another dragon since coming here and there was always so much to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harvest ceremony was a wild congregation which I observed from the air as I circled the village square.  The humans demonstrated all sorts of odd behavior and quasi-religeous customs which seemed completely at odds with the rather sterile religion for which the actual church was being constructed.  The men dressed in masks, their bodies covered in straw and ran about scaring children.  Women dressed in wolf skins and howled at the moon and were surprisingly frisky with the men.  Spirits flowed as freely as water.  There were games, axes thrown at targets; it was obvious that the targets were once dragons but had been hastily repainted to resemble a caricature of Sir Ronald breathing fire.  The music was all encompassing even at a significant height.  A part of me actually desired to be amongst them, to partake in the revelry, and especially to drink spirits with the rest of them.  But I knew I couldn\u2019t.  As for the latter, I could drain the entire village supply of liquor by myself.  At the Witching Hour, the Wicker Man was wheeled out and set ablaze.  The crowd cheered and impulsively, I submitted my own cry, roaring from the heavens.  The crowd went silent below, but then erupted in an even louder cheer.  I roared again and our voices, for an instant, intermingled into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was November when Tobias returned, mere weeks before the snows promised to close the mountain passes.  I spotted him while out hunting far to the east of the village, actually quite close to the area which had been set ablaze earlier that year.  New trees and growth flourished and it was one of my preferred hunting grounds as there was not as much cover for animals moving across the new vegetation.  Tobias was traveling along the single road which led out of the village and towards the town of Anorton, now the westernmost settlement of Lyrond.  From the air I saw that his entourage was greatly increased, two stagecoaches rumbled along behind him and his three bodyguards, all on horseback.  Following this was a wagon carrying supplies, now nearly emptied, and a few more guards.  I angled my wings and flew towards the company, eager to see what fruits the mission had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I came close, however, one man sitting on the roof of a coach gave a cry and raised his crossbow at me.  I hissed and Tobias immediately started shouting commands.  The bolt missed me by a mile, but I was outraged to be treated with such indignity.  I\u2026</span></div></div>",

It seemed like all of the months I had spent in human company had meant nothing.  I was still shot at on sight by the least of them.  Fury pounded in my heart and made me want to fling all of them over the ledge and down into the valley below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias came forward, waving his arms.  I wanted to smash him too.  \u201cMy Lord!  Master!  Please calm down.\u201d  I realized I was hissed and slamming my tail into the mountain again and again, sending chips as large as Tobias\u2019 head down into the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet that man off the coach!\u201d shouted Tobias, apparently realizing what was at stake.  The sight of the perpetrator being dragged towards me by his former comrades calmed me somewhat.  I breathed and my nostrils steamed in the cold air without the need for smoke.  The man, dragged his legs and supported by the shoulders by two men to either side whimpered and I smelled urine begin to run down his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pupils were the tiniest slits in the bright daylight reflecting off the white of the mountains around me.  I calmed myself enough to form words in the slave tongue.  \u201cThis man\u2026 must be punished.\u201d  I breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias hurried ahead, his movement took my eyes from the doomed man.  \u201cYes!  Yes, M\u2019lord.  He will be punished.  But perhaps-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want to hear his simpering right now.  \u201cBring him forward.\u201d I intoned.  The men at his sides looked at each other and then threw him hastily forward where the trigger-happy guardsmen collapsed in a heap on his belly, covering his head and shaking, pleading for mercy.  I began to lower my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon!  Please hear me!\u201d  Tobias cried.  Only his voice could have made me pause.  I looked at him and showed my teeth.  If my eyes could have spewed fire as well, they would have.  \u201cPlease, My Lord.\u201d  Tobias said, his hands out before him, \u201cTake a moment to think on this matter.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our best interests to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the usual punishment for attacking a Lord?\u201d  I asked, cocking my head.  I moved my hand as the man in front of me tried crawling away.  I trapped him between my forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias put a hand to the back of his neck and looked away, \u201cUh\u2026 Death, usually.  But I beg you to reconsider.  It would be good for your image to show mercy, and besides, you were never truly in danger.\u201d  The young man, still in his black and bronze outfit, jogged up to my side and motioned for me to lower my head with an ease in my vicinity that the other men gawked at.  \u201cMy Lord,\u201d he whispered in my ear, \u201cThe ambassadors Lord Dominic sent are in the stage coaches behind me.  You must do everything in your power to defeat the image of being a bloodthirsty monster\u2026 forgive my expression, but it is the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my talons into the dirt under me.  I was in the right, damnit!  Even the human laws agreed with me, the man\u2019s life was mine.  My dragon blood rankled at the thought of letting him go\u2026 for mere political incentives.

Everything in my nature told me to end his life and then promptly devour him; I had been out hunting after all and I was famished.  This man before me saw me as nothing more than a beast.  Perhaps he should find out what a beast such as myself was capable of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then wouldn\u2019t I just be confirming what the man thought of me in the first place?  Well, he would be dead, but I would be confirming it for the rest of them, just as Tobias had just said.  I hadn\u2019t wanted to think about this!  Tobias had lured me into staying my claw this long and now I was doubting myself!  Dragons Do.  We don\u2019t deliberate and discuss, when there is something we desire, we go forth and take it.  I\u2019d taken this land for my own, but there was so much that I\u2019d had to learn in just this short time.  The places I\u2019d been, the things I\u2019d seen in my years as a homeless wandering male, and yet it had all been saturated with the same familiar, recognizable dragony philosophy.  Humans were so concerned with appearances, images, symbols... it grated against my entire world view and yet here I was embedding myself into the thickest of human delusions: Politics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet... it seemed to me just then that taking this man\u2019s life just now would have been an indulgence purely for indulgence\u2019s sake.  I wanted to kill him just because I <i>wanted</i> to.  If I were fresh from the mountains as I had been less than a year ago, I wouldn\u2019t have waited a second; that would have been reason enough to do it.  But now the action seemed different, not only was killing the man who had fired the crossbow at me simply taking his life, it was <i>larger</i> than that.  It would carry further repercussions that would echo forward into the future.  This was a new concept for me.  I understood planning things out, I understood working towards a goal in steps, but the realization, as I sat there on that mountain pass with a human between my paws that actions could be <i>symbols</i> as well...  I just hoped that I wasn\u2019t beginning to think too much like a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that I had finished thinking these things, it was obvious to everyone that I wasn\u2019t going to kill the guardsman, myself last of all.  I leaned over to Tobias and grumbled as quietly as I could - though it was obvious that the humans nearest me could hear me plainly - \u201cPunish this man as you see fit.  I am weary and must hunt for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was getting up and turning to take to the air, Tobias walked back to the stagecoaches, arms wide.  \u201cLord Ladonius has decided in his wisdom and mercy to spare this man from death.  Instead, he shall be flogged for firing upon his person...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men seemed satisfied, the guard who had soiled himself between my talons most of all.  I knew Tobias would handle things for me.  My wings carried me between the towering peaks.  I felt at peace in the absence of humanity among the trees far below and the frosty stone above and around me.  These things were eternal and nothing was shrouded over them.  A rock was a rock and a tree was a tree, there was nothing more to it.  This world was laid open to the eyes and the senses; one could understand it by immersing oneself in it.  I knew no better way than sinking my teeth into the belly of struggling deer.  In the warm blood wetting my tongue and the flesh sliding down my throat, I found the enlightenment of the Wild, a Dragon\u2019s true wisdom.  And yet it was only a taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelly full of deer flesh and my philosophical turmoil put to rest for the moment, I returned to my estate to find the amphitheater packed with humans.  I spotted Tobias immediately among the crowd and wished that I could question him about what was happening, but I\u2019d already been spotted.  The humans waved and some cheered, it was clear that they had been waiting for me.  I was left with no choice but to land and become the center of attention once more.  I was glad that my face was much less expressive than that of a human\u2019s; it was easier to put on a mask of calm and assertiveness over my anxiety at once again being thrust into the center of human society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias\u2019 men made sure to clear my stone basin of visitors as I spiraled in over the noisy crowd.  Arms wide, they pushed back the congregators while among the tiers, wine and cheese was circulated around the tables.  A distance away, I detected the odor of a large roasted hog, turning on a spit.  As I lowered men already began taking it off the fire pit.  I knew an offering to myself when I saw it.  I supposed I had a little room left for roast pork\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed as softly as a dragon could, though the table clothes billowed with the force of my wings.  There was silence as I touched down, gracefully planting my scaled feet on the ground.  When the amphitheatre had been just completed, the few brave ones who had dared attend had been filled with rank fear when I occupied the center arena.  Now, there was still fear\u2026 but it was less intense.  It had a new flavor as my nose and tongue tasted the air.  From the sweat which communicated the crowd\u2019s emotions to me as if it were displayed on cue cards, I tasted the sweet tang of awe.  I found that I liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally Tobias appeared soon after I made a show of folding the wings which, when unfurled, were as wide end to end as the entire seating area; he was getting better as his manifesting act.  As I was glancing to the tall curved copper poles which upheld bowls of burning oil and crystallized pine resin which lit the area against the deepening twilight and released a soothing perfume into the air \u2013 as well as help covering up my own sulfurous scent \u2013 my aide spoke.  \u201cMy Lord, Lord Dominic has sent Baron Crestwell as well as Knights Henry and Kingsley.  He is most concerned about what has happened to Devonshire and would have come himself if the passes weren\u2019t to be closed until spring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded slightly.  There was no way for me to speak without everyone in attendance hearing my words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be gracious and regal as always, Master.  You have already stunned the crowd with your glory.\u201d  In a voice barely above a whisper, he added, \u201cYou did the right thing on the pass today master.  The man is at the surgeon\u2019s recovering after his flogging, but he couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huffed a bit of smoke out my nose as a response.  In the third row, a blond woman in a robin blue dress clapped her hands at the apparent party trick.  I hadn\u2019t seen her before; apparently there were more new nobles in town besides the three men Tobias had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long before the men who would present to case either for or in opposition to war against me were presented.  I reclined on my side, head uplifted \u2013 as soon as I\u2019d assumed the pose, the blonde woman had to be escorted away as she was clearly overcome by \u2018the vapors\u2019 at the sight of my uncovered, but naturally sheathed sex -  as the men came forward.  Baron Crestwell was also referred to as Lord Thurman.  He was the Baron of a region known as Crestwell, similar to, as I learned later that night, the fact that Lord Dominic was also Duke Lyandar.  Lyandar was the name of the capital city of Lyrond, but his dukedom actually consisted of the entire western half of Lyrond.  Even more confusingly, there was yet <i>another</i> man beyond Lord Dominic: King Benedict IV.   I thought I had understood the feudal system, the tiered society being quite similar to how dragons organized themselves - albeit, dragon society was much more fluid with rank usually depending on who you could beat into submission and how attractive you were to the opposite sex \u2013 but it was actually a befuddling knot of allegiances, heredity and who was who\u2019s second cousin and who was who\u2019s bastard child, all with a sprinkling of rule by Divine Right on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I am getting ahead of myself.  When Baron Crestwell stepped forward and, surprisingly, bowed respectfully before my head, I saw that he was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Baron Crestwell was without a doubt the fattest human I had yet seen.  His face, as round as an olive with his heavy jowls was cleanly bearded with his livid red hair.  His loud outfit was vertically striped and largely purple with gold stitching and embellishments.  Perhaps the man thought that dressing as a peacock would distract people from his very large, protruding gut which he kept belted tightly behind a lavender sash.  Apparently, he thought to lift the weight upward by means of the sash for a more masculine appearance; I thought that it just made it stick out even more.  If the clothing was overpowering, however, that was nothing to the smell of the man.  He had laid over the natural smell of his body at least three dozen varieties of flower or other natural musk.  Tobias had attempted to describe to me the human sensation of smell, the way that smells tended to blend together or overpower each other; what odors they were even able to detect that is.  My nose always smelled <i>everything,</i> taking apart the scents so I \u201cheard\u201d every note of the olfactory symphony that was my everyday life.  I didn\u2019t know how creatures could even survive without a sense of smell; humans were quite pitiable in this regard, among others.  At any rate, I wasn\u2019t sure how even a sense as blunted as the human nose could find the horrendous amalgamation and overdose of perfumes emanating from the Baron to be pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet the delegate from Lord Dominic.\u201d  I rumbled softly.  I\u2019d grown used to speaking from my throat because when I spoke clearly, the sound was usually overpowering for a human in my direct presence.  Besides, Tobias had related to me that the breathy softness of my quiet voice was at once disarming in its mildness and intimidating in its mysterious otherworldliness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron emerged from his bow and stood as the Knights to his side bowed and introduced themselves.  Both Knights were taller than the Baron between them though not nearly as wide.  Sir Henry was a younger man, though still clearly much older than my Tobias.  He was blonde with blue eyes and a strong jaw.  He spoke with an accent that I hadn\u2019t heard before, but I basically nodded and agreed with what he said as I quickly attempted to decipher yet another alien presentation of the slave tongue.  Sir Kingsley was the oldest of the three.  He sported grey streaked brown hair proudly with a long, well brushed beard.  When he spoke, his voice was clear and methodical despite his tobacco stained teeth.  Sir Kingsley was quiet, and therefore dangerous.  Though both men were dressed in clothing, they each had decorated swords at their sides to indicate their status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, a table was brought forth for the delegates as well as chairs.  I continued to lounge easily on my side, occasionally stretching a leg when I wanted to remind my guests that I was more than just my animated head on my long, bronze-scaled neck.  With a twitch of my finger, I invited Tobias to sit on my wrist, but my servant declined silently, remaining standing instead.  Could it be that my young majordomo did not want to appear childlike in front of the important men?  Perhaps he had grown up during the months he\u2019d been away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow procuring a leather scroll case, Tobias popped off the lid and removed none other than my proclamation of sucession.  It was only a little worse for wear as the young man smoothed it out over the table\u2019s surface.  A waiter decanted wine for the three men from a silver pitcher as Baron Crestwell removed a sheaf of other papers from his robes, carefully untying the leather thong that bound them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias caught me eyeing the goblets of the men at the table, the bouquet rising from their contents intrigued me.  However my servant delivered terrible news.  \u201cMy Lord, I regret to say that we broke open the last cask of Sir Ronald\u2019s wine for this occasion.  I don\u2019t think there would be enough left to more than wet your tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Tobias.  I\u2019ve never had wine anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry lifted his head from the Baron\u2019s shifting of documents.  \u201cWhat is this?  Are you saying that you\u2019ve never had a drop of the shine before?\u201d  I gave the barest shake of my head.  The Knight pushed his goblet away.  \u201cThen I shall not imbibe where our host cannot.\u201d  Sir Henry looked across the table to his counterpart.  Sir Kingsley looked up at me, my scaled head rising over the table and then back to his glass.  He pushed his away as well.  Only after realizing that he was the only one left who had not refused his drink did Baron Crestwell forsake his own beverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry smiled and looked to Tobias.  He gestured with a hand to the three large goblets.  \u201cSee if you can mix these with whatever is left of the barrel.  Surely we there will be a thimbleful left for Lord Ladonius.\u201d  Tobias was quick to move.  When his goblet had been taken away, Sir Ronald lowered his head and muttered, \u201cWhat a life\u2026 forever sober.  Must be hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head oddly as I looked down at the younger Knight.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\u201d  I confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry snorted and raised a finger, \u201cWhich is exactly my point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias returned toting a small cauldron which sloshed gently with its contents as the young man walked smoothed back to us.  As Tobias moved, I heard hushed conversation from the tiers around us.  It had already gotten around that the dragon was to have his first taste of alcohol.  I didn\u2019t know why it was such a big deal.  True to Sir Henry\u2019s words, the cauldron was little more than a thimble to me.  Still, I\u2019d seen Richard often enough in his moments of weakness, his stumbling, and his slurring of speech.  I wondered if the tiny concoction could possibly have the same effect on me.  I was suddenly apprehensive about the whole matter.  What if my thoughts were clouded, just when the discussion of Devonshire\u2019s future was about to be opened in a matter that would either so completely succeed or so completely fail that the delegates left immediately, or far more likely, would stretch on through all the long months of winter.  Sir Henry looked at me expectantly as the cauldron with the village\u2019s last store of wine was delivered.  I lifted it from Tobias\u2019 grasp gently between my short thumb and first finger.  I sniffed it again and was amazed at the complexity of the odor, which, unlike Lord Thurman\u2019s hostile concoction of colognes, blended together harmoniously, almost like the wine was singing to my nose.  I swirled it a bit and them emptied the contents onto my tongue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quite sweet.  I did not partake a lot of sweet things in my diet, so the sweetness of the wine was the biggest shock, but not an unpleasant one.  The alcohol was very unlike anything I had eaten before.  It seemed almost that, beyond the wetness and body of the grapes that I tasted, I was drinking air.  But it was a strong, almost chemical sensation that was unique in my experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held the wine on my tongue for a long moment, almost overcome with the sensory overload.  Even my noise tingled and burned slightly with the vapors and aroma of the wine.  Having lived a life of drinking water and eating either raw or charred meat \u2013 though I\u2019d grown familiar with \u2018cooked\u2019 meat as the humans prepared it during the past month \u2013 the wine was like a star shining in my mouth, testing my senses of taste and smell to their limits.  The wine burned as it passed down my throat and I licked my chops.  I immediately wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as Tobias had mentioned, there was simply no more to be had.  Further, since there were no grape farms anywhere near Devonshire, I suspected that it would be a great long while before more could be procured.  The passes were closed after all, until spring\u2026 at least for those without a handy pair of wings.  Involuntarily, I shivered the whole length of my neck and head as I downed the alcoholic drink and cleared my throat with a cough.  Sir Henry gave a hearty laugh and brought his fist down on the table.  \u201cAye, I think the big fella like it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted a plume of dense black smoke and looked down, even Baron Crestwell was grinning conspiratorially.  I smiled toothily and said, \u201cI believe that I like wine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you do!\u201d  Sir Henry all but roared.  \u201cI haven\u2019t met a man\u2026 well, haven\u2019t met anyone with a lick o\u2019 good taste that\u2019d turn down some liquid sunshine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what the Knight was speaking of, but I just continued to grin and nodded gently.  As I relaxed back into my stone bowl, shuffling my wings in the process, the fat Baron apparently had selected the documents which he needed from his bundle, tucking the rest back into the confines of his robes.  I wondered what could possibly be written on the other documents.  With his papers spread out for casual observation on the table, at least for those were on the same level \u2013 in my case, the lettering was so small that my eyes, at about ten feet off of the floor were unable to comfortably read them, letters on paper being quite different than scurrying prey \u2013 Baron Crestwell spoke, \u201cI am glad that our host is enjoying himself, but as we are all aware, there is some urgent business which must be attended to.  I assume that you wish to be informed of Lord Dominic\u2019s immediate response to the\u2026 paperwork which you sent via your messenger here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the gentle wind, I detected the odors of the dinner waiting to be served where they had been prepared over the cooking pits immediately behind the amphitheatre.  The roast pig stood out strongest of all.  I\u2019d already eaten just an hour before, but I looked forward to the roasted meat with an anticipation for the sensory experience alone rather than the actual sustenance.  With the contact that I\u2019d had with the old staff of Sir Ronald\u2019s manor, I knew that it was customary to conduct business after dinner.  The fact that Baron Crestwell would want to dive right into the business \u2013 especially given the size of the belt he wore \u2013 said something about the importance of the news he had at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d I said and looked carefully at Tobias standing between the table where the nobles sat and myself, \u201cWhat had Lord Dominic to say about the withdrawal of Devonshire from the country of Lyrond?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Baron Crestwell interlaced his fingers, leaning his forearms on the edge of the table as he looked up at the enormous bronze dragon before him.  \u201cLord Dominic was very concerned, to say the least.\u201d He said, speaking of my taking control of the tiny village of Devonshire.  \u201cEspecially the manner in which you have chosen to handle the situation...  It is quite unusual for a dragon is it not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rumbled deeply in my chest and I allowed more smoke to wisp from my nostrils, exhaust from my sulfurous twin fire-bladders at the base of my throat.  I spoke casually from my throat, my voice breathy and soft and gave an underhand gesture with my paw.  \u201cPerhaps it only seems unusual because your knowledge of dragons is limited.  We do tend to be quite... reclusive, when it comes to other races.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron Crestwell smirked as though I\u2019d told a joke.  \u201cI am not sure I would describe it as such... but I do understand what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyeridge, \u201cAnd what did Lord Dominic think of my apparent discrepancy in behavior?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavyset man looked up at me, meeting my large amber eyes while he gripped the table.  \u201cHe thought that by choosing to make contact with us and...\u201d  he gestured to the proclamation of secession spread out on the table, \u201cpresenting a document which is legal enough to keep the courts locked in session for months debating it, you have single handedly created a very difficult and potentially embarrassing situation for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly didn\u2019t care about what was difficult or would harm the political career of a man I had yet to meet in person.  I had what was mine and all that mattered was this this little discussion to avoid the inconvenience of having to flambe human warriors as they tried to march in over the mountain pass.  \u201cForgive me if I fail to see how the loss of one tiny village on the edge of dragon country would seriously harm a man as important as Lord Dominic.\u201d  I rumbled softly in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron hesitated, but Sir Henry spoke up to fill the silence.  \u201cSeveral hundred people suddenly being removed from our lord\u2019s domain can hardly be considered insignificant, whatever the circumstances.  Also, while Devonshire may be a small, frontier village it still produces a notable amount of wealth, which, if your proclamation were to be considered valid would be lost to Lord Dominic and the nation of Lyrond as a whole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that thread, Baron Crestwell found his voice.  \u201cLord Ladonius, every part of the Duke\u2019s realm is considered important, especially the population centers such as the villages and towns.  If you were to consider the possibility that a rival nation had invaded and taken control of this town instead of yourself.  We could certainly not ignore such an act of aggression.  It would be as serious as a declaration of war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour analogy makes sense regarding the seriousness of the situation.\u201d  I admitted generously, \u201cHowever, it has two vital flaws.  I am an individual, not a rival country.  Also, I have no intention of further conquest.  The valley is rich and will sustain me indefinitely.  I have no desire to expand my territory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron Crestwell raised a finger, \u201cIf you will allow me, Lord Ladonius.  You may have no desire to expand your realm presently, but can you honestly say that this will always be the case?  Dragons are known to live an age and a half as is well known.  What if, in a hundred years, this valley alone no longer satisfies you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clicked softly in the back of my throat, suddenly more eager for the roasted pig to make its appearance.  \u201cIn a hundred years you and Lord Dominic will be long dead, I think, so I don\u2019t see the need to discuss the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron Crestwell folded his hands.  \u201cForgive me, I was merely speaking hypothetically.\u201d  Rubbing the red whiskers which helped conceal, but not completely, the man\u2019s enlarged double chin, he diverted, \u201cBut what is a matter of importance is that we handle this messy situation with all due caution and discretion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not stop myself from growling a bit as I said, \u201cBaron, you speak in circles.  You keep saying that this matter is \u2018messy\u2019 and \u2018difficult.\u2019  I do not see it as such.  I have claimed this area as my own and there is nothing more to the matter.  The other humans living here are even faring better than they had been under Sir Ronald.  I think I have proven that I can manage Devonshire as well as that so-called Knight ever did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up straight, the baron\u2019s ample middle pressed against the table\u2019s edge, but his eyes were bright with concentration.  \u201cLord Ladonius.  I think I may make the safe assumption that you have not had a lot of experience in human politics?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat in silence, though my tail slithered across the stone floor a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Lord Dominic were to allow Devonshire to secede from Lyrond, it would make him appear weak and unwilling, or perhaps unable to defend the outlying territories.  Worse, it would set a precedent for other smaller villages which may be unhappy for one reason or another.  It might even provoke open revolt.  A village becoming independent of its parent country is just not something that happens, even if a dragon is involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squared my shoulders, sitting up straighter.  \u201cWell, it has happened, and a dragon <i>is</i> involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron sat back against his chair, hands placed on top of his belly, \u201cThat it has... that it has...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the human had relaxed his posture, I remained straight, looking down at the trio.  I wondered desperately how much was not being said as the silence lengthened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Baron spoke again, he was brisk and businesslike.  \u201cWe need not get into the details tonight.  We are all weary from travel and we have the long winter ahead to think about things.  You should know that Lord Dominic has vested in me absolute power in his place in regards to this situation and has given me until Spring to return with a resolution.  At any rate, he wishes you to know that he is willing to settle the situation with you without resorting to bloodshed or taking the matter to other, outside parties.\u201d  the Baron clapped his hands and waved to the waiters standing off to the side at the edge of the amphitheater.  \u201cLet us have some dinner before resuming the discussion!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Two weeks after the delegation from Anorton had arrived, winter decided to drop several feet of fresh snow over the valley.  It\u2019d been over 48 hours since the ice had begun to fall and it showed no signs of letting up anytime soon.  I found the powder and the freezing air to be fresh and invigorating, encouraging my inner fire to burn even hotter.  Hunting was more difficult since many animals had retreated into their dens, but I welcomed the excuse to stay away from the village for longer periods of time.  There was only so much human nonsense I could tolerate and my threshold seemed dangerously strained of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I soared, flapping every now and then to keep my height steady, I was not searching the forest below for potential prey.  I was, in fact, studying the contour of the stone crevasses of the mountains around me in my continuing search for a den to call my own.  I had not found anything suitable as of yet, but that was not due to any lack of crevasses or holes to begin an excavation into the shelter of the mountain.  Instead the major hindrance in finding a den was my own indecisiveness.  I wanted my den to be perfect, and yet it was more than simply a matter of one place being too cold or another being too low to the ground.  Of all the things I desired, some of them were contradictory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI imagined a place that was dim, warm and secure, like the safe confines of an egg.  And at the same time, I imagined grand halls and soaring arches where one could spread their wings and perhaps even fly under the earth.  I wanted my den to be my bunker against the rest of the world, my safe haven for myself and my young, but I also wanted it to be a place of opulence and comfort with lots of human slaves \u2013 and there would be no doubt that they would be slaves \u2013 but slaves of any sort would undoubtedly compromise its security.  And while I was willing to spend decades carving out a hole in the side of the mountain, I was not keen on spending centuries.  I really wanted to see about finding a mate within the next 100 years or so\u2026  I was a male after all, I couldn\u2019t expect a willing partner to wander into my lap.  That was <i>my</i> job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, the storm still not abating, I dipped a wing and flung myself towards the ground in a long curve.  When I was a few feet above the tree tops, I leveled my wings and let my momentum carry me as far as it would against the face of the storm.  When I felt myself slowing, I began to flap, and flap and flap.  I would be beating my way all the way back to the village, I knew without a doubt.  My gut rumbled, though it was nary a sound over the howling of the blizzard.  My paws, flattened against my body to decrease the profile I offered to the wind, felt the vibrations across the roundness of my midsection.  I\u2019d developed a soft layer of fat across my ribs and filled out my belly from the year of eating extremely well.  As I flew, the snowflakes bouncing against my shielded water-lids, I was glad for my healthy ampleness.  I had a feeling this winter would be long and it would be far too easy to eat my way through the village\u2019s meat supply.  I concentrated on the image of a large herd of soft bovines grazing on a field come spring as I forced my way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed in the deserted amphitheatre, sinking to my ankles in snow, and shook the powder and ice from my wings before carefully folding them; I tried to minimize the folds and creases exposed to prevent ice from forming inside them.  Grimacing, I kicked in the powdery snow drift, sending a cascade of snow flurries into the wind.  If it weren\u2019t for the tiers rising around me, there would be hardly any evidence that my theatre was here at all.  Someone would have to get out here and remove all of this snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy longing for a proper den was even more palpable as I trotted my way into my garden, seeking at least some shelter between the huge pine trees.  Even in the most densely packed and sheltered turnabouts, however, there was over a foot of snow.  I did what I could with my tail, avoiding damaging the area with the sharp blade at the end of it.  I then had to curl up on the frozen ground and tuck my head under my wing as the sky darkened; it wasn\u2019t night yet, but the humans were hardly even coming outside during the day currently.  Under my wing, I had at least the illusion of shelter as the trees groaned around me in the brutal wind.  I closed my eyes and remembered back to a time when I\u2019d been smaller than a human child.  I\u2019d once spent a night in a tree when I\u2019d become separated from my siblings during a storm.  The groaning sounded exactly like it had back then and I\u2019d been terrified that the tree would fall and crush me.  It hadn\u2019t fallen, however, and I\u2019d learned an important lesson that night about remaining steadfast like that old tree and just hanging on until things got better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, the blizzard finally let up and the old staff of Sir Ronald\u2019s manor labored in my amphitheatre under a clear blue winter sky.  It turned out that since there was only one inn within the entire village, my majordomo had had to vacate his room in order to make space for the visiting nobles who were packed two to a room; which was apparently extremely tight for nobles.  He now slept in the common room, still unwilling to go back to his farm, but he wasn\u2019t complaining.  In fact, he had taken advantage of his position to eavesdrop on many a conversation since the delegation\u2019s arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had little interest in gossip.  \u201cDid you find out what the Baron plans on offering next?\u201d  I asked Tobias.  The first plan had evolved along the lines of just smoothing over the fact that I was technically a dragon on paper.  But we immediately ran into a host of problems.  For instance, to enter into the nobility, even on paper, I would have to make an oath of fealty to not only King Benedict IV and Lord Dominic, but even to a scattering of other nobles who would outrank me and within whose increasingly subdivided realms Devonshire lay.  I was not willing to submit in any form, written or otherwise, my obedience to <i>any</i> human, even a human king.  Then of course, was the fact that I \u2018inconveniently\u2019 dealt with my subject on a personal level.  Even the remoteness of Devonshire would not hide my existence forever, not when I see the people in the village on an almost daily basis and conduct my business with them directly.  And finally, there was the unresolved matter of the tithe\u2026  I didn\u2019t want to pay it and the Baron wanted me to in almost any circumstance.  Discussion had so far not progressed any length in that particular regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have.\u201d Replied Tobias.  \u201cHe was speaking about ways to term the proposition to a dragon with Sir Kingsley last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled a bit, the sound unfocused and indicating my general unease.  I had a feeling I wasn\u2019t going to like the new idea.  \u201cDo tell then.\u201d I prompted, looking down at the little man all bundled in furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed his mitted hands together.  \u201cWell, in the simplest terms, Baron Crestwell thinks that we could simply appoint a human to be in charge of Devonshire on paper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy growling intensified, \u201cWhat, and simply ignore the fact that Devonshire is mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, No!  Master, nothing of the sort.\u201d  Said Tobias.  Apparently, I\u2019d come across too strongly.  \u201cThe human regent would simply be a puppet under your control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quieted, my upset placated with the idea.  \u201cAnd what of the people who will see me conducting the village affairs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Tobias rubbed the back of his head.  \u201cWell, we could get the explanation around that, perhaps, you work for the human lord.  The locals would know the true flow of power, of course.\u201d  He added hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hissed long and softly.  It wasn\u2019t an ideal solution.  But the ideal solution for me would be if the Baron and his entourage simply left and let me be about my business.  \u201cI suppose it is a simple, if inelegant solution.\u201d  I said.  \u201cIt\u2019s worth talking about.  See if the Baron will be willing to meet once the amphitheatre is clear.  I don\u2019t fancy trying to squeeze my head into the village inn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias chuckled.  I hoped that I was getting better at what the humans called \u201chumor.\u201d  \u201cThat would be a sight, for sure, Master.  I\u2019ll speak to the Baron.\u201d  I watched the human slog off through the snow.  If this was truly to be the arrangement of things, there was only one human I\u2019d be willing to work with in such a way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second plan to smooth over my conquering of Devonshire bore fruit.  Tobias was the obvious candidate for a new human regent and I felt comfortable in his obedience enough to allow the farce to exist in the minds of strangers.  If anyone questioned about the presence of a dragon in Devonshire, it would be because Sir Drakling had cleverly negotiated with the beast and secured its services in return for a steady supply of livestock.  I asked Tobias after the first groundbreaking meeting in the newly excavated amphitheatre \u2013 this time, there was no crowd gathered in the freezing aftermath of the blizzard \u2013 if anyone would truly believe that a dragon could be complacent and docile with just a supply of foodstuffs.  He replied that while perhaps the shrewder man with some past experience with dragons might think that something was suspicious, most people actually thought of dragons as roving monsters, akin to wolves or bears in terms of intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the grand palaces that I\u2019d been to and the struggle of power between wealthy and powerful dragons, which, while more straightforward was not altogether alien from how it existed in human society, I\u2019d asked how that can possibly be.  Tobias had just shrugged.  \u201cI suppose that it just comes down to appearances, I guess.  We know for a fact that they keep humans as slaves beyond the valley, and yet it never crosses most people\u2019s minds that if dragons were animals, they wouldn\u2019t keep slaves.  Perhaps it\u2019s because you go about on four legs and we on two.  I think most people tend to think we\u2019re special because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned and pushed the young man with the flat side of my talon until he was forced to take a step back.  \u201cI just think it makes you unsteady, actually.\u201d  We both laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature never really came back up after the blizzard, so the valley was thrust a few weeks early into winter.  Fortunately, the harvest had been long before and no food was lost because of the snow.  The basements were full with preserved goods and most of the village settled into the dreary, boring winter life.  Since the passes were closed a couple weeks ahead of schedule, the furriers and trappers either had to find another place to hunt or break ground over the mountain by themselves.  The ones who chose the latter trickled into town little by little and most spent a lot of time gawking at the sight of a huge dragon occupying the area where the Knight\u2019s manor had once been.  I disliked the way their eyes lingered on my bronze scales.  It was the first time that I\u2019d seen a practical use for the dogs that humans seemed so fond of.  They pulled the men\u2019s sleds as they hiked deep into the forest to lay their traps.  It disgusted me to learn that the men who were going forth to reduce the population of game in the woods were not going to pay me some sort of tax for the use of my land.  When I\u2019d told Tobias as much, he said that he\u2019d never thought of it that way before.  With the village being so cloistered during the winter an hunting largely being a pastime for the nobility, the trappers were simply thought to be harvesting a raw resource.  \u201cThey come, they bring money to buy supplies, which helps the town and leave into the woods.  They catch and skin what they can, come back in spring with tanned hides, trade some for more supplies and leave again.  That\u2019s how it\u2019s always worked and it seems to make everyone happy.\u201d As my young ward put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as I depended on the local population of large game to sustain myself, I quickly decided to forbid the hunting of deer, caribou and goats; I didn\u2019t care about the foxes or rabbits.  Seeing as a deer could stumble unwittingly into a previously laid trap, I added that deer slain by accident could be skinned, but a fine would be levied per skin when they attempted to leave in the spring.  It was the first decision I\u2019d made that was not popular with the general public, or at least the trappers and their friends, which thankfully did not make a huge percentage of the population.  I remained firm, however, in spite of the protests Tobias received \u2013 no one ever complained directly to my face \u2013 It was easy when one\u2019s belly was hollow and empty.  I remained concerned, however about the trappers who had managed to escape into the wilderness before I\u2019d had the sense to \u201cprotect\u201d the local wildlife.  I continued to see evidence of illegal deer trapping here and there in the forest all winter long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Baron and his associates, it turned out that making someone into a knight was not an easy proposition, even when those with authority bend their wills to the matter.  Tobias was a commoner, and worse, because he was not the oldest male child, he did not even stand to inherit his father\u2019s land.  The only way his technical status could be lower was if he had been an indentured servant; I was quite intrigued by the sanctioned form of slavery which was permitted in the land at large and spent many a night wondering how the policy could be bent to my service in the future.  Thus there were documents to be crafted and information about Tobias\u2019 past bent and fabricated altogether.  For instance, he became a lieutenant of the village militia on paper complete with letters of recommendation, thankfully provided by Richard \u2013 when he was sober \u2013 and several awards for marksmanship and horsemanship.  There was also an alleged donation of generous quantity by Tobias\u2019 father when he was eight to get him assigned as a page to Sir Ronald.  I was concerned about where that money was to be procured, but Baron Crestwell eased my concerns with the fact that the sum could be later lost when Sir Ronald\u2019s estate was \u201cransacked\u201d immediately following his death.  It was all a lot of trickery and forged documentation.  Baron Crestwell seemed to have a mind for it, however, and Tobias was not so completely lost that he couldn\u2019t give me the gist of what this man was doing on paper.  I didn\u2019t think that the overweight baron could be trusted, but he seemed inclined to remedy the situation for the benefit of his superior as efficiently as possible, so I let him shuffle and sign his papers as well as age them artificially in tea without too much oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy January, the new documents had been sealed with the village\u2019s collection of records where they were stored in the basement of the post office along with the remnants of Sir Ronald\u2019s library in the wake of the dismantlement of his manor.  With Baron Crestwell planning on returning to Anorton with the relevant copies of the documents in Tobias\u2019 name, my human servant was now a Knight in the eyes of the country of Lyrond as well as in Devonshire alone.  There was no additional ceremony, but there was much heavy drinking that night in celebration.  I myself imbibed a barrel of a strong, dark brew, which while not as tasty and aromatic as the wine, warmed me as if a fire had been lit in my belly and put me at great ease with the tiny humans around me as they sang and danced.  I even recited an ancient draconic poem I\u2019d stored in memory for its sheer beauty regarding the joy of flight.  However, I was interrupted halfway through.  Apparently my native tongue of growls, hisses and clicks as well as periodic roars and some flapping of the wings was frightening people away.  I stopped and expressed my pity that such simple creatures could not appreciate art when they heard it.  There was much laughter and more drinking as I grinned toothily and sniffed about for another barrel of drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, I woke among the trees with a grinding headache.  I closed my water lids, but the murky light filtering through was blindingly intense nevertheless.  The trees swayed in the breeze and I thought the ground was moving under me.  When I finally managed to rise, I was dreadfully sore as for some unexplainable reason, I\u2019d spent the night sleeping on my back, <i>sleeping on my wings</i>.  The muscles were as stiff as logs as I stretched and looked about, trying to remember exactly how I had gotten here after the party last night.  Tobias found me as I wandered to the amphitheatre, head low and dragging my tail on the ground.  He ran to me, showing no lingering sign of his previous night\u2019s drinking.  His words flowed over me, passing between my ears like a mist and leaving not a trace.  I wanted to lie down for a while and have some fresh water brought out to me.  Tobias jumped up and tugged on a decorative, spiky protrusion on the underside of my jaw, using his weight to jerk my whole head.  I growled, my eyes immediately focusing on the tiny human in front of me.  Waving his arms frantically, Tobias informed me that\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The news that Sir Henry had been found dead was not as distressing to me as the place <i>where</i> the Knight had been found.  I padded the few steps to the crime scene, following Tobias between the tall trees that I\u2019d relocated and planted myself.  I growled softly the entire time.  My head was still hurting from my hangover following last night\u2019s party and worse, I had no recollection whatsoever of what had happened immediately following my drunken poem recital.  I plodded after the young man as he jogged ahead of me;  somehow, I knew where our trail was going to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the path, Tobias and I walked until we reached its termination in a thickly wooded roundabout, one of several of my possible sleeping places.  Between the gently swaying boughs of the pine trees, there lay a nest of red gore.  Sir Henry lay dismembered deep in the confines of my very own garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least I assumed it was Sir Henry.  To my eyes, there was little, if anything left that could possibly identify the corpse which had been spread so thinly over such a large area.  I was grateful that my belly was still quite full from the sheep I\u2019d eaten last night.  The scent of blood might have elicited a natural response that I\u2019d prefer remain hidden among my human subjects.  I gave voice to my first concern.  \u201cHow do you know this is Sir Henry?\u201d  I asked Tobias before we quite reached the others gathered around the bloody scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias said quietly,  \u201cThe head.\u201d  His voice was dramatically changed from his casual, usually optimistic tone, the notes flat like lead.  He raised an arm slightly and I followed the gesture.  \u201cIt\u2019s over there, near the trees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I saw was a cloth wrapped and bloodstained bundle at the base of a pine with several people gathered around, gawking at it.  I had little need to imagine what lay underneath.  A frown collected itself on my face.  The gravity of the situation, if in fact, the Knight truly had been slain, was not lost on me, at least in regards to the other humans whom I\u2019d been so involved with of late.  If the Knight had been killed in the village, I would have left the affair up to Tobias to deal with, however, this human had been brutally killed while in one of my most intimate and sheltered areas.  This was an affront to myself and my property in the least.  The thought of other humans mucking about in my private space made me shudder with revulsion, no matter what activities they chose to undertake there.  I paused just a moment, was I quite sure that other humans were necessarily involved?  \u201cHow far has the news spread already?\u201d  I asked Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked up at me with watery eyes.  The skin on his face had changed color again, becoming paler.  It was easy to forget just how young Tobias was.  \u201cMen were sent to the village the moment he was found.  There\u2019s no way this could be kept quiet, Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered my head until the tip of my nose could have brushed Tobias\u2019 shoulder.  The breath from my nostrils steamed in the cold, winter air.  This was a disaster, no doubt.  But did it really concern me?  The plans were made after all and all that remained to discuss was the relatively small matter of the tithe to Lord Dominic.  This Knight... like the rest of the humans would hardly be expected to have lived more than another few decades.  So what if he had died, perhaps being mauled to death by one of the bears in the area.  In the grand scope of things, my life and my destiny included, his life meant little.  I would shed no tears for the man; in fact, if he hadn\u2019t laid in so many pieces, I might have been tempted to \u201cdispose\u201d of the body myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... the knight lay dead in one of the deepest parts of my own private garden.  There could be unwanted associations made among my subjects if this weren\u2019t handled carefully.  Perhaps I should take a more active role in the investigation of Sir Henry\u2019s murder...</span></div></div>",

The fact that the Knight had been brutally slain in one of my private sanctuaries  was too much to ignore.  I would find the perpetrator of this crime and deliver unto him a Dragon\u2019s vengeance.  Ignoring the still-pale Tobias, I stepped forward into the turnabout surrounded by tall pines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, the humans who had gathered about and were conjecturing about the means and cause of the Knight\u2019s murder gave way before my bulk, driven, undoubtedly by the vibrations they felt in the ground for my heavy, deliberate steps.  Extending my neck, I sniffed the pile of gore which constituted the majority of the remains of the Knight.  The stench of blood threatened to override all the other scents.  I knew, from the few times that I\u2019d stored killed game, that the body was certainly fresh, killed last night at the latest.  By my best guess, I would have said that the Knight died in the earlier part of the evening; the smell of the torn guts was already well progressed.  I had not seen the head the humans had apparently discovered off to the side, but I knew after a few good sniffs that this was, in fact, Sir Henry.  His scent, smokey with whiskey lingering in the sweat, exuded from what remained of the torn clothing.  My eye-ridges raised and I snorted into the air.  Lowering my head so my nose snuffled against the dirt, I caught the scent of another human.  One who I did not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human around me were looking with wide eyes, much like rabbits.  Tobias came walking along my body as I sniffed about with my long neck.  I returned to him when he placed his hand on my leg.  \u201cYou seem as if you discovered something, My Lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled softly, \u201cThe scent of a man.  Not Sir Henry and not anyone I\u2019ve met from the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be the murderer!\u201d  exclaimed Tobias, announcing my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded once, not minding Tobias\u2019 tendency to state the obvious in this case.  After a few more steps around the area, I discovered the trail of the stranger leading into the turnabout from between the trees and exiting the same direction.  There were no footprints in the area, either human or dragon, for the dark brown soil was set with numerous cobbles to accommodate my weight, but the trail stood out to me nonetheless as if the perpetrator had left a trail of white paint behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to the tall trees between which the trail led.  I knew each, having excavated each of them, and all the others, from the forest myself.  It would be a shame to damage them by forcing my way through, just for the sake of a worthless human murderer.  I growled with frustration.  \u201cTobias.  Surely, you can smell this man.  His odor is very distinct.\u201d  I said, my head between the thick pine trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias alone remained near, the rest of the crowd having retreated to the far end of the clearing - a wise decision on their part as my tail was lashing, occasionally striking the ground in my agitation.  From where he usually stood to the side of my left shoulder, he said, \u201cI smell nothing but the pine trees... and Sir Henry.  I\u2019m sorry but humans can\u2019t follow an invisible trail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to take to the air and see if I could at least locate where this stranger had left the estate when Tobias spoke again.  \u201cBut, My Lord, I do believe that trained dogs can follow a trail of smell as you describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my head out from between the trees, shaking my horns free a a few caught branches.  \u201cHm...\u201d  I grumbled, doubtful that humans and their dogs could operate in this fashion.  The canine certainly had a capable nose - I\u2019d seen wolves track their prey for miles on end - but the dog could not talk and seemed as likely to chase a chicken as obey a command; I\u2019d discovered this much in my time among the humans.  \u201cRegardless, go fetch Richard and a good woodsman.  Perhaps the this man left a trail further out in the trees...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away, Master.\u201d  Tobias, the young Knight and the one human I trusted to be a faithful and competent servant, scurried off as quickly as his coating of thick furs would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left moments later, forcing the humans - the crowd seemed to be growing at an exponential rate despite the fact that this was supposed to be my private garden - to part again for my passage.  With the edge of my blade-like tail spur, I scraped the remains of Sir Henry along the ground and flung them wetly off into the trees to the side.     \u201cClean up this mess.\u201d I said to a woman who I knew to be among the staff that now maintained the grounds here.  The humans seemed shocked, but the devastated corpse had nothing more to tell me and since it was not fit for eating, it was only a stain dirtying my sleeping area and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of heading back to the amphitheater, I took a side trail and walked a spiraling path to another sleeping hollow.  I sat on my haunches and opened my mouth, pulling in a drought of cold winter air.  It was clean.  Using my tail, I scratched at an itch on the back of my neck and stretched my still sore wings; I\u2019d not be flying today if I could help it.  What had I been thinking, sleeping on my back!  The fact that this murder had happened during the several hours which remained a void in my mind could not be a coincidence.  What on earth could have happened that would have prompted this event?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer presented itself.  I paid minimal attention at best to the human affairs which did not directly affect me.  A horrifying thought occurred to me.  If I could not recall at all what had happened in those hours, it was possible, however remotely, that I could be somehow involved in the knight\u2019s murder and simply not remember it.  I had been so comfortable with the humans last night...  perhaps I said something that I oughtn\u2019t have?  I shook my head.  I was being paranoid.  Still, the absence of memory was a new and unsettling experience.  My mind made a number of unlikely scenarios to fill those lost hours to torment me.  I needed to make sure to limit myself in the future... no more than three barrels of drink on any one evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hastily made promise to myself was soon forgotten as I busied myself about what I should do next with Richard, my head of the militia, hopefully soon to be on the trail of the man whom I\u2019d smelled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An Act of War<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron Crestwell interlaced his fingers, leaning his forearms on the edge of the table as he looked up at the enormous bronze dragon before him.  \u201cLord Dominic was very concerned, to say the least.\u201d He said, speaking of my taking control of the tiny village of Devonshire.  \u201cEspecially the manner in which you have chosen to handle the situation...  It is quite unusual for a dragon is it not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rumbled deeply in my chest and I allowed more smoke to wisp from my nostrils, exhaust from my sulfurous twin fire-bladders at the base of my throat.  I spoke casually from my throat, my voice breathy and soft and gave an underhand gesture with my paw.  \u201cPerhaps it only seems unusual because your knowledge of dragons is limited.  We do tend to be quite... reclusive, when it comes to other races.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron Crestwell grinned like a shark.  \u201cI am not sure I would describe it as such... but I do understand what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my eyebrows, \u201cAnd what did Lord Dominic think of my apparent discrepancy in behavior?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron looked for a few seconds to Sir Kingsley at his left side.  When he turned his head forward again, he said, \u201cHe thought that it was gracious of you to take the time to learn something of our laws and how we conduct business and diplomacy as well as meeting us equals in the political field.  He thought also that you obviously have a benevolent streak as has been made clear by the open support you have obviously garnered among the village commoners and trades-folk.  However...\u201d  Now the Baron\u2019s voice dropped.  \u201cWhat you have done here by annexing the village of Devonshire cannot be counted less than an act of war against Lyrond.\u201d  Lord Thurman placed he meaty palms on the table\u2019s surface, a slight frown on his fat face.  The knights to either side gave no response, obviously they\u2019d known the Duke\u2019s instruction ahead of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was careful not to give any obvious reaction, though my wings may have twitched a little in my agitation.  The entire point of this exercise had been to prevent war.  There was a part of me that imagined dashing the table aside with my tail and charring the plump ambassador to a crisp while flattening each knight beneath my paws.  What could the humans do, anyway? Send an army of ants over the mountains?  \u2018Let them come!\u2019 my dragon-blood screamed.  And yet... here these humans were, having traveled this great distance to meet with me.  I realized that Baron Crestwell had not specifically stated yet that Lyrond was at war with me yet.  I mustered the calm I needed to respond from deep inside, \u201cHm...\u201d  I hummed as I considered the Baron\u2019s words, \u201cAnd still, Lord Dominic has sent you three here to my territory.  He could simply have sent back my messenger if he meant only to make war on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias glanced up at me around his shoulder, but with a look, I sent him turning back into place.  Baron Crestwell cupped his hands together.  \u201cVery prescient of you, Lord Ladonius.  The Duke of Lyandar wishes to settle this dispute without further bloodshed.  You have some idea of the resources we would need to devote to remove a fully grown dragon from an area as remote as this, I think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted a cloud, oily and black.  \u201cI think I do.\u201d  I said deeply, some of my normal voice coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his eyebrows, Baron Crestwell shrugged, grinning plainly.  \u201cThat is why we would like to spend the time that we will be inevitably trapped here discussing alternatives to open warfare between our two kinds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked away, studying the sea of faces on the tiers around me, taking in the discussion with almost complete silence.  \u201cYou mean between your kind and me.\u201d  I said, \u201cI can assure you that I acted independently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever the case may be,\u201d said the Baron, \u201cYou have extended courtesy towards us and while my Lord cannot accept your proposal out of hand, he has invested in me and my companions power to grant a certain number of compromises; one of which, I hope, you will find acceptable.\u201d  Lord Thurman gestured with a thick arm to the papers resting on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the human spoke again, I raised a claw, my curved talons pointing skyward.  Why hadn\u2019t I planned for this?  I had thought that by setting my claim in the way that humans did, I would resolve this matter quickly.  Was this hardly civilized valley really that important to the rest of Lyrond?  They certainly had done nothing as far as I knew to curb the casual predation of dragons on the area.  It seemed natural just to let me have it, just as a young dragon might claim a small area on the edge of an older dragon\u2019s territory or between two adjacent territories.  It usually wasn\u2019t worth the trouble of dislodging them... as long as they didn\u2019t overstep their bounds.  I wished that I had time alone to speak to Tobias.  Perhaps he had learned something in the larger city that would prove useful to me.  I said after opening the pause, \u201cLet us reopen this business after dinner.  The matter will settle easier on us all with full, comfortable stomachs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seemed to have said the right thing.  Baron Crestwell smiled widely, clapping a hand on the table, \u201cSplendid idea, my Lord!\u201d  The waiters came rushing forward unbidden, having been waiting for this moment.  In just a twinkling, the table was loaded high with food, the mugs refilled with local beer.  As for me, the roast pig, with only a few choice cuts removed was brought out steaming on a long wooden board.  The entrails were missing, but otherwise, it was simply delicious.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I studied Baron Crestwell\u2019s features far longer than I usually spent examining a new human\u2019s body shape and odor.  Particularly, I lingered on the man\u2019s face.  It was scarred from battle, that much was obvious, but I had never seen the sort of wound before.  The skin on the left side of his face was dark and thickened with scar tissue, especially about the neck.  However, there were no gashes or cuts as if from a blade, it was obviously some sort of burn, but not such as I\u2019d seen before and I had some experience with what fire was capable of doing to living flesh.  For one thing, despite being an old scar, it was quite irregular, especially for flame, being pot-marked with divots and small craters, stained black in the center.  I thought that it must have been excruciatingly painful, whatever sort of phenomenon had done that damage.  Automatically, my dragon instinct told me to yield the human some measure of respect.  Scarred dragons were not shunned in our society \u2013 such as it was, most dragons preferring a solitary existence or just the company of their mate \u2013 rather, their scars were often as badges of honor, making the dragon in question distinct and memorable as well as providing testament that said dragon had faced adversity and triumphed.  Baron Crestwell had obviously seen some hardship in his past.  As my eyes slid down, I noticed that emerging from the left sleeve of his simple, black attire was not a hand but a curved, three-pronged hook.  The Baron\u2019s own expression was severe as he studied my expansive form, but his eyes were softer perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet the delegate from Lord Dominic.\u201d  I rumbled softly.  I\u2019d grown used to speaking from my throat because when I spoke clearly, the sound was usually overpowering for a human in my direct presence.  Besides, Tobias had related to me that the breathy softness of my quiet voice was at once disarming in its mildness and intimidating in its mysterious otherworldliness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron emerged from his bow and stood as the Knights to his side bowed and introduced themselves.  Both Knights were taller than the Baron between them though not nearly as wide.  Sir Henry was a younger man, though still clearly much older than my Tobias.  He was blonde with blue eyes and a strong jaw.  He spoke with an accent that I hadn\u2019t heard before, but I basically nodded and agreed with what he said as I quickly attempted to decipher yet another alien presentation of the slave tongue.  Sir Kingsley was the oldest of the three.  He sported grey streaked brown hair proudly with a long, well brushed beard.  When he spoke, his voice was clear and methodical despite his tobacco stained teeth.  Sir Kingsley was quiet, and therefore dangerous.  Though both men were dressed in clothing, they each had decorated swords at their sides to indicate their status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, a table was brought forth for the delegates as well as chairs.  I continued to lounge easily on my side, occasionally stretching a leg when I wanted to remind my guests that I was more than just my animated head on my long, bronze-scaled neck.  With a twitch of my finger, I invited Tobias to sit on my wrist, but my servant declined silently, remaining standing instead.  Could it be that my young majordomo did not want to appear childlike in front of the important men?  Perhaps he had grown up during the months he\u2019d been away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow procuring a leather scroll case, Tobias popped off the lid and removed none other than my proclamation of sucession.  It was only a little worse for wear as the young man smoothed it out over the table\u2019s surface.  A waiter decanted wine for the three men from a silver pitcher as Baron Crestwell removed several a sheaf of other documents from his robes, carefully untying the leather thong that bound them and exhibiting an incredible deftness with his prosthetic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias caught me eyeing the goblets of the men at the table, the bouquet rising from their contents intrigued me.  However my servant delivered terrible news.  \u201cMy Lord, I regret to say that we broke open the last cask of Sir Ronald\u2019s wine for this occasion.  I don\u2019t think there would be enough left to more than wet your tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Tobias.  I\u2019ve never had wine anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry lifted his head from the Baron\u2019s shifting of documents.  \u201cWhat is this?  Are you saying that you\u2019ve never had a drop of the shine before?\u201d  I gave the barest shake of my head.  The Knight pushed his goblet away.  \u201cThen I shall not imbibe where our host cannot.\u201d  Sir Henry looked across the table to his counterpart.  Sir Kingsley looked up at my, my scaled head rising over the table and then back to his glass.  He pushed his away as well.  Baron Crestwell was left to the last, but he did not bother to move his goblet.  However, he had not reached for it when it was presented, nor did he resist or offer any sign of discontent when it was removed, so I was left uncertain whether the man had even intended to drink, let alone how he felt about sacrificing his portion for his dragon host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry smiled and looked to Tobias despite the Baron\u2019s ambilivance.  He gestured with a hand to the three large goblets.  \u201cSee if you can mix these with whatever is left of the barrel.  Surely we there will be a thimbleful left for Lord Ladonius.\u201d  Tobias was quick to move.  When his goblet had been taken away, Sir Ronald lowered his head and muttered, \u201cWhat a life\u2026 forever sober.  Must be hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head oddly as I looked down at the younger Knight.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\u201d  I confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Henry snorted and raised a finger, \u201cWhich is exactly my point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias returned toting a small cauldron which sloshed gently with its contents as the young man walked smoothed back to us.  As Tobias moved, I heard hushed conversation from the tiers around us.  It had already gotten around that the dragon was to have his first taste of alcohol.  I didn\u2019t know why it was such a big deal.  True to Sir Henry\u2019s words, the cauldron was little more than a thimble to me.  Still, I\u2019d seen Richard often enough in his moments of weakness, his stumbling, and his slurring of speech.  I wondered if the tiny concoction could possibly have the same effect on me.  I was suddenly apprehensive about the whole matter.  What if my thoughts were clouded, just when the discussion of Devonshire\u2019s future was about to be opened in a matter that would either so completely succeed or fail that the delegates left immediately, or far more likely, would stretch on through all the long months of winter.  Sir Henry looked at me expectantly as the cauldron with the village\u2019s last store of wine was delivered.  I lifted it from Tobias\u2019 grasp gently between my short thumb and first finger.  I sniffed it again and was amazed at the complexity of the odor, which, unlike Lord Thurman\u2019s hostile concoction of colognes blended together harmoniously, almost like the wine was singing to my nose.  I swirled it a bit and them emptied the contents onto my tongue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact it should be an honor to serve you and you can swiftly teach others this simple truth; in fact, out right worship might not be out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sky-Swallower:</u>  So named because when you take to the air, your wings seem to swallow the sky to lesser earth-bound mortals.  An enormous breed of dragon, your strength is matched only by the Juggernaut, and your sheer size by none.  You and your kin have often been mistaken for small hills while you lay dormant in hibernation.  You bulk is such that it can literally flatten a small village under it.  All that bulk means a big appetite, however, so big in fact, that you have to spend the majority of your year in a state of hibernation to conserve energy.  But the more food you can get your giant claws on, the less time you have to spend sleeping and the more time you can spend chasing down loot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Screeching Ridgeback:</u> As a rare kind of social dragon, what you lack in brute strength, size and speed, you make up with an ability to cooperate with your fellows.  Growing up in a mountain colony, you learned that while individual strength is important, you also learned how to be a team player.  Of course, you yourself aren't satisfied with being in the background are you?  Otherwise you wouldn't have a story to tell!  You don't breathe fire, but instead can emit a piercing screech that will travel for miles and allows long distance communication with others of your kind.  At close range, the decibels you can generate are disabling and potentially fatal for humanoids.  Larger dragons might be more trouble but you can certainly disorient them and who knows what you can accomplish by working together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Seraphan:</u> A more majestic breed of dragon you will have difficulty finding on the planet than the Saraphen. However, this breed of dragon is almost never glimpsed by earth-bound mortals. The sky to a Saraphan is more than a convenient way to get around, it is there one and true home. The average Saraphan, in fact, only touches the ground when it dies; they are born, live and breed all in the soaring heights above the clouds. Though it may be rumor, some Saraphen are said to grow to magnificent sizes, such that their wings from tip to tip would cover an entire estate. What is not rumor, however, is the clear fact that for their size, the Saraphen weigh extremely little, able to float on the breezes as the feathers that cover their bodies. You might wonder what it is that you eat if you never set your clawed feet on the ground, well the answer also lies in the sky for unlike any other dragon, you feed off the glory of the sun herself and in the distant heights above the clouds, you never have a want for food. Always a stunning, glowing white, a Saraphan is a glorious specimen of dragonkind sporting not one but two pairs of feathered wings, in fact, most of your kind tend to look down on other dragons who spend only part of their time in the sky and rarely ever enter into your lofty domain. As for other beings\u2026 well, have you ever paused in your stride to avoid stepping on an ant? I didn\u2019t think so. While not truly aggressive, a Saraphan will never back down from a proper challenge, attacking with their claws, complete mastery of flight and vastly superior speed. Also, the Sarahen tend to hold grudges as well as the angels to which they are often compared. There is no getting off their shit-list once a Saraphan has decided that you have wronged them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Really, the only option is to take charge and show them a better way of living...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon will you be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Sky-Swallower:</u>  So named because when you take to the air, your wings seem to swallow the sky to lesser earth-bound mortals.  An enormous breed of dragon, your strength is matched only by the Juggernaut, and your sheer size by none.  You and your kin have often been mistaken for small hills while you lay dormant in hibernation.  You bulk is such that it can literally flatten a small village under it.  All that bulk means a big appetite, however, so big in fact, that you have to spend the majority of your year in a state of hibernation to conserve energy.  But the more food you can get your giant claws on, the less time you have to spend sleeping and the more time you can spend chasing down loot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Screeching Ridgeback:</u> As a rare kind of social dragon, what you lack in brute strength, size and speed, you make up with an ability to cooperate with your fellows.  Growing up in a mountain colony, you learned that while individual strength is important, you also learned how to be a team player.  Of course, you yourself aren't satisfied with being in the background are you?  Otherwise you wouldn't have a story to tell!  You don't breathe fire, but instead can emit a piercing screech that will travel for miles and allows long distance communication with others of your kind.  At close range, the decibels you can generate are disabling and potentially fatal for humanoids.  Larger dragons might be more trouble but you can certainly disorient them and who knows what you can accomplish by working together?</span></div></div>",

Yet what was known of Kinguard was that it was immense covering so much of land so as to act as a natural barrier between the northern and southern kingdoms and only had one single point of \"safe\" travel between the two. With safe being a relative term considering that the trail leading threw the mountains was always swept away by rock slides and avalanches and constantly under the predations of the unsavory side of civilization. But there was one safe place among the path between the mountains the city of Cragslaid, a city built into the walls of the mountain with walls stretching between the large gap between the eastern and western portion of the Kinguard mountains. Cragslaid has long withstood the test of time and has constantly passed threw many hands with none holding claim to it for longer then it took another to take it. Yet now was a \"calm\" cycle for Cragslaid as none were openly trying to claim it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as for you. You lived in one of the many valley's and long having already staked your claim for it several centuries prior and have lived there for the majority of your adult life. Your valley used to be an untamed jungle filled with prized hunting the likes of which you couldn't complain about. Yet now it has become the home of several humanoid villages you have tried the best you can to simply leave them be yet due to the nature of humanoids to be fearful of that which they do not know. Many of them have tried to remove your presence some even to the point where their whole village had gathered arms against you. Yet even with their combined might they would still fail and thus several of the villages have been removed from your valley by your own claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not all of them feared you as you have on countless times saved several villages from dangers where they could not handle. Thus you had earned they're respect and in some cases love. Many of them have already asked you to move from your lofty home in the mountains to stay within the valley which you gave a quick refusal you simply couldn't bear to loose the lofty spot you had claimed as it provided you a view of your whole valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you woke you noticed that it was now midday and as you stretched you couldn't help but look out over your valley. You could make out every human settlement within your valley and tell which had expanded and which had simply abandoned their homes to join another of the villages as they left their previous one to simply return to the jungle a fact which you very much appreciated. Opening your wings you readied to take flight and take your fill so to keep your massive frame moving taking in the scenery before you closing your eyes then leapt from where you were and fell towards the ground below feeling the wind rush by. Then pulling up you could feel as your entire body adjusted from the drop to the sudden leveling out. Gliding you looked for something to eat and found what you were looking for. Letting a tooth filled grin settle upon your face you swooped down as you grabbed four large wild boars they would keep you going for the next couple of days. After eating your meal you returned to your flight above the valley keeping a watchful eye over all within it, even the ungrateful ones that would hate and fear you regardless of anything you told them otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you flew by one of the villages which was now growing into a well developed city you noticed them cry out not in fear or terror at the sight of you but actually in praise and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the Melurians it would seem they have prospered in the few months I have hibernated.\" you thought to your self flying by them dipping a wing to show you had heard them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet not wishing to waste your energy you returned to your home up in the mountains where you saw a rather peculiar sight. A small band of humans had braved the journey up the mountains to see you curios as to their intent you landed slowly and gracefully so as to not  blow them away but so that you could also impress them. After all who didn't enjoy a little praise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to what do I owe the honor of this visit?\" you asked your deep voice rumbled threw the mountain side as the humans bowed the looked up again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great and honorable one!\" shouted one of the humans as if you couldn't hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have come to you beseeching a favor!\" he cried out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A favor? And how many times do I have to tell you that you don't have to keep calling me 'Oh Great and Honorable one'? Use my name already will you I promise it wont offend me.\" you sigh shaking your head at their use of that title<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Very well then. Lord Martelus we have come here seeking a favor from you!\" The human shouted saying your name though still adding in a title which still annoyed you to a small extent but no where near as much as the previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well and what exactly is this favor you seek from me?\" you ask laying your head down in front of them as you laid down so as to hear his request<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Martelus our city has reached the point where if it were to reach any larger it would actually come to the attention of the lords outside of your valley.\" the man informed you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just spread your people out there are abandoned villages scattered threw out this valley.\" you informed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord I don't think it will be as simple as you think it might be. For even if we do spread out there will still be the influx of more people coming to your valley which will still draw the attention of the lords out side of it.\" the human said speaking up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again seriously use my name. And what of them? I have no quarrel with them if they seek to take my home from me I shall show them the folly of their ways.\" you said lifting your head looking out over your valley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Martelus if the Lords outside this valley take attention of it they will see it without a ruling Lord and seek to add it to their domain. For I know that you do not have use of the materials within this valley but many of them are very valuable to the lands outside and will cause quite a stir to claim them.\" the human informed you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So name one of your own as a lord then if it so pleases you.\" you almost yelled back understanding where this was heading and truly not liking it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would Lord Martelus yet it seemed right to give you the chance to assume the title of \"Lord\" over our city and the other cities within the valley as you were the first one here and have been a major influencing power in each of their developments.\" the human said repeating that which you already knew<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would you and the other cities be so willing to have \"me\" a nonhuman be your Lord especially since most of the other cities aren't especially happy that I live so close to them?\" you asked him trying to figure out why they would ask you to do something that any human would leap at the chance for<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Martelus again you have shaped our lives since we have settled here. You have settled disputes between our cities that seemed to be unsolvable and have defended us numerous times from dangers. How many of our kind do you know of that can claim to have done the same?\" the human asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name human?\" you asked facing him bringing your head yards from his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.. my name is Rizthovk.\" he stated gulping as your head completely filled his vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then Rizthovk. I shall think upon your request and shall give you my answer upon a weeks time. Where upon I shall visit you city Meluria and inform you of my choice. Now leave you have given me much to think upon Rizthovk\" you said retracting you head and returning to look out upon your valley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then Lord Martelus we shall await your arrival in a weeks time.\" Rizthovk said bowing with the rest of his fellows before departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the humans departed your mind was set a buzz as you went over all the possibilities of being a \"Lord\" over a size able human settlement if the size of your valley was anything to go by. You would be in charge of one of the largest independent city states within the Kinguard mountain's. Yet that would also make you a bigger target to all the other dragons in the mountains who seeked such promising lands such as your own as well as the wrath of any human lord who found an offense to you a dragon ruling over humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again you could increase your already sizable hoard which you had stashed away within the mountains where none but you knew where it was located. Not to mention the foods that could be prepared for you on a call! Sure Boar and Xlith tasted great raw but the human's seemed to captured and increase their flavors ten fold when they 'cooked' it. That alone made your mouth water at the prospect, noticing that dusk had arrived you set out one last time to find and capture one last meal before you took a brief nap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to think upon the matter you decided to fly outside of your valley to take a look at the world around to try and get an idea of what was happening in the world. Needles to say your flight did not go unnoticed by those that also lived in the Kinguard mountains ensuring that no potential rivals would try to claim your valley in your absence you made sure to stop by some of your friends who lived close by. Though close was a relative term to dragons as anything that could be cover in a days flight as your territory. And considering how much you could cover in a single day your territory would in effect cover quite a bit of land. So any communication between you and your friends was actually quite rare in human terms was actually rather often for a dragon however it still did well to at least give them a fair warning that you would be crossing into their territory soon which you had done by giving a loud enough roar that would be sure to reach them wherever they were at that moment and have them come flying to intercept you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited at the edge of your territory and that of your friends standing there waiting you turned your head to get a good look at the surroundings as it never hurt to observe the area around you. About an hour after giving the warning you noticed several figures approaching in the distance from the southern side came a wing of brown green and various other colored dragons that would be your Ridgeback friend Corlus and what you guessed were a small group of his friends from their clan. From the northern side came two green dragons that flew in a tight cluster your \"friend\" Gelna' Melsa the twins with a bond that allowed them to pretty much read the other mind and know what the other was doing. Though you always had trouble trying to talk to either one of them they had to issue and were understanding of the difficulty most dragons had when talking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Corlus nice to see you again.\" you said nodding your head towards him and his fellows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to see you again Martelus it has been how long since you visited?\" Corlus asked with a smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been a while hasn't it?\" you said agreeing \"Ah Gelna' Melsa it's a pleasure to see you two again.\" you said bowing to the two sisters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Martelus.\" they answered in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you crossing threw our territories Martelous?\" asked the twins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah to business then? Very well then. Believe it or not those humans who decided to call my valley their home have decided to try and name me their 'ruler' so they don't have to deal with some lord from the lands outside the valley.\" you told them after all if you couldn't trust your friends then who can you trust?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be joking right?\" asked Corlus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's serious Corlus. He's not making any of his usual movements when he's joking.\" the twins said amazed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I thought it was a joke as well but they were genuinely serious about it believe it or not. And then I got thinking that if I turned them down and those lords from outside the valley found an interest in them, I would never hear the end of it as they would constantly try to conquer them and attempt to push me out of my own territory. And we all know that when humans work together even they can over power a dragon. So I want to avoid such a possibility and need to learn just what is going on in the world outside our mountains.\" you told them looking to each<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Martelous you always wanted to be the ruler of something here's your chance. But do you really think this is a smart idea? I mean there are so many things involved with ruling are you sure your up to the task?\" asked Corlus it was a genuine question after all he was the clan leader of his clan of Ridgebacks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so after all it cant be that hard can it? I mean come on their humans not orc's or troll's they can think for themselves. And any reason for me to even get involved in their affairs would be if something dire were to happen.\" you said not truly worried about this ruler job as you probably should have been<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Martelous but remember this your going to have more challengers for your lands soon then as well and they aren't going to be just from humans. But from other dragons as well, sure you might be able to fend them off but what about their damages to those under your charge? Being in charge means more then simply being able to insert yourself at the right moment or being able to diffuse situations between those under your care. You also have to ensure their safety, which you cant always provide and you know it after all you do have to hibernate for a time and during which challengers will come and wreak havoc amongst your charges.\" Corlus pointed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess I would just have to ensure that they are capable to hold their own should they need to defend themselves I guess.\" you said actually not having thought of having to defend them full time a role you knew you wouldn't be able to fill as you hibernated not only to conserve your energy but to also allow the valley to reproduce and replace the creatures you would consume to keep yourself up and mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Martelous I am not going to stop you from becoming the \"Lord\" over the humans in your valley but I would strongly suggest you consider finding someone to help you defend it.\" Corlus finished giving you a look of all seriousness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of you Gelna' Melsa? Any words of wisdom from you two?\" you asked jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually we do.\" They answered in unison as you cringed inwardly \"Seeing as how your valley is quite large you might want to consider actually finding a way to get message between one side to the other otherwise you'll find yourself bogged down with request's to get word moved between places of contact.\" they said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it?\" you asked hopeful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we suggest you heed Corlus warning and advice. And we believe we might have an idea on how to address it yet it would probably be best for you to hear it after your trip to the human lands.\" they suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery well then anything else?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" they answered in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then Corlus if it is alright with you I will go threw you territory to the southern human lands.\" you asked with a nod towards Corlus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is alright just please be mindful of the young ones they have yet to see one of your kind Martelous and will probably be more then a little curious.\" Coruls said with a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I had best be off thank you you two for your advice shall we meet here in about a weeks time?\" you asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly\" Corlus said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitly\" replied Gelna' Melsa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you all separated with Corlus returning to his clan and the twins to whatever they did. You traveled south visiting the human lands to the south and finding them in a relative state of peace as they seemed more focused on other things that you were not a part of. Though what you did notice was that the humans and other humanoid creatures like elves dwarves and some places orc's actually worked together. And in even rarer cases you saw your fellow dragons working with humanoids inside vast cities which made your valley look small in comparison and it was small by no stretch of the word. Yet you got the general impression that it might be a good idea to allow other dragons to live within your territory, if only to provide protection in the form of numbers yet you highly doubted you would have to worry about defending your valley from harm yet. However you did not put the idea out of your head and made a note to tell Corlus of a plan you had hatched in your head which Corlus had no doubt had a hand in planting in your head when you meet him at the start of your little journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you flew back to the Kinguard mountains after having made a few new friends in the lands to the south. Traveling threw the mountains you crossed threw Corlus's territory again went threw Gelna' Melsa's territory to the lands in the north. In the northern lands I found about the same thing as I did in the south only the humanoids were less cooperative with each other yet still seemed to heed their dragon allies. And after my visit there I decided to return to my home and give Rizthovk the answer he was waiting for so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeluria wasn't to terribly big of a city yet however it had the makings of one and already the signs that the city was growing and rapidly were evident to all who cared to notice. Yet they would go about their day's working as they normally did yet when you appeared above and blotted out the sky of their city all work halted as you gracefully lowered yourself to the ground listening to their praise. Ah what a wonderful sound you could get used to this! Thus when Rizthovk came out to greet you you gave him an answer finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have considered and thought over your offer Rizthovk. And I am pleased to tell you and all your people that I accept your offer as \"Lord\" over the human cities in this valley.\" you said with a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedles to say they're reaction was quite predictable yet not unfounded. And you couldn't help but find yourself smiling as well when everyone began to cheer and celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations 'Lord' Martelous\"</span></div></div>",

Though whether they were genuinely 'happy' that their new ruling power was a dragon or just simply playing the part. Was actually something rather difficult to distinguish thanks to something the humans called alcohol which seemed to make things happier to whoever consumed it which you did and in the amounts that would have killed a normal human. However when everything was said and done you were officially named the ruler over the cities and villages within your valley which the humans now called Fangoath seeing as you had never really thought of giving your valley a name previously always going by the name of valley easily accepted the new name for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the ceremony was completed everyone spent the next day recovering while you spent it flying threw Fangoath to see just exactly how many human cities were actually within your valley. And to your surprise there were actually quite a few of them that were well on their way to reaching the size of which Meluria was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem there are more of these humans then I had originally thought.\" you thought to yourself flying over one of the cities below<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reaching the other side of your valley when you heard the heads up yell coming from Corlus\u2019s direction. Turning you headed to meet Corlus and speak with him and Gelna\u2019 Melsa about a plan that would increase all our territories while providing us each with something we severely lacked. Both Corlus and the twins were already waiting for you talking with each other as you landed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy that look upon your face it would seem you accepted and have been coming to know your people?\u201d asked the twins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have.\u201d You answered here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then have you considered what we said last we spoke?\u201d Corlus asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have. And after taking my quick trip to visit the human lands out side of our mountains I have to say there is Corlus not taking your idea seriously would be worse then reckless. The humans and dragons have learned to actually work together and built cities the size of which not even I could stand against.\u201d You admitted which was something not most dragons did admitting something was stronger then them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then you\u2019re going to do something about keeping your people safe so how are you going to go about doing it?\u201d Corlus asked a smile barely creeping up onto his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorlus if you weren\u2019t my friend I would swear you were trying to manipulate me. But however as it is yes I do have a plan and I would like for you both to come visit me in my territory so I can better discuss it with not only you but with the others as well. Trust me this is going to make all of us very happy in the end.\u201d You said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a month later found you with several other dragons gathered within your territory sure there were a few high strung tensions as some still held grudges or dislikes for another yet none were willing to attack under one of the ancient draconic rites which you had invoked upon inviting each of them. The rite itself demanded that any and all hatred be put aside for a time being so that any gathering of dragons could work together towards a common goal. And those that did not observe it were to be considered outcast of draconic society as a whole. So gathered before you were gathered many different types of dragons. There were Corlus\u2019s Screeching Ridgebacks as well as Gelna\u2019 Melsa and several other Geminate Drake\u2019s that they knew. But there were also several Fire Lord Dragons, Earth-Render\u2019s, Regal Bronze\u2019s, and Mountain Shadow\u2019s gathered as well and after what seemed like an eternity of greetings things finally got into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then I know you all know the reason I have asked you to come here under one of our sacred rites as dragons. But I would like to share an idea with all of you that will be beneficial to all of us.\u201d You said loud enough for all to hear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last several centuries we have all managed to live with each other with relative peace. And have also done so with some of the younger races that also inhabit these mountains however what I propose will change all that.\u201d You said looking at all of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecently I took a trip and visited the human lands to the south and to the north and saw how they had banded together with the other races including our fellow dragons in grand cities that would be able to outstrip all of us alone.\u201d You informed them and as you had expected many of them were already arguing that was not possible and untrue and many variations of disagreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know certainly none of us is glad to hear such news however must take a closer look at what their joining together actually means as a whole. For one with the cooperation of so many races together in one place they are able to accomplish things far more easier then they would on their own. For example Trazja I know for a fact you and your flight have fallen upon hard times where the subject of food is required. However within these cities the humans and other younger races work together and provide vast amounts of food for their dragon counterparts.\u201d You said nodding towards the rather diminutive Fire Lord<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrazja seemed rather agitated at your mentioning of a problem he could not settle on his own Yet he didn\u2019t say anything as though he was agitated by that he was still impressed at the thought of food able to sustain him and his flight, as the area they lived in wasn\u2019t really the best of hunting locations. And there were several other dragons as well who shared the same plight which was inevitably why there were so many disputes for territory with prime hunting grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever such benefits such as food enough to keep your families feed do not come cheap or easily for even those cities had dangers they faced. Yet even there the benefits of working with the younger races showed threw. For though the dragons provided much of the strength and backing of their military the younger races provided them with armor to ensure that no weapon could even come close to scratching their hides. And even better still there were members of the younger races that also volunteered to be apart of their military and protect their city along side their draconic allies.\u201d You informed them looking towards the gathered dragons to them the thought of making their already impregnable hides even stronger simply filled most of their ego's. Yet there were still a few things that needed to be addressed as well as a few others that needed to be convinced before any would agree to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was also one thing I noticed about these cities where both dragons and the younger lived races were able to share with their combined might and intelligence. They were also able to provide the kind of protection for their own that we as hatchling's could only dream of! Imagine being able to raise your family from tiny hatchling's to full grown adults and not have to worry about having anything threatening their safety. Our children would be raised to know all that we know given every chance possible to reach their fullest potential. Where you can also can become that old wyrm who has seen not only his childrens children. But also their children's children and you would be there to see them grow from the young hatchling to the adult that would make any parent proud.\" you told them already you could see many of the gathered females eye's glow at the prospect at being able to raise a family when ill fated seasons had wiped out entire nests of unhatched hatchling's or with the bold scavengers sneaking off with the young eggs. Or worse the other creatures that lived within the mountains that preyed upon the young dragons as well. That in itself was enough to win over a majority of the gathered dragons yet you sensed there were still a few who you knew wanted some way to increase their already exorbitantly sized hordes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly the revenue from working with the younger lived races would be as such that you would be barely able to count any of it within your life time.\" you said with a knowing smile looking at the few who you knew to be out for nothing more then the treasure and loot making them rather easy to control with a price<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what say you all? Any against this idea please give your voice now.\" you asked looking at the gathered dragon's and were surprised when none made any noise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in favor of?\" you asked tilting your head slightly and were taken back by the sudden chorus of resounding \"AYE!\" from the gathered dragons before you. So with a smile you looked upon all those gathered before you and gave one resounding bugle which the others followed suite making the sound carry forever onwards threw the mountains telling all that a new power had emerged and was willing to face the coming hardships together as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several years went by with a blur as you and your fellow dragons worked together with the humans and various other inhabitants of the Kinguard mountains that inhabited the now newly formed territory known as \"Yurith\" with the capital being Meluria inside your valley Fangoath correction it was no longer just your valley but also that of every dragon that inhabited  Yurith as well as that of the humans, elves, dwarves and orc's and any other race that had the capacity to realize that refusal to join meant their being cast out of Yurith. But one thing was for certain you had created something that would undoubtedly succeed you long after you had joined the ancestors.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next fifty years it took all the combined efforts of all the dragons within the newly made Yurith to convince all the other race's that lived within its lands to join and make Yurith an contendable state to match the other kingdoms outside the Kinguard Mountains. Somehow though all the seperate races of human dwarf elf and Orc were brought together to work together on a common ground. Of course it wasnt all peace and flowers even after the agreement as many simply choose to work on their own ignoreing the others. So it was inevitable that the arise of discord and unrest was so prevelant within the first years of Yuriths founding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany such trouble spots was between the elves and dragons as one or the other could not stand the other. The elves unable to stand dragons being superior to them in just about everything and would always bend and break the laws of established magical theory by thery very pressence. While some dragons just couldnt stand the vainity cursed elves that seemed to want just a little more power and had threw ages past used parts of slain dragons to achive their ends even for such trivial a task such as flying! And those were just the tip of the crimes commited against dragon kind that the elves had done and that was only to adult dragons never mind the children or hatchlings or eggs! So it was to no small concession that any of the dragons had agreed to allow the elves into Yurith rather then simply pursuing them and crushing them from exsistance for past wrongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue there were hot spots all over with Humans and Orc's or Dwarves and merchents yet none were as explosive as one encounter between the elves and dragons as that which happened barely five years after the agreement of all races within Yurith to work together and put past greviencies behind them. For an rather sizeable community of elves living within Yuriths many mountainous trails had attacked and captured a dragon against all agreed rules and regulations as had been agreed upon by even their leaders. Needles to say many of the dragons were not happy and demmanded retribuition of the elves who had disregarded the agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in an attempt to reduce tensions to a more tolerable level and to prevent any further blood shed then had already occured. You flew to the offending community of elves with Corlus and the twins Gelna' Melsa as aide should anything go amiss which you hoped didnt yet you couldnt shake the feeling that before this event was said and done some one's blood would be stainning the ground before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats the plan Martelus?\" Asked Gelna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple go in go in demand the release of the captured dragon and an make sure that those responsible are held accountable.\" Melsa said with an agitated growl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Melsa we cannot simply go in and demand we need to confront and talk to them and resolve this peacefully there cannot be anymore blood shed!\" Corlus said staring at the two<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually we are going to have to do both ensure the freedom of the captured dragon and the transfer of the offending elves into custody so that they can be given a fair hearing back in Meluria all while ensuring we do not cause the spilling of any blood.\" you told them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just have to go the hard path dont you Martelus?\" asked Gelna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and I am glad to have you three with me.\" you said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There that should be where the elves are located at.\" you said nodding to a plateu on the side of a mountain where there was a forest and smoke coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it the scouts said they spotted the elves here previously.\"Corlus said taking note of their location<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we know where the elves are where's the dragon?\" you asked yourself looking all over for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can ask those elves when we land.\" Melsa said as you closed in on the plateu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several minutes went by in a blur as you and Corlus and Gelna' Melsa were suddenly hit with a massive hail storm that had gale force winds and were beginning to batter everyone's wings. Gelna' Melsa were almosted tossed into the mountain side by the strength of the winds but seeing their being tossed around you put you massive size and large wings to make a sort of wind breaker for them to stabilize while Corlus flew to your other side so that you all formed a wedge. Landing on a spot close to the plateu you noticed that the storm itself seemed to be increasing in ferocity and if it didnt pass soon even you would not be able to resist the winds that it had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into that cave!\" you roared over the screaming winds as you pointed out a hole in the mountain side As all three of you rushed into it you noticed you wouldnt be able to fit into it due to your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well atleast I can make a great door stop</i> you thought to yourself rushing to the cave and hoping that the side of you left out in the storm didnt get to badly injured<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was in and you had your body jammed against the entrance were glad you had grown some over the last few years. As you had grown into quite the dragon as you were now as long as twelve house's from head to tail with a wing span nearly double that, while standing taller then a five story buidling at the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Stone Grey scales were harder then any rock found within the Kinguard mountains and impervious to just about any form of physical attack. Magic had little effect over your magic resistant scales as nothing short of a major spell would manage to get threw them. Yet even that was not enough to keep the cold at bay as though your body kept the cold from getting in to the cave you were still exposed to the freezeing winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some one make a fire quickly other wise i'm going to freeze\" you asked looking at the other three<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked at each other and nodded and breathed a small flame of green over your body that didnt hurt yet still kept you warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There that should see you threw the storm.\" Gelna said with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great roasted dragon. Get some rest hopefully the storm passes tomorrow and we can continue to those elves.\" you said looking to them for an agreement which they did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sont-ils all\u00e9s?\" asked an elf from one of the trees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"La temp\u00eate a d\u00fb les effrayer mieux avertir les anciens.\" answered another elf from the ground below the tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Venez nous laisser ici.\" said the elf on the ground as both elves left the edge of the forest to head in deeper to the woods</span></div></div>",

Your rule must be solitary and your very name enough to strike fear into those whose bodies your clawed feet tred upon.  Fear is your only ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon will you be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.  A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.  And that suits them just fine.  Always solid black, you are a hunter of the night and while you can see into the blackest abyss, your eyes are sensitive to bright lights without the time to acclimate.  A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Fire-Lord</u>:  You are a bit scrawny for a typical dragon and almost half the normal size standing at a mere nine feet at the shoulder.  None dare mock your skinny frame or over-sized wings however as the bulbous sacs to either side of the base of your neck contain liquid, molten death.  With your breath weapon, you can lay waste to your foes from afar, but be careful, even your supply of fire isn't indefinite.  Those huge flames sacs take a lot of nutrition to sustain, however, giving you an appetite equal to a quite large dragon.  Elaborate coat markings of black, red, orange and even yellow give this breed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Mountain's Shadow:</u> The classical \"dragon\" mountain caves are where your kind dwell and carve out sometimes elaborate living spaces.  You kind tends to keep away from humans, but the \"hands-off\" approach just isn't for you.  Why make a life of dining on deer and tough, chewy mountain goats when there are fat cattle and sheep in the low lands for the taking; and that's not even mentioning the loot!  Above average size, your kind comes in many colors and patterns from earth-tones to vibrant primary colors.  While the horns on your head are decorative and mainly to attract mates, the six spikes on your tail are all business.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some call you mad, but they just don't understand your genius!  Meddling into the unseen forces behind the world might sound dangerous, but you really know what you're doing right?  Well... there'll be time to sort things out later even if you do make a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Vishian Drake:</u> Also known as the \"wizard's drake\" yours is one of the most poorly understood breeds of dragon.  Smaller than average, your teeth and claws are well suited to your body and not over-sized like some of the more combat oriented breeds.  Your scaly hide comes in watery colors of blue, green and even silver.  Your wings are a marvel, appearing as crystalline webbing between the digits of your wings.  Your fiery breath is mediocre at best, but your best trait and the one you are known for is the ability to disappear at will.  In a process that you don't understand fully yourself, you can slip into a shadowy \"in-between\" to evade your pursuers, becoming invisible and untouchable.  The world remains around you and you cannot pass through solid objects, but its inhabitants vanish and you are surrounded as if by mists.  Reappearing becomes more difficult the longer you remain away so don't linger in your shadowy haven!  Beware wizards because your kind are highly sought as the best of familiars.  You don't want to lose your freedom do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Crovey</u>:  The Crovey are a species of dragon with a reputation almost as dreadful as the feared Deathwing and whose reality is definitely more horrifying for the average mortal. The ancestral home of this breed of dragon is a vast underground cave complex, which exists under an equally vast mountain range commonly referred to as Umbra veil (Land of Shadow) by the dwarves and other beings. The Crovey, if you ever get a chance to see one, are slender of build, almost sickly and possess a short wingspan, which is more suited for short bursts of flight or assisted leaping than prolonged gliding. Boney spurs at the elbows aid in self-defense and another spur at the end of the tail curves upwards as the dragons are known to strike over their heads rather like a scorpion. They lack the ability to breathe fire so it would seem on the surface that they would be forgettable. However, living in the dark these hardy fiends gained a unique ability to sense the life force of others at a distance, and even to feed upon it directly. Similar to a pit viper\u2019s sense of the body heat of its victims, the presence of life \u201cglows\u201d for the Crovey in the dark of their world. With time, their auras have grown incredibly malleable and they are able to extend it at will far from their bodies, thus are they able to feed on the life force of others, assuming the dragon can overpower the spirit, of their intended prey. If a Crovey cares to be subtle, their prey can begin to weaken and die without ever knowing the dragon was present at all. The Crovey do not eat, but do require a steady source of fresh water. They can feed on any form of life, even cave mold and fungus can be sustaining in times of famine, however, living creatures usually have the most abundant life force.</span></div></div>",

The whole problem might have just gone away right then and there, but as you had guessed, the man had prepared several potent wards about his person.  Just as it seemed your fire was about to come into contact with the man's body, it was bifurcated as if by a sudden wind and passed harmlessly to either side of the man.

In time, she settled onto her haunches and the wizard, for his part, sat down cross-legged on the leafy mattress of the forest floor while both parties waited to see if the chase would continue or be ended today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Vishian Dragoness came up with her answer, the man asked.  \"If you do not mind, it would be a great honor for me to know your name, fair dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female dragon rumbled deeply in her long, thin neck.  Her slit-pupiled eyes turned towards the man, \"Names hold great power as you must know, Human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trade then?  You may call me Virgil.\" said the young wizard with an open palm gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness turned her head sideways, still wary.  Just as it seemed she would not answer, however, she spoke.  \"You may call me Narcissa... Virgil.\" she added a tad late, catching the human's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute more passed and then Virgil asked, \"Have you considered my proposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa bared her fangs again, \"Do not rush me, mage!\"  However, she knew in her dual hearts that at this point she was simply dawdling.  She was tired of running... bone tired.  As a female, in order to mate, she had to have a stable territory and defend it from encroachers.  She could not simply flit about like an empty-headed male, waiting to stumble into a possible suitor.  She needed a <i>home.</i>  And as long as she was being hunted, there was no hope of making one for herself; this fact, more than the fact that the last time she had even seen another of her breed had been in the nest with her clutch mates and her own mother - the toad sized creature she'd stumbled across once did not count in her mind - was more distressing to Narcissa's notions of making the best use of her available breeding years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own mother had said to be wary of humans and yet... Narcissa did have little knowledge of the greater world beyond the topography of the landscape and wild places within several hundred miles of her hatching place.  This might be an opportunity to learn about the world, however, it might also be the last decision she made as a free dragon...  What she needed was a concrete hold over the man, no simple promise of being able to leave when she wished would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human... Virgil.\"  said Narcissa and immediately the human rose, gliding up so effortlessly, the dragoness could not tell if he had assisted himself with magic.  \"I have decided to accompany you, for now, on your journey back to your master, assuming you will cease your attempts to capture me and place no fetters upon my person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mage inclined his head deeply and the smallish dragon took that as meaning he agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore, should I decide to leave, I shall inform you beforehand and you must give me a day's head start before resuming your chase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\" said the mage.  \"Why not make it three days?  I am confident that you will be pleased with my company and the accommodations and privileges that we will afford you when we reach my master's estate in Devonshire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had never seen a man-made map before in her 60 years of life so far, she had accumulated enough hearsay to know the place the human spoke of.  It would be a three day's easy flight due North-East from their present location, however, that included passing over a swamp and a broad river.  Narcissa had no guess as to how long the journey might take crawling along the ground like a rooting beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had a gilded tongue, Narcissa had to give him that much.  Now however, was the real demand.  How would she bind this human to ensure his trust?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The words came quietly from the otherwise straightforward dragoness.  \"Lastly... I want you to make a bond with me.\"  Narcissa could hardly believe she just said that; and to a human no less!  But she couldn't think of anything else to do to ensure his loyalty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bond?\"  asked the human mage warily.  Narcissa apparently had finally caught him off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast, Narcissa was hoping she wouldn't have to elaborate any further.  A Bond was something that was only usually shared between spouses, close friends and sometimes children.  The dragoness stood up, though due to her height was still looking up at the human from about waist high, \"A special bond, usually only shared between those who are very close among my kind.  We shall imbibe of each other's auras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard's eyes flew wide and he took a step back.  \"Such is forbidden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa stood her ground, looking firmly at the human and his odd reaction to something that should have seemed overly intimate, but not obscene.  \"That is the cost of my accompanying you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised a pale skinned hand to his close shaven goatee.  \"It... You ask too much, dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa took a step forward, she hadn't expected the human to react so negatively.  She was worried that despite his graceful words, he would resort once again to force to bring her along.  \"Why is this idea so alarming to you, Virgil?\"  she asked, carefully enunciating the human's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard looked away.  \"We... we are taught to keep our auras clean and immaculate, free of outside taint.  Mingling auras... it is how one welcomes corruption into one's heart.  It is how dark wizards and Abominations are born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa was surprised to say the least.  She truly did know little of the world.  She spoke calmly and walked a little closer until she could feel the prickles of Virgil's protective wards tickling her scales.  She was within arm's reach now, and he within reach of her claws.  Sitting lightly on her royal blue scaled haunches, she stretched up her neck to look at the tall human.  \"I know not of any corruption in making the bond.  It is simply a way to better understand one anyother, to <i> truly</i> understand.  It is the only way I can know that there is no deception in your hearts.  And you shall know that there is none within mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grinned oddly as he looked down at Narcissa's slight form, \"It is said that a man has only one heart, and that none may truly know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa was befuddled by the man's words. \"A mere difference in biology does not matter.  I have wings and you do not.  It does not mean that I have any less desire to be free and live as I please than you.  And yet with your hunting, you bring me to either come with you or live my life on the run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange look in the man's eyes faded and he took a step back to a more comfortable distance.  \"I am sorry, but I have been assigned this mission as my final test before proving myself worthy to ascend to the next level of my studies.  I am to become a High Magister in exchange for returning with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa smiled shrewdly and cocked a wing at an angle.  \"All the more reason to accept my proposal then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gritted his teeth.  \"You do not understand what you ask, though.  If I am discovered to have mingled my aura with that of a dragon, I'll be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you find it reasonable to chase me from my home with real intent to bring me to your masters as a slave, Virgil?\"  said Narcissa, cocking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be a slave!\"  Virgil insisted.  The young man was obviously loosing his former composure.  He ran a hand through his now sweaty hair.  \"There are other dragons who live on the estate.  You'll have a much better chance meeting a suitable mate there than out here in the middle of nowhere.  You could live as a queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa lifted a claw and looked at it mildly,  \"My offer still stands.  Will you bond with me, Human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human made a sound like he was trying to growl and then pulled at the hair at the nape of his neck.  He smoothed his long black hair before acquiescing,  \"Alright, Narcissa.  I agreed, but we shall never speak of this to anyone.  It is very possible they will want you dead as well as I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human's last attempt as dissuasion did not phase the young dragoness.  She was set in her mind now.  \"Good.  Now kneel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human sighed but did as he was told.  His robes bunches against the ground as he folded his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little lower... now, that is good.\"  said Narcissa when they were at last eye to eye.  \"Now you must release your wards.  There cannot be any magic seperating us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Virgil hesitated.  \"There will be nothing to keep you from killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust is the first step of the bond.\" said the dragoness, her mind now slipping into the proper mindset as she gazed deeply into the young man's eyes.  \"Put your life in my hands as I am putting mine in yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard took a deep breath and nodded.  He closed his eyes and with a steady outlet of breath, the wards dissipated.  Narcissa could smell when the air was clean of magic, only the scents of the forest and of the sweaty human before her remained.  The dragoness raised her wings and swept them forward, almost encasing the two of them in a protective den of crystaline webbing.  \"Beautiful...\" muttered raising a hand as if to brush it against the many faceted membrane of Narcissa's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not touch.\" intoned the dragoness, and the man's hand lowered.  \"I am concentrating, as you should be.  Calm your mind.  You are in a safe place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard complied, though from the sound of his heart beat - with him so close, she could hear it clearly - it took a long time for the human to become calm with in the embrace of a dragon's wings.  \"Yes... clear your mind...\" said Narcissa as she studied the man's face, the alien contours, the flat nose and mouth like a deformity to her eyes and yet tried to find something appealing, something she could latch onto.  There.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of a sudden their searching minds met in the greater Nether.  She could see his aura, and when he opened his eyes, she knew that he could see hers too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" breathed the mage, \"The colors...\" as if he had never seen another's aura before; which might very well be the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa herself had very limited experience in the art of reading another's aura, but she could tell right away that the man was honest and was true to his principles; even if those principles themselves might be misguided, Narcissa didn't know.  The man had strong faith as well and was guided by it, but he also had a great desire for power and status.  He was an ambitious man and was not afraid to be ruthless if he had to.  In him, Narcissa saw the potential for a great leader.  She liked what she saw.  If the wizard received any information about Narcissa in return, she could not tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, however, seemed entranced by the display of lights coalescing about each other and bouncing off the translucent membrane of the dragon's wings.  \"What happens now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa leaned close, the tip of her snout bare inches from his nose.  The colors rose from their bodies like steam after emerging from a hot spring.  \"Breathe... just breathe.\"  she said and inhaled, taking some of the wizard's aura into herself.  There were flavors and smells of things she did not know of.  The smell of an old leather chair.  Wood burning cheerily in a stone hearth.  The sweat of a horse after a vigorous gallop; but not for eating.  The scent of old paper in a vast library.  Pleased faces she did not know clapping her on the back.  A woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two broke apart with a gasp.  It was the human who had turned away first and broke the link.  Narcissa busied herself with folding her wings agitatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you were reading my mind.\"  said Virgil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was doing more than that.\" said Narcissa, \"But you were doing the same.  What did you experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was holding his forehead in his hands.  \"Forests... Mountains... Delicious cow meat... flying.  Flying!\" the man almost stood straight up, but the dragoness reached around with her long tail and placed it on the man's shoulder to keep him still.  He looked at the small dragon, \"My god, the sensation was incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa reached out with her thoughts, and found the human in the vast Nether much more easily, but he was a vague shape still, indiscernible.  \"Ah, you broke too soon.  The bond is still weak.  Come let us breathe some more.\"  said Narcissa.  This time, Virgil leaned forward much more willingly.</span></div></div>",

Thus you have potentially the most available fire out of any breed, but using up your gas also decreases your ability to fly...  Your limbs and claws are small compared to the size of your body, but that's ok because your method of hunting is to coil around your prey and constrict the life out of it.  Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Earth-Render:</u>  You are a unique class of dragon.  Rather than living in high mountain lairs, your kind prefer to burrow into the earth.  That doesn't mean you don't share the same lust for treasure and glory as your fellow dragons however!  Normal size for a dragon, your wings are shaped to allow you to move through the earth with ease, but makes your slower and clumsier in the air compared to others.  Your knowledge of the deep places gives you special advantages, however.  Your hide is tougher than usual and more heat resistant.  It is even said that your kind can cause pits to suddenly open in the earth, change the foundations of the rock even alter the course of underground water.  You hide has a pebbly texture and comes in various shades of brown from clay to light green. Your head is smooth and no spur or weapon lays at the end of your tail, but your large fore claws are good for more than just shoveling earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Vishian Drake:</u> Also known as the \"wizard's drake\" yours is one of the most poorly understood breeds of dragon.  Smaller than average, your teeth and claws are well suited to your body and not over-sized like some of the more combat oriented breeds.  Your scaly hide comes in watery colors of blue, green and even silver.  Your wings are a marvel, appearing as crystalline webbing between the digits of your wings.  Your fiery breath is mediocre at best, but your best trait and the one you are known for is the ability to disappear at will.  In a process that you don't understand fully yourself, you can slip into a shadowy \"in-between\" to evade your pursuers, becoming invisible and untouchable.  The world remains around you and you cannot pass through solid objects, but its inhabitants vanish and you are surrounded as if by mists.  Reappearing becomes more difficult the longer you remain away so don't linger in your shadowy haven!  Beware wizards because your kind are highly sought as the best of familiars.

Rest secure in knowing that you can outsmart any brute with the barest of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part.  What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Regal Bronze:</u> One of the largest casts of dragon, you tower over your opponents on the field of battle and have the force of well toned muscle behind each of your massive blows.  You are called regal for your long legs and tall stature, you carry your head high and proud when you grace the land with your presence.  Your kind are mortal enemies of Deathwings (but then again, who isn't?).  Your brawn and their speed are evenly matched.  While it isn't necessarily truth, the appearance of battling the Deathwings has given your kind a vaguely chivalrous reputation, a reputation that many individuals chose to uphold on their own.  Your tail ends in a serrated arrow-head that is capable of slicing through fully grown trees and of course, your hide comes in only one color, a luminous bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Golden Mane:</u> A strange looking dragon from a foreign land, you are the only dragon possessed of hair, a full mane that is always a shimmering golden color.  Your elongated body is rather like a serpent and forshortened wings are used mainly for maneuvering through the air rather than to generate lift.  You stay aloft rather by segmented hydrogen gas chambers lining both sides of your snake-like body.

Your kind is noted for a particular like of pearls, especially large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Geminate Drake:</u> They say that two is better than one and this is a truth with which you are intimately familiar. As a Geminate drake, you have never had to worry about being alone because, as with all members of your breed, you were born as a twin. Geminate drakes reproduce in twos, no more, no less and each set of twins is intimately linked throughout their lives. The depth of the connection is such that Geminate twins are often referred to as a singular being and the custom is to have a single name consisting of two parts for each pair of drakes (for instance, a set of twins might be named Mal\u2019Drak with one twin being named Mal and the other named Drak). Pairs of Geminate drakes are usually inseparable; they hunt together, sleep together, live together and usually take mates together. All of this is due to a strong mental link between each dragon, the strength of the link varies from pair to pair ranging from the simple sending and receiving of messages to merger on the extent that it seems that there is a single entity occupying two bodies. Sibling rivalry is rare to the point of extinction, but famous cases have emerged in history; always it has ended in tragedy. Geminate drakes can typically be found roosting in mountain ranges, the dryer the clime, the better. As for size, the typical drake tends to be on the large size, dwarfing land bound beasts and mortals. While not exceedingly strong or fast or possessing fiery breath of significant note, your strongest strength lies in your constant companion and your ability to fight as the ultimate tag-team.</span></div></div>",

An enormous breed of dragon, your strength is matched only by the Juggernaut, and your sheer size by none.  You and your kin have often been mistaken for small hills while you lay dormant in hibernation.  You bulk is such that it can literally flatten a small village under it.  All that bulk means a big appetite, however, so big in fact, that you have to spend the majority of your year in a state of hibernation to conserve energy.  But the more food you can get your giant claws on, the less time you have to spend sleeping and the more time you can spend chasing down loot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Faerie Dragon:</u> Despite being the smallest breed of dragon, there are none who take your kind lightly.  About the size of a large horse, your lithe, colorful body is supported by two pairs of elegant and overlapping wings resembling that of a butterfly.  Foes shouldn't be fooled by your innocent appearance, however, as with every flap of your wings, mind-altering dust escapes and quickly befuddles even the stoutest dragon. If that weren't enough, while all dragons possess deep and powerful magic, your magic crops up much more often and occasionally, you can even will specific effects into being, particularly if you are in danger.  It is also a known fact that your magic is tends to be most in tune with plants, simple beasts and the tiny folk whose forest home you share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Vishian Drake:</u> Also known as the \"wizard's drake\" yours is one of the most poorly understood breeds of dragon.  Smaller than average, your teeth and claws are well suited to your body and not over-sized like some of the more combat oriented breeds.

She was standing with some lushes\u2019 nobleman garments but had blood on it from head to toe and over freshly made corpses. What impressed me was, there was only one woman standing like a living piece of art and both dried plus fresh blood all over my back, a small wall of corpses on either side of me. I smelled the air around me. The odor of sweat and blood, traces of gunpowder all over the place and I think a little bit of the human filth, luckily tainted with the smell of salt. I assumed an ocean was near by. I smelt one other thing, faint but so familiar. It was coming from the woman. \u201cWhy is there so much human on me?\u201d I asked her. I spoke using a different method. If I spoke to her normally I could blow out her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Dragon!\u201d She yelled back at me. \u201cMove it! Your not even supposed to be here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeg your pardons.\u201d I asked a bit shocked. Apparently having a voice within her head didn\u2019t faze her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are laying on Xion\u2019s Temple Damn it!  Move!\u201d She screamed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understood at that point who this woman was. \u201cYou\u2019re a descendent of Xion aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked her. Her reply however puzzled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m. I\u2019m what? No. No I\u2019m not a. A descendant of Xion. She said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your not then you\u2019re a grave robber.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she became more puzzled after that.  She then said, \u201cYou have got to be joking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I joke?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, I know that which you lay upon is a Temple, not a Tomb. Second, I doubt a God could have kids, or want kids.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed at that answer, personally knowing full well that Xion was no god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn\u2019t take that to well. She picked up a sword that was close to her and proceeded to stab me with it. The blade did snap in half after a few times trying to get through my scales though. \u201cEven though my family and I maybe human. We respected the belief of others. Don\u2019t you Dare Dragon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen respect my belief, human.\u201d I said sternly and out loud causing the woman to drop on her knees and cover her ears. I sighed and went back to mentally speaking with her. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not on it. I\u2019m laying around it. Ok? Now, you think you can get off me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy exactly should I?\u201d she asked standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and stood up myself, sand coursing down my whole body. The woman lost her balance and rolled all the way down my side and to the ground below. When I didn\u2019t feel any more meat roll or slide off me I shook off the rest. There were corpses and still wet clogs of bloody sand flying everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s by far the nastiest sight I have ever seen dragon.\u201d the woman said getting up as if falling from that height was nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine so. So what.\u201d I said playfully and looking around. I was apparently in a desert. I don\u2019t remember the Tomb being in a desert. I lied back in my original position, most the sand off me. I then looked at her. \u201cYour not a normal human I take it?\u201d I asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy say that.\u201d She replied as she started walking on the side of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your female right?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, how dare you dragon.\u201d she said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just you\u2019re a female but\u2026\u201d I explained what I found odd about her. She was strong, durable and she was covered in blood.  However I saw her stop half way to my front. \u201cNever mind then.\u201d I sighed and lied my head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, It\u2019s fine.\u201d she said as she started walking again. \u201cYour right dragon. I\u2019m not normal. In fact I\u2019m the freak of my hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy say that?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMainly because of what you mention, but there is more to it.\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m bigger then a woman should be, stronger then a woman should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you kill all those other humans?\u201d I ask a little hesitant. The woman by now was facing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, more then half that was already dead by the time I came. I think that all of them was killing each other, trying to get into the Temple underneath you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then realized that I must have been sleeping for quite a while. I also realized that I was hungry and that I stunk or maybe it was all the dead humans around me. I couldn\u2019t tell at the moment. \"Human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha Ingrid.\" the woman interrupted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha Ingrid.\" She repeated. \"That\u2019s my name dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, then Tabi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a name too right?\" She interrupted me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you can pronounce.\" I answered. \u201cNow then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow bout\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it\u2026\u201d I stopped her and she calmed down. \u201cDragon works fine for now. As to what I\u2019m trying to say. Care for a bath then hunt for breakfast? Or is it lunch? Oh well.\u201d Tabitha seemed to be a little concerned when I mentioned bath. Was she afraid of water?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can we bath in the desert Dragon?\u201d she asked me plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ocean nearby actually.\u201d I answered her and started off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait dragon.\u201d I heard Tabitha yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t stop as I said, \u201cWhat is it this time human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you help me a little?\u201d She asked me pointing to the tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \u201cYour still a grave robber to me Tabitha. You want Xion\u2019s Tomb, you dig it up yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's A Temple Damn it!!!\u201d I heard her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped for a second and sniffed around to find the direction of where the salt was coming from. The ocean was east of where I was.  Before I headed in that direction I looked back at the buried tomb and sighed as I barely saw the tiny being digging her way down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to...</span></div></div>",

The gnomes were minor spirits of the forest and appeared as little more than tiny men carved from wood.  They had their characteristic large noses and ears and the backs of their heads curled back into something of a tapering cone shape.  Few would have call them beautiful, but Alender understood their significance in the natural oder of life in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young gnome was about to make a strong retort to his older companion, when the -comparatively- large dragon made him lose the words he was about to spew at the other.  \"Is there something I can help with?\"  inquired the faire dragon softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gnomes looked at each other and then spat out at the dragon simultaneously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell this freeloader to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n\"You can tell this old fart to stop hogging the good logs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlender recoiled slightly at the outburst.  \"Please, please settle down.  This is not the way we do things around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not for you, big fella with your fancy wings and flutter in' n' such.\"  scoffed the older gnome.  \"But we down here on the ground have to scrap out a living.  Do you know how long it takes to grow a decent mushroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes longer when you don't even have a place to spend the night.  I've had to cover myself with lichen and pray that a fox didn't sniff me out every night for the past two moons!\"  shouted the younger gnome and before Alender knew it, the two were at it again.  The sound of disharmony was distressing in the faire dragon's curled ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please listen to me.\"  insisted the young dragon.  \"There is plenty of room in the forest.  I am sure that we can find you a place of your own to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn right, you best get off with you.\"  muttered the old gnome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the younger gnome seemed more intrigued.  \"You mean you will find me a new place to live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can do that.\"  said Alender, feeling calmer now that the tension in the situation was diffusing.  \"In fact, I know of a place where a young gnome is greatly needed.  There will be work to do, however, for the good of the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I have a spot to grow some fine mushrooms, I'll be dandy.\"  said the gnome.  And then Alender lowered his head and let the woody little gnome clamor up onto his snout and then the crown of his head.  The carved wooden face of the gnome glistened with dew as it wrapped its little fingers about Alender's delicate horns.  As the dragon spread his translucent wings, the gnome asked, \"So where are we headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someplace where the forest is hurting.\"  said Alender, somewhat grimly and set off through the trucks of the trees, floating effortlessly on the moist still air.</span></div></div>",

He thought with a little help from the gnome, Alender could fix it in no time, but when he got their it was worse then he thought. Alender would have not believed what he saw if some one told him. Once a proud forest was now a field of stumps. Nothing Alender had heard of would have ever deliberately done so much damage to the forest. Fear of a terrible monster had over come Alender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place? I thought you were going to find me a new home!\" exclaimed the gnome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but now the place is completely destroyed!\" Alender's anxiety could be heard in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fairy dragon afraid?

With me at your side there nothing that we can't be beat.\" The gnome jumped off Alender and headed into the field. Alender got in front of the gnome before he got out of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing? We don't have a clue what we are up against. We should stay hidden until we know what did this and how to deal with it.\" reasoned Alender. He never liked jumping into a situation and not having all the facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, dragon, If we stay here more of the forest will be damaged.\" Being called dragon was one of the few things that angered Alender. He had a name and was proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, my name is Alender. Second, the trees look like the were harvested. If we follow the smell of smoke, we could find the creature that did this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sounds like a plan.\" The gnome got back onto Alender. \"I am Ivan, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Ivan. Now lets go.\" Alender followed the smoke to a valley with a river filled with logs. He saw a large group of bipedal creatures trimming trees down to logs and tossing them into a river. They were using odd looking tool to handle all their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing?\" Ivan was scratching his head. \"The take all the trees then toss them away? These most be the dumbest creatures I have ever seen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know how to harvest trees and use tools, so they should be smart enough to talk.

What sort of dragon are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Deathwing:</u> These dragons have a sinister appearance with their elongated snouts, huge horns and the spikes at their knees and shoulders.  A fleshy ruff around the face can create a presentation that will stop a man's heart cold in fear.  But more fearsome is their reputation for ruthlessness and guile.  Muscular, but not brawny, quick, but with enough weight to get the job done, these intelligent creatures are the  objects of horrible fairy tales and superstitions the world over.  And that suits them just fine.  Always solid black, you are a hunter of the night and while you can see into the blackest abyss, your eyes are sensitive to bright lights without the time to acclimate.  A single sharp prong for stabbing exists at the end of your long, elegant tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Vishian Drake:</u> Also known as the \"wizard's drake\" yours is one of the most poorly understood breeds of dragon.  Smaller than average, your teeth and claws are well suited to your body and not over-sized like some of the more combat oriented breeds.  Your scaly hide comes in watery colors of blue, green and even silver.  Your wings are a marvel, appearing as crystalline webbing between the digits of your wings.  Your fiery breath is mediocre at best, but your best trait and the one you are known for is the ability to disappear at will.  In a process that you don't understand fully yourself, you can slip into a shadowy \"in-between\" to evade your pursuers, becoming invisible and untouchable.  The world remains around you and you cannot pass through solid objects, but its inhabitants vanish and you are surrounded as if by mists.  Reappearing becomes more difficult the longer you remain away so don't linger in your shadowy haven!  Beware wizards because your kind are highly sought as the best of familiars.  You don't want to lose your freedom do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Nettled Reaper:</u> You have a fantastically dangerous appearance with a body covered in venomous quills.  Down the neck, across the torso, limbs and tail, colorful quills protect your body and advertise a warning to would-be dragon slayers.  Known for a foul temper and easily provoked, the quills on the tail are loose and can be launched a projectiles with a simple flick.  Lacking a breath weapon, your venom nonetheless is potent to render even a large dragon unconscious in minutes and will kill humanoids outright.  A fair flyer, you lack speed for the disturbance your quills cause, but make up for it in maneuverability.  You are also smaller than the average standing about 15 feet at the shoulder.</span></div></div>",

The blood was coming more slowly, but I feared it wouldn\u2019t stop in time.  Behind me, my broken wing spread unfurled in a shattered canvas of agony, I was unable to close it.  It\u2019d been a week since I\u2019d last eaten, but strangely, the gnawing pain in my gut was nowhere to be found.  I closed my eyes.  I did have something else besides the pain, and right now, it seemed the better alternative to lying here and waiting for my hearts to finally stop beating after all they\u2019ve been through.  The pictures came easily as I fled from the pain into a darkness deeper than any cave.  I drowned in my memories\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was young, there was happiness, however briefly it lasted.  It was always dark, but we liked it like that.  My mother was a world unto herself, so large that I could lose myself crawling up her scaly leg and wandering up and down her torso.  The few times that I found her head, I pulled on her ruff with my sharp little baby fangs.  She would purr softly and gently pry me off, depositing me back near her belly were my other siblings resided.  She was the sole source of warmth in the world and all good things came from her.  Except the meat.  Father brought the meat from the Outside.  For the longest time, I had no desire to travel to, or even much inclination to think about the Outside.  Mother was enough world for me.  Father was nice too, but he was gone so often, I never really got to know him.  I wish I could have learned their names\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still little more than a wingless lizard, my dormant wings hidden under the skin of my back when the Bad Thing happened.  My mother had been teaching us how to sing together, teaching us the songs that told us how to be good dragons.  Barely half the size of the meat creature father called a \u201chorse,\u201d I was filled to bursting with the desire to be a great and powerful dragoness like mother.  I was at the age when I finally started asking about the Outside, but Mother always told me the Outside was not for little dragons such as I.  She always said that I had the sweetest voice of the clutch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bad Thing started when Father stumbled into the cave, flapping wildly and landing so heavily on the stone floor that I was bounced clear into the air.  I remembered landing on my tail and I\u2019d started to cry.  I cried because of the pain I felt and because Father looked scary.  I smelled blood on him, but not the good kind of blood, it was his own.  Father spoke frantically to Mother about\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was immediately assailed by a blast of cold. Water was falling, and I felt air bracket against me. I looked up. The sky was filled with dragons, circling above sharp craggy cliffs. They were shooting fire out of their mouths and slashing each other. I could hear them roar, and how filled with hatred and savagery this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Outside' was a terrible place even for the big dragons, but for the little dragons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of my siblings had always been smaller and weaker than the others. He didn't have a name, but what I remembered of him was that he was quiet. He didn't like to play much either, nor could he really sing very well, but he would simply stare off into space for some reason. I also remember that whenever father brought us back food, he didn't eat that much, and would always give part of his meals to one of the other siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, but perhaps inevitably, he was the first to have died. When mother was hit by an unusually strong gust of wind, the small one wasn't strong enough to hang on. He plummeted. The small one uttered but a slight whining noise as his body was skewered by a jagged rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother did not utter a noise, no screams of terror and dismay at the sight. She only gave one glance at small one before flying on. As for myself and the rest of the siblings, we mimicked our mothers silence. One would think that hatchlings would have cried and wailed at that moment, yet perhaps as Darkwings, our souls had been conditioned to expect suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I look back, I figured it was just as well that the small one would have died right then. He would not have lived more than a few days once he left the nest. Perhaps I even envy him, as small one was the one that ended up suffering the least out of all of us...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, mother's frantic flight had begun to even out, as her breathing slowed and her muscles weren't quite as tensed as before. We had escaped immediate danger. Yet from then on, I realized why mother had never wanted us to go 'Outside'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, mother suddenly snapped her head around...</span></div></div>",

The food we received from her was nothing like the tasty meat that we received from father. In these barren lands, there was nothing but small, skinny animals. The water was also dirty and fetid. We were always hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother's behavior had also changed since the 'Bad' day. She wasn't so nurturing and caring anymore. Whenever one of us would misbehave, she would hit us. She didn't teach us how to sing together anymore, but now told us to stay put and be silent. As before, she would sing songs about how to be good dragons, she would warn us of the bad dragons who were out trying to find us and kill us. At times, we were just as scared of her as we were of the bad dragons that were after us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time of wandering, another one of our siblings died. It was one of my brothers. As it so happens all too often to hatchlings, he got sick. Mother kept him seperate from us during the nights. He would cough up blood the entire night, while calling out for mother. For a while, mother did try and comfort him, but even so, we still had to keep moving from place to place. After a while, he soon became too weak to continue on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night he just didn't wake up. He was so thin, and all the color had left him. Mother only shook her head, before she implored us to latch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to wander for another long while, before finally she found somewhere we could call home. By then, we had grown large enough that it was difficult for mother to carry all of us at the same time, but not yet strong enough to fly. Of course, it wasn't the same as when father was still around, but I was thankful we didn't have to go from place to place anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then when me and my remaining siblings were finally given names. Usually, the reason of that is in every clutch, a mother can expect that some of them would die of various reasons. Sometimes they were weak like 'small one', other times they got sick. In any case, it was nothing short of miraculous, given all that we had already gone through, that even three of us out of the original five were still alive by then. Myself. My sister...  And... my brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother named me Mysteria. Perhaps it was because I liked being left alone, and that she loved my voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother named my sister Kursed. She was the one who was always unnaturally and annoyingly optimistic, especially when things were at their worst. Of course, one can appreciate the irony of her name, as overly cheerful Deathwing was not an ideal disposition for a long lifespan. For instance, up until the time the second brother got sick and died, she insisted that father would return and we'd all be able to go home. I figure she knew that, but it was her way of coping, or at least I hope it was. Kursed did last longer than I thought she would, and when she died it seemed only then she realized what a messed up and brutal world we live in, but that's for later though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother named my remaining brother Smaug. I can say without any reservations that he was the strongest of the hatchlings. Especially since he was the only male, he tried to be what father was, and felt that he had to take it upon himself to take care of the rest of the family. Of course, that was impossible back then as we were still hatchlings, but since the 'bad day', he became...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of what Smaug became made me gnash my teeth together.  It was something I didn't want to think about at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet mother never told us what her name was. She always said she would tell us when we became old enough to fend for ourselves. In any case, the three of us settled back into a routine. Living at the edge of a cliff, overlooking the ocean, we were mostly hidden from the Shadowtooth Clan. It couldn't last... not in these lands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My hearts raced in my thin chest and in my long neck as I raced down the shadow-covered slope of the mountain.  I gathered the strength in my haunches and leapt across free space.  The edge of the cliff slammed into my belly and I scrambled madly with my claws and tail, watching the thin, wretched goat becoming more distant by the second.  Oh for my wings!  Stabbing the sandstone with the sharp, bone prong at the end of my tail, I secured the tip and used the appendage to lever me up.  My tail, like all deathwings, was very long and built for whipping rather than brute strength, but I managed the task by deftly twisting it and increasing its stoutness.  I leapt forward as soon as my hind feet touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in my legs that would one day propel me into the sky were still suitable for jumping and sprinting in my larval state, however, like a cat, I tired quickly.  That momentary lapse in the chase was going to cost me this hunt unless I could move faster.  I was so hungry\u2026  Determined, I ran flat out, jumping from rock to rock after the bouncing goat with all the skill I\u2019d developed since we moved to this dry, desolate place.  The goat dove into a crevasse, clever little food beast.  I went down after it, heedless of the possibility that I might become stuck.  I <i>wanted</i> to kill that goat.  The goat stumbled down and hit the floor heavily, walking away limping.  As for me, I was falling, and then I was not.  My tail lashed against the rough sandstone, I wiggled frantically against the pressure I felt on both sides, I was just barely too wide.  The goat, though injured, was slowly making its escape.  I wanted to cry out, to roar, but Mother had taught us to be quiet, there were still hunters out there looking for our blood.  Still, I longed to express my frustration, keeping it bottled inside was making me sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slid down another half foot and I became more stuck, less able to even wiggle.  Damn the Ancestors, the crevasse widened just another foot below me.  If I could just move a little\u2026  But there was nothing to it.  I began to chip at the stone with my tail prong.  The goat was going to get away, but at least I wouldn\u2019t die here; a few hours work and I\u2019d free myself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the goat left my field of view, however, I felt a heavy thud in the earth.  \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d  I thought, intimately familiar with the way my heavier sibling moved.  My brother hissed loudly and the goat turned blindly back into the crevasse, back to its doom.  It stopped short of my free claw, however, and the other was wedged against my shoulder.  Smaug strode into the crevasse.  His muscular shoulders were so broad that they almost touched either wall even at the wider bottom.  He turned his head up and grinned at me.  Oh to simply twist my neck and die right then and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi little sis.\u201d He said in his gruff, oh-so-masculine voice.  I didn\u2019t answer, hoping that he might still go away.  \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve found yourself in a little bit of trouble again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hissed at him, the goat was bleating in rampant fear caught in between two dragons.  \u201cI don\u2019t need your help.  I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d   I tried desperately to slid down the last foot to freedom, but I was caught as snugly as a bean in a pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug grinned with that stupid smile of his, then turned his eyes to my goat.  \u201cThen you wont mind if I help myself a little, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Smaug lashed out with a claw and raked the goat.  It\u2019s screaming hurt my ears in the confined space.  The food beast staggered to the floor and my brother put his paw down on it until the cracking of ribs could be heard.  The pathetic thing flailed back and forth, the sound was horrid.  I <i>hated</i> watching my brother eat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my brother was breaking one of the goat\u2019s legs between his thumb and first finger, I shouted, \u201cJust kill the damn thing already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother looked up at me, his violet pupils round and shining in the moonlight.  \u201cAs you wish\u2026 little sis.\u201d  With his tail prong, he reached over his head and stabbed the goat through the neck.  At last there was silence.  I thought that my brother might have been satisfied with this indignity so far, but I was wrong.  He lowered his head and tore into the goat\u2019s abdomen with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fleshy ruff raised from where it usually lay flat against my neck, greatly modifying the visual appearance of my head.  It rattled with my fierce anger.  \u201cThat\u2019s my prey, you jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug lifted his head and slurped some entrails into his greedy maw.  \u201cOh really?  From where I saw things, this little guy was going to get away if I hadn\u2019t come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter if it had.\u201d  I said.  \u201cBetter if it\u2019d fallen off the cliff and been eaten by vultures than gone into that gut of yours!\u201d  That wasn\u2019t fair, Smaug wasn\u2019t fat, but he was certainly muscular and much more stocky than either one of his sisters, even more than mother- at least relatively speaking \u2013 since she\u2019d lost so much weight over the last several years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one stung, Smaug was very prideful of his sleek and impressive appearance.  Spitefully, he took another big mouthful of the goat\u2019s abdomen and swallowed it.  Then he walked up to me, his big shoulders now touching the sandstone on either side.  \u201cThen consider it just payment for helping you out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could argue, he grabbed hold of my dangling arm and pulled.  I protested, his strength was horrid and I felt like my arm was going to be dislocated.  But he didn\u2019t relent.  My scales were the only reason that I wasn\u2019t flayed on each side as he forced me down the last bit of crevasse.  The second I hit the floor, cradling my hurt limb, I flung my tail forward and hit the side of my brother\u2019s head, slamming it against the stone.  Before he could respond, I darted it forward and, with extreme precision, slid it between the scales on his neck.  The tip of my tail spur was held against his rapidly beating neck heart.  I refused to be bullied by him like Kursed was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug went slack, panic clearly in the big male\u2019s eyes.  I was growling, my ruff still rattling.  \u201cN-now, sister\u2026\u201d  he stammered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything.  I was just having a bit of fun, you know.  I wasn\u2019t going to take your go-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the sharp tip to the unprotected skin of his neck, I could see a bit of blood welling around it now.  \u201cGo, Smaug.\u201d  I said.  \u201cJust go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother shut his jaw and silently retreated.  He stepped on the goat as he did and I could not tell if it was on purpose or by accident.  Once he was free of the crevasse, I pulled my tail back and he rubbed the minor wound, looking hurt.  \u201cThere was no need for that, Mysteria.  I just wanted to come and tell you the good news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ruff flattened.  \u201cWhat news?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother lifted his head to the star filled sky and looked to the west.  There were dark clouds gathering, a void in the sky.  \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming.  And I\u2019m going to be the first to fly in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoatshit.\u201d  I said, looked at my brother\u2019s distinct lack of wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d He said.  \u201cLook closely at my back sister.  I\u2019ve begun to blister.\u201d  It was true, pale grey skin was exposed in two lines parallel to his spine.  The fluid filled sacs where his dormant wings rested would rupture soon and he would be a full fledged dragon at long last.  I wanted to spit in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, I turned back into the crevasse.  I hunkered down over the remains of my goat and after a time, Smaug left.  Very quietly, I sang to myself as I ate my broken, lonely meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The sky, dear Hatchlings, is where we are free<br>\r\nTo loop, spiral and dive is what it means <br>\r\nTo Be...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smaug had, in two bites, eaten most of the soft meat on the little goat.  I was forced to lick the rough stone where most of its blood had been spilled and some traces of soft, nutritious entrails remained.  I bit the head off and spat it to the side, the horns making it unsuitable for chewing or swallowing.  Lacking molars, I used my sharp fangs to rip pieces off the carcass, swallowing them whole.  Each leg was a bite, I didn\u2019t mind the hooves.  The rib cage was already shattered to pieces so it was easy to bite through.  I gnawed on the spinal cord for some time before it broke.  There was nothing left but red stained sandstone when I was done, but I hardly felt any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmaug doesn\u2019t deserve to fly.  He doesn\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d  I fumed silently.  I was angry at the unfairness of the world that my obnoxious sibling should have the honor of flying first when I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only because he\u2019s stolen so much food over the years, that muscle-brained dolt.  He thinks that just because he\u2019s bigger, it\u2019s his job to protect us, but all he does is muscle his way into our kills!\u201d  I clawed at the stone, making a hideous sound and leaving four deep grooves behind.  I wanted to roar, to howl; outside the crevasse, the wind was picking up, doing that job for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided I wanted to see my sister.  Maybe her inexhaustible reservoir of cheerfulness would help put things in perspective for me... or at least help distract me from the unkind world for a few moments.  I went out and a few drops of water fell of my dusty face, cleaning my jet black scales.  I began to crawl up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing was easy for a dragon.  Our limbs were proportionally short and muscular and our tailed helped a lot with balance and supporting ourselves while switching grips. Our claws dug into the stone so even overhangs were rarely a problem.  Still, the going was hard because the water which so rarely fell here became to come down in abundance.  Lightning flashed on the western horizon behind me, illuminating a churning sea.  This was going to be a monster of a storm, it might even last for days.  I climbed faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the cliff, I slithered onto the level ground.  I was half expecting to see Mother, spread out in all her glory, but the shelf was empty.  Beyond was a hole which Mother had dug herself until her claws were bleeding into the side of the mountain.  While it had begun as little more than a stoop for her to hide in and store her hatchlings while she was away, we all had contributed to enlarging it over the years.  It was still nothing to the home that we had shared with Father, but it was comfortable enough.  Inside, I found Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister was black as pitch, just as I, my mother and my brother were.  Her eyes, however were a soft amber color, starkly different from my own intense green.  Before her was a log which was burning merrily.  The light it gave off was so intense compared to the dark outside, I turned my head away.  \u201cWhat are you doing, Kursed?\u201d  I asked, a claw up the shield my sensitive eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister\u2019s eyes were slitted as they were in the daytime.  \u201cWhy, hello Misty.\u201d she said, using her nickname for me.  \u201cLook, isn\u2019t it pretty?  I found this nice dry log out on the mountain today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes adjusted but slowly to the intense glow.  The heat felt nice, however as I entered the cave.  \u201cIt\u2019s... nice.\u201d  I struggled, humoring my eccentric sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to keep these in here, Misty?  We could keep the cave nice and warm at night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppressed a growl.  If anything, it was too warm in here during the day when we were sleeping.  As for the cold night, we should be out hunting.  Running kept me warm enough.  I changed the subject, though Kursed continued looking into the dancing flames curling up from the log,  \u201cDid Smaug tell you anything today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d  she exclaimed.  \u201cHe showed me his back today while I was out hunting.  I\u2019m so happy for him!\u201d  Kursed extended her neck to embrace me, it took everything in me not to shrug her off.  She continued in a high voice, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be the first of us to fly, Misty!  We\u2019re finally growing up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked away.  \u201cYeah, I guess we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed my expression.  \u201cDon\u2019t be such a bitch about it, Misty.  It was bound to happen to one of us eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up to leave, this was a terrible idea.  However before I could, Kursed kicked the fire log towards the entrance.  I hissed and turned from the horrible light, snarling at my sister who say primply upright.  \u201cDon\u2019t leave, Misty.  Tell me what you got under your scales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat, looked into the dark interior of the cave.  My own shadow flickered and danced on the cave wall behind Kursed.  I clenched my fist.  \u201cI\u2019m so... angry at him, Kursed.  And don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m being a bitch.  He doesn\u2019t deserve to fly first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed cocked her head, her tail lifted and fell a couple times on the floor as she thought.  \u201cWhy is this so important to you, Misty?  It\u2019s not like like he chose to blister, any more than we could if we wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the point wasn\u2019t it, I couldn\u2019t speed along my own development, not matter how much I wanted it.  My head lowered almost to the floor, I looked at the floor that us hatchlings had smoothed after Mother had done the heavy claw-work herself.  \u201cI...  I don\u2019t know if I could stand watching him fly while I\u2019m stuck on the ground, Kursed.\u201d  I said quietly.  The hurting was so bad, like a dam had gushed forth its contents in my heart that a tear managed to escape the normally iron confines of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed extended her neck again and put her chin on top of my head.  I felt her neck heart pulsating and the heat of her against me.  To my surprise, I did feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finally broke the embrace, Kursed looked me up and down.  \u201cDid you get enough to eat, today?  You look worn out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, my sour mood coming easily back.  \u201cI made a kill, but Smaug ate most of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister raised an eye-ridge.  \u201cThat\u2019s odd, he shared his kill with me after I lost the wolf I was tracking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted. \u201cNo wonder he was so intent on my prey then, if he was forced to share.  You know how much he cares about \u2018adequate nutrition\u2019\u201d  I said derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed frowned, \u201cYou know, Misty, if you made an effort to be nicer, you\u2019d realize that Smaug isn\u2019t as bad a dragon as you make him out to be.  He helps me all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head between my paws, I muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t need his help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s our brother, sis.  He\u2019s going to be a part of our lives whether you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about inform Kursed of my little scheme to push Smaug off the cliff-face before his wings emerged, but was interupted by a crash from outside.  My hearts rose as I saw the shape outside in the rain.  Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great dragon folded her wings and without a moment\u2019s hesitation, stomped the burning log into oblivion under her foot as she entered the cave.  Though the chamber seemed spacious to me and my sister, she had to stoop to enter.  Despite how rapidly we\u2019d grown over the years, Smaug remained barely half her size and Kursed and I lagged behind him in our own growth.  I wished I could be as strong as her one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this glow?\u201d she demanded, dropping the scrawny antelope she\u2019d caught on the ground,  \u201cAre you trying to reveal our location?\u201d  Mother spoke angrily.  Her daughters both hung their heads.  Despite the fact that I\u2019d not been involved, I was not going to pin this solely on Kursed.  She got in enough trouble with her odd fancies as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke up, \u201cWe just thought it looked nice, Mother.  And it was warm with the rain and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what was coming before she even moved her tail.  Its long, elegant length snaked around her body as if it were some sort of summoned serpentine servant.  Mother clubbed me on the back, forcing me to the ground.  Then, working the bone tip with as much dexterity as she did her claws, she spanked me on my haunch with the side of the sharp prong.  I tried to be strong, but eventually I cried out, which is what she was looking for.  I received nothing for holding on but more whips with the hard, boney spear length, but something told me that she approved nonetheless.  Kursed received the same treatment and as always cried out much sooner than I.  When I had recovered, she still lay sobbing on the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me catch you two playing with fire here again.\u201d  she reprimanded us again.  I felt angry at her right then for the unjust punishment, but had I known that was the last time I would feel her tail against my hide, I would have put up with far more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Smaug arrived in the den, it was filled to capacity.  What remained of our family was together again.  I wish I\u2019d appreciated it more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There is a saying amongst our people. That when things are starting to go too well, it all falls apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearts skipped a beat when a crash, louder and more distinct than the storm outside, shook our little cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" I shrieked, snapping my head upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother rose up on her haunches. To this day, I remember that haunted look she gave the three of us. She had known this day would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble,\" she said grimly. \"Let me handle this intruder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us huddled together when we spotted the outline of a huge dragon; one that dwarfed mother easily and perhaps even larger than father had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At long last, I have finally found you dearest...\" the dragon said. Kursed and I exchanged glances. What could that dragon be talking about? The only dragon that I had ever remembered that had called mother that was father, but this dragon was obviously not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you waste all your time coming this way expecting that my answer would change? You think that I would want you, after you destroyed our home, killed my mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon snarled, \"I always hated that goody-two shoes. You have no idea how good it felt to see him die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with your prattle...\" snapped mother, \"Do what you set out to do and let us be done with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big fight broke out between mother and the unfamiliar dragon. Mother lashed at the intruder with claw, tooth, tail and talon, yet the other dragon's skill was such that he seemed to be toying with her, as if to humiliate her as how weak she was compared to him. Kursed kept her head turned away, whimpering, while I could only watch with a sense of resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Smaug shot out from the hiding place and raced forward to confront the strange dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!! I'm the male of this cave and if you want to go after my mom, you're going to have to go after me first!!\" he roared at the top of his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaug!! No!!\" I screamed, rushing forward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI wasn't about to let Smaug get himself killed, so I jumped forward and snatched his tail with my jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go sis!!\" he snapped, beating at my face with his claw. Yet I wasn't going to let go... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of my eye, I spotted the outline of a tail blade descend upon the two of us. At that moment, I could only muse at how would be such a dumb way to die<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet at the last moment, mother jumped in front of us. She let out a terrible shriek of pain as the tail blade slashed against her chest, literally showering us in her blood. Mother staggered on her feet for a few moments, before slumping belly first in front of us. I remember that my jaw was still clamped around Smaug's tail as this happened, while Smaug's jaw quavered, holding back tears as he glared up at the dragon. I also heard Kursed whine from the back of the room, curled into a ball. She was never meant to see such terrible things happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother's breathing was becoming increasingly ragged, as the intruder withdrew his tail blade. The intruder gazed at his own tail blade, watching it dripped with mother's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it didn't have to end this way. You could have lived and shared in my power as my mate, but it seems like you chose death...\" said the dragon to mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother's eyes were still defiant, as she tilted her neck to spit blood in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the dragons gaze switched toward Smaug and I. All my insticts screamed at me to cower, cry and shriek with fear, like Kursed was, yet I could not; that's not what mother would have wanted. Meanwhile, Smaug gazed up at the huge dragon, trembling with a combination of fear and awe at his power. We knew we were dead; the intruder had the only entranced blocked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, leave my little ones alone...\" gasped mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them alive? You are in no position to make demands of me now, and worse they also have his taint on them... You didn't think you'd be able to keep them away from me forever now did you?\" he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard!!!\" she strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I am, but since I am merciful, you will not have to see me kill your hatchlings in front of your eyes...\" he said. With one quick motion, he slid his tail to her throat and slashed it out. Mother made a gurgling sound. And just like that, she was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, I didn't feel anything at that moment. I didn't curl up and cry for my life, because I knew I was dead anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something peculiar happened. To this day, I have trouble explaining why it happened, whether the gods wanted to play some game with us, or not, but just then...</span></div></div>",

Even now, at this grim moment, Smaug was still full of his insane and irrational bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead!! I'm not scared!! Not one bit!!\" he shouted back. The dragon raised his claw, and I could remember my heartbeat slow down, and waiting for him to swipe and end it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not even worth killing hatchling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" snapped Smaug, eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be far too easy to destroy you right now. Remember what you saw here tonight boy, that I, Shurikan of the Shadowtail Clan, killed your mother and father,\" he declared. Smaug glared at the large dragon, trembling with rage. Yet I sensed what angered him more was not that he'd killed both mother and father, but at the notion that he wasn't worthy of being killed. That he was nothing more than a hatchling rather than a full-grown dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you hate me don't you hatchling?\" taunted Shurikan, \"Then may I be the object of all your anger and your hatred, and once you grow up big and strong, I shall be waiting for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, I watched with horror as Smaug's gaze shifted into a scowl. I could have sworn, that he was smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is that how its going to be then? Fine then. I'll remember this day, and once I grow up I'm coming for you and I'll destroy you,\" said Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShurikan rumbled with amusement, \"Will you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. So you better not dissappoint me then...\" he said. There was absolute certainty in his voice. I only realize now what Shurikan was doing to my brother. My father had been a noble, proud dragon, or at least that's what I had seen with my newborn eyes and what mother had led us to believe in her stories (now looking back upon it, and having lived the life of a Shadow Dragon, he may very well have been as merciless), and what better way to tarnish father's legacy than ensuring that Smaug grew up to become just as evil, or even more so, than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon grinned. \"We shall see then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug's eyes narrowed. With that, he took off back into the storm, quickly fading out of sight.  With that, our gazes switched back to the corpse of our mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed finally emerged from her corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the bad dragon gone?\" she stammered. I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it...\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...she's gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed my body against her, sniffing. Kursed was nearly beside herself though, \"Its my fault that mother is dead Misty. If I hadn't lit that log, then we would have been safe!! Why!! Why!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...its not your fault Kursed...\" I tried to assure her, but I couldn't help but think otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter now,\" snarled Smaug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you say such a thing?\" I snorted. For all I knew, the thing that mattered more to Smaug was getting revenge on being slighted than mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Mysteria, we all knew in the back of our minds that this was going to happen sooner or later. Mom's dead, and now we're on our own. So I'm not going to stand here and watch you two cry yourselves to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mother...\" whimpered Kursed. Smaug made his way up to Kursed. Up until the day she died, Kursed was the only dragon that Smaug had a soft spot for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kursed, there's nothing we can do for her anymore,\" said Smaug, \"She wouldn't want us to stay here. We've got to move on, like we aways do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same thing mom had said when small one and then our other brother had died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're right brother,\" she nodded, \"We've got to move on... but...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curved her gaze back toward Smaug, \"Her spirit, it must be in a better place now right?\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is...\" he responded. Had he said no, Kursed likely would have broken right then and there. I hate admitting it now, but we both followed him at the time because when the worst possible thing that could have happened to us happened, Smaug was the only one who managed to stay focused and get us moving again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wanted to leave the cave instantly after Mother had been slain, but Kursed remained inconsolable and more, the storm outside was mounting into a typhoon.  That night, we huddled in the corner of the cave that Mother had built for us where there had been nothing before.  Kursed shivered and sobbed until dawn came, and by then, we were all so exhausted we fell into an uneasy and fitful sleep.  Mother\u2019s dragon-blood flowed across the floor slowly, and like mercury, it remained dense and fluid long after mortal blood would have coagulated.  Years later, when I returned to the spot as a full fledged dragoness, I found that the blood had soaked into the stone itself, transforming the whole of the small cave into ruby studded granite where it had been merely brown sandstone before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, however, I woke with a shock when my front paws became wet with her creeping blood.  I couldn\u2019t help myself.  I shrieked and ran out of the cave, I saw blood, blood everywhere.  Mother\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMysteria!\u201d  Smaug called after me, but I didn\u2019t heed him.  I flung myself outside, the cave no longer tolerable.  Out on the shelf, despite the fact that it had to be midday, it was as dark as night.  I slid across the wet stone as the gale pushed me to the side.  I nearly went over the edge.  Lightning struck the mountain less than a quarter mile away, rocks slid down the slope.  The world had become a chaotic roiling of wind, water, earth and light, utterly unfamiliar.  It seemed appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over the edge of the cliff I was hanging on, it seemed almost a bottomless pit was under me.  I stared for a long moment, the blackness calling to me, promising to erase the pain I felt, to bring me back to Mother.  My grip on the cliff edge eased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong claw, pulling me back.  I fought it.  I wanted to go over the edge, to fly for the first and only time.  \u201cMysteria!  Snap out of it!\u201d  Smaug\u2019s voice was harsh as he tugged me back onto the shelf and threw me down onto the stone.  He sat on me to keep me from fighting.  I told him that wasn\u2019t necessary, but he didn\u2019t get up; he obviously wasn\u2019t completely without a brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that the moments drew on and Smaug\u2019s more than considerable weight slowly pressed the air out of my lungs, I couldn\u2019t see the point in continuing.  With Mother dead, there was nothing left, no hope.  \u201cYou have no right to stop me, Brother!\u201d  I hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you, Mysteria.\u201d  Said Smaug in my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled, but he held my head down on the floor with a claw and my tail was entangled with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he leaned down to my head and said something that shocked me.  \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me and Kursed alone.  It\u2019s not fair.\u201d  I looked up then and saw Smaug\u2019s heavy cut features framed against the thundering sky.  His violet eye was fixed on mine with an intensity that matched the storm behind him.  \u201cShe needs you, Mysteria.\u201d  He said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining against my brother\u2019s weight, I tilted my head and saw Kursed watching us from the entrance to the cave where Mother\u2019s body still lay cooling.  Her eyes were wide and vapid, seeing, but unseeing, a mere shell.  She\u2019d die without a doubt if I were to take the easy way out.  I sighed.  Nothing for me, not even dying was to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the floor saturated in Mother\u2019s blood, the three of us were forced out into the storm, not even Smaug was apathetic enough to her demise to sleep in it.  I hated to admit it to myself, but I let Smaug carry us through as we wandered down the mountain, seeking shelter.  I was numb and exhausted after my attempt to take my life.  Kursed\u2026 well, she wasn\u2019t even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountainside was nothing but loose boulders and smooth sandstone.  The waves crashed fifty feet into the air against the cliffs, so we moved further inland.  The sea seemed intent on following us, however, rising with a jealous hunger to consume the lowlands.  Animals fled or were drowned.  At least we had no need to worry for food.  Smaug, with his bulk and muscle proved to be an efficient windbreak while we were moving and always he went first, suffering the worst of the gales and chaotic winds which battered his body.  I remembered seeing him take a boulder to his shoulder which made him stagger, but he said nothing of it and continued on as if nothing had happened.  My brother seemed possessed by a spirit of purpose whereas before, he had appeared only vain, lazy and prideful to me.  I wish I could have known the dragon my brother would have been had Mother survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hiked all the way to the valley floor without finding any sort of cover suitable for three dragons.  Though we were but hatchlings still, we were all very large creatures nonetheless.  Before us, the sea had claimed new ground, the dry desert at the edge of the ocean was covered by sea surge.  My brother looked at it as he had the dragon who\u2019d killed mother: an opponent to be overcome and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to swim for it.\u201d  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dumbfounded at his apparent change in stance on the topic of suicide.  \u201cAre you crazy, Smaug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother tilted his nose up at the cliffs we\u2019d climbed down.  \u201cWe all know there\u2019s no shelter over here.  We need to get away from this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d never wanted to leave this place more than I did at that moment, but looking out to the churning waves then looked as sure a death as dropping from the cave shelf.  I looked out along the water\u2019s edge.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just follow the coast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug glowered at me and in that moment, I saw the insanity which would one day overtake and destroy the brother I knew.  He <i>wanted</i> to swim out there.  Not because it was the easiest or the most sensible thing to do, but because it was the hardest.  He felt a complex about proving himself that bordered on the insane.  He turned away from me and Kursed.  \u201cI\u2019m swimming.\u201d  He treaded out until he was knee deep in the sea water and turned his head back to us.  His eyes were softer, that darkness gone for the moment,  \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever want to see the other side of the valley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my resolve weakening.  Smaug promised to almost turn the misery of the world into an adventure.  It was an escape that I desired intensely.  Beside me, Kursed muttered, \u201cM-misty\u2026?  Can we get out of the rain now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrapped my tail around her flank and hugged her close to me.  \u201cNo, not yet, Kursed.  We have more walking to do yet.\u201d  Facing Smaug again, who was lingering in the water, I\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because if you think its bad now, who knows how bad its going to be later on!!\" he replied. He did have a point. Who knew what could be waiting later on the road. Perhaps it wouldn't be today, but down the line when we were older, that by challenging ourselves earlier we would survive a situation that we wouldn't have had we not taken the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed stared at the water, trembling. \"B-but I-I'm afraid of the water Smaug...\" she whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately expected Smaug to snap back at her, but he was sympathetic. \"So am I Kursed... But that's why we're going to it!! Otherwise we'll be scared forever!!\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everythings going to be all right... We're going to make it. All three of us,\" he assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...if you say so brother,\" answered Kursed. Her trust in Smaug was absolute and total, perhaps as much as it was with mother. He could have told Kursed to jump off a cliff, and she would have done it with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. So follow me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be the death of me brother...\" I snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug grinned. I hated the way he grinned like that. Yet worse than the churning waves and choppy seas was portraying myself as weak in front of Smaug. Thus we jumped our way out into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had learned how to swim, specifically, how to catch fish underwater. Yet that had always taken place during calm seas and under the close supervision of mother. Mother was gone, and tonight, the seas were anything but calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest obstacle when crossing choppy seas wasn't necessarily being tossed about, trying to keep ones head above water, or any mere physical hazards, but fighting to keep from panicking. It was one thing to be scared, but once panic set in, you were done for. Smaug shot out in front, leading the way. I'd never seen him swim so fast, and I both admired and resented how much faster he was. I gritted my teeth as I blocked out the pain in my muscles, determined not to fall behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet I was most worried about Kursed. She struggled all the way through, and was never one that was high on will power. About halfway there, she grew tired, and then she panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty...I..c-can't...\" wailed Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kursed!!\" I screamed. I spun around to fetch her, but I was bracketed away by a wave. When I turned back, she was gone. Damn that Smaug!! Damn him!! Damn him!! Smaug had led her to her doom!! I felt absolutely helpless to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet then something happened that surprised me that day. Smaug turned back the way he came, and with no regard for his safety dove deep underwater. I waited. It was only about fifteen seconds, but it felt like forever. Finally, Smaug re-emerged at the surface carrying Kursed on his back. He gave me this look. This look that said he wasn't going to leave either of us behind, and how dare I think otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you Kursed... Just hold on to me all right?\" said Smaug. Kursed just nodded weakly. Thus, now Smaug had to brave the choppy seas while dragging Kursed. To my frustration, he was still faster than I was!! Yet I could not help but admire him at the same time. Because the easy thing to do would have been to let Kursed drown, but he hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug would later tell me, that the harder you work, the luckier you get, and this time was the first instance of that statement coming into fruition. Not long after Smaug had saved Kursed from drowning, the storm began to peter out. The overwhelming deluge of rain slowed to merely a thunderstorm, what were once hurricane force winds slowed to merely a gale, and the tsunami like waves merely became choppy. While as before I had to fight for every stroke, I could now make my way forward with reasonable effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look everyone!!\" said Kursed from Smaug's back, \"I can see the coast!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tilted my gaze up. The outline of the craggy coast could finally be seen, and thank goodness!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" said Smaug, his smug confidence returned, \"I told you we'd make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided it was best not to comment at this remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, we reached the other end of the shore. No sooner had I crawled ashore when I collapsed back first in complete exhaustion. Every part of my body hurt, in places I didn't know it could hurt, and even my non-existant wings hurt. Smaug and Kursed were sprawled next to me, equally exhausted. After about half an hour catching our breath, we all gazed back about the distance we had traversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we actually did it,\" I couldn't help but marvel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" panted Smaug, \"Well, we're still not out of trouble yet though, because look behind us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did look. Now that the weather had cleared up to a mere grey, I could see all the way back to the other coast. I could see the outline of a few adult-sized dragons in the air, their gazes scanning about the coastline that I had suggested we traversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness...\" cried Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dragon who killed mother. He probably expected us to take the coastline,\" said Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face blanched. Had we taken the coastline, we definitely would have been dead. Once again, Smaug had proved an uncanny ability to be right about these type of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet why would that dragon be so interested as to send some of his minions just to kill us?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to say its to test us, but there has to be another reason why...\" replied Smaug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?!\" wailed Kursed, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but regardless of what it is,\" said Smaug, \"I'm not sticking around to find out what it is, we've got to get moving...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze switched toward the mountain range we were now facing. That was the other side of the valley. It was a very steep climb, and after swimming across the ocean, I was so not willing to climb a mountain at this moment.</span></div></div>",

I was bone-tired for the journey we\u2019d undertaken since Mother was taken from us, but I continued walking along the water\u2019s edge, my thoughts as stormy and cold as the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrew here, a fox kit there, the ground was littered with the corpses of the fallen and I fed on what I found.  Back the way I\u2019d come, I knew Smaug and Kursed were dining on a pregnant deer my brother had found wedged between two boulders.  He probably had to force her to eat...  Just like I forced myself to eat.  I wasn\u2019t hungry in the slightest, but growing up hungry had ingrained in me the instinct to take what I could when I could.  Who knew when food would be available again.  So I scavenged, no better than a common jackal or a vulture feeding on the dead in the wake of the devastating storm which was blowing itself out with as much speed as it\u2019d come.  But really, more than the meat, I was grateful for time to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concerns I\u2019d felt earlier about Smaug flying seemed petty and childish now that Mother was dead, dead because she\u2019d thrown herself in front of a blow meant for me and my brother.  My sensibilities told me that she would have died in any case, but my heart felt like she died somehow because of my own mistakes.  Perhaps if I\u2019d extinguished Kursed\u2019s log the moment I\u2019d seen it...  But who said that what happened had anything to do with the log?  I\u2019d spent a lot of time reflecting as I wandered apart from my siblings, but not out of sight of them, never out of sight.  Were there any signs?  How could Mother\u2019s death have been prevented?  What could I have done?  But Mother\u2019s death had simply fallen out of the sky, delivered by a dragon I\u2019d never met before and knew nothing about.  \u2018Shadowtooth clan...\u2019  I\u2019d thought then.  By the Ancestors, I wish I\u2019d never heard of the name, or that I\u2019d forgotten it as soon as I\u2019d heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breath rattled in my throat, and I moaned, feeling the stone under me.  I was conscious again.  How long had I been lost in memories?  It didn\u2019t matter.  My hearts fluttered weakly, my legs felt like they were made of stone.  The pain...  I was dying, and unlike the last time, there was no one left to save me.  I wanted to weep, but my eyes were closed and I didn\u2019t want to see, didn\u2019t want to feel anymore.  I felt myself slipping again.  Good.  I prayed I would stay under again permanently.  My life had been tragic, but it was still better than... this.  I thought I heard something move on the stone, but I was falling, falling away from that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third day after we\u2019d swam across the valley, Smaug\u2019s wings emerged.  There was supposed to be a grand ceremony, but none of us knew the ritual.  Instead, it had begun with my brother itching his rear end against a spiky tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were high up in the mountains.  The peak that we\u2019d recently traversed behind us.  It felt good having that sheltering bulk behind us, shielding us from the dragons we\u2019d seen flapping about the coast and from the memories of our old home.  The night sky was clear and the mountainside was blanketed with grass and violet desert flowers taking advantage of the recent deluge.  With danger less imminent, Smaug was a little less intense, though he remained changed from the vain slacker he\u2019d been before.  With his support and mine, Kursed was a little more lively as well, though she remained depressed and didn\u2019t speak much, just like I was depressed and didn\u2019t speak very much; though that was more of a natural state for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Gyramond.\u201d  cursed my brother, referring to the mythical father of dragonkind.  \u201cI feel like I have fire ants under my skin!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched with a prude disgust as Smaug rubbed his backside against the tree, his tail twitching with obvious pleasure.  The exposed grey skin on his back had grown to bulbous, translucent sacs which were hot to the touch... not that I wanted to touch them.  They were weeping a clear, stinking fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Smaug.\u201d  I said, striding up to him, unable to watch anymore.  \u201cYou\u2019re fledging.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug ceased his rubbing and turned his head around to glance at his back.  \u201cYou think so, Mysteria?  You think it\u2019s time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother said that when they start to itch, it\u2019s time.\u201d  I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug grunted approval and continued to look at the disgusting sacs which welled up between the scales to either side of his spine.  He stared at them, at the promise of what they held, with a mixture of hunger and... perhaps simmering rage.  Then he brought his head back around and he was again the idiot that I remembered,  \u201cUm... what do I do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scoffed and turned my head away, laughing.  \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d  I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea either, but I enjoyed the look on his broad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me, Mysteria.  Oh how they itch!  I can\u2019t stand it!\u201d  He resumed his scratching, but couldn\u2019t angle his back very well against the tree trunck.  Howling, he then rolled over onto his back, squirming in the grass.  I thought that the sacs on his back would surely burst under my brother\u2019s weight, but they didn\u2019t and even as I watched, I saw that Smaung was even beginning to weep with his discomfort.  I suddenly was not so anxious for my own fledging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed came up then, from further down the slope.  She cocked her head, looking at Smaug rolling and tossing on the flowery meadow.  She glanced at me and raised an eye-ridge.  I smiled back at her and shrugged.  I was enjoying the spectacle.  My sister strode forward to end my fun.  \u201cSmaug, what\u2019s the matter with you? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve gotten scale-rot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Kursed.\u201d  said Smaug, still writhing with his back on the ground.  \u201cMy wings are coming it, but it burns and itches and Mysteria won\u2019t help me! Arrgh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed shot me a look and clicked her tongue.  \u201cStand up, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug did, but his legs were shaking with the compulsion to scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you have to do is rub them against something sharp.  Here let me...\u201d  said Kursed.  I watched with avid interest as Kursed raised a claw and swiped it down Smaug\u2019s back.  Smaug moaned with absolute pleasure as the translucent skin split bloodlessly and Kursed was showered with an amber fluid that gushed out.  It was fairly odorless, but I was intensely satisfied that I was standing off to the side.  Smaug was left was a gaping wound in his back, but inside, I could see black scales shining, and more, boney digits and black leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d  Kursed shivered, saturated with the slippery fluid from Smaug\u2019s back, but she said, \u201cN-now, pull your wing out.  It needs to dry... and so do I.\u201d  she said the last in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Kursed.\u201d  said Smaug, but the grin he was wearing was anything but sorry.  \u201cLemme give it a try...\u201d  And I watched as he twisted his face with effort and I saw twitching in the wound in his back.  The wing emerged with a sloppy, halting gait and while it made a sucking, squirting noise as it did, it was the most amazing thing I\u2019d ever seen.  In moments, my brother went from a flightless, wingless lizard to a winged male dragon.  To my utter surprise, seeing him with his - extremely - large wing extended into the light breeze, he suddenly seemed quite handsome, the single talon  at the joint had a shape that nicely complimented the  nest of horns on his head.  I shook my head, clearing my thoughts.  Smaug was still but half a dragon at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wing membrane was pulled out after the wing and when it was fully extended, it pulled the wound in his back shut, like a reversed pocket.  Kursed hopped up and down with excitement for the first time since Mother died.  \u201cGreat job, Smaug.  You\u2019ll make a handsome dragon yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug beamed at Kursed\u2019s praise and he angled his wing in the wind, feeling it as if for the first time.  \u201cThat feels so nice...  Hey Kursed, would you mind doing the other-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed laughed, \u201cNo thanks, brother.  You\u2019re on your own now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me pleadingly and I stuck my tongue out at him.  A dragon should be able to handle himself.  And Smaug did, probably too well in the end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three of us continued our trek through the mountains. Smaug of course, boasted about his new wings the entire time, to the point where even Kursed began to find it annoying. However, growing wings and flying were two different things entirely. For the first week, Smaug was having trouble maintaining his balance, or wary that he accidentally wouldn't get his wing talon hooked around a tree or a rock, never mind hovering a foot off the ground. It was apparent that he wasn't going to be flying anytime soon, or else Smaug's head would have exploded from an acute case of overinflation of ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did Smaug's wings emerge, when my back began to furrow as well. For a while, I celebrated that fact, at the notion that soon I would no longer had to gaze at Smaug with jealousy. That is, until my back also began to itch. It was every bit as agonizing as Smaug had described, not that Smaug was at all sympathetic to my plight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mysteria, suck it up!! It can't itch that badly...\" grunted Smaug, with a dismissive wave of his wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...who was the one crying for us to help you a couple of weeks before?\" I snarled back testily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure you got a good laugh out of that. Now, I get to laugh at you now,\" taunted Smaug. Truthfully, had he suddenly decided to be generous, I would have refused because my pride wouldn't have let me, not to mention I would have thought something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so upset Misty,\" said Kursed, smiling indolently. \"I'm sure you'll have such beautiful wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure whether to blush or wince at the corniness of her last statement. Speaking of which, Kursed's back too was starting to furrow now, but it would still be about at least a week before she began to itch. In a way, I privately admitted I was relieved that I wasn't the last one who would grow their wings, and had that been the case it probably would have bothered me a lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug made this face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, we should probably find somewhere to rest soon,\" said Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but agree. That way I could find somewhere to scratch to my hearts content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-we also still don't know what's out there so its important that we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I heard the ever so subtle shifting of rock. I couldn't tell if it came from behind us or from the side, but my hearts began thumping. While we were still preoccupied with the emergence of our wings, of greater importance was that since we had cleared the peak, we had no idea exactly where we were going. These lands were unknown to our clan, never mind a group of fledglings living on their own for the first time. For all we knew, the mountain range seemed to extend to infinity. And thus, like the fledglings we were without a guide, we ended up stumbling into a situation we hadn't prepared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!! There's creatures about!!\" snarled Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my mouth shut as quiet as I could. Now, looking back upon it, I realized why that few dragons ever dared ventured to the mountain range that lay beyond the valley. Mother always warned us that a whole myriad of vile creatures dwelled in those mountains, the most dangerous of which were the orcs. They weren't especially large creatures, yet they were said to be a numerous, savage and primitive race of beings that had a taste for draconic blood. Of course, the three of us dismissed these as nonsense, as yet another reason for Mother to keep us compliant, but we found out that night there was truth behind that rumor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet my itch continued to stab at me like daggers. My eyes teared up, as my instincts screamed at me to relieve that itch at any cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand it anymore!!\" I hissed, as I tumbled to the dirt and began scratching incessantly. I instantly regretted my impulse. Emerging out from behind boulders, grass and trees were these horrid looking creatures. There were about twenty of them in total. These creatures, possessed gray, wrinkled, rotting looking skin, clad in various fur torn off the bodies of animals, and sharp horns. They snarled at us with rotting teeth, thrusting their weapons at us threateningly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stay quiet didn't I?\" hissed Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!!\" I snapped, with anger mixed with shame. Smaug probably would have done the same, or at least that's what I told myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" whined Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They were all around us. We had to make a decision soon, because if we just stood there, that would be the end of us.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first fundamental rule when dealing with orcs, was that if one could see twenty orcs, that meant in reality there were something like two thousand. No sooner had we spotted the initial twenty, when we spotted the shadow of several more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there seems to be quite a lot of them don't there?\" said Kursed, sounding strangely detached and releasing a hollow giggle. Again, that was one of her mechanisms for dealing with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor moment, Smaug unfurled his wings as if he were ready to take them all on by himself, but after nudging his head with my claw, he thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...lets get out of here!!\" shouted Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, we fled, fled for our lives. There is nothing like that wrenching feeling in ones gut, that combination of panic and the knowledge of being the hunted, when being chased by an entire horde of mindless, bloodthirsty orcs, charging forward without absolutely no regard for their own lives; a monstrous unstoppable tsunami of primitive rage and hate. For the first time, I knew what being prey felt like. And to these monsters, that's what we were. Meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe searched frantically for any pathway of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!!!\" cried Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead there was a narrow crevice that the three of us would barely be able to fit through. It wasn't the safest thing to do by any stretch, but at the very least we would be able to funnel them through a tight spot where their numbers would be more manageable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kursed you first!!\" said Smaug. Yet at that moment, Kursed stiffened into a babbling panic. As we had approached the crevice, she had taken that moment to curve her head back and face the horde that was rapidly closing in. It had happened at the worst possible time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!!\" he snarled. He literally had to push Kursed through the opening, where she was shocked back to her senses. I immediately tried to follow, but I was greeted by a loud crash. I careened backwards and gazed toward the crevice, only to find that my escape was blocked off by a boulder!! A boulder of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!!\" screamed Kursed voice from the other side. \"No!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pounded the boulder a few times. It defied my efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI curved my head and peered through the crack. Kursed had burst into a fit of hysterics, and even Smaug looked ready to panic. It was one of the few times I had ever seen Smaug indecisive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaug!! Get Kursed out of there now!!\" I yelled at the top of my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise that you won't die on me now sis?\" said Smaug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find a way out!!\" I cried back. Smaug could only nod numbly, before pulling my wailing sister away. Of course, I knew I was fooling myself. Not for the first, and not for the last time, I fully expected to die right then and there. Now, the horde was getting closer and closer. They could sense a meal. Frantically I made my way away from the crevice, trying to draw them away from Kursed and Smaug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I remembered my wings. Maybe I could fly!! Maybe, during this moment of danger, my wings would snap open and I'd be able to gracefully soar away from the orcish horde!! I strained my back as hard as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open you damn things!!\" I screamed. Yet no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't obey me. Eventually, the horde cornered me against the face of a cliff. They quickly formed a semi-circle around me. I bent down and faced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want a meal, then you're going to have to fight for it!!\" I yelled. Once again, I found myself feeling strangely unafraid, knowing that my death was inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!! Look up here you idiots!!\" cried an unfamiliar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did look up. There was a dragon. Or rather, that was the first time I ever saw <i>him</i>. He was a male dragon, and couldn't have been much older than I was, if at all. In his grasp was an orc covered head to toe with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want meat!! Go get it then!!\" he called out. With his claw, he tossed the still living orc into the middle of the horde of orcs. Immediately, the orcs spun away from me. I was then greeted by one of the most terrifying sights in my life. The orcs let out a collective, heart-wrenching sound, a terrible, screeching noise such that it would make a small hatchling lose all hope for life, as they turned upon each other for this piece of meat. I almost felt sorry for the orcs as his blood and guts flew in all directions, literally being eaten alive by the others. Then, as that orc's blood got splattered in all directions and splashed onto those orcs closer to them, those unfortunate orcs too became prey, until the horde degenerated into a chaotic mass of slaughter, as every orc became consumed into destroying themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Get out of there!!\" said the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned away from the slaughter, concentrating on keeping my jaw shut as I made my way toward where the dragon was perched. I merely followed the unfamliar dragon, still shaken by what I had seen, until we reached this small cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you have known better than to be out and about during one of the orcs' blood runs?\" the dragon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed at him with a quavering eye. \"Blood runs?\" I stammered, having never heard the term. Yet what frightened me more was the way the dragon put it into context, making it sound like something as common as the changing of the season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...not from around here are you?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Me and my siblings came from the other side of the mountain. We'd never thought that orcs were anything more than a rumor to scare naughty hatchlings until now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked ready to laugh out loud, but unlike Smaug, he seemed to think better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you're lucky to be alive then,\" said the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you haven't already noticed, the orcs have a taste for dragon blood. More accurately, if they don't drink dragon blood, they suffer for it. Every so often, the orcs work themselves up into a bloodlust, consuming everything in their path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how were you able to get them to turn on each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" he answered. He showed me a small cut he'd made on his tail. \"I covered an orc with some of my blood and threw it out in their path, and then their lusts get the better of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the dragon for a long while. \"Thank you for saving me, I don't know how I would managed to escape otherwise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a snort. \"Just don't do anything dumb like that again,\" he replied, sounding Smaug-like. \"Anyhow, you said that you were traveling with your siblings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Smaug and Kursed. I think they're safe though,\" I answered, or at least I hoped. Thinking about them made me think about what triggered the orcish blood run in the first place. Of course, my back decided that it would suddenly start itching like crazy again. I turned back toward the dragon that had helped me, and I felt more embarassed than I had ever felt in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you, you know...\" I stammered, unable to say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.... if you say so...\" he replied, suddenly looking extremely nervous. His claw reached for my back as if he were ready to reach into a pile of orc blood. He sliced on the membrane slowly. I expected to splash all over his face like it had with Smaug, but he was very good with working with his claws. He then slowly worked his claw on my other wing. Afterwards, he stepped backwards to give me space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I opened my wings for the first time. It was a sweet feeling, a liberating feeling, and the cool, sweet rush of air against its twin black membranes. As for the other dragon, I could feel him gaze at me with a sense of wonder and awe. Nobody had ever gazed at me like that before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't think I've introduced myself yet,\" said the dragon. \"I'm Wyrrach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but smile. \"Mysteria...\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, I felt as elated as I ever had. So much so that I broke into a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the sky, what do you see<br>\r\nA dragon soaring, swift and free<br>\r\nUp above she sings a call<br>\r\nAnd all the world wish they were she...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, at this final moment, it makes my heart shudder. The day I gained my wings, the day I met him. Of all the bad things that had happened thus far in my miserable life, and the calamities that were to follow, this was one of the few happy days that stand out. And in all those dark moments, they stand out all the brighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wyrrach...\" I sighed silently, \"I knew in the end you were too good to be true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wept... </span></div></div>",

After a while, he then slapped at it with his claw. The tough granite rock broke apart like it was made of sandstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heat it up and the bonds that keep the rocks together get weaker, and then all you need to do is give it a tap and you're through...\" said Wyrrach. I couldn't help but feel deeply impressed, and I did get the notion that he was making an active effort to impress me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where does this crevice go?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a secret entrance that leads to my cave. I'm almost certain that your siblings are there. I've always used it to escape the orcs, but since I've just gained my wings I don't think we'd be using it much longer,\" he explained. The crevice led upwards to a short, but rather steep mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Mysteria, the sides are kept smooth so that the orcs have no chance of climbing it, so it might be trickier than what you're used to...\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doubt my climbing ability?\" I replied. I didn't sound as annoyed as, say, if Smaug had said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all...\" he answered. However, if Smaug and Kursed did come through this way, I could imagine Kursed having an accident. We reached the top. I spotted Kursed and Smaug inside, Kursed looking very shaken and Smaug doing his best to keep him encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first...\" said Wyrrach, hanging from the cliffs edge. I ascended over the ridge and headed inside. I was immediately greeted by Kursed as she ran out to greet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!!!\" screamed Kursed with hysterical relief, pressing her head against mine, \"You're all right!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd told you I would make it didn't I?\" I answered, spreading my wings a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!!\" cried Kursed, her eyes as wide as saucers leaning backwards a bit, \"Your wings!! They're so pretty!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but curve my head away bashfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did he help you get them out?\" said Kursed with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly introduced Wyrrach to Kursed, and explained how he'd rescued me from the orcs and then led me back here. Yet Smaug didn't look impressed, in fact, he was fuming from the nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, you think you're such a bigshot aren't you? Thinking you can just come in here like you own the place,\" growled Smaug. Wyrrach's gaze immediately snapped toward Smaug, and the two rose up on their haunches and stepped toward each other until their faces only about a foot away from each other, as if trying to melt the other with his glare. Their puffed their chests outwards, wings arched over their heads, growls emerging from their throats as they sized each other up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I'll have you know that I live here, so you're my guest. I take it that you're Mysteria's brother Smaug right?\" said Wyrrach, his gaze not moving one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... that's right. Now what was your name again?\" answered Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wyrrach. Though I thought you'd be more grateful after I saved your sister from the orcs...\" he retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...right...\" answered Smaug, looking as if he'd rather eat his own dung than admit it. \"I also see you've taken the opportunity to open Mysteria's wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you've only just noticed? I fail to see how this would offend you so much Smaug,\" retorted Wyrrach. Smaug only made a resentful rumbling noise as he shifted his body a little more erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, they're acting really weird...\" said Kursed, curving her head next to mine. I couldn't help but sniff in agreement. I had expected it out of Smaug, but considering how mature Wyrrach had acted around me earlier, not out of him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that once males grow their wings, they begin strutting around like they're Gyrimond himself,\" I growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed and I could only watch with a preverse fascination as they began aruging over who was the better digger, the number of animals they could kill during a single hunt, who could climb faster and other rather petty things. While it was humorous for a while, I decided that enough was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, Wyrrach, since you're around here maybe you can explain to us all about the orcs, and where we are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug grunted resentfully. More than anything else, he hated being in a position where he was not fully in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wonder how this cave is big enough to fit all of us? Well, I used to live here with my mother and father. All the hatchlings from my clutch died, so they decided to have another when I was still very small, and the hatchlings from that clutch died except for my younger brother Vador. Anyhow, one day, our parents just dissappeared, which left only the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you said you had a younger brother?\" I said, \"Yet that can only mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feared I knew the reason why... Wyrrach scratched his claw against the ground, \"An orc raiding party came and snatched him away only a few days ago. Now its only me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sorry,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Smaug wasn't at all sympathetic. \"Coward...\" he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me!!\" retorted Wyrrach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I called you a coward. You said that they captured your brother, but that has to mean that you saw them take him am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing that I could have done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bull crap. You don't know that for sure don't you? Since you know the land so well, if you cared at all for your younger brother you would have at least tried to rescue him wouldn't you? Something doesn't seem right about your story...\" accused Smaug. He always had a knack at exposing these kind of things, and did so in a way that made you feel like a complete wretch afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach didn't have a response for a moment. \"All right, here's what really happened. I got angry at him for being a brat while I was scratching my wings out and I told the little prick to run off and see how he liked it off on his own. I saw him crawl off from my perch and get lost in the woods, and I watched him get captured by the orc raiding party and get stuffed in a cage and get dragged away. I thought he deserved getting the shit scared out of him for an entire night, with orcs threatening to suck his blood out, and make him regret being such an asshole to me. Of course, I thought I'd be able to just go after those few orcs and destroy them before they got too far, but that's when I spotted that orc bloodlust raiders approaching, so I panicked and scurried back to the cave like a coward. There, that's what really happened then. Are you happy I said it then Smaug? Go and rub it in my face with your claw...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug did look satisfied indeed. Yet not even he was callous enough to rub it in at the moment. I did feel bad for Wyrrach though. That he may well have cast his brother to his doom because of a stupid fit of rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can work together to get him back?\" I suggested. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wyrrach winced in surprise, as if the idea had not occurred to him until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet him back? A-are you serious?\u201d he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my utter surprise, it was Smaug of all dragons who offered his erstwhile rival sympathy. \u201cLook Wyrrach. We know what its like to lose family. I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m not about to let those beasts do whatever they want to us,\u201d he snarled, scratching his claws against the rock. I was in concurrence as well, yet I suspected that Smaug didn\u2019t truly care whether Wyrrach\u2019s brother died or not. To him, freeing a hatchling from the clutches of the orcs was but a challenge to increase his own power, but the thing about Smaug was that he could make others think that he cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quick to bring caution into the air. \u201cI very much doubt that the orcs are just going to stand there like goats and allow us to kill them. We need to know where they are headed first and then decide how to get him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach raised his head, \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with orcs all my life so I\u2019ll definitely be able to track them. We can catch up to them in a few days if we were to go at a reasonable pace. They\u2019ll probably be at a campsite of some sort. Though they do see reasonably well in the dark, most of them will be sleeping anyhow, and that\u2019s when we can attack to rescue Vador!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement. While Smaug was definitely a superior fighter, Wyrrach was a far better planner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug unfurled his wings, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just fly there!! It\u2019ll be faster!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursed lowered her head, somewhat shamefully, \u201cI still can\u2019t fly unfortunately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could leave her behind\u2026\u201d sniffed Smaug. Kursed shivered, looking deeply hurt. She was well aware of the fact that out of the four of us, she was the weakest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know I\u2019m not as strong or brave as you are brother, but I can still help out!! I\u2019m not helpless!!\u201d Kursed insisted. Her forcefulness surprised Smaug, but nonetheless appeared to be against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped forward before Smaug could say anything more about leaving Kursed behind, \u201cSmaug, we have to stay together, besides, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to fly there anyhow, as none of us had our wings until very recently and I\u2019ve seen your first few futile attempts at flight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug ground his teeth, yet he did not argue with that fact. We would likely need an extra set of claws and teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d cried Wyrrach, \u201cEven if we were confident fliers, they\u2019d be that much more likely to see us. The orcs expect dragons to attack from the sky and have prepared themselves as such. If they do, they\u2019d know we\u2019d be after Vador and they\u2019d kill him before we\u2019d be able to get to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug looked as if he would rather eat his own shit, but he relented.<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026we\u2019ll go with your plan Wyrrach\u2026\u201d he snarled through gritted teeth. I could detect only the slightest hint of a smirk on Wyrrach\u2019s jaw, before return to its usual serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then. Follow me, we have no time to waste\u2026\u201d he gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us followed Wyrrach down a series of winding mountain paths. Orc footprints were scattered, leading to all directions, but Wyrrach was able to pick up the right one by picking out his brother\u2019s scent amongst the others. Once more, I found myself deeply impressed by Wyrrach\u2019s instinctive knowledge of the land; he knew where all the hunting spots were, where the water was, places to rest a few hours during the day and spots to stay out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, we spotted what looked to be an orc encampment. By the looks of it, there seemed to be anywhere from forty up to a hundred of them. Certainly that was no small number, but not insurmountable for a group of four young dragons, especially if we had the advantage of surprise. At the edge of my vision, I could see a reddish-black hatchling being kept in a cage at the center of the camp, looking fearful and lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d said Wyrrach with a whisper, \u201cIt looks like they haven\u2019t spotted us. We\u2019ll stay close to the ground and get up as close as we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet just when we were about to move out, there was an unexpected development\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The orcs began bellowing more of their gibberish, and things grew more alarming as the chief raised what looked to be his war axe into the air. The small caged dragon whimpered with fear as the orcs began dancing around their leader, about to perform some kind of ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to move now,\u201d snapped Smaug. Like that, he took off, and expected everybody to follow him. I found myself rushing straight behind him; Smaug had already led us this far and he had an aura of personality and perhaps, a bit of fear of what would happen if I didn\u2019t follow him. Kursed came by afterwards; if Smaug told her to jump off a cliff she would do so with a smile. Even Wyrrach, who I already suspected didn\u2019t have as much favor for Smaug, came forward, if for no other reason that he wanted to save his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shockingly easy how quickly the orcs died before our claws and acid. As I clawed and rended and slaughtered it was strangely empowering, like being caught in a red haze as orc blood splattered everywhere. Yet Smaug took to the slaughter with a gusto that was both awe-inspiring and frightening, throwing himself into the thickest of action without regard to his safety. The orc chieftain posed a bit more of a threat, but this did not stop Smaug, in fact, it had only seemed to excite my brother, as he took a special pleasure in slaughtering him with particular violence. In fact, Smaug literally ate the orc chieftain raw and swallowed right in front of Wyrrach\u2019s brother, and then let out a feral roar at what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The camp is secured for now,\" said Wyrrach, considerably calmer and even keeled, staring with distaste at Smaug's tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Was that it?\" scoffed Smaug, \"I was expecting more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Smaug,\" I cried, \"We came out what we set to do, lets get Wyrrach's brother out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vador had stared at Smaug with something approaching reverence and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!! By the Ancestors that was totally awesome!!\" he cried, gazing up at Smaug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the beginning,\" said Smaug, as he broke the cage open and pried him out, \"Soon, this entire land will be ours and all will bow down to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet it be said that Smaug never thought small, and this was but the beginning of his quest for absolute power. At the time, I believed it was because that he wanted to avenge the death of mom by becoming powerful enough to destroy her killer, but what I didn't know was that wasn't the reason at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaug!! There's more of them!!\" cried Kursed with concern. I switched my gaze over the ridge, and indeed, there was perhaps an entire army of orcs coming at them. Ancestors, there was more, there were always more; far more than dragons could conceivably slaughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancestors!! Lets get out of here while we can!!\" cried Wyrrach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a coward!! We can wipe them all out!!\" insisted Smaug. Already, both Smaug and Wyrrach were arguing, as males were wont to do - arguing over dominance. I had to speak up to break the deadlock, as otherwise, nothing would get done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I think I have an idea!!\" I cried.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thoughts were swirling in my mind as I was faced with fighting perhaps a thousand orcs.  But I was flushed with the recent combat and still tasted the orcs' black blood on my lips.  We were five strong now, five dangerous young dragons and my venomous spray was not nearly tapped yet.  Between my claws, my long tail and even my wings, I did not feel too threatened with my siblings and Wyrrach and Vador alongside me.  \"Will that blood trick work here again, Wyrrach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young black and red stripped dragon looked up at the gathering horde which was spreading along the tops of the surrounding hills to surround us.  \"Perhaps, but they do not have the look of mindlessness about them this time.  They're at least attempting to surround us.\"  Valor pressed against his older brother, unlike Kursed his back was far from blistering and he was smaller by at least 50 stone, still head and shoulders over the head of an orc though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\"  scoffed Smaug.  He tossed his head at the corpses strewn about the camp around us.  \"Look how easily we can slaughter this vermin.\"  As if to emphasize the point, he scooped up half a carcass and shoveled it down his maw, his muscular neck bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not wise to fight on a full stomach...\" remarked Wyrrach.  \"It makes you slow and vulnerable should it come back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug glowered at the other male, lifting his head and spreading his ruff.  Meanwhile, the orcs were beginning to descend towards us now.  Some stopped and began launching sticks towards us, but neither of the big males paid attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped between them, slapping their snout with both of my wings. \"You two can mount each other all you like after this is done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug growled rough agreement and turned towards the approaching humanoids who were beginning to charge now, their shouts filling the night.  \"Sis is right.  Let's kill this scum.  Besides, I'm still hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach let his distain for my brother show openly on his face, but turned to face the opposite direction at yet more angry orcs.  I faced north and Kursed took her position south.  Valor was left to fill what space he could and at the center of us, our tails mingled, but not for long as we raised them over our heads and shoulders for stabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was a long mechanical grind of bloodshed and screams and roars and death.  Despite their thirst for dragon blood, the orcs were not equipped with weapons which might have threatened us, not a one of them had a pole arm.  The never got close enough to hack us with their axes and spiked clubs.  I'm not sure at all why they rushed so eagerly to their deaths and towards dawn, I was filled more with pity for the sad creatures than anger.  They kept coming, but slowly, their numbers faded, their strength totally ineffective against our scales our assorted weapons and deadly breath.  Valor hung back, perhaps the only one of us really vulnerable, while Smaug practically charged forward after a while, seeking the thickest patches of orcs to lay into, as if he were jumping into a living pool of rapidly rended meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Wyrrach hang back, slightly surprised to seem him so laconically handing out death, that is, until towards the end, he took to the air and began rounding up the stragglers from the surrounding hills, forcing them towards us and preventing their escape.  Even Kursed fought elegantly, frequently skewering orcs on the end of her tail and flinging their bodies into still others.  For myself, I grew bored of the killing despite nearly falling to their hands just over a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose, we were all moving more slowly, but the remaining orcs no longer rushed us.  In fact, it was all Wyrrach could do to keep them from bolting in all directions.  We had moved almost half a mile from where the slaughter had begun and near the end, we had rounded up the last batch of orcs and cornered them in a small, wet gully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmug lay on the ground disinterested.  He'd gorged himself and though he hadn't vomited as Wyrrach had warned, he seemed lethargic now, perhaps even vulnerable if the rest of us hadn't been there.  Valor surprisingly stepped forward.  \"Let me get in there.  One big blast of venom and they should be melted or dead for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach landed with a thud next to him and slumped his head in exhaustion.  \"As you wish, brother...\"  I was sure that he hadn't actually heard what Vador had proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vador went forward to finish the wretches, I checked him with my shoulder.  \"Maybe we can find a better use for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What use are they other than food?\"  asked Wyrrach who finally bent his head to feast on a fallen orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was slightly at a loss myself, but I felt sure now that I had bother to speak up.  \"Perhaps they can be trained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Train orcs?  Like to sit and fetch?\" laughed Kursed.  The battle lust had already left her I noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Among other things...\"  I said, brushing myself against my sister.  I was covered in grim, but felt the need for contact.  She giggled again.  \"Let us make them our thralls.  They crave dragon blood already and they have been humbled.  They fear us.  We can culture that fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good are a bunch of stinking orcs going to do us?\"  Cried Vador, still obviously upset at his recent imprisonment.  \"Let us end them now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to check him again with my tail, just like my mother once did to me.  He whimpered, but Wyrrach did not move to defend him.  I felt a keener regard for the winged drake at that moment.  \"Think about it.\"  I said, turning to each of them.  \"We have no clan and these are not the only orcs in this area.  This is just one horde we have dispatched.\"  I gestured to Smaug and Wyrrach in turn.  \"We don't have the energy to keep doing this.  But if we can make the orcs war against one another, perhaps we can have some peace, at least until we can grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug only grunted, \"Do as you wish, sister.\"  He seemed ready to drop into sleep where he lay.  Wyrrach looked at me, his brown eyes meeting mine.  I wanted to know more about his mysterious red markings, to touch them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear me?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head.  \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, that I think it's worth trying.  One of us should go down there and see if we can subjugate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pointless.  They're barely more than food beasts.\"  said Vador, seething, but the small drake sensed that this was not his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did not vote on who would go down to face the last of the orcs.  I turned my back on the party and padded down the slope, my paws quickly damp and muddy with the stream at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orcs did not face me as warriors, rather they seemed resigned to their fate.  I sat down and curled my tail about me, really studying them for the first time.  I noticed that I had not yet seen a visually female version of the orc and I recalled something that had squirreled its way into the back of my mind.  A song from my mother:<br>\r\n<i>Silly drakka chase the greenskin<br>\r\nTo rip and tear and take their meat in<br>\r\nSilly drakka grows sleepy one morn,<br>\r\nUnaware that their spilled blood grows more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that is why they fled here, where the ground is moist.  I remembered that orcs grow from the ground, which explained their various sizes and why they were so careless with their lives. It also explained why no dragons had bothered settling this region.  It must be soaked in orc spores.  I switched to pigeon Drakine, a very simple language and spoke to the gathered orcs.  \"Do any of you speak?\"</span></div></div>",

Only absolute destruction awaits. If you oppose us, you will be rendered as nothing more than fodder. Know that we can slaughter you all whenever we please, and that attempting to oppose us is futile,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc before me continued to shiver, completely catatonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-p-please,\u201d it begged, \u201cLet live\u2026 me no want to die\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, I rather enjoyed the sense of absolute power I had over this creature and the all-encompassing fear it had of us; that it knew how helpless it was before me and that I could manipulate and control its entire pitiful existence, far more so than the rather dreary act of slaughtering them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d I said almost playfully, tilting my head closer to the wretched creature, \u201cYou wish to live is that right?

In fact, if you pledge to devote yourselves to us, then we can promise you power, glory and supremacy above all the other clans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I could see hope forming in the orcs eyes, and the thirst for power within this simple creature. If they could be granted but even a small taste of the power we had, then we had them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-power? Y-you help Lugbug become mighty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI twisted my neck forward and spoke to him from the side, and then said with a quiet tone, \u201cOh indeed High Chief Lugbug. By serving under us, none will not have a chance against your might; you will be invincible to the others. All will hear your name for the ages, you shall be legend\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesss\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d the orc grunted, \u201cThe Blackrock, Hellscream, and Dunmar clans\u2026 they will bow, bow before Lugbug!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Chief Lugbug, and all you minions,\" I said to the others. \"The fact that you are all still alive against our wrath proves your superiority compared to others of your kind! By pledging your loyalty to Lugbug, and to us, you will all be stronger!!\" I bellowed. It was almost absurdly easy to toy with the primitive emotions of these orcs, and I couldn't help but be amazed at how monumentally stupid and lacking in foresight these orcs truly were. Or perhaps I was better at this than I had previously thought and had actually managed to learn a thing or two from mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYess\u2026. Yess!! RAAAGGGGHHH!!\u201d bellowed the new chieftain, raising his axe into the air. They all let out fresh chants, proclaiming their power and also that of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors Misty!!\u201d cried Kursed, hugging me tightly, \u201cThere you are!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking all over for you Mysteria,\u201d said Wyrrach. \u201cWe were worried\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my heart skip a beat for a moment and smiled. \u201cThanks for being concerned Wyrrach, but I\u2019m all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug let out a snort. \u201cWhat exactly were you doing sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I did tell you that the orcs could be trained,\u201d I said a little smugly, just watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back toward the assembled orcs, who were all already bowed low before us, gazing with a combination of fear and awe, \u201cWho do you all serve!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe serve you mistress!!\u201d they all bellowed. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a rush when I heard those words, knowing that all these scared, stupid little minions were now willing to do anything to serve us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey really serve us now?\u201d cried Kursed. She curiously walked up to one them, as if observing a small pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou orc!! Sit!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc in question sat without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the orc obeyed. Kursed then proceeded to tell the orc to do all sorts of random acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Ancestors, they really do obey everything we say!!\u201d she cried gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, \u201cThey are very simple creatures actually. Give them a taste of glory and they\u2019ll do anything for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach looked deeply impressed, and there was almost a sense of eye in his expression that made my hearts skip. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate what you\u2019ve accomplished Mysteria. Until now me and my brother have always just been on the run from them, but you\u2019ve managed to turn the tables\u2026 In fact, with enough time, we might be able to control the entire marshlands!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug, surprisingly enough, was the one to keep them in perspective. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he snorted, \u201cBut you don\u2019t seriously intend to keep your promises to those orcs do you? Encourage them too much and they might decide they\u2019re strong enough to face us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good point; despite Smaug being a bloodthirsty killer, he was a lot smarter and shrewder than others gave him credit for. I couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cOh\u2026 I have no intension on keeping the full extent of my promises to them. Besides, there are always other clans, and if we can give a demonstration of our power to the others and plant the idea in their head to desire our favor they\u2019ll all fight each for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get it!!\u201d cried Vador, \u201cThat means, if one group of orcs grow too powerful we can switch sides, and that way they all keep killing each other and not us!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! We\u2019ll say the same thing to the other heads of the clans, not to mention others within their clans, like immediate subordinates. Of course, they might eventually figure out the betrayal, but none of them are likely to live long enough and there are always other dumber orcs we would be able to control\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Smaug looked impressed, \u201cWow, I\u2019ve got to admit sis, I didn\u2019t think you could be that much of a manipulative bitch. As Mysteria has shown, we can use these orcs, and in fact, I think this could be an additional opportunity for us. If we can help fight alongside some of their battles, we\u2019ll also grow stronger in turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time though, I could also sense a bit of concern in Smaug\u2019s expression. If I could manipulate orcs like that, who was to say that I couldn\u2019t also manipulate other dragons? It was a question that hadn\u2019t yet occurred to me yet in those early days yet it was something that Smaug always kept in mind as the years and decades progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I think its best if we all headed back for the time being,\u201d said Wyrrach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter 23<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the orcs to pick up the pieces of their shattered clan and retreated to Wyrrach\u2019s cave, or hole rather.  No one could have mistaken it for a proper cavern especially given the large fissure in the ceiling which let in both light and rain water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI imagined that it might have been a comfortable enough hidey-hole for Wyrrach and Vador, but with the addition of Kursed, Smaug and myself, we could scarcely have been packed closer.  In fact, we only fit because Samug deigned to have Kursed rest her head on his shoulder and my tail drape over his haunches.  Wyrrach held Vador close and despite the cramped conditions, no one protested.  We were all bone tired and well fed to boot.  But it was nice, I have to admit.  It seemed like the first semblance of calm I\u2019d had since mother had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all must have slept for over a day.  Smaug slept for two.  I stepped out of the hole, carefully extricating myself and stepping over the small form of Vador, sometime after twilight had passed.  Quickly, I clawed my way up to the top of the plato over looking the marsh.  After relieving myself, I sat facing the marsh, a breeze flowing from my back where the coast was.  The wind felt good on my wings and as I stretched them, dried orc blood flaked off.  I told myself that I must find time to groom myself, but I did not feel like stirring just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretched my wings until the leather was pulled taught and tried to feel the way the wing moved over their curved surfaces.  Smaug, despite his own exuberance, could barely fly still and I\u2019d only had my wings out for scarcely a few days.  I wondered if it might be best to simply throw myself into the thick of it and trust my instincts.  The fall from this ledge would surely not be fatal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon landed near me, kicking up grit and I hissed instinctively and arced my tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d  laughed Wyrrach as he folded his large wings to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed, embarrassed.  \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d  I said, lowering my tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright.  I\u2019d worry more if you were not so quick.\u201d  said the drake as he padded closer to me.  \u201cI saw you down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that this was the first time that Wyrrach and I had been alone, at least in a case where one of our lives were not in danger.  I swallowed.  I did not want him to see how tense I was.  \u201cI bet it was easy for you, zipping around up there.\u201d  I realized how petulant I sounded the moment the words left my lips, but I could not take them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach brushed them off, so much more cool headed than Smaug would have been.  \u201cI\u2019m not a great flyer, trust me.  I barely started a month ago.\u201d  He lowered his head nervously and looked just barely back up at me as he nudged himself closer.  \u201cI\u2026  could show you\u2026\u201d  He coughed and straightened up again, \u201cWhat I know\u2026  about flying that is\u2026  it\u2019s not much\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t stop myself from giggling as bad as Kursed.  I realized then that he was as nervous being around me as I was around him.  \u201cHaha, alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me what you know.\u201d and I touched him with my wing.  He flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, first, let\u2019s face into the wind.\u201d  We both turned around and faced into the breeze.  Wyrrach spaced himself quite far from me to allow for both of our wings and began to talk to me about gliding and banking.  \u201cFlapping all the time is hard.  I learned to fly by gliding first on the coast.  It\u2019s not so hard if you fall too.\u201d  He laughed and I joined him, it was surprisingly easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was feeling a bit heady being around him so perhaps I acted a bit more rashly than I would have otherwise.  But regardless, I felt suddenly that I could simply wait no longer.  \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s try this!\u201d  and with a shout, I leaped off the precipice and into empty space.  Wyrrach called for me behind, but he was already far behind, his voice fading into the rush of the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as exhilarating as it was terrifying.  I snapped my wings open, cupping the air and afraid to move them for fear that they would give way under my weight.  And despite holding them open, I was still falling surprisingly rapidly.  \u201cShit, Shit, Shit!\u201d  I chanted as the rocks below rushed past.  A sudden breeze knocked into me from the side and I nearly tipped over.  Some instinct saved me as I began flapping to stay afloat, but I seemed to gain no traction either in altitude or against the prevailing wind.  At the very least, I did not experience any vertigo, I seemed to have a sense for the way my body was positioned relative to the ground, even as I was floating dozens of feet above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to panic, but then there he was again flapping hard, but breaking the wind for me with his body.  He roared over the wind in Drakine.  \u201cDon\u2019t fight the wind!  Let\u2019s glide down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Wyrrach and mimicked the way he held and flapped his own wings and very shortly, I was coming to a rough landing at least a mile from where we had started.  The wind had carried us out into the lowlands.  I felt surprisingly tired and supposed that I needed to build muscle tone.  With an effort, I folded my wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was quite reckless for a first flight.\u201d  said Wyrrach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m still alive at least.  It\u2019s more than can be said for many dragonlings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach grinned toothily.  \u201cAye.  I think we\u2019ve both had more than our fair shares of death in our time.\u201d  Wyrrach moved closer, a bright light in his eyes.  We were alone in the marsh, a young drake and a young drakka after her first flight and things might have taken a predicable route had I not seen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook.\u201d  I said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach cocked his head.  Together we observed several orcs plodding through the marsh.  They spotted us and bowed low.  I gave an assenting nod and they continued about their business, which apparently consisted of plucking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d  I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen them at this before.  It\u2019s a bit soon, but then we\u2019ve soaked the ground in their blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  I was about to ask, but then I saw an orc pull an unusually large lichen from the ground, but rather than a root attached, there appeared to be a small humanoid with immediately began to write and complain.  The orc stuffed it under his arm where there were already two other such creatures, still covered in peat and stinking.  \u201cDisgusting creatures\u2026\u201d  I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that they are replenishing their numbers.  Our horde will not be effective without more warriors.\u201d  said Wyrrach who sat observing the procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat beside him and mantled my wings, aware that though the orcs did not look at us directly, we were still being observed.  I sighed roughly as they receded from us.  \u201cWe are going to have to learn more about these wretches aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThem.  And others too I imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked an eyebrow at the drake beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur clan is never going to have the numbers to fight the shadow tooth.  We have only two females.  Our only hope of survival is to absorb what strength we can from these humanoids and I doubt that these lowly orcs alone will cut it.  But they are not the only race that lives in the area, or so my sires have told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was rendered quite speechless for a time, surprised by Wyrrach\u2019s foresight, but also by his audacity.  Two females?  He already counted me as his mate and despite my attraction to him, I could not help but feel anger at his presumption.  But also, with Kursed being the only other option in terms of females, that left no one to potentially pair with Smaug.  That was a prospect that I suddenly feared would enter his mind as well, if it hadn\u2019t already.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I steamed, thinking a long time about this. Wyrrach had been a bit presumptuous, but not so presumptuous like my brother. If he wanted me, he would have to be patient, and to his credit, Wyrrach had shown patience. Maybe it had been because he had been the first male I had met that was my age that hadn't been my brother, but as time had passed, I had found myself more and more attracted to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I thought back on him, I found myself continuing to gaze hazily outside my cave, wondering what was and what could have been. Smaug hadn't liked him. He was possessive in that sense, in which he could not bear to see anything he rightfully thought of as his fall out of his control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, there was a thump at the foot of the cave. Wearily, I tilted my head. If something or someone had come to finish me off, I was in no position to possibly fight, as blood continued to slowly and steadily seep onto the ground. Then my nostrils caught a whiff of a familiar scent. A scent which I never wanted to hear from again. A dark, malevolent figure came in. He was powerful, strong, with a piercing gaze that could wrench the life out of any creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-smaug!!\" I stammered weakly, but with as much anger as I could muster, \"S-so, not satisfied with what you have already done, you have come to f-f-inish me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bastard had already taken too much from me, and now he wanted to gloat and watch his own sister die. I had always known from the very beginning that Smaug would do anything or kill anyone for power, with the malicious streak to match. I was already going to die sooner or later, so it didn't really matter what I said to Smaug anymore. It was liberating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet to my surprise, Smaug was not in a boastful mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defiant to the end sister,\" he replied, \"I always admired that about you. Yet I wanted to speak with you again,\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you at least <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug then did something I never expected. He gave me a hug. I wasn't sure if he was mocking me or if I should feel touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always loved you Misty. You idealized everything that a dragoness of our race should be; strong, intelligent and manipulative. By the Ancestors you were manipulative Mysteria. None of the other dragonesses I've ever shared my lair with could possibly compare to what you would be. You were both my inspiration and my near ruin,\" rumbled Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sniffed at him, \"It wasn't nearly enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was not. In the end, there could only be one of us, but I do regret that it had to end the way it did. Had you not been my sister, I would have given everything to try and conquer you and made you my mate, and we'd have had strong little ones together.\" He gazed at me with those possessive, lustful eyes, and I couldn't help but feel sick, but in a strange way, touched. I suppose it was his way of saying that he respected me, but the fact he would look at me in such a fashion was both disgusting but somehow not surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick Smaug... And you knowing the type of dragoness I was, you would have had to watch your back every single night...\" I snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug couldn't help but grin widely. \"Indeed, I would have, and we would have loved it every step of the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. Was Smaug still trying to unnerve me like he could with every other dragon he had met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never understand why you liked Wyrrach the way you did,\" said Smaug. \"More than once, I've wondered that you decided to take to him just because you wanted to make me squirm, and have him be a threat to my power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. \"A dragon like you could never understand why I came to him and not anybody else. You were the one who chose to believe he was your enemy when he didn't have to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug snorted, \"You honestly expect me to believe this Mysteria? That Wyrrach was such a accommodating, good natured individual to not seek power for himself and how being with you could be a way to get at me? Come on sister. You're way smarter than that. The only real difference between me and Wyrrach was that Wyrrach was better at hiding his true ambitions from others. A dragon that you saw as worthy enough of being your mate could not possibly not have ambitions or plans of his own for power... In fact, you're the reason why he became as dangerous to my position as he did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at Smaug, hating him for what he had taken from me, but at the same time I could take some solace that he had also feared both me and Wyrrach. \"I wish that things hadn't ended up the way they had, but perhaps... perhaps it was inevitable. Yet what you did to Kursed... that I will never forgive you for Smaug...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug's smug expression instantly vanished. Kursed was the only dragoness that Smaug truly had a soft spot for. Kursed had been a rather poor flyer, not particularly strong, stunningly na\u00efve nor had she been particularly intelligent; all the qualities that were fatal for a Shadow Dragon. She trusted others easily, and others had exploited that, including myself as I had to shamefully admit. And she had trusted Smaug most of all. Kursed would have done absolutely anything for Smaug, and she had suffered badly for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kursed wasn't meant to live the life we led. She deserved better,\" admitted Smaug. \"Her egg should have been taken from our mother and raised to live far away, where she wouldn't have to worry herself about the troubles of the world. Yet she wasn't, and I tried to protect her the best I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe the words he was saying, \"Protect her?\" I scoffed. \"You, who took advantage of her more than anybody else!! She did absolutely anything for you and she died because of you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she would have died sooner were it not for me!! Remember that storm the day after mother died? She would have drowned that day if it wasn't for me!! Yet there was only so much that I could have done!! Not without threatening my hold on power and thus risking her to some other dragon who would have taken even more advantage of her!!\" retorted Smaug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven to this day, Smaug was using this same justification over and over to make himself feel better about what had happened to Kursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lost Smaug...\" I snorted, \"How could you possibly say that. How dare you say that... especially after what you did with her!! How could you be so sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!!\" snarled Smaug. \"You couldn't possibly understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want to understand that type of thing Smaug, and I'll be glad to die not understanding why in your twisted mind you believed that you would do such a thing with Kursed... And if I hadn't been with Wyrach you would have tried to do the same to me,\" I retorted with as much strength as I could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I don't need you to understand,\" replied Smaug softly, turning his head away. \"Yet in the time she was alive... she made life more... bearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat I could agree with. Yet clearly, 'bearable' to Smaug had a drastically different meaning from what I saw the meaning of the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose its useless now to imagine what could have been,\" said Smaug. \"All I know is that I did what I had to do, regardless of the cost to myself and those around me. Only with an iron hand can our people can be united, and without it, there is chaos, disorder, strife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he did not sound like the triumphant conquerer as he must have imagined himself to be when we were all small. And so, as I laid bleeding out, I couldn't help but pose one question, \"So, are you finally satisfied Smaug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug had a forlorn look. \"I'll admit that I will miss having these types of bitter arguments with you. Its rare nowadays that there are others who tell me to eat shit, so frankly, now that it will be gone... I don't know... I really don't know if I will be satisfied...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I admit that the journey it took to get there... That was satisfying...\"</span></div></div>",

So, I told your son that I had mortally injured his mother, I splashed your life blood in his face, and that he should look upon his uncle and sear that hatred into his memory. I mocked him, told him that he was weak and foolish, and so was his worthless father,\" taunted Smaug. \"Then... I let him go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you.. you have made a terrible mistake then, by letting him go...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I did so intentionally, just like the dragon who had killed our mother, and let us go. Do you see how strong it made us? Only through the fires of our hatred did we get to where we did... Your son realized what was happening too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly realized what Smaug had done. I had taught my son to be good, like his father, but with his one act, Smaug had corrupted my son, and had taught him to hate, taught him to become a twisted fiend like his uncle. The cycle of hatred amongst our people would continue, and we would forever be slaves to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug looked proud, \"Hahahahaha!! And you know what he said back? He told me that once he grew up, he was coming after me to take revenge for his mother. He told me that I was making the biggest mistake of my life by letting him live, because once he grew up, he was going to destroy me. He was going to destroy me and kill all my sons, rape all my daughters and demolish everything I held dear and that I had built!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how proud I was of him when he had said that! You have a strong son Misty, and he will govern our people well!!\" he cackled maniacally, his green eyes glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gurgled at him, and I had never hated a dragon more than I had in my entire life. I hated it, because I still wanted revenge on Smaug for what he was perpetuating in my son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So rest well Misty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaug made his way out, and I made to chase after him. But I was too weak. My body wouldn't move. I would slowly bleed to death over the next few hours, agonizingly. Too weak!! Not enough... It wasn't enough!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I left my sister behind, to die in that cave. At last, my ascension to power was complete. Everyone who had once opposed me was dead. In all honesty, I regretted that it had to end like this. Mysteria had been the only dragon who could compete at my level, who understood me the keenest; she was my sister after all. That had been what made her the most dangerous of all, as she was the one dragoness who could have jeopardized and destroyed everything I had worked to achieve. Yet her words nagged at my mind; was she ultimately right about me? She had warned me that this sort of power would leave me feeling hollow if there was nobody to share that with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a foolish notion that one could potentially share power. There was only one voice that the shadow dragons could be ruled with; his, and there could be no others. There could be no disobedience, and transgression was marked with harsh punishment, because without it, my people would once again fall into chaos. My people hated me, feared me but ultimately respected me, and they understood that to defy me was like defying the Ancestors. In fact, at this point there was little distinction between the two; I had become the most powerful of my kind that had ever existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ascended back into the sky and surveyed all that I ruled. I bestrode a great empire, with huge armies at my beck and call, riches galore, thousands upon thousands of slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose it was making me melancholic now, to really take the time to think back on my life, on how I got to this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a marvelous strategy you employed with those Ironscream orcs Wyrrach. I thought Smaug had that battle won but you turned the tables so quickly!!\" said Mysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrrach shrugged, \"Smaug's Bloodrager orcs almost had us there, but luckily the plan worked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched with great jealousy as Wyrrach was hitting up with my sister. He was saying the most corny things to her, and Misty had that dreamy smile on her face. I swear, Mysteria always enjoyed provoking my anger like this; she did these type of things to get on my nerves, rattle my psyche and perhaps even be in a position to oppose me one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, let me explain the context here. some time had passed since Mysteria had solved the riddle of the orcs. It was surprisingly easy now that I thought back on it. Orcs were easily manipulated, and wanted power beyond all else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we came up with a system. We would rile up several distinct groups of orcs and get them to battle each other, promising their dumb, short-sighted chiefs power and glory. They would fight, and destroy themselves, and only the strong would remain. We would cultivate the stronger of the orcs and get them to fight still more orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysteria then came up with the scheme at making the periodic orc fighting an actual contest. Wyrrach would command one band of orcs on one side, while I would command the other band of orcs, while Mysteria would referee. Each of us would build up our own 'orc army', select each of the chieftains, organize a battlefield, and each give the orcs promises of plunder and glory, and set them off against each other. The point was to make sure that we both learned how to direct the orcs in battle. The fact that thousands of thousands upon orcs were killed in this cruel, endless slaughter and bloodshed, and that we had created a situation where the orcs were dwelling in a state of constant battle slavery because of a contest between two growing adolescent dragons did not even occur to us. I mean, who cares about the lives of orcs anyhow?  They'll just pull out more orcs out of the ground, and we just continue getting them to kill each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was one variety of orcs that showed themselves to be stronger on the battlefield, we encouraged them to breed more of them, but when there was one variety that we judged to be weaker; whether it meant they tended to be weaker in strength, speed or the fact that their type annoyed us just a bit more than the others, well, we would just slaughter their whole line and start over. Though I never said so to Misty, and especially not Wyrrach, I did have to admit that those organized orc slaughter contests were rather fun for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that the orcs would catch on to the game we were playing with all of them and that we were just using them for our own power. But they never did. They were too pre-occupied with the short term, and the very few chiefs who did figure it out, well, there were always subordinates who wanted power and we always killed them off anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet my mind was still obsessed over Wyrrach, at how he had managed to both triumph with his orcs over me and impress Mysteria in the process. Damn him! He would pay for this! My nostrils billowed with black smoke, as I imagined spearing my claw through Wyrrach's heart and seeing his blood splatter throughout the floor, and then slapping Mysteria around a bit to remind her who was really in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Smaug, no need to look all angry,\" said Kursed with that vapid smile of hers. \"I actually think they look so cute together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gaped for a moment, but at the same time, I could never bring myself to be angry with Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute?\" I scoffed, \"More like revolting is more like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody sounds jealous...\" giggled Kursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lie though. It was bugging me that Wyrrach was getting closer and closer with Mysteria. Don't get me wrong though, Wyrrach was no scrub. He was a very capable dragon, someone who knew the area well, was disciplined and intelligent. That's probably why I especially hated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kursed,\" I said, \"Ever since we met... Wyrrach and his brother, we haven't managed to find any other dragons. Granted, we've spent nearly all our time here, growing up and fighting with the orcs, but I am getting a bit worried. There can't just be the five of us. Can there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows for sure?\" shrugged Kursed. \"We have a nice group right here. Why would we even have to move from where we are anyhow? Its nice here, there's food and we have the orcs as a tool to protect us should anything go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the dragon who killed mom...\" I snarled. \"I promised that I would never let him get away with what he did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we ever since such a dragon?\" said Kursed. She didn't really show that much inclination for revenge that I did, and I suppose it was only natural for her to get comfortable here. Frankly, I wished that neither of my sisters would have to be involved at all, and that I would achieve vengeance on my own. Misty would be able to survive on her own; she was devious and strong, but Kursed... I knew she would not survive for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that's why I tolerated the situation at that point in time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a magnificent Dragon.  A wonder to behold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your story of your rise to power and glory.  There are many paths to power however.  Will you be an unstoppable plague on the land?  A compassionate warrior with a sense of honor?  Will you have a host of fanatical minions?  A vast hoard of gold and wealth?  It is up to you to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting is in High Fantasy.  There are elves, dwarves, halflings and other strange and marvelous creatures to be found, but keep in mind that the world is mostly populated by humans.  Magic is a powerful and mysterious tool known only to a small proportion of the population, but do not fear!  A dragon's hide will deflect most cantrips and other minor magics, only the most powerful of arch-magi can hope to challenge a dragon on even terms...  A dragon's hide will also keep out most arrows and glance aside blades, but beware of siege weapons such as ballistae and catapults as well as heavy piercing weapons such as lances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReligion and gods are abound in the world, but they are known to bide their time and be mysterious in their workings.  Fortunately for you, you are a dragon and care little for other mortals' foolish notions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragons have a magic all their own though they do not will it into being like other simpler creatures.  Often, mysterious things can happen around dragons when the situation is appropriate.  Don't count on it to save you though!  Your wings, claws and tail are far better allies.  Remember always to keep your wits about you, there are thieves and assassins around every corner.  While you may find that you befriend some mortal creatures, remember that you will always be apart from their world and will always be treated with fear and suspicion even by the stoutest dwarf or the most open-minded elf. Finally, beware other dragons!  Just because you're the same species doesn't make you friends; everyone's out to build their own hoards and secure their own mates after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, some ground Rules:<br>\r\n1) No sexuality or erotic content (Implied sex, like with a dragon mate is fine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Killing the main character is ok, but must be thoroughly justified (either by persistently bad or extreme choices)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Maiming or crippling the main character is ok, but keep it tasteful and not needlessly gory.  However there must not be complete incapacitation (loosing a leg is fine, neck down paralysis is not) and no mental handicaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Dragons are the top of the food chain, don't invent inherently more powerful creatures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Romance between the main character and non-dragons is ok, but keep it to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Be true to your Path and Personality.  Keep both in mind when you are writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Side note: If you want to create your own dragon breed or are otherwise unsatisfied with the choices presented, feel free to send me an e-mail and we'll see if a solution is possible.<br>\r\n</td>",
