You watched with a sort of morbid fascination as you could see each of them bulging out of one of Ada's cheeks. The giantess had her eyes closed in pleasure as she swished her little victims around in her mouth. Eventually she opened her eyes, when she looked at you broke from your stupor and began thrashing to escape her hand but to no avail. Ada kept eye contact with you in her hand as she swallowed, first one wriggling bulge and then the other. She traced their progress down her esophagus with her free hand and rubbed her stomach as the miniscule couple reached their destination. Then it was your turn, slowly she raised you to her face. You began screaming as her mouth yawned open into a fleshy cavern before you and you were slowly pushed through her lips. You were immediately soaked in saliva, her humid breath blasted your face, and her tongue rose beneath you. You tried to fight but her tongue threw you about her mouth as it pleased and again you heard her low moan of pleasure as she tasted you. It felt like an eternity f torment in her mouth before she swallowed. Her head tilted back, her tongue pressed you against the roof of her mouth, and you were inexorably drawn headfirst down her  throat. The trip to her stomach felt longer than was possible as the muscles of Ada's throat kneaded you downwards.

Looking up from the coffee table you could see that Ada sat on a cheap couch as she looked down on you, she set her gun and holster aside as she considered you. The shrunken couple sobbed and clutched at each other as Ada smiled. Ada reached one massive hand towards you, there was no way you could stop her from taking you in her firm grip. She shifted her grip so that you dangled by one arm grasped between her thumb and forefinger, after she seemed satisfied with her inspection she lowered you into her cleavage.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, this sucked. You didn't even have the words to express how much it sucked. You had been eaten alive, gulped down by a gigantic undead woman. That sentence was easily the most unrealistic, unbelievable thought to cross your mind, but the situation you were in was so far outside your definition of normal you really didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, your city (and the whole world, likely) had been caught up in an honest-to-God zombie apocalypse. Second, you had somehow been reduced to a fraction of your size, a living breathing human being only a little bigger than a toy army man. And thirdly, you had been swallowed whole by one of the zombie ladies prowling the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one bright side to your situation, however. The lady who's gut you were currently imprisoned in was, as mentioned earlier, stone-cold dead. Dead people, as a matter of fact, lost all of their bodily functions, both voluntary and involuntary when they died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to reiterate, you were currently stuck in the slightly-overfilled stomach of a dead lady that had absolutely no stomach acid to speak of. After your initial discovery, you had been immensely relieved to find that you were not going to dissolve screaming in agony into a puddle of goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, your phone told you that several hours had passed since you'd been gulped down by your dead-head red-head captress. And after several hours wallowing in a slimy, squishy sac full of decomposing meat, you were almost willing to take the gastric juices of death than put up with this hell. And to further aggravate you, you had no idea just where the hell you were! The zombie you were inside was still alive (or at least whatever served as alive for them), and she had clearly moved on from the location she had nabbed you at. She could be anywhere inside the city, so even if you did somehow manage to get out of the stomach you had no way of knowing if you would emerge to safety and security, or another horde of zombies. And at your size you had quickly been proven that you weren't even able to outrun a single zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one thing gave you a clue as to what might happen in the next several hours; the meat pile you were sitting on (urgh) was clearly in an advanced state of decay. You were no expert, but it seemed to have been about a week since this particular zombie lady had eaten. Figures, she had shitty luck in life, and she had shitty luck in death. Sucked for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, both of you were hungry. You had only a few ways of escaping this hell on your own. If your gigantic necrotic captress was successful in taking down pray today, her stomach would likely be filled to the point that you'd have a chance at crawling out of her throat. On the flip-side, you could try and signal someone for help. It  wouldn't be a conventional distress signal by any means, no, you'd be using your environment to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas being produced by the rotting meat surrounding and piling up beneath you was steadily building in the undead woman's gut, and every several minutes you'd hear a loud, long *BWOOORPH* as the building gasses erupted out of the woman's mouth. She'd have a hard time creeping up on anyone, but if you could shift the meat inside of her (as disgusting as it was) you could likely make her stomach fill up with gas more quickly. The lady's intestines seemed to be absolutely plugged shut with rotting meat, clogged to the point of allowing nothing to pass through them, so if you could get some of that gas to flow back into the stomach the ensuing belches would likely alert every living being around the zombie to her presence. Just hope you didn't end up gassing yourself...</span></div></div>",

You thought she probably didn't realize that because you were smaller so things sounded much louder you could hear much better than a normal sized person. You didn't get another chance to protest as Jill sat down, removed her boot and dropped you into it, she then put her foot back in on top of you. Her foot entering behind you pushed you into the toe of the boot, every time Jill took a step her crushed you just enough that it didn't do any permanent injury but it still hurt like hell. That was pretty much the rest of your day, you sat and thought about how maybe you shouldn't have gotten mad and talked back to the giantess who held your fate in her hand. At some point you noticed the sweat, it didn't start out that bad but as the day went on and Jill did more walking the smell got worse and worse. Eventually Jill took her boot off again and removed her foot, you were relieved at not having to share the space with her titanic foot anymore but there was still the smell and the sweat in there with you. The reason why Jill had stopped is she was setting up to rest for some time, she looked at her boot with the tiny man in it. On one hand she did feel it was her duty as a S.T.A.R.S officer to take care of him, on the other hand he was kind of annoying... For now at least Jill decided to...</span></div></div>",

Jill had apparently tripped on rubble while running down the street and she was just getting up and her eyes locked onto you, but you weren't looking at her, you were looking at the 50 or so zombies shambling towards the two of you. Jill scrabbles to her feet and scoops you up in her hand before sprinting down the street. \"Over there!\" you shout as you point to a damaged apartment building. The front wall is just collapsed enough that it could be climbed but it would probably be too difficult a climb for the zombies considering how uncoordinated they were. Jill sees what you're pointing at and makes for the building, she starts to climb up the wall. The climb is difficult since she's stuck holding you in one of her hands but Jill is able to climb into a second story window and collapse panting, setting you down on the windowsill. The horde that had been following reached the wall and began clawing at it to no effect, a few of them managed to climb a foot or so up the wall but quickly lost their grip and slid back to street level. You looked down at the walking corpses as they tried to reach up for you \"well, looks like they're too dumb to go inside and look for stairs so we should have some time\" you looked over your shoulder as you spoke. Jill was regaining her feet.<br>\r\n\"Told... you... not to struggle\" Jill gasped between breathes.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" you looked up at her \"I needed to see what was happening, plus you can't say I was no help\" you give her a winning smile as you say that last part. Jill has caught her breathe and she smiles down at you, it's when she opens her mouth to respond that you see a familiar figure approaching behind her. You shout a warning and Jill whirls around just as Ada Wong lunges at her from the shadows. The two massive woman are locked in a grapple, you can see that Jill is trying to hold back Ada's hand. In that hand Ada is holding a syringe filled with a clear liquid.<br>\r\n\"Well hello\" Ada sneered \"it looks like you found my little friend, well I found a convenient way to make more like him.\" As Ada talked she was trying to force the syringe into Jill, you could see that Jill was wavering in her attempts to keep Ada at bay.

From your position on Jill's shoulder you could see both the smile on her face and the struggling bulge in her cheek where Ada tried to somehow push her way out of Jill's mouth. Jill used her tongue to maneuver Ada into a position where she could speak around her, although when Jill opened her mouth to talk you could catch glimpses of Ada struggling inside her. \"Well lets get going.\" Jill said as she turned to you, her mood seemed to have gotten much better since she shrunk Ada. Jill lay her open palm in front of you, you stepped onto it and she placed you back between her breasts. Jill got herself resettled and set off to leave the city, she went out the back of the building to avoid the horde that had chased the two of you into the building in the first place. While you sat under Jill's shirt while she walked you thought about if you could get her to do things to other people like you did with Ada. The opportunity came later that day. Jill pulled you out of her cleavage to introduce you to a group of twelve survivors who'd also been shrunk by the gas attack like you had, there used. You talked a bit and while Jill would be happy to help them she was worried she didn't have comfortable places to carry all of them. You didn't pay attention to the entire conversation because you were thinking, maybe you could try to get Jill to do something to them. Maybe it would work, the only problem was that while she was happy to put Ada in her mouth (Ada was still there as far as you knew) she might not want to hurt these survivors since they seemed like decent people. You should probably make a decision before Jill notices how distracted you are...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris stared at the top of the glass jar wondering what his next move would be as Excella had left the jar close enough to the edge of the desk that he could possibly escape, it would only be a matter of time before Excella returned so Chris would have to act fast he could not give up now and let that giant bitch win their was still a chance and he owed his fallen comrades Chris would make sure that their deaths were not in vain and besides if he stayed in the jar he would end up as Excella's slave a fate that  he would never accept so he had to at least try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright then lets do this'' Chris said with confidence as he backed up as far as he could, ''This is gonna hurt'' Chris then ran towards to other side of the jar and with as much force as he could muster he bashed against the glass and managed to tilt it forward and the jar began to fall crashing hard against the lab floor, The jar smashed into pieces sending Chris flying through the air and landed face first against the leg of a nearby chair he then slid down on to the cold floor of the experiment room, It was a huge risk that he took but it worked he was out of the jar but he had suffered a few cuts and bruises he stopped for a moment to heal himself and then began to observe his surroundings, the room was big and he was only a tiny speck on the vast surface of the floor ''Where to go now?'' Chris muttered to himself as he noticed that Excella had left the door open, Chris decided that would be his best bet and sprinted across the floor towards the door and exited out into the massive hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris figured this must of been a leftover TRICELL facility which would explain how Excella had access to It but Chris didn't even know where to go from here had almost no way of contacting command and almost all of his team was wiped out, the only choice Chris had was to try and find a cure for the virus Excella must of had some vial to reverse the process Chris just had to find It and that's when he noticed an open vent above him he decided to climb the nearby crates it took a while but he reached the opening of the vent ''It will be easier and quicker If I move through here'' Chris then began his journey through the vent he shuddered at what Excella said to him he really was no bigger than a bug but that wasn't going to stop him from getting out of this situation, He was Chris Redfield after all! He then noticed an opening in the shaft up ahead and light was emitting from the room below and when Chris looked to see what was In the room he was shocked to see it was the goddess herself...Excella, ''This must be her personal quarters...but What's she doing?'' Chris said carefully leaning closer so he didn't fall through the gap and into the room below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcella was ecstatic she had perfected her shrinking virus and captured her old enemy reducing him to nothing more than her personal slave, she decided to celebrate with a bath and of course some personal time with the two miniscule soldiers who had been pleasuring her for the past few hours, Excella removed her high heels which had decimated a few of those pathetic BSAA insects, She began to rub her feet which had also reduced many soldiers to a bloody pulp, ''It's time to relax'' Excella said as she removed her dress revealing her luscious breasts and huge curved ass, she then removed her panties and fished out the two soldiers who were soaked in her pussy juices.<br>\r\nShe began to laugh ''You bugs should consider yourself lucky to have served my glorious body!'' she then entered the tub with her tiny slaves In hand and began to masturbate using their tiny forms as she layed in the tub thinking about what she will do to Chris when she returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris once again watched on In horror as his two remaining teammates were fed to the goddesses hungry pussy he was helpless to do anything about it he only hoped that Excella would be so distracted he could somehow find the cure In her room, but he did not expect what the evil Titaness would do next down below in the tub Excella grew tired of the soldiers as they were no longer able to pleasure her to a good standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled them up towards her face as they protested but she merely laughed at their pathetic attempts to break free from her long slender fingers ''You bugs have lasted long enough and now it's time to serve me in the ultimate way!'' she said smiling at her prey as she opened her mouth and slowly began to lower the soldiers towards her perfect lips, ''NO PLEASE YOU CAN'T EAT US WE CAN'T DIE LIKE THIS HAVE MERCY!'' but Excella simply ignored their pleas and closed her soft lips slowly sealing the fate of both soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mmmmm'' Excella moaned in pleasure as the BSAA soldiers slid down her throat and Into her stomach to be digested<br>\r\nShe then layed back In the tub to relax and let the soldiers slowly be dissolved by her stomach acids.<br>\r\nChris meanwhile could not believe what he had witnessed she had eaten his last two teammates the only other people aware of his current size he was truly alone now, ''THAT BITCH... I WILL MAKE HER PAY FOR THIS!'' he said as he slammed his fist down on the vent but unfortunately for him this caused the shaft to swing open and he began to lose his grip ''NO THIS CAN'T HAPPEN'' he said struggling to hang on but at this size he simply could not hold on any longer he lost his grip and began to fall down below into Excella's personal quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then saw that he was heading straight for....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The land was hard, harder than the fall from the jar, but<br>\r\nsomehow he managed to survive. The only thing was that he was in pain and couldn't move for a moment. He needed to rest <br>\r\na little in there...in the giant heel which crushed his friend before ! The smell was bearable, but not good either..Well Chris prefered<br>\r\nto ignore that he was forced to smell Excella's foot odor, and tried to recover as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Excella was enjoying herself in the bathtub. Her eyes closed, she wanted to feel her poor victims trapped in her stomach,<br>\r\nbut she was disappointed as she couldn't. Now there only Chris, the last shrunken soldier. Of course she could shrink other people<br>\r\nif she needs, but she prefered to have some of her ennemies in her hands, and not some insignificants random people. With Chris, she<br>\r\nwill take pleasure to crush his pride, make him cry, and see the despair in his face. He was hers, her property. He will live to serve her whim.<br>\r\nShe giggled at this thought, then she decided it was time to use him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt a little better, but still weak. Anyway, he managed to climb to get out from the heel. As he was on the back part of it, he could see<br>\r\nthe giant nude Excella putting a leg out of the bathtub, and took a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh no this is not good at all...\" Chris said. He looked around, if he tried to escape now, she will see him for sure. But if he get back inside the <br>\r\nheel, there's a possibility she will put her foot in it soon...What will he do ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire had reloaded her revolver and was worrying about how many bullets she had left when she felt a flutter in her stomach and suddenly remembered that she needed to get the little guy out of there as soon as possible, also she should probably apologize for eating him.

Inside Claire you could tell that something was happening but it felt weird and you didn't realize what it was exactly until you started being forced upwards. After the reverse of the trip you'd taken you found yourself lying on your back in a pile of bile, looking up you could see Claire wiping off her mouth and looking at you with worry in her eyes. \"I'm really Sorry but that was the best thing I could think of to do with what was happening, are you alright?\" She asked you.<br>\r\n \"I'm fine.\" You snapped as you stood up and started trying to get yourself clean, Claire reached down and picked you up. She pulled out a handkerchief from her coat and helped wipe you off.<br>\r\n \"You're not too mad at me are you?\" And then after you didn't answer her for several seconds Claire went on. \"Please answer.\" You hadn't answered so far because you were still deciding how mad you were about this, looking into her eyes you could tell she was actually sorry but that might not make up for swallowing you.

She\u2019s been running all around the city and encountering these things at every turn. Her mission was becoming more and more difficult. Get the virus sample and get out. Hard to do that with zombies at every corner and street of the city. She needs a moment to gather herself. As she was bent over, she saw a small figure approaching her feet and latch itself on her boots. Now they come in small sizes too? What kind of virus is this? She mutters. She shakes her foot and knocks the small zombie off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the violent shaking, you get knocked off her foot and back onto the ground. You watch as the lady adjusts herself to full height and looks down at you with disgust. So you creatures come small too? Great\u2026.. At least this way, you\u2019re easier to kill. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what!? No, no, no, no! I\u2019m not a zombie!! You said as you watched her boot rise into the air. You barely had enough time to get and run out the way as it comes down. You jump out the way just as her boot hits the ground. Tch\u2026 Nimble little thing. Hold still! She said. Wait! I\u2019m a person! You shout. You dodge her foot again. And again. And again. And again, until you got an idea. When she dodged her foot this time, you latch onto it. Rgh\u2026.! Get off. She said. She shakes her foot violently and you cling on for dear life. You little\u2026..! That\u2019s it! She said. She reaches down for you and pulls you off her foot and brings you to her enormous face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve wasted too much time with you. I\u2019ll just\u2026. Wait. You\u2019re not a zombie. She said. No\u2026. I\u2019m\u2026.human. Please\u2026.. help me. You said, out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny human? In the midst of all this? Ada had a bunch of questions. Did the virus do this to you? Where there others just like you? Any side effects of your current state? Her mission was to retrieve the virus sample, but this changes everything. She was already getting paid well to retrieve the virus. If she brought you AND the virus to her employer, she could possible retire. But looking at your exhausted body after she tried to crush you made her feel a bit bad. It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t killed innocents already, but your size made her heart go a bit soft. </span></div></div>",

But see you like this made her heart soften. Not only were you caught in this hell like everyone else, but you were small as well. That was beyond having bad luck. Someone wants you to suffer. She\u2019s surprise that when she was trying to stomp you, you didn\u2019t just stand still and let it happened. She looked at you with a soft expression and brought her finger to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s ok. No need to worry. You\u2019re in safe hands now. She said while gently rubbing your head. You were too exhausted to say anything, so you jut nod. Here. This might not be the best place, but you can rest there. She said. She opens her pocket and places you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her pocket, you were smiling. You\u2019d do more if you weren\u2019t out of energy. So you just rest yourself until she wants you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a safe spot, Ada pulls you out of her pocket. Sleep well? She said. Yeah. Thanks for not crushing me. You said. Yeah\u2026. Sorry about that. So what\u2019s your story? Were you born like this? She said. No. I have no idea how I got like this. You said. You must be pretty brave to walk the streets alone at this size. She said. Actually, I was getting away from a crazy woman. You said.  A crazy woman? She said. Yes. She\u2019s lost it. All this going on and she\u2019s focused on me. You said. Why is that? She said. I ran from her because she wanted to use me as her personal toy. You said. Well I can see her point a bit. You are adorable like this. She said, smiling. You blush lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about you? How did you get caught in all this? You said. I\u2019m looking for something. Then I\u2019m out of this city. She said. What are you looking for in a city overrun with these\u2026..thing? You said. Ada giggles and gently pats your head. Sorry, little one. But that\u2019s a need to know basis. She said. Fine. Keep your secrets. Just take me with you out of this city. You said. I don\u2019t know\u2026.. The helicopter only has room for one person. She said. How much space can I take?! You can literally fit me in your pocket! You said. It\u2019s a small helicopter. She said. Look, I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. Rub your feet, be your stress toy, whatever it is you want. I won\u2019t even complain about it. Just take me with you. You said. Ada lets out a little laugh. Relax little guy. I was only teasing you. I was going to bring you with me anyway. I\u2019d be crazy not to bring you. She said, smiling. O\u2026.oh. You said. But I will remember what you said for a later time. She said. G\u2026.great. You said, dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what I\u2019m looking for is underground. And the perfect place to get there is through the police station. She said. Wait the police station? Isn\u2019t that the one with the black gates in the front? You said. Yes, why? She said. That\u2019s where I was coming from. And that\u2019s were that crazy lady is. You said. Well, time to head back she said. I\u2026..don\u2019t know. You said. I won\u2019t let her touch you if she\u2019s still alive. Plus, you want to get out of here? Right? She said. I really do\u2026. Ok. Just keep me out of her reach if she\u2019s alive. We didn\u2019t part on good terms. You said. Ada drops you down in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her smiling down at you. Don\u2019t get use to that spot forever. You\u2019ll have to earn it when we\u2019re out of here. She said. Why didn\u2019t I just keep my mouth shut? You said.</span></div></div>",

Or her chances in this place? Sure, she'd survive longer than you would at your current size, but not for that long surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, we can both get out of here. She said. .....How do i know you won't just toss me away or forget about me at the first sign of trouble? You said. I'll look after you, i promise. She said. Her words sound sincere and honest, but you need a little more before you take the chance. .....Prove it. Give me a sign of trust. You said. Step onto my hand. She said, knelling down and putting her hand on the ground. What?! Just like that? You said. Yes. You wanted a sign of trust. She said. Yeah, a sign. Not a walk into the lion's den. You mutter. Look, you can't survive at your size. Just trust me. I promise i won't hurt you. She said. You look away the back at her. .....Damn. I really hope i don't regret it. You mutter. You walk up to her hand and climb on. She pulls her hand back and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee? I told you i wouldn't hurt you. She said. For now. You say lowly. Now, we just need a way out of here. She said. Maybe pick the lock? You said. I don't have a lock pick on me. A hair pin would work too, but I don\u2019t have that either. She said. She looks around until her eyes fall on you. What? You said. You could fit into the keyhole and unlock it. She said. Me? I don\u2019t know anything about picking a lock. You said. All you have to do is remove the tumbler. Simple. She said. Alright\u2026.. You said. She takes you to the keyhole and you jump in. Remove the tumbler. How the hell am I going to do that at this size? You said. You find what looks like would be the tumbler. Great\u2026. Going to put out my back doing this. You said. You push against it with all your might until the tumbler is out of socket. You walk out of the keyhole and onto the lady\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone. You said. She pushes the cell open and steps out. Nice job. Told you it was simple. She said. Yeah\u2026.  You said. Claire saw that you were still uneasy about this situation. Look, I know it\u2019s hard to trust someone you just met, but I mean what I said earlier. She said. \u2026..If you say so. You said. Well, now that we\u2019re out of there, only thing now it where to keep you. She said. Keep me? You said. I can\u2019t have you in my hand the entire time. I need to put you somewhere. She said.  And where would that be? You said, not sounding eager at all. Why don\u2019t you choose? She said. Me choose? You said. As a sign of trust. I\u2019ll let you choose where you want stay. She said. So anywhere I want to go, you\u2019ll put me there? You said. Sure. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. This is not what you expected. Seems like she wants this to work as much as you do. So now the question is where do you want her to put you? You could have her put you in her pants pocket. Or in her jacket pocket. But why stop there? Maybe have her put you right into her cleavage? That way, you can at least get a little enjoyment out of being this size. Could you hurry it up? I don\u2019t like standing here in a place like this.

She did say that, and she is a woman of her word if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. Could you at least look away? She said. You turn your back as she starts to undo the buttons on her shirt; revealing her black bra. She then places you between breast, which made her blush a little. There. Happy now? She said. Yeah\u2026. You said. She starts to button her shirt back up, but leaves one undone so you would be able to breathe. Claire was hoping that you weren\u2019t some pervert and you knew to keep your hands to yourself. Ok\u2026.. Let\u2019s get out of here. Claire starts looking for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, you couldn\u2019t help but smile a little at how this situation has turned out for you. She was moderately endowed. If nothing else good happens, you can say you ridden between a woman\u2019s breast. Hey. Do you know the way around here? I think I\u2019m lost. She said. Shit\u2026. You said. You usually stayed away from this area. You only came down here once to prep a prisoner and after that, avoided this place like the plague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a right here and turn left at the next intersecting hallway. You said. Following your guidance, she comes to the door. When she opens it, it leads to a catwalk the overlooks more empty cell. What is this place? Why are there so many cells? She said. You knew the answer to that one. Your boss was experimenting on a lot of people. More than you could count. These cells would be full of people. One person in each one. The one time you meet your boss, she didn\u2019t exactly tell you why she needed all the people here, but she said it was to find an escape. An escape from what, you have no idea. But one thing is for sure, every single person who comes here, ends up dead. One way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire comes off the catwalk, she pulls you out and places you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. I think you owe me a few answers here. She said. Now? I thought you wanted to get out of this place. You said. I do, but I don\u2019t like being in the dark. So what is this place? She said. Crap\u2026. You didn\u2019t expect her to pry so soon. It\u2019s not like your boss is coming to your rescue any time soon. And Claire hasn\u2019t done anything to you, yet. But that could always change. And you still weren\u2019t ready to give her the benefit of the doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on. I didn\u2019t put up a fight when you wanted to ride in my cleavage. The least you can do is tell me what this place is. She said.</span></div></div>",

I won't joke in your panties and in your mouth you could bite me by accident. So ... I'd rather go in your boots.\" the little man cleared to Claire as she outlined a dumbfounded face. \"I understand your reasons, but you should keep in mind that I have been running from one place to another on this island in search of a way out and I don't wear socks you know? Besides ... I haven't showered since this started ... It won't be nice there ... \"Claire replied. \"Aaghhhh would have preferred you not to tell me damn it! Do you know how difficult it was to decide this?\"<br>\r\nThe little one expressed his disagreement. \"I'm sorry,\" Claire said as she unfastened one of her boots. Although he was worried about the latter, the little man still kept his decision and as soon as Claire took off his boot he entered slowly. The smell was bad, but not so horrible. The worst was the sweat inside the shoes. By not wearing socks, the boot was soaked in sweat. The sweat was such that, being a leather boot, it looked like a swamp.<br>\r\n The boy did not want to experience that \"swamp\" first hand so he decided to stand at the base of the heel, so when Claire put his stinky foot he will not have to suffer under his sole. Unfortunately for him, Claire lifted his boot to put it on, and this caused the little man to walk completely face down in the center of the boot having a full test of Claire's sweat. It tasted sour and was very unpleasant, so in the middle of the panic he just turned upward and caught his breath. \"Damn Claire! Warn before doing that!\" the little one exclaimed furiously from inside the giant's boot while she continued with the process of putting on her shoes, now with a new involuntary insole. When the little man saw Claire's foot enter, he began to hyperventilate and in an attempt to stand up, he slipped with his sweat and fell on his bottom. To dodge Claire's toes, she decided to go to bed quickly, but this had sealed her place under her sole. Claire, meanwhile, was buckling her boot again. This time tighter than ever \"It would be bad if he somehow fell off my boot, it would be best to adjust it to the maximum so that there are no openings.\"<br>\r\n When Claire finished she felt a pleasant sensation of pressure on her sole \"wow, hey, are you small? I thought you would stand by my heel to avoid the plague, but think that you would put on as my template so I can feel if you are still inside of my boot and you didn't fall .... Well thought out! \" Claire praised her tiny companion while she was boiling in rage, since because of her he was in this situation. \"And although I hate to think you're suffering, I like the pressure you make against my sole, it's like a relaxing massage,\" Claire thought to herself as she went deep into a warm tropical island.</span></div></div>",

You didn't have time to take in the true terror of her mouth as you plummeted straight down the woman's throat. It was dark inside her, the muscles of her esophagus pulled you deeper and deeper. You could actually feel Claire quietly moaning as you traveled through her, eventually you reached her stomach with a wet plop.

As you sat in her dark wet stomach you felt the vibrations of Claire patting her stomach, then you heard her voice.<br>\r\n\"That was amazing, I wish I'd taken more time to taste you, I suppose that wonderful feeling of you squirming in there will have to be enough for now.\" You heard the giantess let out a satisfied sigh before she continued...</span></div></div>",
