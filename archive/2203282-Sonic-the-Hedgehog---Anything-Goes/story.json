They all wanted to see what that power source they detected was... only to find out they had been chasing each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well,\" Sonic said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah...\" Mario said.  The two stared at each other awkwardly while Bowser and Dr. Eggman glared at one another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This is a colossal waste of time,\" Bowser said, turning to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I agree,\" Dr. Eggman grumped.  \"Move out.  We're going home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know,\" Peach said, admiring the architecture of the stadium.  \"A little cleaning, some magic here and there, and it would make a great place for an Olympic stadium.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMario blinked.  \"You serious?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally frowned.  \"Wait, magic?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeach nodded, creating some sparkles.  \"Our kingdom is rife with magic.  Maybe combining it with your world's technology, we can set up some great games.\"  She turned to Bowser and Eggman, the latter still leaving, the former having stopped to listen.  \"You all are invited, of course, so long as you play fair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have got to be kidding,\" Eggman said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"...No, no, we've done this before,\" Bowser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"SERIOUSLY?!\" Eggman asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBowser nodded.  \"Yeah.  Sometimes I go go-karting with these losers.  Or play sports, or this giant magic board game thing...\" he shrugged.  \"It's something to do between conquest attempts.  And honestly,\" he added with a vicious grin, \"its rather satisfying to beat them in fair combat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeach nodded.  \"Paranormal-level abilities would be suppressed, of course,\" she said.  \"To keep everything fair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No zipping around at the speed of sound for you if we take part,\" Tails said to Sonic, getting the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic snorted.  \"Don't know how happy I am about that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman stroked his mustache, looking thoughtful.  \"...I suppose.  I don't really have any new plans...  Not to sure about this 'playing fair' nonsense.  But I do like the idea of beating Sonic at something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMario turned to Sonic.  \"So how about it?\" he said.  \"I'm-a gonna go for it, Mr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" Sonic said.  After a moment's thought, he added, \"And yeah, it does sound fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm-a Mario,\" Mario said, shaking Sonic's head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRelucantly, everyone else agreed to it as well.  \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so it began.  Six teams were made.  Team Mushroom Kingdom.  Team Freedom Fighters.  Team Eggman Empire.  Team Koopa Troop.  Team Independent Nasties.  Team Civilian Heroes.  The latter two teams blended heroes and villains from both worlds.  The contests would last three months, with the winning team being granted wishes from a wishing star.  And to win?  Why, you simply had to have the most gold medals...</span></div></div>",

He didn't like the fact that his superspeed powers were suppressed to keep the contest fair, but he was still fast enough to get gold in most racing events.  Plus, Eggman tended to play fair, wanting to beat Sonic in fair combat.  And the events were always interesting too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn top of that, he just liked meeting new people.  Mario and his group of friends and enemies were an interesting bunch.  There had been some tensions at first, but everyone eventually settled into the routine of the Olympics.  Today, for example, Bowser Junior, Metal Sonic, Captain Toad, and Tundra were all competing in a swimming competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t(He was silently glad to be left out of that one.  He couldn't swim, and was the only one who had to walk on the bottom with a life vest and oxygen tank.  It was humiliating.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic wasn't scheduled to compete until two days from now.  Which meant he had time to sneak around and have some naughty fun.  The villainesses on both sides tended to mellow out during the games, and were a lot easier to talk to and flirt with.  Plus, Sonic was something of a ladies man.  Every married couple he knew was in an open relationship, and he had an almost complete success rate in dating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow the question was who to visit for some fun?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

I want to be digested in some pretty young lady's stomach and become fat for their boobs, belly, and have my remains flushed down the drain.  I am offering myself to every young woman on Mobius as food.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails wiggled his butt for the screen.  \"I'm delicious, I assure you.  And I'll wiggle in your stomach most pleasantly.  Don't worry about causing me pain, I'll take a drug that will dull my pain centers while strengthening my pleasure centers just before you eat me.\" He turned back around, and patted his tummy.  \"I mean, just look at me!  Who wouldn't want to have a plump, juicy fox like me for a meal?  And I'll be getting plumper and juicier by the time I choose a predator to gulp me down!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails grinned.  \"That's right, I'm choosing a predator.  If you want me to become your fat, to fuel your sexy body, send me a video and try to seduce me.  Show off your maw, talk about how good I'll look swelling out your tummy, how big I'll make your breasts and ass.  In fact, I may go in another hole, so show off your anus and your pussy as well.  Don't worry, I won't post any of your videos on the internet.  They're just for my personal enjoyment.\"  He pulled up an image on the side of the screen.  \"And if you're wondering if weight gain is all you'll get out of this, the winner will also be paid ten million rings from my bank account.  And yes, this is my legit bank account.  I've got a lot of patents out there right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails thought a moment and added, \"Ladies only, please.  Despite the oddly popular theory, I assure you I am heterosexual.\"  He looked mildly ill.  \"I mean, I view Sonic as my big brother, not my butt buddy.  Geez louise.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails shook his head, and went back to smirking.  \"As for those of you who are worried about murdering me, don't be,\" he said.  \"I'm using this as a way of testing the 'extra lives' system I've invented.\"  He moved the camera over to a glowing device with ten power rings in it.  \"If it works, after I'm completely digested, I'll respawn right there.  As proof, I'll ask the lucky predator to completely record my consumption and digestion and post it to my account, with my respawning being auto-recorded and posted as well.  If it doesn't... Then my predator and a few friends will inheret all of my money and possessions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails giggled.  \"It's win-win for me either way.  If I respawn, then my 'extra lives' system works and we get an advantage in the fight against Eggman.  If not, then I go out the way I want to.  In the belly of a hot young woman,\" he said.  \"So send in those vids, ladies.  I'm sure you're hungry.\"  </span></div></div>",

All the mechanics seem functional.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And there doesn't seem to be anything wrong on the mechanical end,\" Rotor said.  \"The memory recorder is functional, the lifesign monitor is functional, the DNA sample is stored safely...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You cannot possibly think this is sane!\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pft.

Clove the Pronghorn and her sister Cassia, the ninja lynx Conquering Storm, the pirate queen Abyss the Squid, the sleek Nephthys the Vulture, the maniacal loyalist Thunderbolt the Chinchilla, the wicked troll witch Wendy Naugus, the elegant technomage Regina Ferrum, and the evil cybernetic echidna Lien-Da.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe played Tails video for them.  \"I want all of you to submit videos to the fox's contest,\" he ordered.  \"Regina, Lien-Da, since you're contractors instead of slaves, I'll pay you the usual mission fee for this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For a plan this dumb?  You better,\" Lien-Da muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For the glory of Eggman!\" Thunderbolt declared, the others rolling their eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Are you sure this will even work, my lord?\" Nephthys said.  \"I don't mean to question you, but there is a huge element of chance involved in this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm aware,\" Eggman said.  \"I'm not happy about this at all, but for a chance to get access to this Extra Life tech Tails is developing... It's worth it.  If you're chosen, try to get him to take you to his lab and steal the technology.  Failing that, save a portion of the 'leftovers' after you digest him.\"  The women all went a little green around the gills.  \"Yes, yes, its gross, but some of it may be tied into his DNA.  If you're that squeamish, grab some of his fur.  Or seduce him and get semen.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if none of us are chosen?\" Nephthys persisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Consider yourselves lucky, as due to the high element of chance in this, you won't be punished for failure,\" Eggman said, sighing.  \"I refuse to let this opportunity pass us by. As for your chances... Well, Regina obviously is good looking, even though I hate her.  And from what little I understand or care about Mobian standards of beauty, I'm reasonably certain all save Wendy are decently attractive.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWendy chuckled.  \"Don't feel too offended, girls, when I outclass all of you,\" the witch said, cackling in her shrill voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Actually,\" Eggman said, \"I want you to have Carrotia make a video offer instead of you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss, Thunderbolt, Regina, and Lien-Da all snickered at the gobsmacked expression on Wendy's face.  \"B-But... But Eggy...\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"One, don't call me that,\" Eggman snapped.  \"Two, you're old, you're ugly, and you have a voice like nails on a chalkboard.  Have.  Carrotia.  Make the video.\"  <br>\r\n\tOffended, Wendy made a mistake.  \"Now listen here, you-\" she started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman hovered his hand over a bright red button, one of twelve.  All the Egg Bosses froze in fear, while Lien-Da and Regina watched with fascination.  Wendy, sweating visibly, gulped hard.  \"...I'm sorry, Lord Eggman,\" she said.  \"I'll get Carrotia started on the video right away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman smiled, moving his hand away from the button that would trigger the failsafe in Wendy's cybernetics, and sat back in his chair.  \"I'm glad we understand each other.  Now GET TO WORK.\"  He closed the connection, and sighed.  This was a dumb plan, and there was a chance that none of them would get picked.  But he had to TRY.  \"ORBOT!  CUBOT!  Get me a lemonade!  And cookies!  The good chocolate ones with the cream filling!\" he bellowed.</span></div></div>",

Where's Wendy?\" Eggman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Gone off to sulk because you insulted her looks,\" Abyss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman snorted.  \"She can get over it,\" he said.  \"Listen, I just thought of something - I'm going to send Phage to hack into Tails' computer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss had to fight the urge to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman continued.  \"She'll steal the files related to the Respawn and anything else that might be interesting.  I've upgraded her stealth capabilities recently, so she should be able to get through his defenses without being notice.  I want you lot to continue with the initial plan, though.  If we're lucky, he'll pick one of you and that will act as a distraction.  Again, no penalty for failure if you don't get picked,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if we do?\" Storm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Call in backup and steal the device itself while you're digesting him,\" Eggman said.  \"Again, it'll be a good distraction for the Freedom Fighters.  And who knows?  You might get lucky and actually kidnap him.\"  He chuckled.  \"I have to admit, that would be a unique way of doing it.  Anyway.  Get to work.  Make a video.  Think sexy.  You want him to think your stomach is the best.\"  He paused.  \"...That felt really weird to say.\"  He broke contact again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"See?\" Abyss said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThunderbolt snarled.  \"Enough mocking our lord!  We have been charged with seducing the fox into letting us eat him!  And I, for one, shall do my best to win his affections!\" she declared.  Then she paused, realizing what she just said.  \"For the plan.  Win his affection for the plan... SHADDUP!\" She quickly closed off the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Imbecile,\" Storm muttered, Abyss, Clove, and Nephthys chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Anyway,\" Abyss said.  \"Lord Eggonhisface being predictable aside, we should probably make those dumb videos.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If we must...\" Storm said.  \"My spies noticed that he tends to blush and stammer around Nicole, especially since she gained a more physical form... Perhaps if I play on the fact that we're the same species...\" She broke the connection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I cannot believe we're actually doing this.  Trying to seduce a young man into becoming our food,\" Nephthys muttered, breaking the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Eh, different kind of plunder,\" Abyss said.  \"How about you, Clove?  Any reservations?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Several,\" Clove said, sighing.  \"But considering that I don't dare betray him because he's the only one who can help my sister, I have little choice but to be as loyal as Thunderbolt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, I heard that was why you joined... Gotta be a doctor who knows how to treat her somewhere, right?\" Abyss said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Encouraging rebellion?\" Clove said, a little amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss shrugged.  \"I got a line on short-circuiting the failsafe.  At this point I'm only staying with Eggman because he's got the best toys and can lead me to the best plunder,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClove chuckled.  \"I wish you well on that,\" she said.  \"As for your idea...\"  She smiled sadly.  \"I went to Eggman because I had been to everyone else I could find first...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss cringed.  \"That's rough...  Y'know what?  I like you.  Send me data on Cassia's condition and I'll see if I came up with anything,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thank you,\" Clove said.  \"...We should probably delete the last part of this conversation from the records.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Heh, good point,\" Abyss said.  \"We also gotta get started on seducing a kid genius into our stomachs.\"  She frowned.  \"...Eggy's right, that is weird to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth women broke contact, deleting the records of the conversation from Nephthys leaving the call, and went to work.</span></div></div>",

It's controller, one Dr. Eggman, could be seen pressing every button he could in some attempt to turn the device back on. But it was simply no use as he and his contraption vanished beyond the horizon, leaving the small group of Sonic and his pals alone in the broken lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze brushed her coat, removing a few metal shavings from the cloth. \"Good riddance. Again. Honestly Sonic, does Eggman attack you so often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess turned to the blue hedgehog, who was streching as if he had gone through a mere workout rather than saving the day. \"Yeah, you get used to it. That Egghead just doesn't know when to give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stepped through the debris of the Dr's latest failure, though what that failure was could be debated. Tails, was standing over by a stack of large, open containers holding some kind of green gel. His tails twirled in curiosity as he held a scanner to a leaking barrel. \"I'm not sure he even knew what he was doing.\" The young fox said. \"Whatever this compound is, it doesn't seem to have any energized properties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had to admit, she was having trouble seeing what the doctor's plans were herself. She wasn't as scientifically inclined as Sonic's friend, but there were hardly any robots guarding the lab. In thought, Blaze turned back to Sonic. The self-proclaimed Blue Blur was talking to Amy, Rouge and Kunckles, patting them all on the back for a job well done. It was almost amusing, for all of his faults, Sonic truly was a hero. Selfless and certainly there for those he cared about. And look where that got him, loads of friends or at least rivals who respected him. All those years Blaze had spent alone and where did that get her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's ears flicked as a groaning scratch sounded. Blaze turned back to the poorly balanced barrels Tails was examining, the pile was starting to rip. Being closer to Tails, Blaze rushed towards the fox. Her desire to protect her friend sparked her powers as a flame formed around her. She pushed Tails to the side as the barrels began to topple. Her fear of her own damage increased the heat of her flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gel touched her flame, the red surrounding Blaze turned purple. Before Tails could pull himself up and say anything, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if she was weightless. Blaze found herself floating through a swirling vortex of pink and purple, falling and yet feeling like she was going nowhere. The time passed, Blaze could make out something coming at her. As the figure came closer, Blaze couldn't believe her eyes. It was difficult to see much of the details, but she was too certain that what she was seeing before her was herself. The being in front of her looked so much like her, her face, colors and everything. But this Blaze was wearing a far more regal outfit, purple lipstick adorning her lips and was glaring at her with a cold look. Not the kind of cold that comes from pushing away people, but the kind of cold that came from a dark heart. The two Blaze's floated beside one another for a minute, neither knowing what to say to the other before both were pulled past each other. Blaze watched as the figure vanished, wondering just what she had gotten herself into.</span></div></div>",

Of course, she was not literally his biggest fan, but as the oxymoron suggests she was the most obsessed one. Amy had constant daydreams and the kind you get sleeping at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout her and her beloved hero getting married. However, the pink fanatic had one problem that was delaying that dream goal of hers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every day, Amy would find herself in the same tiring routine, where the young girl would chase after her hero everywhere; and Sonic would either flee or make up some excuse to leave. Nothing was changing. History was sort of a song on repeat. But despite these setbacks, Amy refused to give up as the pink wonder was determined to make her hero entirely hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today, she may have found that solution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile out doing some shopping for her place, Amy unexpectedly came across her hero outside of the store, where he was reading a magazine in his hands. The pink hedgehog almost unleashed a cheerful squeal before covering her mouth; not wanting to blow this opportunity. However, just before she could make her move, Sonic in a second boosted off! Creating an enormous gust of wind that almost blew Amy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wind cleared, Amy unfettered a defeated sigh before suddenly getting her face smacked by the magazine Sonic was reading earlier. Peeling the book of her face, Amy, out of curiosity wondered what Sonic was even reading or looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the pages, it looked like any other leisure magazine, until Amy came across an interesting double-page, where the young girl\u2019s eyes were soon met with something she had never considered. Just the mere sight of it almost made her eyes jump out from their sockets from what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic... likes them big?\u201d Amy murmured in surprise, the two pages in front of her showing exceedingly large women all dressed in skimpy clothes and alluring lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching her flat stomach, Amy\u2019s dumbfounded expression into a confident smirk. \u201cWell then, if he wants the fattest around...\u201d Closing the magazine in her hands and stuffing it into her shopping bag. \u201cThen I got some work to do...\u201d </div></span></div></div>",

You're Wilde the Wolf, and you were a hero.  You started out as a nervous rookie, fighting in the Resistance alongside real heroes such as Amy Rose and Knuckles the Echidna.  You didn't have special powers, but you did have a Burst Wispon, and a partner Wisp you named Flare.  You didn't understand the language the Wisp spoke, but Flare seemed to like the name it was given.  As tiem went on, you gained more confidence, and more Wispon weapons, using a miniaturization holster around your chest designed by Tails to hold them all.  You also had a grappler which allowed you to swing around for mobility.  It took building up some arm strength for it not to hurt while swinging, but by the end of things, you were a confident, brave hero which couldn't be stopped.  Infinite fell to you, and while you needed the help of two Sonics to do it, you beat one of Eggman's most dangerous robots, earning the respect of the entire Resistance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow, you worked alongside the Restoration to clear out the last remaining bits of Eggman's Empire, fighting against Egg Bosses and robots to reclaim Eggman's territory. </span></div></div>",

As his vision cleared, he noticed his fellow Freedom Fighters all around him.  Sally, Antoine, Bunnie, Nicole, Rotor, Tails, and Amy were all picking themselves up.  Nicole chuckled weakly.  \"I picked a terrible time to test my prototype new body,\" she said, the lynx hugging Sally.  To Sonic's surprise, Shadow and Rouge were there as well, along with Vector and Espio of the Chaotix, Knuckles, Tangle, and Whisper.  Antoine's sword was missing, as was Amy's hammer.  Whisper had been stripped of her Wispon multi-tool and mask, and was looking around frantically for them, Tangle doing her best to comfort her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Everyone okay?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No, Sonic,\" Shadow said irritably.  \"We've all been kidnapped, probably by Dr. Eggman.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's the last thing everyone remembers?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A bright red flash...\" Knuckles said, frowning.  \"You don't suppose it could be Infinite again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're half-right,\" said a voice, Sonic groaning in frustration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh no...\" Sonic said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice to see you too,\" Breezie said, her silhouetted form coming on the only viewscreen in the room.  Everyone in the room glared up at their captor, the green hedgehog also the ruler of Casinopolis and the greatest media power in all of Mobius.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What do you want, Breezie?\" Sally demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want you to participate in my new show,\" Breezie said, only her eyes visible in the shadows that filled her office.  \"But considering WHAT my new show is, I figured you'd need... persuasion.  So I tracked down Infinite and extracted the power of the Phantom Ruby from him.  Its all at MY command now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, that's not good,\" Bunnie understanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No kidding,\" Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If you're worried about your stuff, don't worry,\" Breezie said.  \"You'll get it back for the show.  I just wanted to make sure you were all aware of WHO IS IN CHARGE.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For now,\" Shadow growled.  Breezie just chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So, what, are we competing against each other?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sometimes,\" Breezie said.  \"Mostly, you'll be competing against your co-stars.\"  She gestured to a wall, which retracted to reveal a glass panel.  Everyone's heart sank as they saw who was on the other side of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman's Egg Bosses.  The elegant Clove and her sister Cassia.  The vicious Akhlut.  The graceful Nephthys.  The cunning Lord Hood.  The pirate queen Abyss.  The brutal Tundra.  The deadly Conquering Storm.  Ruler of the roads Axel.  The mad Eggman-loyalist Thunderbolt.  The mysterious Maw.  The mighty kukku Battlelord.  And the troll witch Wendy Naugus.  In addition, Eggman's newly recruited assistant, Dr. Starline, and the technomage Regina Ferrum and sometimes Eggman ally were there as well.  They were glaring at the Freedom Fighters in a mix of curiosity and fury.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You should have seen Eggman's face when I defeated and captured all of his minions at once,\" Breezie said, grinning at the memory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, this is gonna be fun,\" Knuckles said, smirking.  \"Always wanted to bust up all of these guys at once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, it's not gonna be like that,\" Breezie said.  \"You see, the show's format is...\" </span></div></div>",

The green furred young woman tightly clutched her staff, the metal toes of her hoof-like boots clicking lightly on the ground.  Her name was Clove, and she was a cyborg, an Egg Boss of the Eggman Empire.  She only reluctantly served her lord, as her sister Cassia had a health condition that only Eggman could keep at bay.  But as Eggman was a scientist rather than a physician, he could ONLY keep it at bay and not cure it.  She kept this fact from Cassia, not wanting to steal her sister's hope.  She, like all Egg Bosses, wore a variant of Eggman's clothing, her pants black and her coat gray with white highlights and gold, square-shaped buttons.  Her boots had gold trim, lining the shape of her hooved feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe walked through the abandoned mine shaft, ready to trigger her staff's energy scythe at a moment's notice.  Around her, four Motobug badniks and two Egg Pawns, their glowing eyes acting as flashlights, acted as her bodyguards, the Egg Pawns carrying energy rifles.  Things had been going wrong at the mine shaft, hindering the investigation into a possible well of magical Golden Rings.  Equipment failures, up to and including explosions, were happening at random with no known cause.  Knowing that Eggman would get grumpy and possibly punish her if a potential source of power was lost, she decided to lead an investigation into the mine, having the Motobugs record everything and broadcast it back to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer younger sister, Cassia, didn't want her to go alone.  But Clove had refused to risk any of her troops, and had gone in with only Badniks for backup.  She would do whatever it took to protect her sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Scan for any anomolies.  Report immediately if mechanical failure starts to occur,\" Clove ordered.  The robots all confirmed the order as they moved deeper and deeper into the facility.  Clove didn't like how quiet things were.  It made her nervous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEventually, they came to a blockade, stones collapsed along the path.  She frowned, and ordered the Egg Pawns to stand back.  She began to examine the fallen rocks, trusting in her cybernetically enhanced speed and agility to get her out of danger should something go wrong.  As she examined the rocks, she noticed something.  A strange light pulsing at the back of a tiny hole.  She peered in close, trying to get a better look at it.  \"It looks almost like Dark Ga-\" she stopped when she recognized what she was about to say.  She realized her mistake moments too late, and was about to call in one of the Egg Pawns to look at it in her place, when a burst of purple smoke shot out.  Before she could stop herself, she inhaled it, coughing and wheezing.  She clutched at her throat, desperately gasping for breath, coughing up blood as her vision went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she woke up, her uniform was in tatters.  The robots and the Mobini powering them were all ripped to shreds, and Clove could taste blood in her mouth.  Frightened, she found her staff and used the energy scythe's light to guide her out of the cave as fast as possible.  She had to get back to base.  She needed to figure out what happened, why her clothes and her robotic minions were destroyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe told herself over and over again that the Mobini didn't have bite marks in them.  That the blood in her mouth was her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe almost believed it.</span></div></div>",

Oh.  That thing,\" he said.  Nearby, the cybernetic echidna warlord, Lien-Da snickered.  Eggman sighed.  \"That is a repository of all my... sillier ideas.  I kept them to remind myself not to make them again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Sillier than Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts?\" Dr. Starline asked, clearly baffled by the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Still can't believe Breezie was able to find use for those losers...\" Eggman muttered.  \"Anyway.  They're reasonably effective weapons, but what they do is just so ridiculous... I couldn't bring myself to actually use them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Conisdering your aversion to simple pragmatism, I'm surprised you didn't,\" Dr. Starline said, Lien-Da taking a very large step away from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman snorted.  \"You're lucky you're damn useful...\" he muttered.  \"The reason I didn't use them is that doing so would humiliate me as much as it would Sonic and his friends.  If you want to play with the stupid things, be my guest.  Passcode is H4t3th4th3dg3h0g.  I'm going to see if I can give Orbot and Cubot combat capability.  Getting tired of them not doing much around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that, Eggman stomped off, the Silly Vault opening up.  Lien-Da walked up to Starline, impressed.  \"He didn't vaporize you for backsassing him.  That's new...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Unlike you and your mercenary 'Dark Legion,'\" Dr. Starline said, ignoring the glare Lien-Da gave him, \"I prove my worth to our dear delightful lunatic every day.\"  He entered the passcode, the vault door opening and revealing several blasters that, indeed, looked quite silly.  Lien-Da, curious, looked in the vault as well... and stared right alongside Dr. Starline, struggling to process what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Are we looking at Dr. Eggman's fetishes right now?\" Lien-Da asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No, the Doctor is completely asexual,\" Dr. Starline said.  When Lien-Da gave him an inquiring look, he said, \"One of his lower minions attempted to sexually accoust Vanilla the Rabbit when we held her prisoner one time.  Eggman yelled at him, claiming that 'sex is disgusting, and if you want to act like an animal, don't do it in my base.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And then he killed him,\" Lien-Da surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And then he killed him,\" Dr. Starline confirmed, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, at least I never have to worry about getting raped by the big fat bastard...\" Lien-Da muttered as she and Dr. Starline walked into the vault, looking over the various weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Rape, I think, is the least of your worries when dealing with Dr. Eggman...\" Dr. Starline muttered.  \"...Oh dear.  I can see why this one would be bothersome to the Doctor's dignity.\"  He paused in front of a device filled with a yellow liquid.  It resembled a dart gun with rapid fire syringe projectiles that were filled with the foul-looking yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da leaned in, reading the label underneath the gun.  \"The Fattener.  Any Mobian struck with these dart projectiles will become impossibly, incredibly fat and gain a tremendous appetite, wanting to do little more than eat and sleep and attempt to fuck.  The effects of the formula also spread, turning other Mobians into gluttons, their bodies processing everything they eat into fat, leaving no bodily waste,\" she read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline frowned.  \"Actually, that sounds rather effective,\" he said.  \"Why not use it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What would you do with the affected afterwards?\" Lien-Da asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline thought a moment, and shrugged.  \"Hmm, point taken...\" he said.  Although he began to think of ways to impliment it effectively... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two moved on, coming across a gun covered in glitter, looking like a disco ball with a gun stock attached to it.  \"...The Bimboizer,\" Dr. Starline read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh hell the fuck no,\" Lien-Da said, scowling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline smirked, reading the text underneath the weapon.  \"Affects both male and female Mobians, turning males into females before the primary effects occur.  Any female affected by this gun's rays will become large breasted and curvaceous bodies, as well as decreased intelligence and a greatly increased sex drive.\"  He turned towards Lien-Da, eyebrow quirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da glared back.  \"Say it and you die,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline snickered and moved on.  The two of them walked through the lab, looking through the various odd experiments, until another caught Dr. Starline and Lien-Da's attention.  \"The Transformicron - A device that can transform any living Mobian back and forth from an inanimate object,\" Lien-Da read.  \"Wait, this could actually be a powerful weapon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Read on,\" Dr. Starline said.  \"'Discarded because the only thing it turned people into was female-shaped sex toys.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da huffed.  \"Well, that sucks,\" she said, walking off.  Dr. Starline just looked over the device thoughtfully, ideas formulating in his head...</span></div></div>",

He found where the barrel was through careful examination, the barrel popping out and the gun activating, making a glittery noise.  \"Very intersting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da paused.  There was an unravelling sound, Dr. Starline glancing over and seeing that Lien-Da had unfurled her whip.  \"...You'd better not be doing what is it I think you're doing,\" she said in a low, dangerous tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline grinned wickedly.  \"And what is it you think I'm doing?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think you're playing with one of the doctor's dangerous toys,\" Lien-Da said.  Her muscles were tensing, the red-furred echidna ready to move.  \"I think you're about to make a mistake you're going to regret for a long time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline's grin widened.  \"No...  No, I don't think that's what's happening.  All I'm doing is conducting a little scientific experiment,\" he said, taking aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I DON'T THINK SO!\" Lien-Da said, lashing out with her electrified whip.  Dr. Starline, anticipating this, teleported out of the way, dropping through a portal and reappearing in front of her.  But Lien-Da moved surprisingly fast, lashing out with a kick that forced Dr. Starline to teleport again.  Dr. Starline reappeared far away, firing, but Lien-Da dodged out of the way, lashing her whip towards him again, sending a blade of electricity towards him.  He portaled out of the way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You won't get in the way of SCIENCE!\" Dr. Starline said, laughing wickedly.  His hand was aching from using the Warp Topaz over and over so quickly, but he wasn't about to lose this fight.  Especially since Lien-Da was likely to use the weapon against him should he fail.  </span></div></div>",

The orange-furred bobcat sneered as he surfed the web, gauging the importance of a series by how much porn it had.  And so far, in his poor judgement, he had decided that the Sonic franchise was the most popular in the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't get it,\" he muttered.  \"People complain about their games, especially the myuwer ones, all the time!  And yet they're just so damn popular!\"  He huffed, glaring at Sonic.  \"I'm cool!  I have cattitude!  Heck, I sling puns all the time!  I got two puns in that rant I said just nyow!\"  He shook his head.  \"I friggin' hate that hedgehog.  How could he pawsibly be more stylish than me?  Hedgehogs don't run fast!
