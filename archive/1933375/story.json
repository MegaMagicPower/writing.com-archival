I.e., a catgirl, of the 'basically human, but with cat ears and a tail\" persuasion. But Vix is no wimpy tuna-sucking bell jockey; she's a tough as nails wildcat who'd just as soon scratch your eyes out as give you the time of day. With her flame-red hair and cute (but sharp!) fangs, she's not gonna take no dung from anyone! Vix is used to living on the land and hunting for her supper; she looooves fresh-caught meat, and lives by the adage \"eat what you can, as much as you can, while the eatin' is good.\" But if the eatin' gets good and stays good, what fate does the future hold for our hairy heroine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Aurora Glacierfist: A frost giant valkyrie, nine feet tall and a muscular as a Clydesdale, blue flesh slick with ice and rime.   As most valkyries do, she takes life seriously and gives her all no matter what she does, be it a war or a drinking contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Flinzi Flotberkle: Manic goblin dreamgirl and out-there engineer/biochemist/all-around mad scientist.  Only three feet high, she nevertheless cuts an unmistake figure with her grease-smeared overalls, her enormous goggles with the cotton-candy-pink lenses, and her garishly rainbow-colored hair, currently sticking out in all directions in about a bazillion braids and ponytails.   Like all goblins, she has light-green skin, pointy ears, a large and slightly upturned nose, and a prehensile tail (in her case, usually holding a wrench or a test tube).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Cap'n Vashine Hookrust: She be a roight fine pirate wench, arr--and all the finer fer bein' a true denizen o' Davy Jones' locker.   Fer this mariner be a mermaid as well, with scaly skin as blue an white as the swordfish whose weapon she shares, hair as black as the inky depth o' the abyssal zone, and great white eyes like the devil's whirlpools themselves, they are!   Sultry as a siren, stinging like a jellyfish, and drinking like a gulper eel, Vashine is one scurvy sea-witch who's out fer grog an' treasure, and woe to any air-lubber who gets in her way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore on the way.  (Have a suggestion?  Let me know!)</span></div></div>",

A good four hundred pounds of pork on the hoof--enough to sate even the appetite of a catgirl who hadn't had a decent meal in a week. Prey had been scarce out in the scrublands: a scrawny rabbit here, a few roots and berries there. She'd grown whip-thin and wiry, not exactly the state you wanted to be in when winter winds were only weeks away. That's why she'd chosen to brave the thick, lush forests of \"civilization\", where rich, fat lords and ladies released hordes of animals so they could enjoy hunting them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young amazon nocked an arrow. Hunting for fun--ridiculous. You hunted to eat. You hunted to live. It wasn't fun... but the eating, sinking your teeth into warm meat and lovely squashy viscera, guzzling down hot blood, that was fun. That was heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked away visions of steaming, succulent golden-brown pork. That pig wasn't in the bag yet.</span></div></div>",

Said woman had short black hair, a pancake-shaped face, and clear brown eyes that glared fiercely at the cat-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good poacher! Just...wheeze...um...stay there until I can get these chains on you and we can drag you off for a nice long stay in the dungeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVix's ears twitched and her tail stopped lazily flopping about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious, tubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deadly, you little twig poacher! Now stay there until I arrest you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of speed, Vix left the guard huffing and puffing, her round face turning red with rage. Vix took a few moments to further study her newest foe. Looking below the woman's neck, which was partially obscured by a few chins, the cat girl saw a pair of massive breasts, sagging heavily onto a mighty apron of a middle. The woman's thighs weren't touching, which was quite the marvel considering her size, but her rear was truly incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded Vix of an oliphant's butt she'd carved into once, the thought of how tasty that meal had been causing her stomach to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her gaze away from her portly enemy, the huntress turned her attention back to finding a good meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Stop*...Gasp*...you...little...*Wheeze*...T-thief...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an embarrassingly short time the obese guard, a former mercenary by the name of Mara Redflight, crashed to a halt, gasping desperately for air as her flabby body quivered with every breath. Wincing as the unforgiving metal squeezing her soft rolls, Mara's face burned with humiliation as well as effort. When Mara had taken this job, the gift of a grateful patron, the lithe warrior had laughed at the comically over-sized suit of armor her predecessor had left behind, thinking it a strange piece of ornamental gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the armor was no joke. The warden job was without the slightest bit of hard work; no one would dare poach in the Royal Forest, a place known to be filled with enchantments. Mara had no supervision or visitors, and her duties included little more than an occasional walk though the woods.  Add to that an endless supply of rich, fatty meat and a generous stipend of luxuries leftover from the royal larder, and Mara had outgrown her own armor in a month. Then the cycle had begun; Mara would outgrown her clothes, vow to change, get a week into her diet and quickly start gorging herself out of boredom again, only to split the seams of a new pair of pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor had seemed a mental refuge; no matter what, Mara would assure herself as she strained to cover her wobbling gut or felt her massive rear quiver with every step, she wasn't that fat, not bigger than the armor. Then the unthinkable had happened; one of the forest's wards had alerted her to an intruder! Mara had no choice but to don the only gear she knew could fit her, and was almost brought to tears as straps loosened as far as possible still dug cruelly into soft flesh. She was fatter than the largest suit of armor she had ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to...do something...about this...\" The porky guard mumbled, not for the first time, finally catching her breath. She waddled off into the woods, at a much slower pace. But first, she had to catch that damned cat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Urrrp!* Vix patted a stomach grossly distended with delicious meat torn from the enormous dead pig at her side. Her belly was round enough to hold a litter of kits; the catgirl had never eaten this well - the dumb thing had barely tried to run away! This place was great - game everywhere and only one fat human to bother her. Vix stuffed another hunk of meat into her overstuffed belly greedily. This was predator heaven!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cat-ears perked up as a familiar sound reached her; puffing and the squeak of metal. Vix grinned; she was sure she could take the dumb, soft human, but shy bother? She could out-run her any day, and humans reacted badly to their own kind dying - she might have friends. Besides - Vix's ascent into the trees was a tad slower, but still quick - it would be much more fun to annoy this charging porker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara lumbered into the clearing moments later, seeing only the massive carcass of a prized golden boar. She winced; the king loved golden boar meat, and despite the forest's magic the huge pigs bred slowly. She removed butchering tools from her backpack; no sense wasting it. She could send the remaining meat via magical courier to the king's kitchen - part of her duties was to provide the castle with certain kinds of meat in between hunts. At her current... girth, Mara mused, it was lucky that hunting in the magical forest was the easiest of tasks....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, Vix had dragged several of the fattest, stupidest rabbit she had ever seen up into a tree and was now lazily picking at the bones. Even stuffed full, the prospect of such easy food had been too much for the huntress to bear, and now her gut towered over her semi-conscious form like a mountain of greed. Her eyes slowly flickered closed. What new delights would tomorrow bring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe how much of this she ate!\" Mara muttered to herself, performing the grisly task with automatic skill. \"She must have eaten twenty pounds of meat at once! I couldn't eat the much...\" Her own massive gut grumbled audibly, and Mara flushed, remembering just how much she had eaten last time the king had called for pork. Her gut arced far before her, only held off her thighs by her straining breastplate. It was round enough to interfere with the simple task of dressing a animal, and the bloated guard was growing more and more despondent. Why when she got here, she wouldn't have eaten a tenth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara froze, her eyes wide. Slowly, a wide smile spread across her round face. The king's forest had many spells upon it. They kept the animals in the trees, growing to massive size - and docile as lambs. The would ignore a human until the very last minute and all were of record size. Nobles rarely wanted a arduous hunt, they wanted trophies, and the spells could be altered for the real sportsmen. In addition - Mara's smile seemingly stretched ear to ear - due to their placidity, most of their bulk was fat rather than lean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara began to chuckle. Catgirls were infamous for their wildness, their agility - and their complete lack of restraint. In a place like this... Mara's chuckles became full-throated laughter. There would not be a royal hunting party for months - and one catgirl, however ravenous, could not deplete the entire vast forest. Even if a hunt did arrive, the catgirl would hide. And sooner or later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara finished butchering, then loaded the meat into a magical bag of holding enchanted to preserve meat. She promised her growing hunger pangs she could have a little - a very little. Mara was determined to make this embarrassingly tight suit of armor a joke again. Besides - her grin seemed fixed in place now -  Mara just knew someone else would be too big to fit it, very soon.</span></div></div>",

One starving catgirl could take on a knight, a well fed one could take on three, a fat one could take on a battalion and a obese one could take on a army.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara started to sweat as she read the book she bought. \u201cBiology of monsters\u201d was at a discount, so she bought it as in these months the catgirl has been more elusive than before.

Even as full as it was her belly growled for more and Vix was happy to oblig-*thud!* Vix moved her head, an arrow hitting the wood as she turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped to her left as another arrow was shot at her. Before her were a group of human on horses grinning evilly at her as some notched their arrows.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara grinned as she drank from a water skin. She decided to tell the king about the catgirl, fully expecting to be sent to the dungeons. Instead the king was overjoyed as he and the other lords wanted a challenge today and the royal wizard was on vacation so he wasn't able to modify the spells of the forest. He was gracious enough to pension her with a good amount of gold too so she was able to resign her position. \u201cI won't have to deal with that annoying catgirl anymore\u201d she says happily between pants as she exercised, her task of getting had only begun and there's nothing that would stop her. \u201cIt's a great day to be alive\u201d she says before continuing her running.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2019Not a good day! Not a good day!\u2019 Vix screamed in her mind as she jumped from tree to tree, arrows whistling all around her and dogs following her scent with their owners following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!* Vix dodged three arrows meant for her torso as she continued jumping around, asking herself how many arrow they have left as the amount thrown was ridiculous. Sweat fell over her face, she knew she couldn't do this forever and sooner or later she would fall...</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes, the woman had regained consciousness and gazed at the hulking cyan she-titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 thank you, miss\u2026\u201d The lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAurora Glacierfist. What\u2019s your name?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya\u2026 Belle.\u201d The human answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya unveiled her tan tattered hood, revealing pitch-black irises, a clear cream-colored face, short scarlet locks, a small round nose, and full pink lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Maya Belle, how did you end up here? Humans can\u2019t survive out in the tundra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead turned her head to the frozen ground, eye swelling with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad story.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Two hours earlier*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty oxen coated in thick brown fur were pulling a large wooden cart across the savage white wasteland. The coachman was pale-skinned with a pointed sniffer and tired green eyes and sporting a silver coat of wool. In the cart was a hostage trapped in a cage. She was another victim of an illegal trafficking deal, this one involving the cargo to be transferred from a secluded forest town to a village in the vast green marsh lands down south. The woman constantly banged at her cage, praying for a way to escape and make her kidnapper suffer for what he did. Alas, that seemed like a fantasy doomed to go unrealized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock it off! There\u2019s no way you\u2019re keeping me from getting paid.\u201d The coachman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard. How do you sleep at night knowing that none of the women who go the marsh lands live past two weeks?\u201d Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sleep pretty fine, given the piles of money that this job gets me for every bitch like you that makes the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope began fading from the woman. She\u2019d been at it for hours and she got for her efforts was a bruised arm. It\u2019s over, she was screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she would\u2019ve been had fortune not decided to smile upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather worsened throughout the journey. The once gentle snowfall had evolved into a hellish blizzard. The winds blew like a hurricane in the face of the coachman, his hood doing little to provide protection. Overtime, his field of vision had reduced from a few miles to several feet, barely able to see past his oxen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn snowstorm\u2026 Why\u2019d I have to travel trough this place to get to my destination?\u201d He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to gain speed by whipping the oxen\u2019s backs, but that soon backfired. Already losing control over the cart due to a lack of visibility, that sudden boost in velocity was the final in the coffin. The increased acceleration itself was the main problem, rather it was that it occurred right as he was approaching a jagged rock. It was two feet tall and three feet long so combined with the rider\u2019s near-blindness a collision was almost inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right side of the cart was elevated into the air as its wheel was knocked off. Now having fully lost control, the coachman was at the mercy of the oxen\u2019s stampede. Both occupants were shaking and bouncing as the cart quickly fell apart. Maya\u2019s cage was cracked open by the force of the impact to the ground and she rolled around for a bit before stopping. It took a couple seconds for her to gain her bearings, after which she studied the chaos of the situation around her. The oxen were long gone, probably forgetting all about the coachman who steered them. As for the man himself, he suffered the grim fate of having his heart impaled by a large icy stalagmite, blood slowly oozing out of the wound. Even Maya took a moment to wince at the fate of the poor bastard before deciding to head back east to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Now*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora had a few tears streaming down her face after having heard tale of her guest. Having little to no prior interaction with humans, she initially presumed them to just be some soft creatures that preferred to avoid danger. A cowardly life, she thought, but an understandable one given their inferior physical prowess. However, with the story of this poor woman sinking into her mind, she could tell that they were capable of great evil, which disgusted her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy were you taken.\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess the person who wanted me thought I was pretty.\u201d Maya responded with an orange blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unwarranted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya\u2019s blush deepened which led to the frost giant to give a hearty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m joking, Maya. But I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just require a place to stay for the night, then I\u2019ll make my way back home in the morning.\u201d Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy go back? Those people didn\u2019t care for you or else you wouldn\u2019t have been stolen.\u201d Aurora questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all humans are like him. We\u2019re a mostly kind race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d The valkyrie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked at the dinner that Aurora made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I have some?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. There\u2019s enough for two.\u201d Aurora answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya dug into her meal with a vigor that would\u2019ve betrayed her weakened state. She sucked on the tender meat of the rabbit, savoring the taste in case it happened to be her last. She cared not how hot it was, only that her appetite could be at least momentarily sated. Aurora was both surprised and impressed by the ferocity of the human, thinking that only another frost giant was capable of glutting like that. In a couple of minutes, the carcass had been reduced to an ivory skeleton and the one responsible for it was slowly rubbing her slightly extended stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026<u><i><b>~*BBURRRRPP*~</b></i></u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short silence was broken by a large chunky belch erupting from the small lady. She covered her mouth and blushed even deeper. Aurora's jaw dropped at the sight of it... then she bursted out in a giggle fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, nice one, Maya. I didn't expect a human to belch with the force of a frost giant!\" She complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you?\" Maya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the light-hearted moment was interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

The chest did not bob for a second longer on the skin of the ocean\u2019s surface than it had to, for Captain Hookrust was soon wrestling it open once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was deceptively light for such a large box, one so ornately carved and decorated. She noticed, barely, these engravings across its distressed wooden surface as she attempted to pry it open once more. It danced easily on the line between ocean and air, bouncing up and down excitedly at every salty wave that came its way. It was hardly as poetic for Vashine, who only felt the erratic movements of her prize to be a hindrance in its acquisition. As she cussed and spat at the chest, she could slowly feel the decrepit hinges give way once more to her forcefulness. In due time, which was far too long for Vashina\u2019s pleasure, whatever was in this box would belong to <i>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the box. On the surface it appeared to be little more than that, albeit somewhat elaborate and ornate in design. Chiefly, at least in the sense of its d\u00e9cor, was the undeniable affinity for the aquatic. Etched into the wooden surface of the box, running down the sides in remarkable symmetry, was a race between fish. Big and small, svelte and bulky, all manner of fish seemed to be in some sort of competition with one another. In the golden afternoon sun aflame with pink and orange, even considering the age of the box itself, it was not difficult to see the ferocity with which each scaly competitor swam with. Curiously they all seemed to be bee-lining towards the central lock, two sword fish dueling across the top of the lock. What in Davy Jones\u2019 Locker were they all fighting over\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all lost on Vashine, though. If anything this was just another chest; potentially another storage unit for all things plundered from the dreaded Air Suckers. With greedy white eyes she peered into the cavernous chest, now open and ready for looting as she tilted it towards her and the ocean. Inside she saw nothing (\u201cArg! No wonder the blasted thing was so light!\u201d), at least not right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the box was a small, carved totem of some sort. It had\u2026 things on it. Scales. Were those supposed to be scales? One large circle towards the tip of the totem, a smaller circle inside\u2026 Eyes. Those were clearly meant to be eyes, Vashina thought to herself as she reached for her embarrassingly lacking swag. The tail end of this\u2026 this <i>thing</i> looked to be split. With two wooden sections spreading out in a fashion not dissimilar to her own tail, and a metal hook drawn through the center\u2026 oh\u2026 OH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fishin\u2019 lure?\u201d she growled to herself as she plucked it from the box, fingering it with clawed fingernails. She found that it was attached to something faint and light, whatever it was brushed against her smooth blue upperarm. Probably line, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snarled at the contraption, having never really cared for the \u201cingenuity\u201d of the \u201ccivilized\u201d folk on land. Sure, she ate fish too, but at least she had the fortitude to go out and catch them herself. Those Menfolk on land, Breathers she called \u2018em sometimes no matter the Race, thought they were so clever. Fashioning something like this out of wood and preying on the less intelligent residents of the Great Big Blue. Though Vashina had never seen one carved quite this intricately, she certainly wasn\u2019t impressed. No, not her. Not at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine was not one for Romantic sentiments. There was no finding beauty in everyday occurrences, no elegance in the mundane. Yet as she raised her arm to toss the infernal symbol of Landlubbing into the inky abyss, the mermaid found herself unable to do the deed. Something about this\u2026 thing, that she had found. This lure, it was\u2026 pretty. She liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping off some of the line it was attached to, Captain Rusthook fashioned herself a necklace out of the tiny string. Looking around before diving, an assurance that one of her girls hadn\u2019t seen her, Vashine soon swam back to the depths of the ocean to rejoin her crew\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher new necklace, and all the strangeness surrounding it, in tow.</span></div></div>",

For one thing, there were no doors; every passage of use to the Breathers had been gleefully boarded up.  Her crew slipped easily in and out the portholes, laden with treasures and useful bits of scrap.   For another thing, it had the useful property of being able to rise and sink at will.  Originally, it had been a ghost ship, crewed by the legendary ghost pirate Old Crook-Bones, but a phalanx of silver-tipped swords and one kidnapped human priest had allowed her crew to take the ship and send the ghost crew on a return trip to Davy Jones' Locker.   It was a fine ship, and perfect for her purposes, though she didn't fancy the eldritch green fires which burned around the sails--far too visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sank, she passed through a small school of sea bass.   She was used to such school scattering as a matter of course, and was suprised when they didn't--in fact, she smacked face-first into one.  Even with a mermaid's gleaming fangs inches away, the bass simply bobbed serenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"   Vashine grunted.  \"What's wrong with these wretched little morsels?\"  For usually, when a fish failed to flee, it was a good sign that it was sick.   She opened her mouth and gulped in some water, \"smelling\" it as it ran over her girls.  She had very good sniffers, and the fish seemed fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around.  The other sea bass were watching her dully.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine shrugged.  <i>Never look a gift seahorse in the mouth, I s'pose</i>.   She plucked the bass and slurped it down.  It gave a couple of half-hearted thrashes, but otherwise barely struggled as it slid down her throat and into her belly.  She smacked her lips and seized another fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffing yer gob while yer little band o' trollops does all the work, eh?\" gurgled an unpleasant voice which sounded as if it had spent a century soaking in rum.  Vashine glanced behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their best efforts, they hadn't quite been able to banish Old Crook-Bones himself.  The skeletal old tyrant was too much a part of the ship.   So--they made him part of the ship.   Upon taking the <i>Trilobite</i>, Vashine's crew had knocked off the busty wooden mermaid figurehead and lashed Bones up in her place on the prow.   The curse ropes had held him there for years, until he was almost a part of the crew again, albeit one they didn't dare untie.  He was crass, violent, foul-mouthed, and cared for nobody but himself, so he fit right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just jealous ya can't--gulp--eat nothin' no more,\" Vashine growled good-naturally, downing another bass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't eaten in three hunnert years, an' it wouldn't be raw fish I'd be startin' on,\" Bones said.  \"It'd be juicy ribeye an' fresh crisp vegetables, warshed down with a nice bit o' brandy...it's tired I am of the taste of seawater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine grinned, displaying an armory of teeth, and reduced the ocean's bass population by one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That don't mean I want you eatin' in front of me, you scaly bint!\" Bones roared, sending a cloud of bubbles rushing for the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?   Feelin' a little peckish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all those centuries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be... must be...hard,\" Vashine panted.   She curled around lazily, patting her stomach, which was by now quite full of bass, and plucked another from the sea like a ripe apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Specially when someone else is enjoyin' the sea's bountry right in front of ya, like.\"  Vashine waved the last one under Bones' lack of nose.   \"Blood an' bilgewater, but I'm stuffed.  Dunno if I can rightly finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'pose I had a little room left, a' that.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbled curses echoing in her ears, she allowed herself to sink past the prow and slip though a porthole.  Her slick white belly was so distended with fish that it brushed the metal sill as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mebbe I shouldn'ta et so much just ta spite 'im</i>, she pondered.  <i>Nahh.  I'd do it again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to see how the loading was going.  \"Layna!\" she bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first mate appeared in the doorway.  \"Yes, Captain Hookrust?\" she said meekly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the haul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've appraised it at over five hundred bootysworth, Captain,\" Layna replied.   \"Any other orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' for more work?\" Vashine laughed.  \"Careful, or you'll end up swabbin' out the poop deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, Captain,\" the mousy minnowmaid replied, and began to swim off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, now!  Just a wee joke.  What's gotten inta you all of a sudden?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Captain Hookrust was a notoriously hard (mer)woman to please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a tight shift on board, expecting everyone to do everything they were asked when it was asked of them. Most of the time she was considered fair, if not a little cruel. There was a reason <i>she</i> wore the big hat on board and not any of the other watery wenches that swam in and out of the portholes around here. Insurrection, no matter how small, would not be tolerated. It was a slippery slope, Vashine admitted this if nothing else, and that a thin line was present between asserting one\u2019s authority and senseless tyranny. Most of the time she stayed wise to her boundaries, well aware that if she pushed her crew too far they might push right back and mutiny. She was a tough old salt, but didn\u2019t dare think herself tough enough to fight off her own crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all being said, while no one ever forgot who was Captain on deck many of them just didn\u2019t care all that much. These were a school of mermaids, some of the ficklest and deadliest creatures in the ocean. They didn\u2019t all kiss her tailfin or anything, but most of them did respect their captain. Most of them. And while all were happy to share in the spoils of their hunts and their plundering, there was certainly a lot of self-servitude aboard. Not that Vashine minded much. Kept the spirits high. So long as it didn\u2019t interfere with her, her crew was able to do as they saw fit and fight things out amongst themselves\u2026 to a degree, of course. <br>\r\nAs Vashine swam on deck, her still rounded underbelly slithering just above the decrepit wooden deck of her vessel, her crew worked diligently around her to unload whatever was deemed salvageable from the <i>Queen\u2019s Bounty</i>. Lots of chests, these sailor types seemed fond of \u2018em. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was inside of \u2018em? Vashine didn\u2019t rightfully know. It could be grub (though she never much cared for Land Food), it could be grog (which she cared for quite a lot), or it could be treasure. No matter the bounty though, she\u2019d suffer finrot before she allowed those Breathers up there what was rightfully hers. All that crossed her path was, after all, hers. So long as she could take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here, admiring the sizeable addition to her long list of marinal misdemeanors, that something caught her eye, something foul and distasteful as far as any vessel was concerned. There, around a pretty sizeable bount, was a gaggle of girls\u2014practically guppies. She knew of them, young things that stuck with her for security and adventure. And obviously, by the way they leaned dorsal-up into that box, for spoils of war <i>without the approval of their captain</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this was going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t notice their captain as she swam behind them, probably too busy sneaking pieces for themselves. The three ungrateful hands sniggered excitedly as they sifted through their ill-gotten gain, completely unaware of Vashine\u2019s watchful deadlights. Their eyes reflected the eerie green glow of the <i>Trilobite\u2019s</i> flames off of their precious coins, so engrossed in their amounted treasure that only the looming shadow of their captain could pull them from their greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty haul yegot there.\u201d Vashine growled, \u201cThinkin\u2019 of all the ways ya might be spendin\u2019 it no doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cap\u2019n!\u201d one of the guppies sounded for her friends, \u201cWe just\u2026 eh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere buyin\u2019 yerselves a floggin\u2019 is what.\u201d Vashine folded her arms crossly, \u201cY\u2019think ya can just beg me to come aboard an\u2019 plunder a plunderer? No dice, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were\u2026uh\u2026appraisin\u2019 it for ya!\u201d the one on the right, coral-headed little lass, piped up, \u201cWe figgered that ya got a lotta booty here an\u2019\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d take some of it offa my hands fer me?\u201d Vashine\u2019s lips began to curl as a distasteful snarl became her, \u201cYa think I popped outta me egg yesterdey, girlie? I know what you were doin\u2019\u2026 \u2018sides, I already got me a girl fer that. Ain\u2019t that right, Layna?!\u201d she hollered over her shoulder to the mousy first mate, armed with a mop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways right, Captain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019see? Now get\u2019cher grubby grabbers off my booty or I\u2019ll take \u2018em off for ya.\u201d Vashine spat before adding, \u201cYa bilgesuckers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise, the three little things jumped ship just as the words left her lips without skipping a beat! In unison, all three of them swam quickly over the ornate railing. Vashine, shocked by the strangeness of it all, peered over to find that her three little sea rats were\u2026 were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsucking the Bilge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019n the name\u2019a...?\u201d Vashine asked herself incredulously, \u201cBelay that, ya roight fools! I di\u2019nt mean it literally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that her three little thieves swam back up as if nothing happened. They just kinda looked at her, not unlike the sea bass before them, all blank and stupid the lot of \u2018em.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 make yerselves useful! Ya heard me, scat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they swam off just as fast (if not faster) than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaft little things, they are. Thought I told Layla not to hire the slow\u2019uns.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vashine swam through the towering pillars of coral, sunlight dappling their pink and purple hues.   She'd decided to leave her crew to their odd behavior; she could always do a surprise check later to make sure none of them had pilfered any treasure.   Right now she needed a bit of solitude, a little peace and quiet, and the chance to swim off her bellyful of fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was such a thing as a little too much peace and quiet.  And as the merwoman wove her way through the reef, she was starting to feel just a little peaced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchools of glinting sunfish hung motionless in the water.   A barnacle-covered crab emerged from the reef and stood silently at attention, like a footman.   The dark shadow of a ray drifted across her path, aimlessly, as if the animal had forgotten where it was going the second it got close to her.  <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nShit and sand dollars</i>, she thought.  <i>It's Poseidon's own insane asylum here t'day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd swallowed a few of the smaller fish as a matter of principal--a proper pirate had to be greedy, after all--but she quickly reached a point at which the thought of more food made her gills tighten with dismay.  Waving off a particularly persistent clownfish which seemed to have mistaken her mouth for an anemone, she thrashed her tail a few times, lifting herself with just a bit of difficulty away from the jagged candy-colored landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!  Captain!   I did what ya asked, I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine turned to see one of the wretched little dolts from before.   She growled and tried to outpace the girl, but the little minnow was a speedy slip of a thing, and Vashine was bloated and slow.  Soon her merminion was swimming beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made myself useful!  Look!  I caught us a right big load o' oysters!\"  She held up a net.  \"Hundreds of 'em!  Found a whole nest on t' other side of the ship, an' I went all walrus-an'-carpenter on 'em!   We'll have a feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine felt the fish shifted in her belly, and a few stray bubbles of air escaped from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain?  Don't ya want ta try the first one?\"  The girl help on a particularly large oyster and waved it temptingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get stuffed!\" Vashine growled crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blinked her nictitating membrane, then, without a word, cracked open the shell and slurped down the oyster.   She repeated the process with another, and another, empty shells falling from her hands like raindrops to rest against the coral below.   Vashine just watched, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-there,\" the girl grunted when she'd swallowed the lot.   Her middle bulged with the bulk of her fleshy meal.   \"Now I'm stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neptune's briny balls!\" Vashine exclaimed.  \"What's got inta ya, lass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mermaid covered a burp.  \"Lots an' lots of oysters, mostly.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Captain Hookrust stared at her wench, baffled by what was either an example of loyal stupidity or a complete inability to recognize or refuse a figure of speech. This girl, this little pup that she was, had just eaten hundreds of oysters in what Vashine could only describe as the most confusing thing she\u2019d ever seen right <i>after</i> trying to pocket a share of <i>the Queen\u2019s Bounty</i>. Had the whole ocean gone mad? First the fish were loony, now the fish-people were loony too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Vashine asked rhetorically, \u201cI think I\u2019m done for t\u2019day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a kick of her tailfin, Vashine propelled herself back towards the ship at a steady pace. However the little minnow soon turned tail and followed her, earning the ire of the now very frustrated captain. As Vashine grew further and further away from the sea life, things began to go back to normal\u2014namely everything started trying to eat the other again\u2014though her attention was not on the annoying fish behind her\u2026 well, rather not those ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But Captain!\u201d the young mermaid called out, \u201cI-I did just what you asked!\u201d she cried, \u201cI-Is there somethin\u2019 else you\u2019d like for me to do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine\u2019s pace slowed down eventually, just to where she and the maiden could see the <i>Trilobite</i> nestled in a deep aquatic canyon. It wasn\u2019t out of any desire to actually speak with the finned freak following her around, as it was mostly a result of her fatigue. So far she\u2019d eaten pretty well over the past hour or so, and her pale white stomach was getting uncomfortably full. The little one though, was not quite so hindered. Despite her own belly being burdened by the weight of hundreds of oysters, she somehow managed to catch up to Vashine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnythin\u2019\u2026 anythin\u2019 at all, Captain!\u201d she said with an odd sense of eagerness in her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine growled under her breath, not taking very kindly to this new behavior that had seeped onto the ship and having infiltrated some of her lowest mers\u2019 already delicate psyches. She turned around, bulging belly blazing, and stared down the eager beaver with malice reflecting in her pale white eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna help?\u201d she asked venomously, \u201cYou an\u2019 yer girlies better stop messin\u2019 around, or I\u2019ll have ya all keelhauled to make an\u2019 example outta ya.\u201d She spat, \u201cThe fish\u2019re actin\u2019 somethin\u2019 crazy, an\u2019 I sure as hell don\u2019t need my girls goin\u2019 loony on me too.\u201d At the mention of the word \u2018fish\u2019, her stomach kicked somewhat, causing her to wince a little in pain, \u201cI\u2019m retirin\u2019 to my chambers. Stay here an\u2019 eat all the bloody oysters ya want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the Captain jettisoned herself towards her ship, leaving the younger girl out in the canyon with an uncomfortably blank expression on her face. Vashine soon found herself back aboard the Trilobite in all of its eldritch elegance. However for the first time since they\u2019d actually taken it over, the Trilobite actually seemed like so much the ghost ship it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody moved, no mer so much as flicked her tailfin as soon as Vashine came aboard. They all seemed to stare at her, making her feel very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019re ya lookin\u2019 at?!\u201d she cried out angrily, \u201cGet your tails back to work before I toss all'o ya to the shore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Vashine\u2019s crew went diligently back to work as per schedule\u2014maybe even a little bit better than schedule actually, since most of them were actually pulling their own weight this time around. She let out a sigh, one filled with exasperation and eye-rolling intolerance for the strangeness on board. Uncrossing her arms from underneath her breasts, Vashine started towards one of the two portholes that led to the Captain\u2019s Quarters, more than happy to punch out early and (hopefully) have a relatively normal day of pilfering, plundering, and piracy tomorrow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swam through the metal tube like normal, her head and shoulders fitting through nicely. Though when it came time for her stomach to pass, there was some difficulty. That was to be expected, what with all the apparently brain-dead fish she'd eaten today, but it only served to make Vashine all the huffier and all the more ready for bed. She climbed into her private quarters and drifted off contentedly in her cabin...</span></div></div>",

Your favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelp-wrapped salmon here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it!\" Vashine growled.  \"You're so set on fawnin' over me... then listen to me and leave me alone when I tell ya to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayna shook her head.  \"We can't do that, Cap'n.

She felt like a manatee.  Her crew, grinning like sea devils all the while, had stuffed such a quantity of food into her that she could scarcely move beyond a weak wave of the tail.  She rolled over slowly, belching up a little extra air that had gotten into her in the kelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" she groaned.  \"Now...we pillage... just give me a bit here... feelin' a mite... uggh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Cap'n!\"  Layna said, rubbing Vashine's distended flanks.   \"Take all the time ya need!

And though she told herself, <i>forced</i> herself even to stay awake for fear of treachery, the battle against sleep was one not easily won on a stomach as full as poor Captain Hookrust\u2019s. Her eyelids were heavy and her attention was quickly fading. With every little circle Layla completed over her distended abdomen, the battle grew more and more hopeless as the ruthless mermaid slowly fell into a deep, deep sleep\u2026<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nIn her mind\u2019s eye, as she slumbered, Vashine dreamt herself a tiny island. With blue sand and a large rock in the center of it, which she sat upon with her tail resting lightly against the side. There was no air on this island, only water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat atop the rock thoughtfully, not quite contemplating the strangeness of it all but hardly immune to it. In all her years, Vashine had never seen such pretty blue sand. She ran her tailfin through it idly, watching as her tail disappeared below the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn looking down, she noticed light from above reflecting off of the water. Instinctively she turned up, spotting the Sun from far away, but also several rather large objects around her dancing in the water. A vase filled with giant beautiful flowers, far taller than many of the plants she had seen both on and off of land.  Also books, a stack of big brown leather. She\u2019d never actually read any, given that they would come apart in the water should she ever try, but still she recognized them. In front of her was an enormous room, built in stone and furnished proportionately with gigantic furniture that she\u2019d known landlubbers to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming from her rock in curiosity, she headed for this mysterious room in the water only to be stopped by an invisible force. She tried again, but to no avail. Vashine began pressing on this invisible wall that separated her from what she desired to know. She growled, angry at her inability to reach past this wall. It was crystal clear, this wall! The only way she couldn\u2019t make it through was if it were made of\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting that thought, Dream Vashine was soon greeted with the sight of an extraordinarily large man in robes with an equally extraordinary beard. He looked to be the seaman type, not quite a landlubber but more of an airsucker, and painfully human. His feeble age showing in his cracked face as he smiled down at her like she were some kind of pet. The nerve of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Captain.\u201d His voice came out muffled, Vashine was hardly able to understand him, \u201cMy you\u2019re getting so big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine crossed her arms and huffed, rolling her opaque eyes distastefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s dinner time, m\u2019girl, eat up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the man leaned over, a small cup in hand, and began pouring into the skyline above her. And that was when she had her epiphany. Her \u201cisland\u201d was nothing more than this man\u2019s fish bowl, stuffed away on some shelf! She had been captured, defanged, <i>domesticated</i>! Her! The Captain of the Trilobite, the Queen of All Seas! Vashine Hookrust was\u2026 a pet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed herself against the glass once more in hopes of reaching the man, shouting to him that there had been some kind of mistake. But he would not listen, or could not listen. He simply kept pouring, pouring into what must have been her bowl. She could only cry out in agony as the bearded man left, opening his mighty door and closing it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned around, her \u201cisland\u201d was lost beneath a sea of fish. It made her mad, to have her life taken from her and then her only refuge. So she ate them. All of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFish of all shapes and sizes. From sharks to krill, shrimp to bass, mammals and mollusks too, Vashine devoured them all. And they let her, barely putting up a fight as they all slithered down her throat. She was ravenous, a mer possessed. Admittedly, she forgot what exactly she was eating them for, just that she was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she ate, Vashine grew more bloated. The enormous, blinding cloud of pisces insedit began to dwindle as a shape grew to fill the gap left. It was Vashine, becoming girthier with every indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the tip of her nose to the tip of her tail, Vashine looked more like a pufferfish than a mermaid. Her grossly, almost comically large stomach swelled and folded over its mighty weight. Her tail was all but useless, only able to give out half-hearted little kicks of belabored energy. Her face was as round as a sand-dollar, white eyes retreating beneath her encroaching facial flab\u2014but still she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she felt a strange sensation on her flanks. Then further up. Her arms were pressed against the glass! She\u2026 she couldn\u2019t move! She was too fat for her bowl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, on a reel and armed with a hook, loomed a dangerously familiar lure carved to look like one of the many scaly creatures she had just devoured. Her mind, blank, told the greedy glutton to swim upwards, but she could not! Slowly the lure lowered further and further until finally, after much pathetic struggling on Vashine\u2019s part, it fell into her mouth gently. She wrapped her lips around it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then the bowl gave out.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nVashine awoke with a startle, her eyes shooting open not half a second before she was awake. She began feeling around, making sure that this was indeed her quarters. Breathing a sigh of relief that it was, her hands fell atop her distended middle, still quite solid from her earlier binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain?\u201d she heard Layna\u2019s voice as her mousy first mate swam through one of the portholes to her room, \u201cIs everythin\u2019 alright in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Aye\u2026 everythin\u2019\u2026 everythin\u2019s fine.\u201d Vashine uncharacteristically as the shock of her dream overwhelmed her even roused, \u201cJust a nightmare\u2026 just a nightmare\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u201d Layna said happily, \u201cI was starting to think that you might be in too foul of a mood to enjoy your dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dinner?\u201d Vashine parroted back, \u201cYer serious? Layna, I\u2019m not eatin\u2019 anythin\u2019 ever <i>again</i>, let alone dinner after that blimey feast this mornin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you slept all the way through lunch\u2026\u201d Layna added quietly, \u201cI was going to wake you up, but we were busy plunderin\u2019, just like you told us to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, a group of privateers, rich lot they were.\u201d The redheaded seawench smiled, \u201cCan\u2019t believe ya managed to sleep through the whole thing. We were pretty loud up there.\u201d She added with a giggle, \u201cLots\u2019o treasure fer you to go through though, Cap\u2019n!

A bursting wave of stale air wafted outwards carrying with it a foul stench. Having had her face poised eagerly before the treasure container, the mermaid girl was assaulted by the odor, forcing out a gag. It was an unpleasantly familiar smell; that of long rotten seafood. Regaining her composure, the pirate captain gazed into the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Vashine's great disappointment, all that sat in the chest was a single book. It was an ancient looking thing, with its leather-bound cover long since ruined by numerous fissures and cracks. The pages had lost their pure white sheen, now dyed yellow from age. A few other dark red stains marked the book's surface but it was impossible for the Captain to identify their origin. Finally, her eyes locked on to the books gilded title, plastered dead center on the cover. It read <i>To Serve Mermaid</i>. Intrigued, she pulled the book out and began to leaf through its pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon came to regret that decision. The book was a horrific container of the unspeakable; inside its bindings it contained hundreds of recipes designed with Vashine and her kin in mind. Barbaric ideas ranging from pickled mermaid tail to mermaid vegetable rolls filled the book. There were even recipes for breast meat sashimi! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMental images of her mermaid brethren's awful demises began to force their way into her mind. Innocent souls, dragged out of the sea's depths to serve the gluttony of some fat land dweller. Her crew had heard such awful rumors spread across the ocean floor but none had actually believed them to be true. Even the most ruthless of mermaid pirates, such as Captain Vashine herself, would not have done something so wicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething with anger, she shot back beneath the ocean's surface, book still in hand. The thick salt water ate greedily at the flimsy book, but Vashine hardly cared. Her crew would take their trusted captain at her word even if the ink had been washed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the crew at the plundered ship, still having their way with it. With a furious roar she ordered the group to assemble and within a few seconds they did just that. Lined up before her, she explained in earnest what she had found on the surface. Their reactions weren't much different; they murmured in disgust and anger at the landlubber's actions. A few cried, the poor girls having indulged themselves on an unknown type of seafood in the ship's food stores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're furious, gals, as am I!\" Vashine shouted. \"I say it's time we strike back at those gluttonous fools and give them a taste of their own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye Captian, are you suggesting we start devouring humans?\" a young pirate with bright red hair spoke up. She was Lanya, the ship's second in command. A thin, mousey girl, promoted more for her intelligence than fighting prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just humans. Anyone. Goblins, orcs, and whoever is slow enough to get captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Captain. But where should we strike first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply, Lanya, we head straight for...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Captain Steamer, of the Boiling Sea Pirates, lounged on the bed in his quarters, his one arm wrapped around his favorite wench.   Once he'd been ambidextrous.  Now, he was left-handed, and the fingers of that hand were gradually, playfully working loose the strings of her corsets.   Daria \"Lefty\" McCuddy giggled and took another swig of rum; she had just about down enough of it herself so that she couldn't smell it on him.  That was when things started getting fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>Crimson Cloud</i> lurched to one side, sending her rolling off the bed in a tangle of sheets.  Steamer followed her, but picked himself up almost at once.  They could here shouts of alarm from the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here,\" Steamer grunted, shoving her into the closet.  She heard his cutlass sliding from his scabbard, and then the slam of the cabin door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time she huddled in the darkness, listening to the screams.    She hoped nothing happened to the captain's remaining arm.  Once he'd had two, and she'd had a twin sister; when a rival claimed the limb, he reasoned that it was a waste to have more girls around than he could hold at once.  She'd been forced to fight Mickey to the death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must have been hours and hours, the door was yanked open and Daria was hauled roughly into the light.   A burly merwoman, white spots speckling her slick tangerine skin, threw her down on the bed and looked her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pl-please...\" Daria begged.  \"Don't kill me!  I never liked 'em, that I didn't, an' that's the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, little human,\" the merwoman laughed, \"I've got some good news for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on her tail in a sort of half-walk, half-slither, the great fish dragged Daria from the captain down to the mess hall.   The benches were filled with more mermaids, shiny-scaled and colorful, all dressed in the mariner's motley of a pirate crew.   Maybe of them slept; other drowsed over plates garnished with a few bones and scraps of flesh.   A great feast had taken place here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria was hauled before the great throne where Captain Steamer had once held court.  Currently it was occupied by an imposing looking mer-lass, her hair braided and knotted with shells, a battered hat pulled low over her eyes.   She lounged across the chair, one arm over the back and her tail slung over the armrest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found another juicy little morsel for ya, captain,\" her captor said, shoving her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid captain picked her teeth with a sliver of bone and belched thoughtfully.   She scratched her distended fishbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Slices, you're doin' me too good.   Any more food an' I'll bust wide open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned, giving Daria a terrifying look at her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a nice one, though.   Juicy.  Just a littl bit plump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria blushed and shook out her blond ringlets.   \"A little, maybe,, but if you've any gentlemen among you I can still please 'em, easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd offer up yer services willin'ly, after what we did ta ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't done nothin' to <i>me</i>, far as I can see.   An' I don't care if you killed off the rest of that scurvy lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mer-captain laughed.   \"Just like a human!  We didn't just kill 'em off, you know.  We ate 'em up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.  Every last one.   Which leaves the question of what to do with you...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh how it was,\" Daria feigned, falling to her knees in a pathetic pose. \"They treated me like some sort 'o filthy harlot! Havin' their way with me whenever they felt. Ol' Cap'n Steamer himself were the worst of 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bastard'd keeped me locked ta' his bed for hours at a time, beatin' me if I moved as much as an inch. I shudder at the thought of bein' hold up in some captain's keep ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. In that case, I think I got a proposition fer ya, lass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mer-captain raised her limp arm from the chair's back, turning her full attention to the girl cowering before her stolen throne. The prisoner in question was beautiful one indeed. Golden curls dangled softly from her crown, styled to utmost perfection. A nearly undone corset still held fast to her hourglass form, accentuating her melon-sized breasts and wide hips. Her belly seemed to hold a little bit of pudge, but Vashine didn't mind; it made for a more filling meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's about ya join our crew as an honorary mermaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her chance, Daria jumped up in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, o' Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pompous grin spread across Vashine's face. Nothing made the old fish giddier than roping in new members for her merry band. Especially when they were as intriguing (and appetizing) as the girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, lass,\" Vashine began, leaning forward, \"welcome ta t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mer-womans greetings were cut off as she tumbled violently from the chair. She had made a grave error; Her swollen fish-belly was still stuffed to the brim with pounds of undigested meat. Vashine had failed to adjust for her lower center of balance and paid for it. An uncomfortable belch forced its way past her lips as the contact with the floor compacted her stomach, closing whatever gaps remained. Hurt only in her ego, she popped back up with a face as straight as a razor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry 'bout that, I haven't been this full in a long while. Now then, as I was sayin', welcome ta the crew. Now what's yer name, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria, is it? Well, Daria, you've probably noticed by now, but the crew n' I've eaten our share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah, about that...\" the blonde trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tcha worry, lass, we got something just for ya. Slices! Go fetch it!\" Vashine ordered, motioning toward the burly merwoman still standing at attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soldier's discipline she slithered off to the far end of the room, well beyond Daria's view. A few tense moments later and she had returned, a plate balancing between her ice grip. It was a piece of fine china, pearly white and shinier than a newly cut diamond. At its sat a large chunk of meat, freshly cut. Daria winced as it was shoved before her face, the horror overtaking her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're ya waitin' for? Dig in!\" Slices said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll pass for now. I'm not feelin' hungry, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine slouched back in surprise. Such insolence was uncommon among her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? One of yer superiors just told ya ta dig in. I suggest ya listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, girl, there are two kinds of people in this world. Those that eat an' those that're eaten. So dig in or there won't be a next time, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For another moment, she could do nothing but stare at the meal, fully knowing what it was \u2013 but at least not who it was. It looked like an ordinary, if enormous, steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm waitin', lassie!\u201c, the merwoman reminded her impatiently, but with a malicious grin, showing off her intimidating teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria had no choice but to follow orders if she wanted to stay alive, so she carefully cut off a tiny piece of meat from the steak and, in order to pointlessly buy more time, she stared at it. She had to admit to herself, it looked... appetizing. It was white and lean and also finely prepared, juicy with a rosy core. It looked just like a steak ought to look like, and a moment later, she found her mouth watering. Her... interactions with Capt'n Steamer had made her hungry and she had still enough rum in her belly to feel starved.<br>\r\nUnder Vashine's stern gaze, she stuffed the piece of meat into her mouth. A chill went through her body. It was the most luxurious steak she had ever eaten, almost silky in her mouth. She actually moaned in pleasure, for pleasure it was that the steak was giving her, far more than Steamer had ever been capable of. Who would have thought that the worthless bunch would taste that good? Being aware of the fact that she was eating a human being made it all so much more kinky. It was like the most expensive food one could imagine, like she was eating the last unicorn ever to exist or something. Even before, she had felt above the dirty, smelly pirates, and due to her beauty, also above most women, but now... now she just felt like the whole of humanity was utterly beneath her.<br>\r\nHappily, she crammed the steak down her gullet, bite after bite after bite, savouring the hot, tasty goodness even after she ought to have been past her stomach's capacity. When the whole steak was gone, she downed the cup of rum that had been placed next to her plate, let out a petite burp and slumped against the back of her chair. Her belly was quite a bit distended by now and she was happy her corset had been loosened before. She patted her bloated stomach softly and released another burp. She didn't feel like a whore any longer, instead she felt like a pampered princess from a fairytale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA careful side glance told her that the merwoman was smiling at her in satisfaction.<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, lass. An' you seem to have plenty of room left for yer second course\u201d, she announced.<br>\r\nDaria awoke from her food-induced stupor and stared at her. \u201cS- second course?\u201d, she repeated in disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. If ya oughta stay with us, ya oughta eat like us\u201d, Vashine said and patted her own enormously bloated belly, before she brought in the second course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enormous ribs, and apparently the ship's chef had had time to prepare more than just the meat, as it had a side of vegetables in a buttery concoction of a sauce that had an almost pudding-like quality to it.<br>\r\n\u201cThought that if we give ye some rabbit food with the fine meat, it would be easier for ye to swallow\u201d, Vashine laughed.<br>\r\nHesitatingly, Daria grabbed the silverware again and stared at the huge helping. It was not that it looked \u2013 or even smelled \u2013 bad, but she was already plenty full and she hadn't intended on eating even more. Yet, it was far, far better than the prospect of landing on this plate herself next, so she started to eat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was close to euphoric the moment she tasted the sauce. <br>\r\nNever, ever in her entire life had she eaten something so creamy, smooth and tasty like this sauce, and in combination with the wonderful ribs, it was truly a meal worthy of the Gods. She dug in like crazy, letting fork and knife go in an instant, instead just grabbing the ribs one by one and gnawing the savoury meat off them like an orc. The buttery sauce was dribbling from her lips, over her chin and onto her voluptuous breasts, but she cared neither about that nor about the captain licking her lips when she watched this.<br>\r\nBy the time Daria was done with the ribs, she trembled all over, partially from the exhaustion of having eaten so much in such a small timeframe, partially from pure joy. She could hardly move, being so stuffed made her heavy and sluggish, she felt like she had swallowed the ship's anchor instead of a delicious meal. Her stomach gurgled under the massive bloat and tried to digest what Daria had encumbered it \u2013 and herself \u2013 with.<br>\r\nYet she did not hesitate to also eat the veggies, stuffing her face with them, one by one, and finally even drinking the rest of the heavenly sauce. She felt her stomach swelled up like a water balloon under the pressure of the fatty liquid. It ran past her mouth and dribbled onto her chest and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOok\u201d, she hiccupped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling fingers, she reached for her cup. She could barely lean forward, her belly was so full. Actually, even though her blouse was rather widely-cut, she filled it out quite nicely now, and between the blouse and her skirt, half an inch of her bloated belly was to be seen. She had slight trouble breathing and it hurt quite a bit, especially when she tried to take a deep breath, so she preferred to breath shallowly. Her sauce-drenched breasts visibly rose and sank with each laboured breath she took. When she finally had her cup in her hand, she emptied it quickly to complement the buttery bloat. The massive amount of butter in her stomach had made her quite thirsty, yet she dared not to ask for more, for even if she was far from Vashine's massive frame, she felt like she would burst, should she eat a single more bite.<br>\r\nWith an exhausted heave, she wiped some sweat of her forehead and temples, where it had started to make her golden curls stick to her skin. She had eaten far, far too much. The overstuffed girl sprawled back in her chair and gingerly petted her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurrrrrrp... oof\u201d, she moaned lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly felt as taut as a pregnant woman's on the upper and a bit flabby on the underside, and it gurgled and sloshed, desperately trying to digest the massive meal. Breathing heavily, Daria turned her bright red cafe to Vashine and smiled almost drunkenly, as if she had defeated an overwhelming enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVashine decided that...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Rather than messify the other story with an ugly little tail-chain of yes/nos in order to add more characters, I've decided to keep it organized and start another story here--a special all-monster-girls edition of Gluttony and Glory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you haven't read the original Gluttony and Glory, you can do so here:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1856570-Gluttony-and-Glory-Adventuress-WG\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1856570-Gluttony-and-Glory-Adventur...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still going, so feel free to keep adding there, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules here are pretty much the same as the other one... allow me to quote myself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1) In general, try to keep it focused on amounts people could potentially eat and gradual, realistic gains (of course, there is some leeway here given that the adventures aren't human, so their capacities could potentially be a bit more).<br>\r\n2) Avoid scat, exploding, children being involved in anything sexual or fetishy, non-food/drink related inflation, male WG, immobility, death of the main characters, or excessive slobbiness. Given that some of them are rather monstrous, vore may make an appearance, but please don't get too graphic.<br>\r\n3) Try to add character and story as well as pure sexy stuff, it keeps things interesting!<br>\r\n4) Try to use good grammar, spelling, and punctuation. I'll try to catch and fix any mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you follow these and make your addition a decent length, I'll do my best to follow up any additions (eventually!) Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in this case those \"monstrous\" and \"a little leeway\" exemptions are in full effect.  :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado... let's meet the girls we'll be adding a few extra hit dice to!</td>",
