In his younger years Ivar reunited the fracturing Kingdom in a brutal military conquest but these days he spends more time controlling the boisterous fruit of his loins than managing his armies and his martial strength is all but gone, though he still maintains an imposing (if increasingly plump) stature. His hair and beard have turned silver, granting him an almost grandfatherly appearance, though this belies the ruthlessness he is willing to meet out on those that disobey him.<br>\r\nA lecherous old sod, Ivar works tireless to hide his multiple lovers from his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Queen Helena (the Vast)</b><br>\r\nIvar's wife and cousin, their marriage was been one of political convenience. Despite the loveless union, Helena has still managed to bear a generous clutch of children. Each birth, combined with her love for extravagant banquets, has increased her girth, so that she now resembles a massive, waddling ball of silk and ermine studded with jewels.<br>\r\nHelena has a fondness for intrigue and spend her time plotting, scheming, and trying to catch the King in his infidelities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Rilian (the Lost)</b><br>\r\nThe eldest and beloved son of Ivar and Helena, the handsome Rilian vanished during a military campaign in distant lands. It is believed he fell in combat, though in truth he is now prisoner of the queen of Erolus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Princess Isabella (the Fecund)</b><br>\r\nPrincess Isabella is the eldest daughter. Yet unwed, Ivar is hoping to use her to cement an alliance with the Kingdom of Ordania, though it is vital her virginity is kept intact. This has not been helped by the Church of the Goddess, who recently bestowed upon Isabella a fertility blessing, regarded as a great honour, which has transformed the plain young princess into a broad hipped, big breasted harlot. Her many handsome suitors have Ivar tearing out what remains of his hair.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- The <b>Bountiful Blessing</b> is a fertility spell designed to turn women into baby factories, making them abundantly fertile, lustful, and capable of inducing lust in any nearby male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Princess Emma (the Brave)</b><br>\r\nA strong, courageous woman, Emma has displayed extraordinary skill with sword and bow, and keen martial and political acumen. For a woman. It is Ivar's greatest regret that she were not born a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Edward (the Pure)</b><br>\r\nThe fraternal twin of Emma. Ivar's greatest source of frustration, Edward is the sickly, naive successor to the throne. He is pale, delicate, and devoted to the pacificist teachings of the Church. Sensing his weakness, pretenders to the throne are already circling like vultures. Ivar is determined to make a man and a King out of Edward or failing that, kill him and appoint his younger brother King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Anders</b><br>\r\nThe youngest, Anders is a healthy and adventurous child, always getting into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Janus Meade the Magician</b><br>\r\nThe court consultant on magic, Janus is a powerful sorcerer fiercely devoted to the Royal Family as only the protection of the King stops his fellow wizards from blasting him out of existence at the first opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jiggles the Jester</b><br>\r\nA rather sad individual, Jiggles is a shapeshifter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A meeting had been called in the war room. As the lords and commanders gathered around the table and Warmaster Hogar the Two Eyed began to give his report in his slow, sonorous voice, the King seated himself at the head of the table with his jowls in his hands, staring vacantly over the parchment map laid out before him. There had been a time when he'd loved these meetings, when the little painted clay figurines of Orcs and Elves placed around the map had evoked memories of the glory days of his youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut war was a game for younger men now. These days it was his family that weighed heavily on his brow. It was the transformation of his eldest daughter, Isabella, in particular which was keeping him awake at night - quite literally, he had spent last night camped outside her chamber door. Handsome young suitors prowled like wolves in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meeting wore on, many of the Lords struck pipes, and the air of the windowless room was soon thick with whorls of smoke and the deep, sleep-inducing drone of the Warmaster. As usual, the reports of impending catastrophe were without end - the Kingdom's borders were vast, so was its list of enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Orc warbands continue their march Southwards. They grow more brazen and gain momentum with each battle, as is their way. They must be broken, and broken hard, or they'll only return stronger. If we can't find a way to stop them - or at least distract or divert their advance - they could very well be at our walls by this time next year. Just something for your consideration... Meanwhile, from Allarmarsh, comes a report of yet another breed of elves - accursed, feral creatures that spew a corrosive substance. Sir Golan was investigating them - alas it cost him much of his skin. The local Elven King assures us that it is an isolated, personal matter that he wishes to deal with himself, though clearly action must be taken if these beasts continue to attack our outlying settlements. Since this is a diplomatic matter, I will only pursue this with the consent of the King of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHogar paused lengthily for confirmation. One by one, the assembled Lords turned to their King. He was slumped in his seat with his chin on his chest, eyes closed beneath their bushy silver brows, snoring. Hogar's scarred face twisted in annoyance, and he drummed his fingers on the pommel of his sword impatiently. With a snort, Ivar realised he was being watched. He stirred in his seat, blinking bleary eyes at his vassals, who were were watching him in the way they did when they expected him to sign or proclaim something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. Are we ordering dinner already?\" Ivar yawned, stretching and rubbing his hands together eagerly. \"I think the stuffed quail today for me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are <i>not</i> ordering dinner,\" Warmaster Hogar growled. \"We are discussing important matters of state which will decide the future of the Kingdom, whether it survives or falls. It is not asking too much for you to focus on the briefing and not your belly for just a few hours. Or is there something more important than an impending, unstoppable Orc invasion on your mind? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your war council,\" he muttered acidly, adding, \".. my liege,\" as an after-thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies.\" Chastised but amused, the King sat up straighter in his chair. He had a fondness for the old war dog and his chronic inability to mince words even around his King. Perhaps he was the man to ask. None of the others lords had given him a straight answer, soothing him with empty assurances regarding his daughter's chastity and his son's failings.</span></div></div>",

Leave that one for the colleges,\" Ivar said dismissively. \"Back to these elves, did you say Sir Golan himself had fallen to them? Why, he's one of the finest knights in the land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely fallen, my friend, at least not yet. His squire rode in with him during the night - what was left of him.\" He selected a journal from among his notes - the parchment was discoloured and there were holes burnt through the leather binding like swiss cheese. \"According to his notes, these cursed elves spew a supremely corrosive bile upon any who come close. It is capable of melting through steel plate as easily as dragon's fire. By his account, these elves melt their victims alive and drink them like a soup. Alas, while studying the monsters, Golan himself was attacked and received a glancing spray across the side of his face. He has been brutally maimed, my Lord. The healing powers of the prieetesshood appears to do little against this foul acid. Even if he survives, he will be blind and deaf, his face melted away, a true horror to behold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's heart sank. Golan had been a true knight, chivalrous, brave and loyal to the crown, perhaps even one of the few men that he might have entrusted to guard the Princess' precious virginity. His adventures were a staple of many a bards' oeuvre and Ivar's chamberlain would always see to leave a copy of Golan's latest excitibg report of daring do on top of the king's desk whenever he detected that His Highness was having a bad day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's the poster child of the military!\" Ivar gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any more, he's not. Not with half his face missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he fought gallantly till the end, sire,\" a young noble smirked. \"Nobody could accuse him of losing face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king glowered and he rumbled, \"Sir Golan is a hero worth ten of any of you. You can lead the force to deal with these elves,\" he barked at the smirking lordling, whose smile evaporated. \"I want these monsters eradicated. Meanwhile somebody find my physician and the court Mage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-|-|-|-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA instigator and veteran of many a bloody campaign, Ivar had seen things that would turn the heart of lesser men, limbs hacked and bones splintered. He had a stomach of steel, but the vision of Golan's poor body was near enough to turn his stomach. He gave a groan of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prized knight looked like a used candle. His burnt melted skin hung in rivulets over raw, red musculature, while his chiselled jaw was exposed white bone. He still moved weakly, calling for his King. Tears welled in his lidless eyes as Ivar hurried to his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an honour... to serve... my Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gone yet, good knight. You've fought worse before and won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... report....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We received it. Don't you worry, I'll burn that whole blasted forest to the ground! We'll flush those twisted tree-huggers out together!\" A priestess swished into the room with a cloth and a basin filled with sweet-smelling oils to wash and bless the soon-to-be-departed. \"Get the hell out of here, you vulture!\" Ivar roared. \"Where is my physician? Where is my wizard?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the man arrived red-faced and gasping, with Janus teleporting in a moment later in a puff of red smoke.  Together they poked and pondered over the dying knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?! What are our options?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two scholars sucked air through what teeth they had left and shook their grey heads. \"Hard to say, my Lord. His body and soul hover on the precipice of death. We may be able to save his mind before his body succumbs. We could cut away the damaged flesh, perhaps save him, but the damage will be extensive and he will certainly never fight again. Or there are treatments that could rebuild his body completely, but the agony may be enough to drive him mad or even sever the last thread anchoring his soul to this mortal plane. You could be left with an empty -albeit healthy- shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar was torn. To choose between Golan's mind and body was one of the impossible decisions he hated as a king. Golan's tactical acumen was as powerful and indespensible as his sword arm. </span></div></div>",

There would be little left of him... but he would... <u>could</u> survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Golan's physical might could be replaced, though it would require training ten new knights to make-up for his absence on the battlefield. His tactical acumen and unwavering loyalty however was indispensable. \"Do what you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the physician pulled from his robes a bundle of dark cloth, unfurling it on the table to expose a dozen sharp blades and other implements. Janus stepped forward to pass his hand over the them, and their blades began to glow with a red-hot intensity. With a steeled expression, the physician took the largest of the knives and began to cut away at the melted, blackened areas of flesh that riddled Golan's body. The patient screamed. The king watched in dismay as more and more lumps of his prized knight were carved away and discarded on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physician switched to a bone saw. Ivar turned away as the hideous sound of metal-on-bone filled the chamber, followed by a dull thump as Golan's lower leg hit the floor. The other limbs followed soon afterwards The intense heat of the instruments seemed to cook the meat as fast as it cut, stemming most of the bleeding, though not all of it. The floor was soon slick with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of an hour, Golan was carved up and whittled away like a hallow's eve pumpkin. He had bled more blood than Ivar thought ever possible to <i>be</i> in a man, yet still he clung to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ubi pus, ibi evacua, Quamish,\" Janus muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not tell me how to do my job, wizard!\" the physician snapped back, wiping the sweat from his brow. \"While you were reading your books, I studied the blade. I am the finest surgeon in the land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear Golan will be the final judge of your skill tonight,\" Janus retorted somberly. \"The corruption spreads faster than you can cut it out. It eats through him like fire through a log.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuamish eyes opened wide and he snapped his slick fingers together. \"If it is like a fire, then I will smother and snuff it out as one! Fetch me a husk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Janus vanished in a puff of crimson smoke. A minute later, he returned in similar fashion, this time with what looked to be violently writhing stag skin rug in his hands. He held the stag head by the antlers, while the hollow arms and legs thrashed around, trying to enslave his limbs like the tentacles of an octopus. \"Help me get it on to the patient!\" Janus yelled. Ivar leaped into action and with their strength combined they were able to remove the parasitic skinsuit's hold on the wizard and force it down on to the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetecting a potential host, the stag skull split open and sealed itself around Golan's head, while the body wrapped around what remained of his torso. The creature pulsated rhythmically as it settled into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in heaven's name is that?\" Ivar gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An epidermite,\" replied Janus, gasping for breath. \"Otherwise known as a husks. Or skinsuit. Or <i>the flayed ones</i>. Nasty creatures. Parasites, like leeches, they attach themselves to and replace the skins of their hosts, permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they <i>do</i> make effective bandages in a pinch,\" the physician said. \"If we are lucky, the parasite will stem the bleeding and stop the corruption from spread-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the husk let out an ear-piercing shriek, peeling away from Golan and flopping off the table. It slithered into a corner, spasming into a curled up ball, turning black and rotten in moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The corruption kills even the creature!\" the physician cried. \"Try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the wizard vanished and returned, this time wrestling with an irridescent, scaled husk in the shape of a young drake. This one was fearsome indeed, even snapping at the king with its empty head of sharp teeth as they wrestled it into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A young, healthy specimen. I have good hopes for this one!\" the physician said, though the tremor in his voice gave away his doubt.</span></div></div>",

Exactly what i didn't needed..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, she was about to stand up, when she catch a the reflexion of a mirror that stand within the room, grasping her head, getting scared at the image that she was facing, her hands going down onto her perky breasts, causing her to huff, out of pleasure, visually confirmed as small puffs of smoke leave her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, a maid had been tasked to clean the room up, as well as to wash the 'unique guest', as part of the good will of the king, being sorry that he actually added to his prized soldier and friend. And the last thing she was actually expecting, it was to find 'Sir Golan' awake, especially nude and in an inintendly provoking position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid herself could be considered as cute. In her early twenties, maybe even 19 years old,  peering at the world with green eyes, going alongside a petite nose and average lips. <br>\r\nHer hair are white, with a soft light purple hue, attached upward into a ponytail, going down roughly around her shoulders, partially concealed by a maid coif. Her body, overall, is slender, with long legs and a pretty generous pair of H-cup breasts, while being abnormally tall with a size of 6'2\". Golan could even feel some sort of naivety waffing from her, despite her own precidament.<br>\r\nBut the most remarkable thing about the maid, or rather the three most.. Are her ears, being long and elongated, pointed backward, of a teal scaly skin, a pair of horns, protuberances visible from her hair, and a long and seemingly heavy tail, as it drags a bit on the ground, of a similar blue as her ears, its bottom of a milky white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a first glance, one could believe she's been at least partially elf, but given what Golan saw, she knew what she was. The dragoness mutters, 'A draconian..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her trail of thinking cut short, as the maid says, 'S-sir! Y-you're awake..!', before she turns around, flustered by the sight. Confused by that reaction, the dragoness idly catch another glimpse onto herself, before hurriedly standing back up, trying her best to cover her nudity, and order, a bit hesitantly, 'G-give me some clothing!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'B-but Sir! There already is..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed there is, neatly folded onto a chair, with a pair of leather boots next to it. But they were ill-fitting, she notices, grabbing the tunic, as they were tailored for her, but when she was still human, leaving her no choice but to make a makeshift cloak of sort, using the blanket she slept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing that moment to remind what happen to herself, Golan had the feeling that her new body wasn't a dream, nor what happen against the elves, but he couldn't why she got to be.. A reptile. And on a lesser extend..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Young girl.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-yes sir?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you doing here.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'T-taking care of the room, and of you, S-sir.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How come you've became a draconian.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'S-sir..?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do tell. I order you.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I found something glittering on the ground.. Out of curiosity i went and tried to grab it, but when i was about to grab it, things went blank and i woke up.. Different. I felt stronger.. And smarter i believe.. Then guards interpellated me and asked me to follow them. I thought they'd punish me or something, but then my mom came and told them that i was a servant in the castle. They spoke to another man and asked me to take care of you.. At first, i got afraid that you'd eat me or something, but they explain what happened. And given i've e-even met the King.. N-not directly, S-sir! But he's been kind toward us.. Since then, i've been caring of you, as i've been asked.. S-sir.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolan would've inquired more, but another voice could be heard, a male one, 'You finally woke up?'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness had the feeling that his voice echoed in his mind, asking, 'What happened.. To me..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Long story short? We had to save you. Using.. Drastic means.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness blinks, 'Were you really forced to do me this!?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighs, 'Yes. The King was personally here. And surely he would be more than please to know that you are finally awake.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How long i've been sleeping..?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Around a week.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And that girl?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh.. Her?'. The maid nervously stand back. 'Don't worry. And as i can tell. She did a fine job.. Nearly.. I.. Suppose i ought to get more.. Proper clothing? Well.. The king wants to see you, Sir Golan. Good thing we kept an eye on you. Otherwise, who've could told what happen.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome memories comes to Golan's mind, hazy reminder of the hell she's been through, before whispering, 'Thank you, Janus..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man let out an 'Hm?', adding, 'Anyway.. I have other matters to attend to. And if you want to know more, the King would probably be willing to explain that occurred while you.. Were away.', and goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Young girl.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, sir..?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is your name.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'..Yuma, Sir.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yuma, let's get me proper clothes.

While the others had resembled the furred skins of wild animals, this one was smooth and mottled greens and yellows, like the skin of an apple. As he brought the parasite closer to Golan, it unfurled into a humanoid shape and Ivar could see how the sinewy skin was indeed that of a plant, with delicate leaf-shaped ears and hair like long grass the colour of autumn leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husk slowly extended tendrils of itself towards Golan as though sniffing him out, then in no particular hurry it latched on and started to draw itself closer, coiling itself around him. It was a relief as the husk finally sealed its own head around the exposed bone of Golan's melted, eyeless visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited with baited breath. As the minutes ticked past, the husk seemed to settle comfortably onto its new host.

Better yet she may banish you for an entire year!\" Sir Golan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar and Janus shake their heads. If Sir Golan was sane he would keep quiet and not say such crazy things. If Helena had a spy in the room she would consider the punishments that came from the madman in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought it may be good to call in the psychologist. I fear what other insane thing Golan may utter next,\" Janus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus looks around the room and notices that Sir Golan is nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, Sir Golan just left. We shouldn't let him roam around in his condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for? Find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar and Janus set off to find Golan before he does anything insane.

Also you were going to marry Isabella to Prince Roberto of Ordania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but restoring Golan's sanity is more important. Besides I can always marry off Emma to the Ordanian prince anyway,\" Ivar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Emma has a higher chance of slitting your throat than willingly marrying Roberto. In every universe he's known as a playboy,\" Sir Golan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar and Janus roll their eyes in response to Golan's insane response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean, but I've heard of a myth where a princess's kiss was able to turn a man who was cursed to be a frog back to normal. I think it's called true love's kiss or something like that.\" Ivar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only a myth, sire. Not only is the idea crazy it simply wouldn't work. The blessing on Isabella causes her to lust for any man she sees. Lust and love are not the same thing!\" Janus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be insane, but I agree with Janus. Isabella would only want to marry me for sex. Yet again that isn't such a bad thing,\" Sir Golan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, at least one of us is in agreement,\" Ivar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus shakes his head as his king decides to go with his crazy idea. It was clear that his admiration for Sir Golan clouded his judgment. If it was up to Janus he would administer various treatments to rid Sir Golan of his insanity, even if it meant giving him the mentality of a vegetable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I marry your daughter I have one request,\" Sir Golan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your request?\" Ivar sighed. Clearly the request was going to be insane and dangerous. With Sir Golan's newly founded insanity he may be more of a liability on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My request is simple.

I won't stand for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar looked back at the two scholars. Still red-faced from fatigue, they were diligently awaiting his order. What will it be? Will his majesty save the body? Or perhaps his soul? Those were the thoughts running through their heads right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know how to save both of them?\" Ivar said sternly, causing them to flinch. The two briefly look at each other before shaking their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid to say there is nothing we can do,\" Janus sighed, drooping his shoulders. But Ivar was a king, and had faced such opponents many of times in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I don't think you understood me. You <i>do</i> know how to save him?\" Ivar repeated, even more sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Janus began, before he shut his mouth as a result of the physician's glare. It didn't go past Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it! Unless you want to lose your head, of course,\" Ivar barked at the two, squinting his eyes. He obviously wasn't going to execute the two, but he had hoped that the threat would provide incentive. After all, they must have heard rumors of his atrocious ruthlessness. And looking at the beads of sweat pouring from their foreheads, they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the physician began anew. \"The royal mage knows more about this, but I do know that you can anchor the soul to the body while rebuilding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Janus continued. \"If someone else volunteers to use their internal energy, some in the East call it 'ki', then it's possible to do that. Unfortunately, we don't know what would happen to the person providing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Key?\" Ivar repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your majesty, 'ki',\" Janus corrected. \"It sounds similar, but it's different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, we must fetch someone to provide their key or whatever,\" Ivar suggested, stroking his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two once more looked at each other before beginning to interrupt each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one to provide it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Golan dies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two voices united into one for the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless your majesty provides it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't one of you two do it,\" Ivar suggested, not happy with offering his 'key'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Janus stated. \"I will have to anchor the soul, and Quamish here has to rebuild the body. Quick! Decide before time runs out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar quickly interrupted him with a series of laughter. \"Qua... Quamish?\" He choked on his spit in his laughing fit. \"That was your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decide,\" the physician barked, visibly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar straightened himself out, calming down. This was a pivotal moment. He didn't want to sacrifice anything of his. However, just one look at Sir Golan... the knight who made him proud. Unknown to his servants, he would stay up during the night, reading his reports while grinning like a little boy. He... he just couldn't lose that. It wasn't even the political acumen that made his decision, but his personal feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" Ivar said, calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other again and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Janus said. \"But this might hurt and...\" Ivar wasn't able to hear his last words as the spell flew at him and knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar bolted upright. Looking briefly around him, he noticed his two scholars standing around him and... Sir Golan! He was standing there too! The liquified face was nowhere to be found, and he even looked healthier than prior to embarking on his mission. So he was saved. And Ivar was still alive. He mentally pumped his fist into the air at that thought, as it would be unbecoming of the king to do that in front of servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as you can see, we were successful in his recovery,\" Janus reported, before adding something else in such a whisper that Ivar could only barely hear it. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">princess</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hear that, right?\" Ivar began, before noticing the high pitch in his voice. Now that he thought about it, the men around him seemed too tall, even if he was sitting, and his robes were draped all over his body, clearly too big. \"No... it can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Quamish said, before clearing his throat. \"It seems that 'his majesty' has gone on a trip, princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me princess!\" Ivar yapped in his shrill voice. \"In addition, what age am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize,\" Sir Golan intervened. \"But do you remember last month when Princess Isabella began parading and insisting that we call her Prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do remember that, my dear knight,\" Ivar's attitude softened when it came to Golan. \"But pray tell me, what does that have to do with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! It's just that... you enacted a law that allowed us only to call royalty according to their appearance and status... so we are forced to call you princess, princess.\" Golan stated, trying to sound as polite as possible. \"And the answer to your question is about 9 years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only 9 years old?\" Ivar shouted, losing his composure. \"And a girl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, princess,\" Golan continued. \"Your sacrifice has saved my life, and thus, I will now protect yours. I offer that we travel to the Kiccigiorgi Forest, where my residence is, and I shall take care of you with my lovely wife, until a solution to your problem has been found. We shall declare that the King is away on a trip and no one shall suspect a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not suspect that would be wise,\" Janus rebutted. \"We do not know how long it will take to reverse this problem. It could take years for all we know. Or maybe there is none and the King will be forced to grow up naturally. Either way, it's best for the King to take the throne now and declare that there will be solution, rather than later where he would have lost the will of the people. At least now, the people would still accept a little girl sitting on the throne. If he does it later, he will most likely be forced into marriage with a prince from another country. Besides, the Queen is bound to find out, she's extremely shrewd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar thought about it. Both options were not delightful ones and could lead to severe consequences and him losing his throne. However, he ultimately went with...</span></div></div>",

Ivar rode with Golan, enjoying the speed of the enchanted beast and able to sit back against Golan's armoured chest and watch the beautiful wilderness of his kingdom go by. It had been years since he had left the city. Breathing in the clean air, seeing the animals flitting in the lush undergrowth, it all made him feel young again, though being 9-years old again might have been part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was liberating not having documents to sign, not having his wife looming over his shoulder. Ivar began to daydream, as children are likely to do on a long journey. He had carved out such a vast territory in his life - imagine what he could achieve with a second chance. Why, he could own the entire world. He pictured himself staying in this form, having ten years to plan and consolidate and muster his troops before storming out of his gates as a great and terrifying warrior Queen, all the experience of age married with the energy of youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Married.</i> That was the kicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus galloped ahead in the shape of a mare, giving further encouragement to Golan's mighty stallion. Bandits were common on these roads and it would be unwise to linger, not that Ivar felt anything but safe sheltered in his knight's strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolan's estate was relative small, just a few hundred acres of farmland hugged tight against the manor which was a simple squat building. The trees grew large and thick here, and there was a well-defined transition where the estate ended and the shadowed forest began. \"Fey woodland,\" Golan explained. \"Make sure not to stray too close, my liege, there are creatures within that would make quick work of a young human girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Ivar said, ears shining eagerly for another of the knight's tales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depraved satyrs. Wicked flesh-eating hags. Fexgits and Nixies that will spirit you away to their courts, never to be seen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought of burning them out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolan chuckled, ruffling the king's hair as if he'd said the darndest thing. \"Sometimes. But they don't bother us so long as we don't bother them. For the most part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steed trotted to the stables for a much-earned rest. Janus lay in the hay, panting, while halfling servants brushed him down and lathered water down his steaming flanks. A feedbag was being affixed. Ivar jumped down immediately and kicked the tired horse. \"Did I give you permission to rest, wizard? You're supposed to be working on a means to fix me so hop to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard gave him a look that could literally curdle milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halfling serfs scurried to receive their lord. They looked happy and well-fed even by the standards of their race, with rosy cheeks and pot-bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to the manor, Golan said, \"A small word of warning before you meet my wife. She is, well.... from around these parts,\" he said, gesturing to the fey woods in the distance. \"She has her fey moods from time to time. It is best to ride them out, like a storm. Ah, here she comes now - oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman was marching from the manor towards them. Even from a distance, her dryad blood was plain to see, with skin the colour of bark and hair as green as grass. A loose lavendar dress was draped over a willowy figure, and she had inherited the unworldly grace and beauty that had a tendency to drive men mad. Ivar was surprised to feel nothing. As a man, he had been a sucker for such perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one hand was a crumpled note, in the other was clutched a dead raven, the life choked out of it. She gestured furiously with that hand, feather's flying. \"They told me you were dead!\" she roared accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Now, er- I can explain. That message was sent prematurely. I was only, well, mostly dead. I got better!\" Golan stammered before his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to throw myself from the window of the tallest tower before I saw your horse arrive!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zalia, sweetie, don't you think that's a bit of an overeaction\" Golan mumbled. \"You can't just keep throwing yourself from the tallest tower every time you have a problem. One of these days, the servants wont be there to catch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave an indignant humph, Turning away from him, she stared down her perfect nose at Ivar...</span></div></div>",

During his time as a king, he had met many imposing figures and he obviously had beaten them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this wasn't anything that he has faced before. Was this the vengeful gaze of a woman in love? Was this the discerning gaze of a wise woman? He couldn't tell. But he couldn't back down either. Even when faced with such an adversary, he mustn't back down, age be damned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly arched his back before remembering that court etiquette didn't require him to bow anymore. He usually didn't bother with etiquette, especially since his heavy stomach would often interfere, but Ivar wanted to impress the charming wife of his hero, so a curtsy was a requirement here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings. My name is Ivar- ee... ah!\" Ivar's words were cut off as he crashed in a spectacular fashion. One of his slippers caught onto the other which caused him to stumble, and achieve that result. Zalia wasted no time in swooping up to Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my grandfey! Are you hurt?\" She asked as she picked Ivar in her arms, which might have been difficult in his unchanged state. Flustered, Ivar began to flail in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me down! I am fine!\" Ivar shouted, not relenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop that! We need to take a look. I'm certain that you sprained your ankle,\" Zalia began to persuade Ivar, but it was futile. The former king, now princess, was not used to be handled like a little child. He was humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! I should let you know that I am the ki-\" Ivar's words were cut off as Zalia cast a paralyzation spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I had to do this, but we need you to settle down,\" Zalia chastised as she began her quick walk to the manor. \"Now that I look at your face closer, you are so adoooooooorable~. Golan, dear, who is this Ivalia? Where did you find her? Did you finally live up to your promise?\" Her attitude reversed into a completely other direction as her eyes, colored a pale grey, seemed to sparkle. Ivar could almost swear that he heard a horse cackling somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFey were creatures that generally had long lives, and coupled with that were low birth rates. Golan and Zalia had attempted to procreate numerous times, but infrequent menstrual cycles coupled with long, away-from-home adventures that Golan had frequently went on, the attempts yielded nothing. Golan had once suggested that they adopt a child until they had finally managed to create one of their own, but quickly forgot about it. Zalia, though, didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she finally the one? We'll need to get her out of these rags and finally adorn her with a proper attire!\" Zalia continued with an excited tone. Ivar, wearing a prince's clothing was confused for a second, but then realized the implications behind those words and winced. He quickly threw a begging towards his hero, hoping for his help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Golan was stuck between a spear and an arrow. On one side, he owed a huge debt to his kind for saving him. On the other, he really didn't want to deal with a month long moody wife after finally reviving back from the dead. Opening his mouth, he stammered...</span></div></div>",

She decided she had to be extra prepared once the idea of adoption came into play, lest there approach a day where Golan marched through through her door with their new child, and she couldn't provide anything for them. What a potential horror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my <i>goodness</i>, you are the cutest thing!\u201d Zalia gushed as she bent down and placed her hands on the considerably shorter girl's shoulders. With Golan and her new 'daughter's' arrival, the matron of the household wasted no time fulfilling her urge to doll 'Ivalia' up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully insuring the tumble the little girl took during their first meeting left her unscathed, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gown at hand blended well with its new wearer's shimmering brunette hair, as green floral accents dotted atop an array of beiges and browns. She for all and intents and purposes, gave off the appearance of a down to earth 'flower child', which was apt, since there seemed to be what looked like magically self-sustaining flowers laced into the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl, for her part, subtlety gave an annoyed glare at her new 'father', as he stood back slightly to the left of the two other women. What she got back was an equally awkward half-grin, and a look that pleaded with her to 'bear with things' for just a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise darling, you're going to <i>love it</i> here. There's plenty of room around for you to play, there are servants to take care of your needs, and rest assured, I am the <i>finest</i> of cooks!\u201d Zalia was still in the afterglow of the realization that she and her husband had finally fulfilled their wish of having a family, and thought nothing of it, when 'Ivalia' held her perpetual grimace, as the dryadic woman placed an actual flower crown atop her head to complete the ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolan knew if he didn't get matters sorted soon, things were going to crash and burn quickly. He'd already had his face melted off once in his life. He didn't need his wife to help him experience it twice over. \u201cYes, about that dear! Do you think maybe you could whip something up real quick? I'm afraid 'Ivalia' here didn't get a chance to eat much of anything nutritious on the trip.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalia, in response, gasped. \u201cOh you <i>poor</i> thing! You stay with your father for just a few minutes, while I get you a nice lunch! Then we can discuss how you two met!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woodland woman sashayed her way downstairs, the regressed ruler swiftly turned her head towards the knight. \u201c<i>Golan</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I know!\u201d He responded, waving his hands defensively at the daggers being pointed at him. \u201cPlease, princess, you have to understand, it's a bit complicated!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care how complicated it is! I'm a <i>king</i>! I deserve to be treated better!\u201d She shouted as she pounded her foot on the wooden floor; incidentally bare by Zalia's choice. The older woman felt it completed the 'image' more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d Golan hushed, as he eyed the doorway for any signs of his wife. \u201cListen. Zalia is a lovely, <i>beautiful</i> woman, but she is <i>quite</i> emotional. It comes with the territory with her people, and her thinking I brought you as my adopted daughter, might very well have saved us from a month of drama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king turned 'princess' wasn't liking this. She wasn't liking this at all. But she somewhat understood the man's discomfort. Dealing with her wife while as a man was one of the biggest frustrations she had in her day to day life, and the thought of butting heads with her was one of the reasons she decided to go with Golan, rather than vie for trying to straight away retake the thrown while a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise you, if you can just hold on for a little bit, we can maybe ease her into the truth. Besides, right now isn't this a good thing?

The scouts say that she's trying to force Rilian into marrying her. They also say that the prince has gained a lot of weight, but the scouts also claim that Rilian looked like he was lifting some heavy weights the other day. They theorize that she may be gradually brainwashing him or he has developed Stockholm Syndrome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's preposterous! Rilian has been dead for two months! There's no damn way he's alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry sire, but they speak the truth. There's even a letter from Rilian stating that you should abdicate the throne immediately or else you'll be removed by high court order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see the damn letter! For years Rilian has been threatening my life! To him I'm a wicked, perverted, fool! The truth is Rilian is in his right mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar trembled in anger. It's true that Rilian saw his father as a danger to the kingdom. Secretly Ivar was relieved to hear that his eldest son was missing. Before he went off with an army Rilian threatened to expose his adulterous acts to the church. But now Ivar couldn't weasel his way out of this. Once Rilian shows up, yet fatter than when he first left Ivar knew he would have to answer for his abuse of power. Ivar slowly opens the letter/ To his surprise it wasn't very long. However, the message was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Father,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nduring my imprisonment in Erolus Princess Luna kept on insisting her that we wed. After getting to know her for two months we found that we both shared hatred toward your tyrannical rule. Your foolishness threatens the kingdom and must be put to an end. Once I return with my new fiance I'm going to have you face trial before you get banished forever. Enjoy your rule while you can <span class=\"cred\">traitor</span> for your treason against your own kingdom will not be tolerated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Son and Future King,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar exploded with anger after reading the letter. With the Prince Roberto arriving from Ordania tomorrow to marry Isabelle this was the worst new yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That definitely sounds like Rilian. Clearly we can scratch the idea of being brainwashed out the window. Prince Rilian wants revenge. We advised you to send a search party. Looks like the rumors about you, Ivar, are true.\" A nobleman said as he looked at the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard that he almost had sex with his own daughter. Incest has always been disapproved by the church. I can't believe he would stoop that low.\" Another noble said as he looked out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar was bubbling mad at this point. Already some of his men were going to betray him for Rilian. \"Enough! This is clearly some farce. There's no way Rilian would banish his father. I taught the boy everything he knows.\" Ivar said hoping that denial would bury this family issue under the rug. By trying to avoid family matters only caused one to arise. It was like the Goddess was punishing him for his sins. His Justice obsessed son was marrying a religious psycho. A psycho who's a sorceress. Ivar looked at the nobles. Many of them looked at him as if he were a criminal. Before Ivar could get back to a topic that didn't involve Rilian...</span></div></div>",

Tryzantium had been at war with the neighboring kingdom, off and on, for centuries. \"After they're wed, their delegation will negotiate a binding peace contract between our kingdoms-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- allowing us to redeploy our forces away from the Ordanian border, sweeping North to smash the Orcs advance-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- but only if the wedding goes ahead.

Tryzantium could scarce afford another war with Ordania, not with soldiers spread so thin already across the borders. \"This is magic, beyond my understanding.

Janus was re-securing the ties holding the skull's wrapping, and pocketing the item carefully. The Princess and the Count lay unmoving in the flower bed, their entwined bodies frozen in granite. Their heads were twisted towards Janus, expressions trapped forever somewhere between lust and surprise. They looked for all intents and purposes like statues, except for the finery they still wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a moment too soon,\" the King noted. The stone head of Count Bexley's penis was a hair's breadth from his daughter's petrified pussy. He knelt beside the count, staring into his eyes. \"Can he hear me in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are awake and aware, I'm afraid, however they are perfectly safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both hands, the King grappled with the statue's penis, levering his weight against it, and there was a sickening crack as it snapped away.

Her flesh and clothing were still formed of grey granite. His eyes wandered up the smooth stone of her thighs to the open, frozen vagina molded by the Goddess herself. He felt himself stirring and shook himself. Even trapped in stone, the holy fertility enchantment was working its magic on any man who came close. The longer he stood there, the more the blood continued to pour into his member until it hurt. If the Princess were to become a permanent fixture in his chambers for the next few days, Ivar would need a larger codpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated to even touch the petrified princess, cautious of what lustful magics might take hold of him, but it was necesary to check that she had not become damaged by those blundering fools. As he ran his hands over her head and face, his fingertips located a fracture. He pried his fingers into the fracture just a little and - horror of horrors - there came a cracking noise.

Being manhandled by those two servants had offered a moment's outlet for her endlessly mounting but constantly frustrated arousal, but now she found herself trapped far from any suitors in her father's quarters, physically damaged by his hands, and with the lust enchantment working overtime.</span></div></div>",

Night was beginning to fall as they were finally given justice out in the yard. Ivar waited until they stopped twitching and then turned in for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle corridors were darkening as he returned to his chambers. The Master of Lamps scurried about his business and the guards changed their watch. Isabella still lay where she had been left, her damaged face pressed into the worgen-pelt rug that lay before the fireplace. A servant had kindled the fire and the flickering light of the fire played over her naked form, casting into shadow the open hole between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his tired eyes. Naked? He could have sworn the statue was at least partially clothed before - the torn, petrified bodice was now nowhere to be seen. And did her breasts look to be bigger? They had been large before but now they were <i>huge</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic...\" he shook his head in dismay. Tearing his eyes away, he climbed into bed and settled into the quilts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed and turned fitfully for hours and the fire had burnt out before he was finally able to rest. His dreams were equally troubled. He dreamed he was young again, tearing across the battlefield, laying low his enemies with each powerful swing of his waraxe in the name of the Goddess. He had never felt so strong. As he killed the last of his enemies in personal combat, a golden light shone upon him. It was the Goddess herself, rewarding him for his zealotry! Instead of a battlefield, he was standing in a rose garden, and the soldiers and corpses that littered the ground were suddenly transformed into women, thousands of them, who gathered around, tearing off his clothes, washing away the blood and gore, kissing and caressing every inch of him. His dick grew hard, growing larger and larger... and larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stop!\" he pleaded, tears of pain welling in his eyes as his member continued to grow. It felt like it was going to explode. He tried to push the women away but they fought back, pinning him to the floor. His penis jutted into the air six... seven-feet high. He was getting so hard his penis felt like it was made of stone. In fact it was stone. He screamed in horror as his petrified member wobbled, toppled and came crashing down ontop of him, squashing him flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came away with a start, sweating heavily and tearing back the quilts. To his relief, he penis was neither 7-feet long nor made of stone, though it was still painfully engorged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky outside showed no pink of morning but he knew sleep was out of the question while that enchanted statue was still in the room. He would need to find some relief somewhere.</span></div></div>",

They lowered it with utmost care onto his workbench before backing away, wincing as they worked out the chaffing in their steel codpieces. The captain of the guard stood before him, pushing a severed stone nose into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This statue of the princess must be whole and pristine by the time of the royal wedding. Fix it and there will be a grand reward for you. Fail and the king will have your head!\" With that he turned to the guards, ushering them out. \"Come on, lads, we'll stop by a brothel on the way back to the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDag Caglayan stared at the nose dumbly. \"I-I am no wizard!\" he gaped. \"I can't make one piece of stone out of two!\" As he unfurled the statue, his worry deepened even further. The statue was a masterpiece. Even a craftsman of his caliber would struggle to craft such a lifelike work of art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he would have to. He could see where the statue has been damaged and his expert eye picked out a lacework of cracks running through the stone that would inevitable cause the head to crumble into chunks if he began to work on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were weeks yet till the wedding. He had time, if he didn't sleep and got some of the Guild boys to assist. He paced his workshop, selecting a block of unworked granite that matched the size of the Princess. Then picking up his hammer and chissel, he began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks past. Isabella lay in torment, only able to watch as the men of the Guild busied about her. Occasionally they would measurements from her and a few of the younger men groped and fondled her when the Master wasn't watching, but other than that she was forced to wallow in her frustrated desires and watch as their project took shape. <i>They're making a statue of me!</i> she realised one day. <i>But why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, there came the sound of merriment in the street outside. <i>It must be my wedding day!</i> she thought jubilantly. <i>Finally the wizard can free me from my prison and allow me to be with my beloved!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workshop was abuzz with men. They began to manhandle the statue replica of herself. They had done a very good job on it, she thought, it resembled her exactly - except for the nose of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heave ho, lads, the king needs it in time for the wedding,\" the Master barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workshop finally quiet, the Master rolled up his sleeves and turned to the original on the workshop. It was a tragedy to destroy such a masterpiece, he thought as he selected his tool, but he had a feeling it wouldn't end well for the king to find out that he switched the statues instead of repairing it. He selected a heavy iron hammer. For reasons he couldn't understand, his time around the statue of the princess had done wonders for his physique, filling out his aged frame with a great bulk of wiry muscle. He hoisted the hammer high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, stop! It's me! I'm the real Princess! Stop!</i> the Princess screamed as the hammer fell, shattering her beautiful head into fragments. Blow after blow snapped off her arms and legs and broke them to pieces until the only piece left of any size was her upper torso. Alone in his workshop, Dag Caglayan took a moment to fondle the exquisitely crafted breasts one last time. \"Such a pity...\" he sighed.</span></div></div>",

A lavender dress was laced tightly around his slender torso, girdled at the hips to emphasize the abundantly child-bearing properties of his curvaceous silhouette. Beneath his pettycoats, a pair of slim ankles fit into simple, soft leather slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand leaped to his breast, seeking out the comforting weight of the thick chains of milthril and gold that had hung around his neck ever since his coronation, familiar companions for over thirty years, yet they were gone, along with the vast wealth and absolute authority they represented. Only a delicate silver chain remained draped across his cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breasts were bountiful, threatening to spill over the neckline of the dress at any moment, the constraining material forcing the globes of pale flesh together and upwards, as if presenting them to onlookers for their consideration. As a man, such a sight would have made him cry tears of joy. As a woman, it was all he could do to choke back sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jowls and the double chin were gone. The features of his new face were strong and beautiful, none of the delicately refined features he so detested in the high born women, with a broad jaw, stern brows, and full lips. His dark hair had grown down to his waist and was tied back, and his crown nestled at a rakish angle upon it. He was relieved to see the crown still there, unchanged, though it was now far too big for his head. It hung down over one ear, threatening to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands sprang for a dagger which no longer existed. \"Wizard, what have you done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sire, I don't understand.. the Goddess... the blessing... this wasn't supposed to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right this wasn't supposed to happen,\" she roared. \"Turn me back <b>right now</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard sputtered weakly, wringing his hands within the sleeves of his robe. \"B...but I don't know how!

Their price then had been steep - the immediate cancellation of the marriage between Isabella and the Ordanian prince. It was then that Ivar realised the Church hadn't been blessing the union, they'd been trying to sabotage it, terrified of an Ordanian getting a claim to the throne through her daughter. Furious, she'd thrown the offer back in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Church wanted nothing more than control over the monarch. Should she arrive at their altar begging for her manhood back, they'd have her by the balls, able to demand any price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she could hardly afford to wait for Janus to correct his mistake. The King's absence would be swiftly noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer internal dilemma was rendered moot as Prince George seized her by the arm, pulling her from the wizard's study. As an old warrior of imposing stature, she found herself stunned at the ease with which he dragged her along, her feet slipping on the spiral staircase as she scurried to keep up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards watched them closely, Ivar in particular, as they moved through the palace towards the chapel, though the Prince's stature, regal clothing, and imperial air was enough to quiet any suspicion they might have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palace chaplain was a squat, mousy haired woman of middle age dressed in a humble, brown habit. She was busy renewing the candles at the altar, and gave a squeak of surprise at the sight of the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Prince Rilian, you return!\" Yet as they approached her, she shook her head. \"My apologies, for a moment there I thought... never mind.\" Now that she mentioned it, Ivar saw that there was a certain resemblance between Prince George and his lost brother. The same jaw that could break rocks, the same handsome features and cocksure grin. Had she not been his father, she might have made the same mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped up to the altar. The chaplain smiled warmly at Ivar, stretching out her arms as if to embrace her. \"Welcome, sister. And what brings you here today, in the company of so handsome a man.\" Her eyes flicked from the beautiful but evidently lowborn girl before her, to the noble gentleman beside her. She nodded sagely, her hands reaching out to caress Ivar's belly. \"Ah, I believe I see. Allow me to sooth your fears; you're not the first expectant young woman I've given a swift, private married.

As much as I would love a son and heir of your-\" Her eyes darted to the bulge between her daughter's legs. \"-impressive stature, I still intend to give you away to the Ordanians. Even if they are a country of boy lovers, they may object to receiving a man for a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like being a man, and I don't want to marry an Ordanian\" he sulked, his hands unconsciously sliding down to massage the massive horse cock tenting his trousers, staring openly at his father's swollen breasts. \"I don't want to marry anybody. I just want to... fuck. Can't you give them Emma instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do what with you?\" Ivar scoffed. \"I can hardly pull a fully grown son out of thin air and expect the realm to accept him, they'll only assume that you're a bastard. And if I told them the truth, that this-\" She gestured to the extent of his masculinity, her eyes wandering over the rippling muscle beneath his tunic. She found herself savouring the sight. \"-was the product of arcane interference, the Church would never let you sit the throne. Why else do you think I haven't pumped Edward full of magic? It could make him a man, sure, but an heir has to be free of magic's taint or the church won't crown him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they'll make an exception for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge scowled, sinking into a brooding silence. Ivar had seen that face before, Isabella always wore it when she didn't get her own way, right before she dug her heels in and made life hell for everybody else until they relented.

Among the upper hierarchy of the church the wearing of clothing was frowned upon and practically forbidden among those blessed directly by the Goddess herself since to conceal the beauty of the holy female form was an affront against the Goddess' greatest work. As such the Archmother was nude, covered only by the curtains of curly, snow white hair that hung down over her swollen breasts and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her age, Archmother Helena never looked a day older than her mid-thirties and she was always pregnant, a requirement of the title and an effect of the Bountiful Blessing that came part and parcel with it. An Archmother not with child was regarded as ill omen. With her left arm she cradled a baby to her breast, which gurgled and clung to her long tresses. She bounced it gently as she approached the king. A few tongues of holy flame leaped from her skin to lick around Ivar - they didn't burn, merely enveloped her in a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, all dimples and rosy cheeks. That's disconcerting, thought Ivar. She had dealt with this woman many times but not once been greeted with a smile, only suspicion and contempt. The church rarely had fondness for the king, for any king in fact, regarding them as violent patriarchal thugs, a blunt tool through which to extend their influence at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem, dearies?\" Helena cooed. \"The chaplain says you don't want a wedding, is that true?\" She looked the masculinised Isabella up and down, licking her lips. \"You're definitely sure about that? It only takes a minute. Oh, I do love a good wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time. No. Weddings,\" Ivar growled, leaping down from the altar. \"I am-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She-\" Isabella cut in loudly, \"-is nobody of importance.

You're a spoilt, greedy girl and I'll have you over my knee when this is done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I shall have your tongue cut out for speaking in such a way, maidservant,\" Isabella retorted, positioning himself between the Archmother and Ivar, who found herself backing away from the imposing figure, her backside pressed against the chapel's altar. She felt panic mixed with a strange parental pride. She had always hoped to sire an heir with the balls to seize the throne. She never expected it to be Isabella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar pulled the crown from atop her dark curls, waving it triumphantly. \"Does a maidservant wear a crown, Archmother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you are a maidservant and a thief!\" Isabelle lunged to grab it. Ivar was shocked at the fluidity with which her new body dodged away from her daughter's grasp, though the sudden movement left her fecund form jiggling. \"I caught her raiding the vaults, Archmother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the doing of my mage, Archmother! Speak with Janus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how she cavorts with wizards, Archmother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough from the pair of you!\" the Archmother's sharp tongue cut through them. \"You two had best stop squabbling right now, or neither of you will get to be king.\" The baby had begun to cry. She cooed and bounced the baby gently until its cries subsided before turning to Isabella. \"Isabella, I'm disappointed. You should know better than to try to try to lie to me. As your father said, you are no Prince Rillian. A convincing likeness, yes, enough to fool the common man no doubt, but you forget that I was there when his mother delivered him into this world, and I watched him grow, as I did you. He is as familiar to me as any of my own children.\" Isabella hung her head and mumbled an apology. Ivar shrank back as the withering gaze of the Archmother fell on her. She found herself being chided like a child caught playing in the mud. \"As for you, Ivar, how many times have I told you to stop associating with that wizard, to stop toying with unsanctioned magic that you neither understand nor control? But not only do you not listen, this time I find you trying to pervert Her very design. Your arrogance knows no bounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar ground her teeth. \"Save the sermon for Sunday, Archmother. Can you fix me or not?\"</span></div></div>",

Why won't perform such a simple task at hand? This kingdom is missing its king! What will they do without me? Surely you jest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmother cackled loudly. Realizing that this action caused the baby to cry again, the Archmother hurried to bounce the baby once again to calm the little child down, before turning to Ivar. \"I have heard various rumors about you, Ivar. Many rumors. I'll be frank with you. I have always had this sense of... nausea when dealing with you, and it looks like the rumors were true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar spat as she stated, whilst stomping her right foot, \"Rumors are simply that! They are nothing but the deceit and falsehoods of my enemies, jealousy that rampant all over the kingdom in regards to my glorious deeds.\" Ivar smirked, as she remembered carrying out capital punishment to all those who spoke ill of her, or rather him, when she was king. 'Wait,' she mentally thought, 'I still am king. This form will not prevent me from getting what I want from the Archmother!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmother scornfully looked at Ivar as she once again had to proceed to calm the little one down. Once finished, she turned back to Ivar before stating, \"Don't interrupt me. I haven't even finished my part yet. I don't mind your executions or your political rivalries or your personal statehood. Those matters are not of importance to the church. What does disturb me is your treatment of women!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ivar yelped, not expecting this change in pace. She was expecting the Archmother to disdain her for her corrupt policies or the execution of her rivals. Not this. What did she even do to women to deserve such disrespect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Archmother,\" protested Ivar, \"I haven't done anything that would result in poor treatment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchmother shook her head before replying, \"No, your current predicament is because of that. I have heard that you were preventing poor Isabella here from fornication with others. You should know that is a sin in front of the church. A woman's stomach must always be filled with life. I have also heard that you have been neglecting the Queen in that regard as well. So unless you learn to treat women with proper respect, you shall stay in this form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar's jaw nearly dropped as she heard Isabella giggling to her side, which was rather strange as Isabella was a man now. Quickly snapping her head and giving him a sharp look, Ivar turned to the Archmother while stuttering, \"B-but Archmother, I-I promise to reform. I-I will do my best if you just give me a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmother, while cradling the baby, seemed to ponder for a moment before replying, \"No, I cannot trust you to change your ways until you show me that you can. As soon as you deliver three children, I promise to return you to your former form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar nearly fell as her legs buckled. She could only stare at the Archmother as she heard Isabella laughing hysterically to her side. She didn't even have the strength to chastise her as she could only utter, \"B-but what about the kingdom? And Isabella's marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmother smiled, \"Surely you have not left heirs behind for nothing, have you? Prince Edward shall do the trick. In fact, maybe you should even retire and leave him the kingdom whole. As for the marriage with the King of Ordania, I'm sure that he hasn't <i>actually</i> seen the princess, has he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar paled at the suggestion. He knew what the woman was implying. But he couldn't bring himself to actually believe that the Archmother said it. She certainly wasn't going to walk up to the future King like some harlot and devote herself to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmother continued, \"Fortunately, only a part of the Goddess' blessing inhabits you - a part of it is still left in Isabella here. So you should be able to retain your innocence until the marriage... I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar growled as he stated, \"Fine! I'll resolve this problem by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar stomped out of the church with Isabella following suit, as the wails of a crying baby filled the room behind. Marching through the street, she didn't notice how observers sneaking peeks at her wonderful bosom and her childbearing hips. Leaning in, Isabella whispered, \"Father, shouldn't we take the carriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Ivar snorted as she continued onward, \"Pay them no heed, they won't recognize us anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the two got back to the royal palace, Isabella asked him cautiously, \"So father, what are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar only had a moment's hesitation before replying...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't be pregnant!!\" The very idea was offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as he approached her, she seemed to slow down. As if she were moving through treacle. The king's eyes darted about, even she was affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a powerful magic, she saw that even the flames of the candle were flickering more and more slowly before stopping. She saw that the chaplain was frozen in place. Turning to see if Prince George was seeing the same thing, she saw that he too was still as a statue. One hand indecorously adjusting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertainly he reached out and touched his newest son... but nothing happened. He remained in the same pose, with a warmth in his skin he felt sure that was a good sign... and she dearly needed a good sign right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to admit it, but he was terrified. What would he do if this never ended. He turned to run from the little chapel, his eye spotting a feather hanging motionless in the air. Perhaps.... just perhaps Janus hadn't been affected by ... by whatever this was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wished that there was a little less motion from her own body, as her cleavage shifted when she turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching up the aisle to the exit, her stomping transformed into a strut. It wasn't a conscious choice, it just came naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>I haven't dismissed you, girl</b></i>.\" a voice boomed behind the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girlish squeak came from her as she whirled back around. She wasn't prepared for what she saw there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging in the air above the altar was the glowing outline of a female figure. As King Ivar watched, she fell to her knees. The outline filled in, with tones and shades. However, the face remained stubbornly blank. The light was the brightest there, as the King squinted, her arm raised uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess...\" he stammered uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have offended my with your rejection of my blessing. Princess Isabella would have been a good consort, moderating her husband in the difficult times ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar made to start talking, but her reasons felt like excuses under the harsh light of the Goddess. Her lips moved silently, before she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But such blessings should not be lightly removed. I have changed your history, Ivar.\" Her voice was firm daring her to even challenge a Goddess for the limits of her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have changed, George's too. The palace chaplain's unexpected wisdom has merit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar shuddered, he really didn't fancy the idea of pregnancy as her punishment. \"Please....\" she started, overcoming her terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish woman... a child only comes from love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King fell silent again, whatever her punishment, she breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suit being on your knees, girl. Besides, it is appropriate in to show respect to royalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly Prince Rilian has returned... and just in time too. The kingdom was in danger with the absence of the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!!!\" her bluster undermined by coming in such whiny tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a weight vanish from her head, as the crown turned to smoke and vanished, leaving behind only long cascades of raven hair. It didn't stay missing for long. Before Ivar's eyes it reformed above Rilian's head, settling onto his lush manly locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... <b><i>Ivana</i></b>...\" she pronounced the King's new name clearly. \"You have to perform an act of penance, to regain your status.... and throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess cast her arms forward, and a golden glow spread outwards from her fingers, encircling and cocooning the kneeling figure. </span></div></div>",

Because of this, you have been chosen to take her place.\"  Ivana gestured to the returned Prince, no, King Rilian.  \"The King was decided to marry off his most beautiful sister, Ivana to the prince of Ordania by weeks end.  By the stroke of midnight on your wedding day I shall decide if you have truely repented and give you back your crown, your lost son, and keep the alliance with Ordania in tact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden aura suddenly turned into a dark crimson, \"However if you fail to go through with the marriage, if you fail to keep you newly found virginity in tact, or if you simply fail to learn any lesson from this, you shall have this form forever and I shall make the blessing upon you into a curse.  You will have many children for the rest of your days and each childbirth will be more painful and excruciating than the last.  You shall lose your status as royalty and be cast out to spend the rest of your days as a commoner.  Heed my warning and do not fight against this.\"  The light turned gold again as the Goddess' voice became almost too soft and sweet, \"After all, it is a blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime unfroze around Ivana as her long lost son and now King Rilian gave her and Prince George a warm embrace.  \"Brother!  Sister!  I came back the second I heard of father's passing.  I went to the church first thing in order to go through the coronation so that our country still has a king and stays strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was stunned and simply said, \"...Brother?\"  While Ivana felt tears falling down her face.  Some of them were from the overwhelming feeling of terror at what the Goddess had just declared, but mixed in were tears of joy at seeing her son (well, now brother) again.  Ivana's voice cracked as she said, \"Rilian.\"  And returned the embrace 10 fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian laughed, \"It is good to see you too sister.  And don't worry.  Just because father is gone does not mean things need to change.  You will still be married to the prince of Ordania by the end of the week to make a great peace between our nations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge simply looked even more confused, \"What?\"  Apparently the Goddess had not spoken to him about the situation.  Ivana broke up the silence by saying, \"You should go see your mother Rilian.  She will be very pleased to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall go now.  We've got a very important week ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do.\"  Ivana said and grabbed Georges arm to lead him out of the church.  Ivana knew that if she was going to get through dealing with the Goddess' blessing she would need help, and the only person who might be able to help him now who wasn't affected by the change to reality was George.  So Ivana explained to George what the Goddess had said to her about having to go through with the marriage, keeping her virginity, and learning some sort of lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all of this happens, I everything goes back to normal.  I will be King, you will be a princess and married to the Ordanian prince, and Rilian will even be back.  Now Isabella, I mean George, you must help me.\"</span></div></div>",

Your ears strain to hear any minute noise. Even here, in your private sanctum, you feel that your wife or her spies are somehow watching. There have been times when you swear you hear creaking of floorboards from <i>within</i> the walls, or that the eyes upon the tapestry are turning to follow you around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today you hear or see nothing that could suggest eavesdroppers. You slip a simple wooden locket from your pocket and flick it open. Inside is coiled a lock of golden hair. Gently you lift it out, twisting the beautiful strands over your old war-callused fingers, smelling the sweet fragrance. Your lecherous mind conjures the image of the amorous young scullery maid when which the lock came, skin smooth as milk, a body like a ripe peach. You had met only briefly. There had been time only for a few stolen kisses and hastily uttered sweet nothings, but it left you wanting more. Today you will get more. That will be your reward for being such a responsible ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing back your chair and striding across the room, you throw open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere, my Lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard outside the door stands to attention. You don't recognise him. He is fresh-faced and eager. Without a word, you stomp past. The guards footsteps keep pace with your own. \"Why are you following me? What are you doing?\" you snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives a smile with the faintest hint of a sneer. \"Guarding you, my Lord. I am a <i>guard</i> after all. Wherever you go, it is my duty to escort you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today. This is a private matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private matter or not, sire, orders are orders. It is for your own safety after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Orders'? 'Orders'?! I am king! My command overides your 'orders', as you should damn well know! How long have you worked here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quite a while, sire! At least two weeks!\" he beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is on kingsguard duty after two weeks! Then you notice it-  the silver ankh of the Goddess hanging on a chain around his neck - and you understand. This man is a spy. You've long suspected your wife of sneaking her own agents into the castle guard. Their eyes are everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be easy enough to dismiss this guard, yet to do so would only confirm your wife's suspicions that you were hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering, you turn around and storm back to your office, slamming the doors behind you. The guard returns on the other side of the door. Somehow you must give this young lad the slip.</span></div></div>",

Something which really shouldn't be moving. Your gaze is drawn to the large oil painting that hangs above the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting had been given as a present by your wife some months ago, and was one of those that gives you an uneasy feeling, as if the eyes are always following you around the room. Once you had even removed it from the wall to check that there weren't eye holes drilled into the wall behind but had eventually been forced to concede that your old mind was playing tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt depicts - or rather would normally depict - the nude figure of a woman astride a white horse, being made to ride through the streets of the city with only her long hair to shield her modesty, as the crowds heckled and leered at her. It was a scene from the old story of Lord Godiva who, as the story went, had once been a cruel man who taxed his domain harshly, that was until the day that he was tricked and transformed by his wife into the form of a young woman and made to take a walk of shame before his subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg/1280px-Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday however, the painted figure of Godiva is not sat inanimate upon her horse. She is moving. You watch, stunned, as she tosses a cigarette down onto the cobbled street and scrambles to pull herself back into the saddle, but without stirrups she loses her grip and lands hard on her backside. She glances back over her shoulder and out of the painting, her eyes going wide in terror to see you storming across the room towards the fireplace. \"Shit!\" she cries and tries to run, only to hit the edge of the painting as if colliding with an invisible wall. She dives beneath the horse's red and gold coat, out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sorcery is this!\" you bellow, tearing the painting from the wall. \"Spies everywhere, hiding in plain sight! Even the walls have ears. Come out from there, you nasty little eavesdropper, there's no hiding now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painted figure continues to cower. You give the painting a violent shake and she is thrown back into view, only to scurry back into hiding. \"What are you and who put you up to this? It was my wife, wasn't it!\" The painted Godiva is now cursing loudly as you hurl her from side to side, knocking her against the confines of the frame. \"Well if you wont speak, it's on the fire for you. I'll look forward to watching you burn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you shove it on the fireplace. The flames lick at the canvass, and the woman screams as growing black spots begin to eat through her world. \"Not like this! I'll talk. I'll talk!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop the smouldering painting on the hearth. She sits huddled in one unburnt corner, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you were right,\" she grumbles. \"Queen Helena put me in here. She had me repainted to look like this bitch. Said it'd just be for a few days. That she'd let me out when I found out who you were fooling around with.\" She glares at you. \"You were supposed to hang me in the bedroom, damn it, where the action is. Not the study. I don't even know how long I've been in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back. It had been your birthday that you received the gift. \"Seven months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven months of sitting on a horse... No wonder my ass is sore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much have you told her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I swear. I've got nothing to tell her. Every day I just see you come in here and stamp parchmentwork. She barely even checks in on me anymore. Hell, it's been weeks since I saw her last, she probably forgot about me for all I know. Look, I don't even want to work for her anymore. I just want to go home to my wife and kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"'Wife', eh? So who were you before you came to hang over my fireplace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painted woman gives a slight bow of her head. \"Agent Veeto, at you service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Veeto...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fine, frosty morning in the dead of winter and Ivar stood in the courtyard, eager to depart. A light snow had fallen during the night, which would make the stags all the easier to track. Not to mention he loved the sight of the sprays of crimson against the sheets of white. Why, he would probably be able to follow them just on the clouds of steam from their mouths, he thought, as his breath hung about him in the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling from around his fingers were four horse shoes. \"The day is young and I wish to depart! Where is my horse? She is late!\" Ivar growled aloud to himself. \"A horse! A horse, my kingdom for- ah, here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain of the guard pushed open the gate of the courtyard - behind him trudged several dozen men, some in guard uniform, others still wearing pajamas and grumbling as though recently kicked from their bunks. With a harsh bark, the captain ordered them to stand in a line, which they did, sluggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped up to the king, a young man followed him, staggering a little as though inebriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies for the delay, sire. Your, ah, horse was having a late one night. She's a little worse for wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar clucked his tongue, his eyes flashing angrily at the younger guardsman. \"<i>Was</i> she now? Drinking a little too deeply from the trough, was she?! This displeases me!\" He approached the guard, stretching his eyelids to examine the bloodshot eyes. He could smell the ale on the boy's breath. \"Just because my horse is drunk does not mean she shall avoid the crop! In fact I will see fit to whip your flanks all the harder for it!\" He turned to the guard captain. \"And where is Epona's other half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I do not know, my lord. I could not find her. It is possible she was also out drinking last night. However, any of these others cadets will surely suffice. I have assembled the hardiest and fastest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be the judge of whether they will suffice or not,\" Ivar said quietly before indicating to the captain to strip the men. Somewhat confused but nonetheless awed in the presence of their king, the men quickly doffed their armour, civvies or pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About face!\" Ivar barked. The men spun on their heels, some a little drunkenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar paced up and down the row of men, examining them, as their naked bodies shivered and steamed in the cold. Occasionally he would stop to grip the calves of one, or the thighs of another, or to squeeze the buttocks of a particularly fine specimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent musculature on this one!\" he declared aloud eventually, as both of his hands squeezed the iron-hard buttocks of guardsman #32. \"Wonderfully long legs!  Healthy skin tone! She's a beauty alright! She'll make a fine addition to my stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away, Ivar set the horseshoes on the cobblestones. Epona #1 had done this before and knew exactly what to do. He stepped forward quickly to stand with his bare feet on the front horseshoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Ivar barked at the one he had just selected, pointing at the read horseshoes.  Confused, the man stepped into them. \"Grab her waist, girl!\" the king bellowed impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man at the rear nervously reached forward and gripped the waist of the man in front. Immediately the shoes began to glow brightly. The young man nearly jumped out of his skin but, alas, he was unable to jump out of the horseshoes, which now appeared to be glued to his feet. Furthermore, his hands were glued to the man in front. He began to tug at his fingers, but they had begun to fuse with the skin below. The flesh of his hands began to liquify and pour into the other man's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Epona certainly sounds spirited today, sire,\" the captain of the guard ventured nervously, as the screams of the man at the back filled the courtyard. Ivar shot him a sharp look.  The man's arms had now fused almost entirely with the back of the other man, dragging his face ever closer. His screams were cut short as his head turned to fleshy goo, and fused with the spine in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick, red hair was sprouting all along the length of this fused entity, while the human musculature swelled into that of a horse. As the spell went on, they resembled less and less two men, and more and more a single horse, a statuesque mare of noble proportions. The front man's skull cracked loudly as his face was pulled into the long snout, a huge horsey tongue spilling out of the mouth before it had a chance to resize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an excellent solution to the problem of training the King's horses, who he tended to grow bored of after a few uses. Instead of training the horses, they could simply make them out of the excess guardsman sitting around the castle. Ivar had requested Janus to handle it, and the stable was now fully stocked with all manner of enchanted horse-shoes, saddles, bits, and skinsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Epona was complete. She staggered a little, her hooves clopping on the cobbles. Her rear half didn't quite seem to be playing ball, moving out of synch with her front as though trying to pull herself away, her tail swishing in agitation. It wasn't unusual for the rear to take a while to adapt - the loss of sight meant they have to soon learn to surrender control to the front half. It was nothing that a few sharp strikes from a crop wouldn't sort out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stableboys rushed forward with saddle and bridle, and began to make her ready. Ivar...</span></div></div>",

So far Ivar had encountered nothing but squirrels. For a typical day of hunting Ivar hasn't been having any luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! The forest is awfully quiet for today. After searching for a few hours we ought to have found something by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, you spent a majority of the morning trying to kill your son, Edward. Your daughter Emma then threatened to slit your throat the next time you laid a hand on her younger twin. On top of that you had to order some of the female guards you hired to take Isabelle to her room so she wouldn't assault some merchant. Do I need to mention that Anders almost lit the stable on fire.\" the huntsman with Ivar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get your point, Joshua. If you speak to me like that again I will personally rip out your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Hopefully we can find something.The sooner we can get a few deer or something the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a few moments Ivar saw some bushes rustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Now to catch whatever lurks behind those bushes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ivar could ready his bow, whatever was hiding in the bushes decided to attack. The assailant was some sort of weird creature. Before Ivar could get a glance at it the creature quickly bites Ivar's hand. The creature had moved with such amazing speed that Ivar couldn't defend himself. Just as fast the creature had made itself known it darted off towards the west. The most disturbing thing though that the creature had an evil cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that thing! I had never seen anything like it! Looks like we got a pest to... Awgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar starts doubling over in pain. He then passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it! The king's been poisoned!\" One huntsman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's the case, Jerome. It looks like he has some sort of disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say, Josh. The king looks like he's in some sort of delirium. Maybe if he dies one of us could become king. All one of us would have to do is marry one of his daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts! Ivar would pluck out our eyes, chop off our crotches, or have Janus turn us into animals. Just last week Simon was turned into a cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point, yet I just wish he would of sent a search party for Rilian. He might have united the kingdom, but his corruption is slowly destroying the very kingdom that he unified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Joshua could answer another huntsman pierces Jerome through the chest with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you speak of such treason. Die you foul mouthed gossip. No one will miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerald! Why did you kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just doing my job. A job that you should have done. Instead you entertained the words of a traitor. That is also unforgivable. However, I decided to spare your life. I cannot carry King Ivar back to the wizard on my own. His belongings and kingly figure are too much for one man to carry. If it was just him I should be fine. Now grab his gear and meet me in the medical bay in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dang, Gerald didn't really have to do that. I would of talked some common sense into Jerome, but alas. The king is now ill with a disease from a creature that no one has seen before. Hopefully we can cure the king. With Rilian still missing none of Ivar's male heirs being acceptable substitutes. Isabelle is too much of a pervert to rule, but Emma could pull it off. But such thoughts are not to be spoken aloud.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald and Joshua take Ivar back to the castle. They immediately have Janus give medical aid. It wasn't until three hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's waking up! Sire, do you remember what the creature looked like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar mumbles a few incoherent words. \"I... I think I may remember. The creature was quite large. It was definitely an anthro. I believe the sun was setting when it attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, what you described is none other than a werebeast. Werebeasts are cursed to transform each night to transform into a beast. However, the transformation isn't always stable. Was it a werewolf or some other werebeast? Tell me sire.\" Janus said as he held his wand up to his king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threaten to kill me without proving that I was attacked by a werewolf or whatever that thing was. Yet somehow he seemed familiar. I can't put my finger on it, but whoever that beast was I'm going to kill him! I don't even care if he's a trusted ally or possibly my lost son Rilian. I will have that monster's head on a silver platter.\" Ivar growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry milord. It's just that we have to take precautions. If we can't cure you than we will have no choice, but to kill you if you turn into a werewolf or any other kind of werebeast. If you don't become a lycanthrope we'll have to study you to see what affects that creature's bite has on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar ponders it over for a moment. \"Fine, but let me know if you find something on that creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the outskirts of the city a man and woman meet under the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do the job, darling?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did as you instructed me. Now when can I go free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet my love. Remember that you are my prisoner until you accept my hand in holy matrimony. Also we must see that Ivar suffers. Soon he'll look like what he is on the inside... a beast beyond reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, he must suffer for what he did to me. He must pay for his treason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman steps into the full ray of the moon's light. The woman is a tall red head. Her red hair blows in the breeze. Her blue eyes give off a cold yet peaceful glimmer. The man's identity remains obscurred by the hood over his head. His attire is that of a noble or knight. The pair gazes off into the night as their plan unfolds.</span></div></div>",

Staring with furrowed brow into the dying embers of the fire, he dreamed of glories past. He remembered fondly the forging of his Empire, the wicked villains and archenemies he had vanquished, and the loyal friendships he had forged along the way. His knights... The men and women who had fought side by side with him with the vigor, strength and hope of youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of those friends were gone now - retired, infirm or dead. Not even glorious deaths either, for some of them. Kremir Dualforce had tripped over a spellbook and tumbled from the window of his tower. Edirix the Teethtaker had pulled her back out at the age of 45 attempting to lift that vast two-handed greataxe of hers - bedridden until infection took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar stared at the pudgy sausage-like fingers of his hands. He missed the days when they had been caloused, strong and bloody. Now they were discoloured only by the splotches of ink from signing so many royal decrees! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kingdom that he had reforged was stable and secure, yet it seemed a hollow victory now. Peace had robbed him of his purpose. Oh, how he wanted to feel that youthful vigor again. To be an adventurer!

The diminished embers of the fireplace burst into life as he did so, burning a multitude of colours, sending rainbow light across the walls.

Something about the chords he chose must have been special, Ivar thought, as just the slightest sound evoked emotions of joy, or sorrow, or heroism within his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddoros performed a deep, acrobatic bow, the feathers of his cap jiggling merrily as he did so. \"Addoros Gladdenhart, at your service,\" he said, his voice a melody. \"And you must be?\" he added with a wry wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar chuckled. \"You know very well who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddoros grinned perfect, pearly teeth. Several women in the neighboring rooms swooned, though they knew not why. \"King Ivar, I know who you are. Yet I do not know who you <i>might</i> be.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Tales?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do indeed,\" said Addoros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his jerkin, he produced five scrolls sealed with a curious, glittering wax. The light of the room seemed to grow dimmer until it only the scrolls seemed to be illuminated. A hush fell. Even the eyes of the portrait of the Queen seemed to strain closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddoros whispered, though his voice filled the room. \"The bardic colleges tell wondrous tales of the heroes of yore. It is our stock in trade. Of course, all know that not anybody has a story - only a chosen few rise to be heroes. But what most people don't know is that some <i>stories</i> do not have any <i>body</i> to tell them. Tales just waiting to be told. Tales without a hero...yet. Locked within each of these scrolls is the destiny of a hero. Some great.\" He gave a slight shrug. \"Some not so great perhaps,\" he added in smallprint, his whisper no longer seeming to echo and boom on the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on Tamoria do you find such things?\" Ivar gasped in wonder, his fingers itching to tear open all five of the scrolls at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our secrets are our own, even to you, King. Some say that they are prophecies that have existed too long and become tired of waiting. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Others say that the Bardic Colleges track down promising heroes-and-villains-to-be and pay them large sums of gold to give up their destinies so that we can sell them on for massive profits to rich folk who want a lark</font>. Who can truly say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddoros watched as the King's fingers reached out, gliding over each scroll, unsure which to chose. \"Each of these will make me a hero again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hero? Villain? They will give you a destiny, a part to play in the theater of the gods. Perhaps your part will be grand, perhaps it will be more of a ... side character in the tale. Either way, you will play the part until the destiny is fulfilled, upon which you will become King Ivar once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's hand withdrew a little. \"But if I can't fulfill the destiny asked of me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would an adventure be without a little risk?\" said the bard with a reassuring strum of his harp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to restrain himself anymore, Ivar snatched up one of the scrolls, tearing open the wax seal. A flicker of light burst from the scroll and sank into his chest as he unfurled the parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text was small, ornate and spidery. An entire hero's tale written in tiny, dense script upon the scrap of parchment. With his aging eyes, it was hard to make out the writing but the name at the top of the scroll was legible enough...</span></div></div>",

Maidenlight?\u201d Ivar\u2019s blank look of confusion slowly turned into a rakish grin. \u201cAh, a good name for a ladies man; cavorting around taverns, wooing women. A fine destiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Palseya is Erolusian for \u2018beautiful flower,\u2019 I believe.\u201d Addoros helpfully added, a small smile on his face.  And her gods would brook no sleeping around, I do believe. Or drinking. Oh, and mixed fabrics are a big no-no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvars smile slid off his face. \u201cDid you say he\u2014<i>ughluph</i>\u201d He collapsed forward in pain, clutching his stomach. The legs that he was kneeling upon began to shift, liver spots fading as skin became pale and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the tears of pain clouding his eyes, Ivar could spy the face of the bard peering at him. \u201cMy liege, I must say, I didn\u2019t expect you to take the Tale so poorly. Though come to think of it, it was quite painful for the original Palseya herself \u2014 I suppose losing and gaining the favor of the gods is a painful affair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 bastard\u2026\u201d choked Ivar. But the insult sounded feeble, its bite dulled by his new musically pitched voice. His gaze dropped down to his tingling hands; the pudgy, wrinkled digits were tapering down into long, smooth fingers \u2014 the kind that would be delicately crossed in a lady\u2019s lap, or demurely extended for a noble to kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddoros opened his mouth in mock shock. \u201cBut, my king, I\u2019ve given you exactly what you wished for! A hero\u2019s destiny and life \u2014 and all the trials and tribulations that come with it. Being a virgin priestess is hard work after all. Palseya couldn\u2019t take it herself; she actually sought out one of our members, begging to be released from her duty. Last time we saw her, she was off to some bordello with her newfound gold. The poor dear probably hadn\u2019t been touched since the day she was born.\u201d He sniffled dramatically, dabbing at his eye with a silken handkerchief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar merely grunted in response, the mounting pressure in his body taking the larger part of his attention. The wizened muscles in his arms and legs dwindled to nothing, leaving only the accumulated fat from years of sedentary rule. But that too changed in the coming seconds, his limbs dissolving into soft little things, unsuited for slaying even the most feeble monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprised \u2018Oh!\u2019 and the sound of tearing paper drew Ivar\u2019s gaze back to Addoros. The bard was holding a scrap of glittery paper. The rest of the was dancing around the room in miniature scraps, their backs as white as the locks dropping into Ivar\u2019s eyes. The rest of the hair bunched up inside the king\u2019s crown, which hung loosely on his diminished skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just help you out there.\u201d the bard chirped, lifting the crown up and off of Ivar\u2019s head, sending a cascade of snowy hair down his back. With a quick flourish, the crown disappeared from his hands. \u201cPayment for services rendered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat cwown is a welic of the\u2014\u201d Ivar stopped short to spare himself some dignity \u2014 and to let his lips swell to the same girth. \u201cThat crown is the Royal Family\u2019s, <i>bard</i>,\u201c he eventually spat. \u201cIt is not for commoners to toy with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, my dear Palseya,\u201d Addoros smirked. \u201cI just thought to lessen the burden on your sainted head. Yours is a great calling, after all \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even allowed to read your Tale.\u201d He flounced a hand at the flurry of paper dancing around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026  call me\u2026 that\u2026!\u201d Ivar gasped, pushing himself to his feet with a heroic effort; his new feet weren\u2019t suited to carrying his substantial paunch. \u201cYou will change me back\u2026 or I will \u2014 <i>Ahhnn</i>~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warbling moan escaped his lips as the pressure crescendoed to a climax of pleasure, not even noticing the great force constricting his every inch. Ivar\u2019s belly shrank along with his \u2018kingly rod\u2019, leaving behind the smooth core and unplucked flower of a model priestess. Shoulders pulled inwards and shrank, loosening his robes. At the same time, his hips burgeoned outwards into pelvis-defining curves, the alluring shape serving alongside the rush of feminine fat to his thighs and rear to cinch his pantaloons to the brink of tearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure and changes concluded as a pair of breasts asserted themselves on his chest. Ivar was left half-crouched on the floor, sweat beading on every inch of his new pale skin and hot breath escaping his mouth in aggravatingly high coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see that everything is in order, my lady.\u201d Addoros\u2019 voice rang out, laden with false courtesy. \u201cI was half-worried the Tale may not take, but it seems it has agreed quite well with you.\u201d The scraps of paper framing his face began to curl and blacken, burning in an otherwise-impalpable fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will hunt you down to the ends of any land, you thrice-damned pissant, flay turn your flesh into a <i>slurry</i> unless you turn me back! <b>Right. <i>NOW</i></b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bard covered the center of his wide grin with a single finger. \u201cMy my, so angry. But you shouldn\u2019t speak that way at that volume in the chambers of the king; I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s missing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar\u2019s face purpled with rage as his clothes writhed and shifted: His pants split in two at the thigh, the cloth of the legs unwrapping themselves into lookalike ribbons. They coiled itself around his feet like twin snakes, forming footwraps that anchored themselves securely in the cushiony flesh of his thighs. The remaining fabric paled into a bright shade of white, curling itself around his pelvis and rear, sending a chill through the uncovered portion of his upper legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis robes underwent a similar metamorphosis, the hem of the royal attire creeping up ribs whilst the cloth in the front and back of the garment remained static. Ivar let out an undignified squeal as his jerkin vanished, exposing the curve of his breasts for all to see. Frustratingly, the twin curtains narrowed in width, baring more of his sweat-slick skin to the cold air. It was cold comfort when the wide circle of leather that formerly served as a belt softened into satin and bound the two drapes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tfHRFiD.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/tfHRFiD.jpg</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you dress me like a <b><i>whore</i></b>?!\u201d Ivar shrilled, balking when his chest threatened to wobble out of its precarious position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite the opposite, my dear.\u201d Addoros wagged a didactic finger at the crouched king. \u201cThose are the traveling raiments of an Erolusian priestess. They protect the poor dears from being accosted by brigands \u2014 save those with a death wish. Not many thieves want to bring the wrath of the gods upon their heads, after all. I like to call them look-but-don\u2019t-touch togs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chuckle was low and loud, and all the more infuriating to Ivar. He tried to stand up; to beat the bard with infirm arms, to call the guards to rip him apart, to do <i>anything</i>, but all strength had deserted him. \u201cI\u2019ll have you hanged\u2026\u201d was the only thing he could mutter out as he collapsed to the floor, eyes flickering between open and closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my, someone looks tired. Don\u2019t worry, dear, I\u2019ll tell the guards that the king is sleeping \u2014 give you\u2026\u201d Ivar could see the tall figure astride the hearth produce, check, and return an object from its belt in one smooth motion. Gravity pulled down his eyes once again  \u201c...four or so hours to sashay out of here after your little catnap. You\u2019d probably have the run of the castle: No one\u2019d suspect the pure little priestess of wrongdoing, after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar lightly flinched as the bard bent over his prone form. Gods, he just felt\u2026 vulnerable. But there was no attack against his unprotected body; instead, a  low whisper echoed in his ear: \u201cI\u2019d call them normally \u2014 dramatic escapes are just <i>grand</i> for an opening chapter \u2014  but I imagine the deck is stacked against you already. Good luck with the Tale, dear!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe (former) king could hear, but not see, the familiar creak and slam of the chamber doors through closed eyes. With a legendary effort he opened his eyes; just in time to spy a white scrap of paper fluttering down in front of his eyes. The short snippet, \u2018________\u2019 was all he knew as he tumbled into the warm embrace of sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivar lay, twitching and moaning softly, lost in a troubling dream. In the dream, he was trying desperately to chase down a slip of parchment upon which was written '<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">King Ivar</span>'. Every time he grew close, a gust of wind would whip it further away, accompanied by a single high chord. His body betrayed him, growing weaker and wearier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as his fingers closed around the paper, it was torn away once more, landing lightly in the outstretched hand of a peacock-coloured bard, the Royal Crown atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar awoke with a start in his chambers, dimly illuminated by the late evening light. The fire was dead. He had slept for hours, as the bard had predicted, though, from his snowy hair to his dainty toes, his body still trembled and ached with the fatigue of being forced into the shape of a young maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPained mewls emerging from his lips with every laboured movement, Ivar dragged himself towards the mirror. He needed not to confirm the truth (a single glance downwards would have confirmed everything, nor was it possible to ignore the feel of the carpet beneath his heavy breasts), but he hoped there might be some aspect of the man he had been remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment, he stared into the face of the young Priestess, recognising nothing. His eyes drifted over her form. She was young, only an acolyte most likely, and beautiful - yet he felt no stirring of arousal within him at the sight of the nubile, vulnerable maiden before him. Even more than the change, that troubled him. Not only was his manhood gone, but his most basic, basest male urge along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Have I become a maiden, not just in body but in mind too?</i> he shuddered, turning away from the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bard had implied he should escape, lest he himself be implicated in his own disappearance! Could he reason his way out of this? The Church and the Crown had always been in opposition to each other - what would his own Lords make of him, if a woman of the cloth was found at the scene of his vanishing? They would hang him for regicide no doubt. What would the clergy make of him, if they discovered one of their own in such a state within the King's chambers? They would have him stripped and whipped through the streets as a harlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mahogany chest of drawers beside the bed, there was always kept a Draught of Vigor for when the King needed a little materia medica mid-conquest. He dragged himself there, and slid open the lowest drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of his own undergarments, Ivar's stomach turned, bile rising to his throat. The piles of crumpled off-white britches, pantaloons, and unwashed codpieces filled him with a new, strange revulsion. Though they had been his own mere hours ago, now they seemed unclean things. Soiled things undeserving of touching his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside those feelings, he plunged his hand into the garments. His stomach knotted in disgust, as if he was elbow-deep in worms, but his fingers closed around the glass phial. He ripped his arm out as fast as he could, shaking with exertion and repulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the gods had Virgins with a capital V among their clergy, girls chosen before puberty to be sworn to nothing but their faith. They were made to swear vows of lifelong celibacy, trained and groomed to reject all matters of the flesh. Their purity and innocence was sacred - any sign of them straying from such a path would be punished severely until their chastity became second nature to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Palseya Maidenlight been one of these sacred Virgins? Had her church trained such a rejection of matters of the flesh into her that she was physically nauseated by physical proximity to such things? Was that training so ingrained that it was now in him too? A disturbing thought indeed... Ivar took a glance at the drawer of underwear, pressing a dainty hand to his full lips as the bile rose once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if the gods wished him to remain a virgin maiden, on that they could agree at least! Ivar certainly had no intention of giving his unplucked flower to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Draught fizzed once the cork was popped. He downed the liquid within the phial and slumped back against the bed. After a few moments, he felt energy re-enter his chest and flow out to his limbs. Though still weak, he could stand without his knees knocking together with exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

He brushed a few locks of sweat-damp hair from his forehead, only to have them fall down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d he muttered, gradually shifting his weight from the bedpost to his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking came easier than he expected, but it contained unexpected challenges. His stride had to be short, lest he wanted his pelvis to be exposed to the cold air. But besides his burgeoning sense of modesty, the small steps forced his soft thighs to rub against one another with every step. This wasn\u2019t particularly striking in and of itself\u2014 the king had been living in that reality for fifteen-odd years \u2014 but it unveiled another distressing reality to the king:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was, simply put, weak. Even after years of sedentary life on the throne, his strength hadn\u2019t quite deserted him. He could heft the greatsword used for knighting ceremonies \u2014 albeit with both arms \u2014 and pull back a longbow (On a good day). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his thin arms were soft and untoned, and his chest and rear oscillated whenever he made a movement, not a trace muscle to hold them firm. <i>It\u2019s not even the mark of a glutton,\u2019</i> he desponded. \u2018<i>Just the body of a girl who never worked a day in her life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar set his face and shook his head to clear his thoughts. Twenty minutes in this form and he was already concerned with his body's shape! But there was a point in considering it; he would not be able to rely on Palseya\u2019s strength to overcome any challenges. Only cold steel could help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cast a forlorn gaze at the aged battleax hanging a few feet away from him. It would be nice to heft it once again, but even dislodging from the wall was daunting, and discreetly hiding it would be impossible. A more subtle approach was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar approached the writing desk that had occupied so many of his recent years. Sheets of parchment were scattered over its surface, some blank, and some lined with prewritten decrees. He took a seat at the bare wooden chair, grimacing at the \u2018cushion\u2019 that accompanied him. His eyes narrowed as they surveyed the desk, trying to recall the location of a secret latch somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he peered over his secondary seat of governance, a seed of anxiety took root in his stomach. What would Tryzantium be without Ivar the Bloody on the throne? The web of alliances and coalitions that he had spent the better part of thirty years delicately arranging could all fall apart. The Colleges could attempt to usurp the place of the Church; the encroachment of foreign nations, or, Gods forbid, <i>elves</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis careful balancing act, torn asunder in a matter of weeks. He would not, <i>could not</i> let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar whipped a blank sheet of parchment out of a sheaf with practiced ease, simultaneously dipping a quill in a nearby inkwell. His Council fought like a flock of squabbling hens, but they could be trusted to govern. For a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quill cut dark lines into the parchment. \u2018<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">For the eyes of the Council. Rule as I would \u2014 I shall only be gone a month.</span>\u2019 Ivar allowed himself a small smile of satisfaction. The instructions were clear enough, but the enigmatic nature of the message would keep them on their toes. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile faded and his brow furrowed as he considered the issue of his family, however. Helena might be rudderless without a husband to scrutinize, but her love for banquets would lead her to maintain the status quo. Isabella would be kept locked up if the Council had any sense. Emma\u2019s time would be monopolized by her martial training \u2014 an unusual habit for a woman, but it kept her occupied. Anders\u2019 tutor kept him on a tight leash, skipping his lessons would be the most trouble he could get into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was\u2026 Edward. The quill pen trembled in Ivar\u2019s grip, fueled by rage and anticipation. Any lesson he had tried to impart to the boy simply didn\u2019t take. He spent most of his time dodging the responsibilities of manhood and princedom, and the rest was spent in the <i>library</i> or <i>chapel</i>. The boy needed a firm hand to guide him or, failing that, to put him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king\u2019s mind teemed with possibilities. Maybe Edward the Pure could benefit from a baptism by fire: leading a force against the Northern Orcs would toughen him up. Or maybe a few years in the decadent courts of Erolus would pound some guile into the boy. Ivar laughed \u2014 a sweet, tinkling thing that concealed intricate plans of cruelty.</span></div></div>",

Ivar\u2019s focus was far away from his chambers, his castle, or even Tryzantium: rather, it was in his mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar stood astride a great rocky hill, the landscape around him torn asunder by a battle more fierce than any he had waged. He was a young man again; a great warrior in his prime, clad in the finest armor. His arms rippled as one hefted a grand battleax with ease, the other a massive greatshield. But no companions stood beside him, and no army was beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar tensed every muscle in his body. An attack was coming; he could feel it. And come it did, but not in the form of steel, but as a hail of words, sharp as any arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cruel, cruel man!\u201d the voices howled. \u201cHow could you <i>think</i> of doing that to your own son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar glanced the blows off his shield with practiced ease. \u201cI am a <b>KING</b>!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cIf he is to be one, he will follow in my footsteps!\u201d His voice was laden with implication; the alternative would be unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second volley screamed towards him: \u201cYou dig tunnels into the walls of your castle to avoid the gaze of your wife! Is that the life you want for the boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar smirked; that was even easier to deflect. \u201cA life spent sampling the lovely fruits a kingdom has to offer?\u201d He lifted his arms to the grey skies, reveling in the lack of nauseation he experienced. \u201cWorth a thousand compromises!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence permeated the landscape for a long while. Was it over? Ivar took a tentative step off of his perch before halting suddenly. Another attack was coming; he could sense it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he squinted in the direction his instincts had portended, he could not help but smirk. It was a pitiful thing; hardly larger than a child\u2019s fist. He didn\u2019t even bother using his shield: What harm could it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel bad about this?\u201d hit Ivar square in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king\u2019s body spun through the air at the impact, eventually scraping to a halt in front of a large boulder, armor torn off like tissue paper. Ivar was left breathless, involuntarily lifting a hand to his chest to assess the wound. But he touched no blood, nor wound, nor muscled chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his hand made contact with the same sagging chest he had lived with for the past twenty years. His hand desperately scrabbled to his other arm, his legs, his face; only to discover familiar jowls and loose skin. All his muscle was packed underneath years of accumulated bulk \u2014 again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d asked a soft voice. Ivar whipped his head around, desperately searching its source, before the voice spoke once again, echoing in his skull. \u201cYou <i>do</i> feel bad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words struck Ivar once again, but this strike did not send the king flying. Instead, a familiar force started to press down on his body. Feverish \u2018no\u2019s spilled from the king\u2019s lips, pitch rising with every syllable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, it was over: Ivar\u2019s body was, once again, small, weak, and abundantly feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar curled his pale hands into tiny fists. Was this some great divine joke!? And, this voice, this impudent, <i>inaccurate</i>, insistent voice  \u2014 \u201cStop <i>talking</i>!\u201d Ivar punctuated his squeal with an impertinent stomp, no longer caring about his wobbling protuberances or propriety or anything else. His plump bottom lip wobbled for a few pregnant seconds before he continued. \u201cAnd you\u2019re <i>wrong</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d the voice gently chided, seeming more familiar by the second. \u201c<i>You</i> are wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of pure emotion swept over Ivar, half-submerging his rational mind in pure guilt. Certainly, he was within his rights to educate Edward, <i>but it was simply brutish, the way he went about it</i>. No, wait that wasn\u2019t right. <i>No, it was.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar gripped his head, which felt like it was about to burst at the seams. \u201cWait,\u201d he managed to whimper out. \u201cStop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice continued on, not heeding his pleas. \u201cEdward is so brave, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Absolutely not.</span></font> <i>Well, he hasn\u2019t demonstrated that in combat, but there was a certain nobility in how he persisted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s quite intelligent too!\u201d The voice continued to gush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Not in any way that counts.</font></span> <i>There was no denying that; the boy did spend an awful lot of time in the library, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, well, he\u2019s quite dashing~!\u201d The voice of Palseya cooed embarrassedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>NO.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar broke free of his vision with a guttural roar, and forced the quill to paper, carving the words '<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>DO WITH EDWARD AS YOU WILL.</b></span>' into the parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange cocktail of satisfaction and guilt bubbled inside Ivar. He flicked wild eyes from wall to wall. He swore he could hear girlish voices echoing off them. He clutched his head again; he could not be sure if his thoughts were his own in here. This room, this <i>castle</i>, all of it was too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snatched a dull paper-knife from the table and stowed it in one of his billowing sleeves \u2014 there was no time for secret weapon stashes. Bits of ash swirled around his legs as he strode quickly to the door and opened it with a trembling hand, making only the barest sweep for patrolling guards before he scampered into the twilit hall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivar took a few experimental steps, half expecting to fall over once more. But his legs, though unsteady, did not give out. A few paces followed, then a few more, and more, \u2018till he was quite sure he could walk unsupported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet pride at his accomplishment was quickly smothered by seething rage. He was expected to play the part of this\u2026 this frail <i>girl</i>! His fists balled as his lips curled into a snarl, he would certainly\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of white motion drew his attention to the mirror. The view that greeted him was humbling; a delicate girl with her hands bent into impuissant fists, the snarl on her face more impudent than intimidating. It brought to mind memories of spats with his daughter before she was \u2018blessed\u2019; an image that belied the hexed king it contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar pushed down the great anger bubbling inside of him. In this form, he could not afford to charge forward now; lest he ended up manacled, whipped, or worse. Escape came first, then action could be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king strode to the wall adjacent to his bed, probing the stones with thin fingers. In order to hide his many dalliances from the Queen, a chamber had been constructed to disguise the \u2018participants\u2019. It had been constructed secretly, by the advice of a prodigal genius in the fields of architecture and enchantment. His reward was hasty conscription into the siegecraft division of the army. Even now, his letters and missives were secretly screened by agents of the crown; if they contained the slightest hint of catching on, he was to be disposed of quickly and discreetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese distant memories passed through Ivar\u2019s head as he finally depressed a stone in the wall, sending part of it quietly grinding open. Yet, instead of satisfaction, a heavy emotion weighted his chest. Ivar wrinkled his nose in confusion as he identified the sensation\u2026 as guilt? <i>No, it can\u2019t be,</i> he reasoned. <i>I\u2019ve done no wrong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the sensation persisted, even as a hallway much larger than its containing wall it was lit meter by meter by enchanted torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber, he had been assured by its creator, was the first and only of its kind. Its stated purpose was to be a bastion for the king if his castle were to come under attack, which was true, in a more metaphorical sense. The left wall was lined with \u2018armor\u2019, in the form of outfits meant to both disguise one\u2019s egress and titillate the king \u2014 primarily the latter. The right wall was, appropriately, lined with \u2018weapons\u2019, in the form of bindings and the latest \u2018in sexual paraphernalia; both magical and mundane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to the left wall that Ivar firmly affixed his attention; the stains and musky scent of sex on the right sending convulsions through his slight frame. But though they had less of a\u2026  physiological reaction, the clothes he saw were more taxing mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar had vastly overestimated the number of acceptable disguises in the chamber. Amongst the unacceptable candidates was a scant two pieces of sheer fabric that served as a \u2018dancer\u2019s outfit. Its owner came from a troupe that had come to celebrate Edward\u2019s 13th. The wan prince had taken his leave after a mere three hours of celebration, citing \u2018My duties\u2019 as a pale excuse. Normally, the king would have chastised the boy for his poor show of manhood, but the dancing girls were holding his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few winks, nods, and silent glances later and the girl and the king were off to his chambers, the girl coming 20 minutes after with a maid outfit over her scandalous garb. And, well, now\u2026 Ivar took an appraising glance downwards. Gods, <i>he</i> could fill it out and then some!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly moved on, arms crossed protectively around his chest. The light patter of his feet echoed off the walls as he passed nightclothes made of translucent cloth, ornate gowns that would take an hour to put on, the mere rags of a beggar\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother piece of clothing caught his attention. A black hood crested the top of an equally black traveler\u2019s cloak that swept the ground, even from its high pin. The corners of the king\u2019s mouth started to raise for the first time since his transfiguration. It certainly wouldn\u2019t do for the castle, but it would be excellent garb for\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THWUMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king would\u2019ve liked to meet the noise behind him with a barbaric yawp, weapon in hand, and steel in his eyes. Alas, he was simply not in the right state of body nor mind for such heroics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he let out a piercing squeal and scampered behind the cloak. His breath came fast and sharp for a few long moments before he gathered his courage to peek at\u2026 an ornately carved phallus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBile hastened to his throat as his hands shook with anger. Was this unseen hand of fate to strip him of all dignity, and turn him into some hysterical maiden? His breath hitched as his vision blurred \u2014 Gods, was he going to <i>cry</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotional exhaustion of maintaining his composure was too much for the king\u2019s tired form; he collapsed to his knees with an undignified grunt. As if to mock him, his chest wobbled and shifted with the jolt, only pushing him closer to the precipice of hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small portion of Ivar\u2019s brain that wasn\u2019t tied up in this emotional tug-of-war was desperately searching for some means of assuagement. But there were precious few of his old habits to fall back on: no spirits were nearby to imbibe, no prisoners or peasants were available to torment, and any carnal means of satisfaction were certainly infeasible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar could not tell whether it was his new body or his spirit that laced his fingers together. He could not tell whether his own will or someone else\u2019s shifted his gaze towards the ceiling. But the words \u201cHelp me,\u201d whispered in a trembling falsetto stemmed from no-one but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whisper echoed off of the rock walls, and it was as if a small sun had lit itself in the King\u2019s chest. A vast wave of calm suffused Ivar from head to toe, smothering distress underneath a great weight of placidity. Even the residue of exhaustion that rested in his bones was expelled, replaced with quiet energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar passed a hand through his silver hair, the embers of anxiety still slightly trembling his fingers slightly. Had that been\u2026 him? In his times of adventure, he had seen the truly faithful shift great objects with a mere prayer, or bring people back from the brink of death. Did the Gods still hold Palseya in their favor, despite his own lack of faith?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly struggled to his feet, hurriedly brushing the dust off of his clothes. It simply did not bear thinking about: he would not be doing anything like that again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his hands remained clasped in front of his chest as he apprehensively made his way to the back of the chamber; to more sensible disguises.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sounds more like a name you'd give a... oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather, I think you mean 'oh gnome',\" smirked the bard. \"I know you're going to love being Tanki, my liege. I remember her well. She was on her way to becoming a great inventor, though she was admittedly forced to steal the supplies she needed for her work. That was until her fate landed her in hot water - she was caught stealing fire gems from the royal vaults and sentenced to hang by yourself. So we offered her a pardon in exchange for consigning her heroic Destiny to us. Us bards can be quite persuasive. She's now a perfectly normal nobody on some nowhere farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan felt a rumble in his stomach as a glow began to emanate from within, and an immense weight on his shoulders. The walls of the already vast royal chambers seemed to recede around him, until he felt he was standing in the Grand Cathedral itself. He was shrinking! Not only that, his portly belly was deflating like a leaky wineskin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar looked up at the bard and gulped, a sense of deja vu back to the days of fighting Frost Giants. Addoros loomed over him. Even by gnome standards, Ivar was short, barely coming up to the man's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked to be a hero, not some pint-size little runt,\" Ivar bellowed, slapping his hands over his mouth as the voice that emerged was shrill and piping. The hands themselves were no longer sausage-shaped but thin and deft, perfectly suited for tinkering with tiny gnomish devices. A flush of light green flowed through his pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pressure in his scalp. With a 'poof', a shock of vibrant pink hair spring from his balding head, sending his now-oversized crown flying into the air. The golden crown bounced and rolled across the floor, stopped by Addoros' shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways a physical imposing man, Ivar felt himself suddenly overwhelmed with timidness confronted with the size of what had been a normal sized man mere moments before. Turning to the bedside mirror, he stared at his new body, as his hips widened and tiny breasts formed on his chest. Pointed ears peeked out from under his candyfloss-hair. His royal garments squirmed and shifted like snakes into minute, form-fitting leather attire. A leather satchel hung over one shoulder within which he could hear the clink of glass and metal and feel the slosh of liquids. His tinkerer's pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hCuCEz5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/hCuCEz5.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you just the cutest little thing,\" Addoros crooned, scooping the king into his arms like a doll and hugging him. Ivar kicked his legs and beat his tiny fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down! I am the king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore you're not. As a matter of fact, you're a gnomish girl with a criminal record of breaking into this very castle... currently trespassing within the king's chambers. You might want to keep your voice down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes are a slippery lot. Ivar found his new body was exceedingly wriggly and double-jointed. Squirming his little gnomish form like a greased eel, he slipped from the bard's grasp to tumble to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spoony bard! Wizard college drop-out! Turn me back right now or I'll call for the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-GUARDS!\" Addoros finished his sentence. \"GUARDS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar's blood ran cold. Addoros grinned. \"We'll be resuming Tanki Battlekettle's Tale in medias res. Last time we saw her, she was desperately trying to escape the castle. Remember, if you ever want to be Ivar again, you must complete her Tale. Good luck.\" The doors to the chambers flew open to admit a trio of guards. \"This gnome was caught attempting to steal the King's crown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards smirked. They had swords, though they didn't even bother to draw them. One of them grabbed a chamber pot, clearly intending to try to trap the king underneath it. Another grabbed a pillowcase and swung at Ivar with it, trying to stuff him inside.</span></div></div>",

I have no crossbow. Grab a poker from the fire? That poker is the size of an iron girder to me now. Threaten them? I'm just a lowly gnome to them; what could I ever threaten them with? I know, I'll-!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, his hesitation had cost him everything. The guard scooped him up in the pillowcase. Ivar struggled valiantly against the silken confines but it might have been made out of unbreakable adamant for all his tiny fists and feet could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the squeaking, squirming sack closed with one hand, the guard swung it against the bedpost of the royal bed. The prisoner within went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disappointing,\" Addoros sighed under his breath. \"Well I can see poor Tanki's story is ended. After I had such hopes for the girl as well. Farewell, king.\" With an elaborate bow to the unconscious, sacked king, he faded away with a few subtle notes of his harp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard slammed the sack against the thick oak bedpost a second time just to be sure before decanting their prisoner from the pillowcase. She tumbled onto the bed, head lolling in a stupor. \"...wha...where am I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guard grabbed her roughly, pinning her entire body down with but a single hand. Her tinkerer's kit was swiftly removed. With his other hand, the guard simply clutched and wrenched at her leather armour until the straps snapped. She was stripped completely of her clothing. The guards had dealt with Tanki Battlekettle before - they knew the sorts of gadgets she could pull from her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought to know where you are - you're that fucking gnome we caught snooping around here months ago. A criminal always returns to the scene of her crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gag was thrust into Ivar's open mouth - one of his own socks grabbed from a dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her to the barracks,\" sneered the guard. \"No need to bother the king with this one. You'll not be getting a pardon this time. Bind her limbs, and make it tight. These gnomes are a slippery lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes were indeed a slippery lot. Their tendons and ligaments were stretchy, letting them contort their joints into any configuration and granting them remarkable feats of dexterity and escapology. But even that couldn't help Ivar as his arms and legs were bound tight enough to cut into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately gnome flesh is resilient too, tough and springy. A gnome thrown from a high place will bounce instead of splat, and will recoil away from a killing blow with merely the wind knocked out of them. They are like rubber balls - it was the only way they could survive around the lumbering humans, who might otherwise have killed them with a misplaced step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that elasticity of flesh that saved Ivar, physically at least, though not from ignominy, as the guards had their way with Tanki's young, flexible body. The huge human cock pressed eagerly against his tight gnomish pussy like a battering ram breaking through a doorway. Ivar sobbed senselessly into his gag as her flexible flesh yielding to allow the vast organ entry to her body. It filled her up, sliding all the way into her torso as her organs moved aside to let it pass and her vagina distended to accommodate it. As the guard began to thrust, Tanki felt her body forced into a new configuration from the repeated pounding, her torso becoming little more than a sheath for humongous cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn next,\" growled a half-orc guardsman, unbuckling his codpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first guard blew his load and slid out, he noticed a scrap of parchment still tightly in the gnome's list. He snatched it up. It was mostly blank, the dense story from before now vanished. All that remained was the name 'Tanki Battlekettle' and beneath that a single sentence writing itself onto the paper before his very eyes.<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><br>\r\n<i>And Tanki Battlekettle remained a plaything of the castle guard until the end of her days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End.</i></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gnome-king\u2019s hair whipped about him, the dull shade of pink made bright by the afternoon sun. The loud groans and venomous curses of guards slithered out of the broken window, one particularly loud voice asserting that he could <i>definitely</i> hit that gnome bitch with his second shot \u2014 she had just cursed his first shot with her wicked magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree thoughts entered and exited Ivar\u2019s head in short order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a blend of amusement and contempt \u2014 with the way that crossbow had been maintained, that guard would have to be lucky to hit a giant at ten paces. Halfwit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thought was mostly comprised of confusion with no small amount of concern. How did he know that? A menagerie of explanations and rationalizations paraded through his head before the third thought cleared them right out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps \u2018thought\u2019 was too strong a word. A more fitting term would be \u2018the sudden realization of impending death\u2019. The small trees and brackish tributaries lining the moat were getting awful big, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed from Ivar\u2019s eyes, some from the wind, some from fear. Listening to the bard was a snap decision; the open air outside the castle walls seemed a sight better than the leer of his castle guards, but he had neglected to consider the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the king known more about his new gnomish physiology, he would have had less reason for panic; the worst injury a gnome could suffer from a fall of this height would be a dislocated shoulder or two. But the most contact he had with the greenish race was a brief smile and a toss of a coin to a small, excitable minstrel \u2014  not the most informative of exchanges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with newly deft hands that Ivar rifled through his pouch, fingers brushing across tools and bottles with desperate speed. The ground fast approached as he managed to stick his entire arm in the pack \u2014 it must have had a Holding charm placed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for options, his hand involuntarily grasped itself around some kind of metal pole; the first non-phial or tool he\u2019d laid hands upon. He pulled the object from the bag with three desperate yanks and was almost immediately flooded with dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a parasol \u2014 a familiar sight in his court, come summertime. This particular one had a black fabric covering its whalebone frame, with a curve in the base of its handle like a shepherd\u2019s crook. It was longer than his body, the tip of the device even stretching above the length of his now-vertical ponytail. Gods, <i>this</i> was the reprieve he got?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was better than nothing. Marginally. Ivar scrabbled for a latch or lever to release the mechanism \u2014 maybe it could slow his descent somewhat. But as his hands traveled up and down the shaft of the parasol, a button was involuntarily depressed \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of the parasol \u2014 that, by the grace of providence, was facing downwards \u2014 lit up with a Crimson magic circle, and almost immediately started to belch great gouts of fire. His fear for his life compounded with the reflexive avoidance of heat and overwhelmed poor Ivar\u2019s sense of dignity; leaving him to squeal at a ludicrously high pitch whilst clinging to the gadget for dear life. Gnome and umbrella rocketed into the sky, passing the chamber window handily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards watched from said window, mouths wide open with shock; all ideas of crossbow shots and crown theft purged from their minds. Addoros too, watched the gnome rocket through the sky, a single raised eyebrow the only thing betraying his surprise. \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly a fascinating opening.\u201d he chirped, ink-dipped quill already scribbling the first verse of a balld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above the castle\u2019s spires, Ivar had managed to pull himself astride the odd device with a heroic effort. A  side effect of his new riding posture was a correction in his path of flight: from vertical to horizontal \u2014 something that he was immensely thankful for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was the matter of height to consider. Merely looking down sent a lurch through the king\u2019s tiny stomach. That had to be fixed. With nervous resolution, he gripped the hook-like end of the shaft and shifted it the <i>tiniest</i> amount clockwise, with an equally tiny lean right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parasol, in accord, shifted right. The anxious frown slowly cleared from Ivar\u2019s face; this might be easier than he had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king continued his experimental process in the air above his castle, turns and dips gradually increasing in depth and risk. This culminated in a barrel-roll that left him shrieking with delight, strands of pink hair stuck to the edges of his manic smile. Ivar swiped a small hand to dislodge the tresses and gazed down at his castle. It seemed so small. The people seemed so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn incredibly ill-advised plan hatched and matured inside the king\u2019s little green skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sloped his makeshift steed towards the same window he had exited. He pulled the handle to the left and performed large, lazy circles, all the while craning his tiny neck to get a good view inside. A few guards milled around in there, some looking underneath the beds, and others investigating the chimney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, CLANKERS!\u201d he shouted. He didn\u2019t quite know where the title came from, but it just seemed\u2026 right. \u201cLOOKING FOR SOMETHING?\u201d A few surprised faces turned his way; Ivar gave them a friendly wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were coming towards the window now. Ivar performed a small loop-de-loop for his impromptu audience, letting out a shrill whoop of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you!\u201d he exclaimed, pointing at a guard with an unloaded crossbow. \u201cAgain, thanks <i>so much</i> for the exit! Couldn\u2019t have made it without \u2018ya, tall-legs!\u201d He let out a tinkling peal of laughter at the guard\u2019s reddening face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king performed a few barrel rolls before hearing a chorus of <i>click</i>s from the window. He looked back quickly; four loaded crossbows met his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>grizjak</i>.\u201d he swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar veered his parasol around with lightning speed as four consecutive <i>twangs</i> echoed behind him. Three crossbow bolts sailed around him, but one struck his mount right in the ferrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar squealed as the umbrella bucked wildly underneath him. Gods, why had he gone back? Why had he been so <i>stupid</i>? And what did <i>grizjak</i> even mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all these questions went unanswered as his flight path tipped downwards. Ivar wrestled with the handle, trying to aim it towards something softer, like a bale of hay or even a pile of manure. But the gnome-king crashed directly into\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were no bales of hay this far into the city, but there was the next best thing - a thatched roof. It would be a rough landing, but not the worst possible outcome considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment before impact, the parasol gave a final lurch, bucking straight down to smash into the thatch, throwing the diminutive Ivar like a broncho. With precision aim, he vanished down the chimney of the inn. His bouncy gnomish body ricocheted down the chute. The world tumbling end over end, there were two points of light in the sooty darkness - the diminshing sunlight up above and a growing, crackling firelight below. Desperate not to burn to death in the flames below, he outstretched his hands to grab any part of the rough stone walls, yet his body bounced off each surface like a rubber ball faster than he could find purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, this time he received the soft landing he had prayed for before. A pool of meaty broth swallowed him up. Underwater, eyes clenched shut against the near scalding water, his hands and feet pushed through the thick chunks of carrot and turnip as large as his fists. His fingers scraped against the hot sides of the iron pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was knocked out of him from the fall - he had to get to the surface soon before he drowned. With all of his diminished strength, he pushed his feet against the iron beneath him, swimming to where he hoped the surface was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink gnomish head broke the surface of the communal soup cauldron placed upon the fire of the Drunken Troll Tavern. It looked up at the high sides of the pot around it. Spluttering and spitting out a mouthful of potato, it called out in its tinny, tiny voice. \"In the name of the king, help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broth was hearty and thick - good for eating but less so for swimming, and it was a battle to get to the edge. Using a particularly large lump of chicken as a float, Ivar reached up, managing to get one hand over the edge of the pot, and pulling up the rest of the body. Half in, half out, he paused there for a moment, bruised, battered and burnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pot sat upon the crackling fire of the common room of the Drunken Troll Tavern. An old man sat sleeping before the fire, while a smattering of patrons drank, ate and chattered around the half-empty, midday tavern, all undisturbed by the quiet plop of a king falling into the communal dinner.</span></div></div>",

The sense of barbaric zeal from his warrior days was still present, but the tattoo beat of his gnomish heart urged him \u2014 far more convincingly \u2014 to stay quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe risked another peek, eyes scanning the room quickly. The folk ambling about varied in their respective activities \u2014 ruddy youths played cards; a bearded barkeep polished glasses; and grizzled working men seemed to be swapping tales of some sort \u2014 but they all shared a similar trait: they towered over his gnomish form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar let go of the near-scorching metal and dropped down to his chicken buoy. Apprehension mixed with fear mixed with caution to muddle his thoughts and hasten his breath. Every human \u2014 gods, he wasn\u2019t <i>human</i> anymore! \u2014 was a giant to him, with hands the size of his head and limbs thicker than he was wide. Would they capture him?  Was a gnome even worth being captured? Gods, what if the guard had sent word out of hi? What could they, <i>would</i> they do if they caught him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar shivered and tried to change his thread of  thought. He cast a look at the assortment of bruises turning his pea-coloured skin a glaucous blue; the only badges of his tumble down the chimney. He tentatively depressed the soft, mottled skin, a soft gasp of surprise slipping out from his lips at its texture; that of a slightly damp rubber ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was a tornado of thoughts; objects of alarm, unfamiliar schematics, and alien sensations all caught up in its winds. He shook his head to clear it, half-wincing at how it brushed his pointed ears against the seasoned metal. First things first: escape. The rest would come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an empty table and a swinging alleyway door some distance away from the fireplace that, thankfully, no one seemed to be paying attention to. Some extant voice in his mind whispered the time it would take for him to get there: \u2018<i>Ten seconds, eight if I sprint,</i>\u2019 Ivar knit his small brow into a frown at the unrequested information, but quietly gave thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the lip of the cauldron that was closest to the chimney, shakily checking over his shoulder for any stew-watchers or signs of stirring from the old man. Nothing. With a quiet squeak, he hoisted his torso up, feet dangling above the broth, before they were pulled up to an uneasy perch. He delicately shuffled along the lip to face the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar readied himself to jump off and skedaddle. On one\u2026 two\u2026 Wait, what was that dangling out of that old man\u2019s pocket? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew his face into a squint. A gold chain\u2026 wait, no. That was <i>Tyranian</i> gold! Ivar\u2019s face unconsciously relaxed itself into a giddy smile, pupils dilating to overwhelm amber irides. \u2018<i>Extraordinarily ductile even compared to normal gold, it\u2019s used to form components in the most complex magical circuits,</i>\u2019 helpfully filtered into his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar didn\u2019t need any more convincing, however. He leaped down from his makeshift bathtub and half-staggered over to the rocking chair, dopey grin still plastered on. The man\u2019s pocket wasn\u2019t quite at gnome-height, but he managed to grab a loop of the chain after two short hops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet tinkle of the chain falling sent an unfamiliar prickle of warmth through the pit of Ivar\u2019s stomach, which only intensified with the feel of cool metal on his skin. Had he possessed such <i>wondrous</i> treasures in his own vault, and never known it? Ivar rubbed the links against his cheek, a throaty purr rumbling in his small neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to procure his goods. Ivar yanked on the chain like a church bell, but it pulled taut. Ivar frowned; this would not do! Bracing himself against the leg of the chair, he gave a mighty tug on the chain, sending the cheap copper watch it was attached to sailing into the air and\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The heavy lump of copper and components sailed straight towards his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash, Ivar raised Tanki's satchel high, stretching the brim wide. He braced himself for impact as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch slipped smoothly within the satchel of holding, the lustrous gold chain in its wake coiling down and down into the oversized insides of the bag. <i>Gotcha</i>! crowed Ivar triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocking chair gave a lurch. The chain had become taut and the man within was abruptly awoken as he was dragged belt-first from his seat and under the table by terrific force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the thing with holding charms. They liked items to be <i>in</i> or <i>out</i>, but never <i>inbetween</i>. A mundane item caught within a holding charm aperture could be chopped in twain upon its sealing - a magic item disastrously sundered, causing damage to the container, the owner, or everybody in a 3 mile radius, depending on the power of the magic item in question. A holding charm was capable of exerting considerable force to ensure items stayed whole and complete. Alas, to the satchel, the watch and the man securely fastened to the watch appeared to be one and the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's fingernails shaved wood from the floorboards but it did nothing to slow his inexorable progress towards the satchel. Though the satchel mouth was only inches, it grew wide like a guppy as his feet slipped within it, then his legs, until his upper body bulged out of the top. He began to thrash wildly in an attempt to grab anything to hold on to, and Ivar had to duck several times as the man's fists swung his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man took a deep breath to call for help, the satchel found its chance, gulping down the gut that had become lodged. After that, the upper body and head were quick to go, just a glimpse of fear-stricken eyes vanishing down into the dark. The satchel contracted back to normal size with an almost satisfied air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush fell on the tavern as the man's final cry echoed into silence. With dread, Ivar turned to the tavern. The tavern's patrons stared back in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gnome just ate Arthur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few indignant faces looked towards the sign above the bar, which displayed the small silhouette of a Halfling inside the larger silhouette of an Orc, and the words 'Do Not Eat Fellow Patrons'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere was turning hostile as the hulking humanoids rose from their seats all around - the barkeep grasping the business-end of a bottle, ready to swing it, the youths eagerly producing knives from their cloaks, the workmen unhooking rusty, mean-looking tools from their belts. A pimple-faced scholar, who looked far too young to be drinking, set aside his pint and his tome, flickers of green flame igniting in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, I can explain!\" shouted Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be good. Go on. Explain,\" rumbled the barman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar took a deep breath. \"Using the Seamstresses of Nul we wove corporealised nether-confluxes via a convergence loom capable of sequestering a quantum of ethereal continuum into a minor sub-demiplane enchantment entirely within this handy hesian haversack.\" He held up the slightly wriggling satchel. \"...or a, uh, Bag of Holding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Ivar knew that wasn't the explanation they were expecting. It wasn't even the explanation Ivar had been expecting. He only recognised half the words that just came out of his own mouth. He was starting to learn that Tanki had quite a big mouth on her for such a small gnome, just as capable of talking her <i>into </i>trouble as <i>out</i> of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hurled pint glass the size of his torso exploded next to him like a goblin bomb. He shielded himself, sensing several stray shards slice the skin of his arms. So cutting weapons were effective against gnomes, it seemed, even if they could tank bludgeoning blows like creatures many times their size. That was good to know. More data, more options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patrons were closing in with murderous intent. Knives, flames, rusty billhooks, broken bottles, and there! - a man clutching a snooker cue! There was always one in any bar brawl. Ivar leaped at him, crying \"dumb grizjak, you couldn't hit me with that thing if I was your mother, which would be very easy on account of her wei-OOF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment of impact, Ivar jumped and curled into a ball. The cue was slimmer than Ivar would have liked - a bat or racquet would have been ideal- but it had the desired effect, propelling the gnome at high speed across the bar. The wall approached fast. <i>Judge the angle. Adjust the body.</i> He rebounded higher, struck the barkeep square in the nose, rebounded, soared high and he unfurled himself to land deftly upon the chandelier. The barkeep clutched his spurting nose, swearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar's heart was pounding like a drum, a mad grin on his face. Sure, he smarted from head to foot, but the sense of speed, the fine control on the rebound... he hadn't had fun like that in years. With a giddy laugh, he kicked a foot against a candle, dropping it on the heads of the attackers below. \"Let's see you get me up here!\"</span></div></div>",

Get the pot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cauldron was lifted from the fireplace and placed beneath the chandelier. The patrons tossed glasses and food up at Ivar, trying to make him fall. In exchange, Ivar kicked candles down on their heads. Some landed in the boiling broth, dispersing quickly into molten wax. A drunken, hungry chant of \"gnome, sweet gnome\" was taken up by those below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't be seriously thinking of <i>eating</i> him, could they? Perhaps they were just trying to scare him... perhaps not. Whether gnome or King, eating a member of a thinking race just wasn't done in a place like the capital, was it? Perhaps he had been shut up in his castle for too long - if he made it back, he would see to it that no race could be treated this way within his realm, regardless of their stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first he had to make it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chandelier was hung from the vaulted ceiling by a large iron chain, and consisted of two crossed planks supporting the outer ring, which held the dozens of candles required to illuminate the room. The planks were wide enough for him to manauver around on. Ivar dashed along the plank, almost jumping off the end but grabbing the ring at the last moment. His inertia caused the chandelier to creak and sway. He sprinted back along the plank and did the same on the opposite side. It took a few tries to time it just right, but soon the chandelier was starting to swing with greater and greater amplitude in the direction of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to jump for the door!\" came the cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell uttered by the trainee wizard was nasal and riddled with teenage voice cracking. With an intonation and flick of his wand, the shutters slammed shut against the windows all at once, while a wall of green fire sprang from nothing to turn the front doorway into an impenetrable furnace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No escape now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar turned away from the door, running back along the beam just as the chandelier reached its apex, and jumped. He soared over their heads, cannon-balling through the rear door to the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocated out back between the high, damp walls of the adjacent buildings, the privy was nothing more than a plank of wood with holes cut in it placed above a hole in the ground. A dingy, foul place that stank of piss, Ivar nonetheless bounded onto the plank with a grin. He paused, giving his pursuers time to follow. While he teetered on the open hole of the privy, they hesitated, not wishing to see lunch disappear down the toilet before they even had chance to digest it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now, little girly. You don't want to be doing anything daft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate worse than death down there. Better the pot than the pit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar donned the Satchel of Holding like a hat, shimmying his body higher into the velvety abyss until it slipped down over his waist. Now just an abbreviated set of legs, he took a single step backwards, vanishing down into a second, stenchier abyss of the cesspit. He had just enough time to pull his legs into the satchel before it impacted the sluggish river of human waste.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the battle of Magloria Prince Rilian and his men were about yo head back Tryzantium for a celebratory feast. Unlike his father who was an adulterous brute, Rilian was more noble and peaceful believing war to be a last resort if necessary, but he did enjoy hunting and sports competitions. His amazing physic and his charm would have any lady so. He's also the type of man to hire lowly peasants to high positions of power. This however gained scorn from his father who believed that doing such is nonsense. This was also the reason why Rilian wanted to usurp or at least convince his father to give him the throne, for he believed that his father's foolishness will destroy the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he ran into a bit of a bind. Just when things seemed peaceful they were suddenly ambushed from behind. It so happened that the princess from Erolus had set a plan to capture the prince and force him into marrying her. Being the ruler of her kingdom Princess Luna needed to take over Tryzantium and remove the evil from within it and find a husband. So when she heard that the foolish King Ivar declared war, this was her chance to kill two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that Rilian knew that he was in some sort of guest bedroom with a bathroom connected to it. But when he tried to leave the room a magic barrier blocked the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of trickery is this?\", questioned Prince Rilian<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you're awake. Now we can talk about peace negotiations.\", said Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an awkward to seek peace, but I'm all ears.\", said Prince Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, the peace I seek is the unification of our two kingdoms.\", said Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I'm awfully sorry Princess but it would be disgraceful for me just to marry anyone out of the blue without the blessings of my parents and the blessing of your parents.\", replied Prince Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents died three years ago leaving me in charge of the kingdom.\", said Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that. At least let me send word to my kingdom so I can tell them that I am making an arrangement for peace.\", said Prince Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot permit that. I'm afraid you have no choice but to stay in Erolus until you say yes to my proposal.\", said Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you're doing is totally improper and thus warrants restraint.\", replied Prince Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well according to the rules of war you're my prisoner and ergo don't have a say.\", replied Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Luna leaves the room. Rilian then notices that on the balcony of his room is a plate full of food cooked for a king. Rilian thought this to be strange since he is technically Luna's prisoner but figures it's due to the fact that she's trying to make him change his mind about the proposed forced marriage. Yet it could of been a lot worse though. He could of been locked in a cell but at least in the princess's weird sense of treatment ensured that he was sort of treated like royalty. Yet it also became apparent that he could only leave the room if accompanied by a guard or by Luna herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least she knows how to treat a prince, except I'm her prisoner until I accept her ridiculous marriage proposal. Might as well eat my dinner.\", Rilian said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rilian took a bite of the food the taste buds in his mouths exploded with flavor. He couldn't help but devour it with such tenacity. Suddenly thoughts of hunger filled his mind. He just had to have more. So over the course of the next few days Rilian requested he had a double of whatever he would receive for his meals, which oddly enough Princess Luna granted the request seeing this new development to be a sign of consideration to marriage. Yet it was her idea to spike Rilian's food with a weight gain potion figuring it might be easier for him to agree to the proposal if well fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later</span></div></div>",

Luckily he had been making several escape plans. His last resort plan involved marrying Luna and having the marriage annulled if the other plans didn't work. Yet today was Rilian's lucky day. Princess Luna was planning on taking her hostage, Rilian, on expedition. On an expedition Luna could do nothing to trap him for he has been slowly manipulating the her psychosis for his own benefit. As Rilian laid on his bed and suggestively rubbing his growing belly he took delight in the revenge he was planning against his father. Yet he doubted that he would shed weight due to the weight gain potion and his new addiction to food. At the very least Rilian exercised twice a day in order to keep his body healthy, though once he becomes king and if he manages to escape he only saw himself as a huge fat man ruling with wisdom and using his strength to tear down tyranny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rilian! It's your future wifey!,\" Luna yelled with a kind of perverted excitement in her voice. \"It's time to go the expedition to the Lost Temple of Seasons. So get your fat and sexy ass moving for we leave now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian heaves himself off the bed and walks out of the bedroom. Thankfully Rilian had managed to seduce Luna enough to convince her to lower the forcefield, yet he had to use the excuse of getting a snack though for the guards and Luna would quickly discover that they are being played. Yet as Rilian walks past the mirrors in the hallway he notices that his thick beard hides his double chin and that his body is definitely wider. He still had muscle tone under neat his fat arms and legs, but that was due to his vain attempts at losing weight. Rilian's waist was easily 50 inches or so yet he was surprised that he carried his weight well. He was thankful that he had garments that actually fit his body for it would be humiliating go out in his skivvies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully by trying to find the Lost Temple of Seasons Rilian could lose Luna and make his way back to Tryzantium. Unfortunately, his weight gain made him unrecognizable to many, but he could swear that the maids that came into his room were secretly fawning over his plump and rotund form. So after eating a hearty meal, Rilian and his self-procliamed and psychotic fiance left for the Lost Temple of Seasons. After many hours of searching Princess Luna decided to take a rest from her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat! The legends are right about the Lost Temple of Seasons. It is impossible to find. With the power of this temple I should have the power to turn Ivar into the pig that he truly is. Good night my future tubby hubby. Sleep well and think only of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then falls asleep while resting her head on one of Rilian's fleshy pecs. In order to escape Rilian had to plan his next move wisely. If he was too careless Luna would cast a forcefield spell to imprison him and he didn't want that. So Rilian slowly strokes Luna's head and gently lowers it on a pillow. Luna starts laughing in her sleep much to Rilian's annoyance. Before exiting the tent Rilian checks for any guards. Fortunately all the guards were sleeping on duty. Rilian quietly tiptoes out of the camp. Once out of the campsite he makes a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how much he's slowed down Rilian's best chance of escape was through the forest. The forest was near an orc village, a colony of gnomes and of course the elves who take delight in watching those foolish enough to enter get attacked by and turned into lycantropes or anthros. By the time Rilian had made his way to the forest one of Luna's guards has awoken from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prisoner has escaped! You know the drill men. Capture and detain the Princess's future husband. If he make his way back to Tryzantium then Her Highness's plan would go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's men yell their battle cry and take off. Rilian hastens his pace hoping not to get caught. However Rilian stumbles upon...</span></div></div>",

As soon as he enters the Lost Temple of Seasons disappears by using ancient magic to cloak itself. After entering Rilian notices that the entrance is sealed shut. At first Rilian tries to pry the door open, but it wouldn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I'm trapped inside. At least that psycho won't be able to get in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then walks away from the door. Rilian then spots an altar with various relic sitting on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these relics doing here? What purpose do they serve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Rilian pondered the relics he heard a deep voice echo throughout the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome chosen one to the Lost Temple of Seasons. Your current season has come to a close. Pick a relic from the altar and smash it on the ground to begin your new season. Once you smash the relic your life will be forever changed. Once changed you must strive to live out your new season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New season? Does that mean I can only leave once I transform. If that's what it takes to get revenge on my father then I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then approaches the altar. Many of the relics were of different races of humanoids. Some were of the opposite gender. Others were just flat out weird. Probably a bit too weird. After thinking over his options Rilian chooses the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking over his options Rilian chooses the Orc Warrior Relic. After holding the stone relic, which resembled a stone figure of an orc with a giant battle ax. Rilian promptly smashes the relic. Upon smashing the relic Rilian is enveloped by a bright green light. At first Rilian doesn't feel anything, but after a few moments Rilian feels intense pain.The first change was Rilian's height. He grew from 6'8\" to an impress 8'8\". After growing in height Rilian's girth was the next thing to change. Rilian's body widened greatly to account for the new girth, both muscle and fat. While he grew wider his skin turned a vibrant green. The final change were the slight elongation of his ears and the restructuring of his jawline and face. Rilian's nose grows bigger and jawline grows wider as two new lower tusks grow. Once these changes were made Rilian passed out. Rilian was now an 8'8\" orc weighing a hefty 654 lbs. Rilian was now bigger than the average orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour Rilian awoke from his transformation induced sleep. Upon waking up Rilian saw that the room has changed as well. He was still inside the Lost Temple of Seasons. The only difference was the larger size of the altar and the altar itself is surrounded by a reflection pool. Rilian looked at his reflection. The orc staring back at him intrigued him. He still had his thick facial hair and long way hair, but he couldn't recognize himself. He knew from his past studies that he would be attractive in orc society and could probably take over as warchief. The very thought of raiding Tryzantium with a massive orc army pleased him. His father, the king, had to pay and leading an orc army would do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then makes his way up the altar. It took Rilian a while to get used to his size, but he got over the awkwardness. He then puts on the clothing, which is mostly orcish armor, and straps the axe near the clothing onto his broad back. After getting dressed the door to the temple opens. Rilian then hears the same voice that he had heard earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go forth chosen one and live your life to the fullest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely plan on it.\" Rilian said with a much deeper voice than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRillian then walks out of the temple and towards the orc village, which would serve as his new home. The orc village near the forest was a vast tundra with a well-renowned swamp. There was also a lake on top of the mountain, but the lake itself is controlled by the dwarves who have an alliance withe gnomes. Rilian didn't mind the harsh conditions of his new home. It was no different from when he was a human prince setting up camp with his troops. As Rilian drew closer to the village he felt a huge surge of adrenaline. He felt like he could take on the world. Yet this was due to the  abundant orc pheromones in the area. When two or more orcs are in the same area they more likely to do dumb and foolish endeavors. Orcs can be quite brilliant, but they prefer using brawn when around other orcs. When in a group orcs are known to have intense berserker rages, especially when they are trying to woo a female or vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this didn't surprise Rilian. Humans tend to do similar things while in a drunken stupor or when they are feeling feisty. After arriving in the village Rilian felt like challenging the biggest baddest orc in the village. If his plans for revenge were going to succeed he would have to become a warlord. He was already dressed as an orc barbarian so that would help him out a bit, judging by his riled up train of thought. The orcs of the village readied their weapons as Rillian  lumbered into the village. Rilian could he was respected due to his size alone and the fact that positions of power often had to be earned through combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the mighty Rillian Draxus! I'm the toughest and biggest orc around! I've been traveling the realm and fighting off the strongest foes around! Now who among you is the warlord! I'm here to take over!\" Rillian yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Rilian's first name wasn't common among any race, but for his surname he had to change it to something more orchish in nature. The orcs start mumbling to themselves. They spoke the same language that Rilian does, but none of them dared approach the huge orc that issued the challenge. After few moments a lone figure emerge from the warlord's hut. The orc that emerged was...</span></div></div>",

Rilian could see that the odds were in his favor. All he had to do is beat the current warlord in power and then his plans to punish his foolish human father could begin. Rilian grins a daring grin as the warlord approached. The warlord was slightly older than Rilian and wore pelts made out of bear hides. He also wore a necklace made from alligator teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the orc who dares to challenge me. You may be bigger, but do you have the strength and experience to take me on? If you lose you'll spend the rest of your days in this bottle.\" The warlord said as he pulls out a bottle normally used for Orc Mead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian snorted and grinned. Truly this warlord doesn't know that when Rilian was still human he studied about the different races and knows their cultures very well. As long as Rilian used his head and brute strength he should be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Rilian Draxus have explored many lands and taken down entire armies! I even took down the eldest human prince from Tryzantium! The man simply couldn't muster the strength to take me down!\" Rilian boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian knew he had to say what he said. If he became warlord he had to make certain that Rilian heir to the Tryzantium throne was dead for all those encountered. For in truth Rilian gave up his humanity to bring justice on his wicked father. Now as an orc he was free to carve out his own destiny and do what he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Draxus. We shall wrestle right here. No weapons should be used. A true warlord is strong enough to defeat his foes with his bare hands. Witch Doctor, quickly prepare the arena so I may show this fool his place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of orcs back up as a tall female entered the area. Like most of her kind she was well built with muscle, but probably stronger than most males her age. She was about Rilian's age and  adorned with light armor and a clerical cape. A large band of cloth covered her chest, but she still showed an impressive amount of cleavage. The witch doctor takes her broad sword and used the edge of the blade to draw a circular arena. The way she moved and the fact that her blade didn't suffer any damage truly spoke highly of the quality of the crafting of orc weapons. After drawing the arena the witch doctor approaches Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your ax Rilian Draxus. I will give it back to you if you prove yourself worthy to become warlord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian takes his ax off his back. Despite its heavy weight the ax wasn't a burden for orcs enjoyed using heavy weaponry in combat and would use it to help build up their own strength. After handing the witch doctor his ax Rilian stretched for a few moments. As he stretched the fat on Rilian's body jiggled briefly. Rilian then readied himself. After the witch doctor gave word Rilian and the warlord went at each other with full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian and the warlord almost matched each other in strength, but Rilian clearly had the advantage. After an hour or so Rilian tosses the warlord in the air and then pile drives him before he could land. The former warlord was rendered unconcious and should recover in 2 hours or so all thanks to the durability of an orc's body. Rilian then shrinks the former warlord and puts him inside the empty Orc Mead bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should take of that. Now as your new warlord I say that we feast. Today is the day to celebrate for the fate of the orcs will change for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers wildly as the new warlord walks out of the ring. Many of the females swoon over Rilian's mighty form as he walks to his new hut with the witch doctor. Upon entering the hut Rilian saw that the interior was decorated with skulls and clay containers. There was also a broad sword on one of the walls. The witch doctor hands Rilian his ax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have proven yourself to be stronger than any orc. With you as our warlord we can unify our peoples and prosper. May the gods bless you Draxus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch doctor proceeds to leave Rilian's hut. As soon as she leaves Rilian's stomach starts gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so pumped up that I forgot to get something to eat. These pots should have food. Probably enough to last a day or two. I'll have to hunt for more and gather some of the wild vegetables that grow by the mountain. There's probably some grub that's catchable in the swamp. If the legends are true there should be a monster whose flesh that gives all who consume it incredible strength. Said monster is supposed to reproduce asexually in order to survive. With that said I need to make sure I can gain as much weight as possible and get as strong as possible. The bigger I become the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then consumes all of the food in the pots to satisfy his hunger. After eating...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After eating Rilian decided to walk around the village to know his subjects that he is ruling over. All great orc warlords need to access their fellow orcs. For an orc army can't afford to have any weak links. If a weak link is found it is usually remedied as soon as possible. Rilian takes off tunic and proceeds out of his hut shirtless. In orc socirty male were free to go around shirtless in any orc village or town. They only needed tunics for hunting, travelling, fighting wars, or if they simply felt like wearing one. As Rilian walked a gently breeze blew across his shirtless body. Many female orcs who were attracted to him whistled as they saw his hairy upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian just waved and passed them by. If he were to choose a wife she would have to be the biggest and strongest orc in the village. Even though exacting revenge is on Rilian's mind he won't let it deprive him from the joys of life. He also had intentions of starting a family of his own. Rilian's new race were keen on raising big families. An average female orc was able to carry two to three new bay orcs at a time if they're pregnant. Yet orc marriage traditions were simple and straightforward. Usually two orcs would wrestle each other in order to woo a potential marriage partner. The victor would then court the orc who has his or her affection for a few months. During the courtship both orcs hunt and dine together and even wrestle each other in order to improve their strength. If the two orcs find each other worthy of marriage they seal the deal with sex. Once the two orcs have sex together they are officially husband and wife. Afterwards they throw a huge feast to celebrate the union. The very thought of marriage aroused Rilian, but first he needed to ensure that his fellows were adequate for tomorrow's big hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rilian continued his stroll he saw adolescent orcs training with their fathers or mothers, depending on their gender, and a few orcs reading some literature. When it came to reading orcs only liked to read about wars, war heroes, weapon crafting, or any knowledge that would help them in a fight. So it was no surprise that orcs would read about their favorite war after a hunt or after a battle and sometimes after an intense workout. For orcs knowing of past wars helps them when facing familiar foes. If an orc faces a strange foe he fights it and then chronicles his experience so the combat knowledge could be read and used in training regimens. Rilian grins at the sight. Surely his tribe does well by training the body and mind, even though it is solely for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rilian continued walking through the village the scent of food caught his nostrils. Various orcs were enbiggening the food supply to prepare for the feast. Rilian also noticed that the time of feasting drew near as his stomach roared to be fed. He then noticed the witch doctor carrying a totem towards the entrance, Rilian decided to ask her why she was doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings fair and wise witch doctor. What's up with the totem that you're carrying?\" Rilian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch doctor places the totem by down in a circular hole by the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Warlord Draxus. I'm placing this totem to ward off men who change into wolves under the moon. Lately they have been a plague among many people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian grunted in response. The rise of werewolves is a fairly new occurrence in the realm. If werewolves dared to invade Rilian would have to make sure his people were ready to fight back. Luckily he had some knowledge about werewolves. Now all he had to do was chronicle it and train orcs how to fight them for orcs rarely fought werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That silver totem should keep them out of the village, but I'll need to prepare counter measures if an incident of a werewolf attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch doctor nodded at Rilian's response. \"Well spoken warlord. The sun is about to set.Prepare for your feast for tonight will be a night of great gluttony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch doctor's words rang true. Unlike other species gluttony is acceptable among orcs. Obesity often granted orcs many health benefits such as fertility and increased strength. Orcs only faced health problems when malnourished since their bodies were engineered to be larger. Unlike other races orcs were also immune to all forms of poisons. It is often said that if an orc is in a human tavern that despite drinking large amounts of alcohol he would remain sober while other races would engage in drunken brawls. Yet again orc pheromones were the only substance that could cause orcs to go berserk.

If he could get a measurement of his body then it would be easier to know how many animals he'll have to skin in order to craft new armor and clothes. Once Rillian stops by the armorer and tailor he is greeted by two orcs. The orcs were husband and wife and they ran the place with only two of their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't warlord Rilian Draxus. I had a suspicion that you would be stopping by. The name's Crantor and this lovely orcess is Judia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what do we owe your presence?\" Judia asked the half naked orc before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going on a hunt tomorrow and I intend on having some additional armor made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well warlord. My daughter will show you to the back room so we can take your measurements. Iona! A good looking orc needs measurements for armor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds a 7'5\" female orc emerges from the backroom. She had an impressive amount of muscle and was clad in a set of silver armor. She looks over Rilian before motioning to him to follow her in the back room. Rilian then follows Iona to the back room. Once in the back room Rilian saw a giant wooden basin, an orc of of tall stature with massive muscles, and a huge mallet. Unlike other cultures orcs didn't use measuring tapes to get measurements. Instead they used a thick clay, mud, or some other substance to create a mold around their bodies. Orcs use the created molds to estimate how much they'll need to forge armor and craft clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your pants. We can't let the clay ruin them.\" The orc who Rillian guessed to be Iona's brother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then strips down completely. Rilian could feel the chill of the night time air on his nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now hop in the basin great warlord and lie flat on your face. Be sure to close your eyes. The clay is a pain to wash out. My triplet, Iona will start pouring in the clay. Once the clay hardens completely I Rex Maelstrom will use this mallet to finish the mold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRillian proceeds up the sturdy stool that leads into the basin. Once he is in the basin Rilian lies face down in the basin with his arms and legs an equal distance apart so that he could get accurate measurement. Once positioned Iona starts pouring in buckets of fresh hot clay. As clay came pouring in Rilian felt a sensation of pleasure. The fresh hot clay was refreshing. As more clay entered the basin Rilian's body rose until he was in the center of the basin. After that additional clay stacked up on his massive form. After five minutes Rilian's body was completely covered and engulfed by clay. As the clay hardened the only thing on Rilian's mind was the feast in his honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne half hour later the clay surrounding Rilian's body had completely hardened. The basin that Rilian was in was dismantled. All that stood in the basin's placed was Rilian's clay covered body. Rex and Iona were pleased by their handiwork. The mold that they have created will be the biggest that they have ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rex, why don't you free our warlord. He can't afford to miss the feast that is being held in his honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the feast can't start without him anyway, Iona. I just gotta find the sweet spot and the mold should split into two equal halves. From there the warlord should be able to free himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex picks up his mallet and feels around the mold for the weak spot. Once he finds the sweet spot he steadies a stake by plunging it into the mold and then strike it with all his strength. After the mold has been struck it splits perfectly all the way around. What he wasn't expect was for the upper half to slid off on its own. Once the upper half of the mold was removed Rilian got up and stretched his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was refreshing. Thanks for your service. Tomorrow I'll bring in as many pelts as I can carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure Warlord Draxus. We'll use this new mold to forge some armor for you. See ya at the feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then slips on his pants, pays Crantor and Judia for the mold creation, and heads off towards the feast. The moment Rilian stepped outside the smell of food was greater than it was earlier. Rilian grinned as his stomach let out a loud rumble. After arriving in the feasting hall Rilian felt another great surge of adrenaline. What could the source of this new adrenaline be?</span></div></div>",

There was also entertainment in the form of dancing, eating contests, Orc Mead drinking contests, and even the torturing of various captured enemies which included exploding gnome tossing, watching greedy humans beat each other up, feral elves, and transforming non-orcs into orcs by exposing them to orc sculptures made of wood and stone which were, ironically, Rilian's gifts for becoming the new warlord. The sculptures depicted obese, muscular, and well-endowed male orcs. Commonly known as fetishes these sculptures are imbued with magic. They gradually enhance orcs as they are exposed to them, but to non-orcs they transform them into orcs before they receive the huge benefits. Yet these newly transformed orcs are set at the bottom of orc society and have to fight their way up to respectable positions in orc society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian gave a sly grin as the amount of orc pheromones increased. Once exposed to their kind's pheromones it takes a while for them to think rationally in a group. Common sense is the first thing tossed aside in orc gatherings since many orcs seek pleasure above all else. Some say that the riled up condition is the equivalent of drunkenness, except orcs become extremely dangerous. Anyone who crosses a group of riled up orcs better hope that they can outrun them or defeat them since orcs are more likely to kidnap all who lose to them while in large groups. Rilian then proceeded to the spot of the table reserved for him. After he filled his gut he'll claim his sculptures and toss a few exploding gnomes. For the moment Rilian just felt like stuffing himself full of food and Orc Mead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the main feasting table Rilian starts chowing down and drinking Orc Mead by the bottle like the barbarian that he has become. As the young warlord gluts himself he watches several female orc battle dancers dance for his pleasure. After two hours of nonstop eating Rilian was almost full, but due to the high concentration of orc pheromones Rilian and several battle experienced orcs continued their gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Draxus, wanna *burp* see who can eat the most and drink the most Orc Mead? Winner gets first dibs on hunting spots.\" An orc six inches shorter than Rilian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but prepare for total annihilation!\" Rilian responded as he patted the huge green dome that he called his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompelled by their pheromone induced drive both orcs and a few other engage in an eating and drinking contest. As the contest went on Rilian crammed as much food into his fat face as possible and down entire bottles of Orc Mead to wash it all down. As Rilian ate more and more crumbs caked his face and exposed gut. If Rilian was still human such gorging would be inappropriate, but as an orc such gorging was celebrated and approved in orc society. The eating and drinking contest went on for three  hours. While the men were gorging the women gambled on who would win. The winner of the bet would lick the winner of the contest's stomach and face clean. In the end Rilian won. As warlord it was his duty to prove himself as a leader of his people. Yet Rillian was beyond full and he probably gained a good six pounds or so from his overindulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rilian heaved himself up the winner of the bet approach him. The female orc was known as Warlinda. She was by no doubt the biggest and strongest female orc in the entire village. She had just returned from a journey and decided to crash the festivities. Standing only an inch shorter than Rilian she made her way to the warlord while the other orc women wrestled each other for the runner up. Rilian slowly made his way to the gnome tossing area until he sensed the presence of a female. After turning around the female known as Warlinda began to lick his hairy stomach. The very act itself only aroused the warlord and caused the orc men to drop their activities and wrestle each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the sensuous action just caused Rilian's manhood to go erect. As Warlinda continued licking Rilian, Rilian himself was smitten with genuine love. By the time Warlinda finished licking Rilian's black beard clean his erection had faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to earn your warlord's affection, eh? I might have to hold a special competition. You may be sexy and strong, but you must prove yourself to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you milord must prove yourself on the hunt and battlefield first. You don't want to lose to a woman now. The name's Warlinda. I own the weapons shop in the village. I had my father man the shop while I was adventuring. As a commander of your troops their a small human city to the west. Within a month or two we should move out. The lord of the city has been using captive orcs and those born into captivity as mere slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. By then winter should be here. When the time is right we'll storm the city and liberate the captives from those ever greedy and foolish humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then enjoys the rest of the festivities of the feast. Rilian then gathers his gifted sculptures and heads back to his hut. Once in his hut Rilian puts the sculptures on a shelf by his bed and strips down until he's nude. Once fully nude Rilian lies on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew that being an orc could be exciting. Someday I'll get revenge on my father King Ivar, but before I do that I need to build an army of orc's that rivals that of Tryzantium. I also have to become the the biggest, strongest, and fattest orc around. Tomorrow I'll have the new orcs enlarge my living quarters. If they can build a bigger hut I may train them for my army. They were former human, elvin, dwarfish, or whatever race they were before they transformed into orcs. As long as I let them prove themselves I'm fulfilling my duties as warlord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then falls into a heavy slumber. As Rilian slept his body and the fetishes glowed as a sign that their magic would gradually enlarge him over time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month has passed since Rilian chose to live out his life as an orc and many changes have occurred since the day he became warlord. For starters he put the weakest orcs under a strict training regimen. While most warlords would not pay any heed to the weak, Rilian thought it would be more efficient to put the weakest orcs around in a remedial training program. Rilian put former Orc Warlord, Thrasher in charge due to his strict discipline in combat. Rilian was also known as the greatest hunter around for he managed to slay a single dragon by himself and this was due to the dragon attacking the village a month ago. His quickly building reputation caused the elves in the nearby forest to feign out of disgust. After proving himself on the hunting grounds Rilian was ready to conduct war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter has arrived and the humans of the village that Warlinda mentioned would be vulnerable. Since his arrival Rilian has grown noticeably taller, stronger, and fatter all around. Now standing at 9'2\" weighing 891 lbs. Rilian Draxus was a sight to behold. Due to spending a month among orcs Rilian truly behaved like any other orc male when around others. When around other orcs it took six hours before Rilian's intelligence would normalize to the levels that he possessed while he was alone. One time when Rilian was with his fellow orcs he foolishly made an explosive compound that almost burned down the entire village. Yet from that foolish mistake arose a new weapon of war. After the fire was put out and the loss of a few prisoners Rilian regained enough of his intelligence to write down the ingredients used for the bomb. Yet it took a near fatal incident to an orc woman to discover how to properly mix the ingredients for battle. Once the method was learned the orcs practiced the method on their prisoners. Of course every time it was practiced the entire village had to be rebuilt. The only victims were the prisoners themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Rilian was busy eating a hearty meal. Like always Rilian was eating more than his stomach could handle. Rilian sat nude in his bigger hut eating with abandon. As his fat and muscular arms pick up food to cram into his fat face they jiggled slightly. Every time Rilian ate he would eat crumbs and stains all over his body. Yet Rilian used clothing he had outgrown to wipe himself off or he would take a refreshing mud bath. As Rilian ate he rubbed his stomach with his strong hands. After he finished eating Rilian lumbered to his restroom for his mud bath. Once in the restroom Rilian admired himself in the mirror. When Rilian looked in the crystal mirror he saw a powerful orc staring back at him. This orc was his reflection. By his reflection Rillian was starting to develop a fourth chin. His cheeks had a bloated appearance. Rillian waist was roughly 80 or so inches wide yet his flabby gut showed signed of developing into a strange looking, but strong muscular and fat 8-pack. His legs were huge and meaty, jam packed with muscle and flab. His butt was huge, but his gut was truly the biggest part of his whole body. And of course his manhood was a few inches longer, yet his gut clearly covered it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day when this warlord liberates his people from Shirewood. No one uses my people as slaves. After a successful raid I'll throw a contest to see who the strongest female orc is. After thre or six months of courting we'll marry.\" Rilian said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian grins in the mirror. His teeth and tusks shine brilliantly. Apparently orcs didn't suffer any dental problems except for the occasional missing tooth, but that's usually caused by getting punched in the face. Rilian lowers himself into a large basin made of clay. He then pull a pulley that dumps fresh mud from the swamp. Rilian's people had managed to create some sort of circulation system that takes mud from the swamp and returns it to the swamp after use. Yet it wasn't easy setting up for many brave orcs were attacked by the swamp monster. The monster would use its sucker tentacles and leech of an orc's strength. The result would be a malnourished orc who would die of health complications, get treated as an outcast until they recovered, or they would set off on a journey and bulk back up to a larger size. Once the orcs are healthily bulked up they either return to the village with new war stories or they start new orc settlements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrc scholars are usually baffled as to why these swamp monsters inhabit swamps, but regardless of the species of their victims they always drain them dry. Yet when it comes to matters like these Rilian uses his boot camp to rectify the massive loss of girth, yet some orcs do leave for a week or two to scout out new territories but they usually return bigger than before. That's another thing that baffles orc scholars. Yet these scholars are currently looking into ways of reducing this problem among orcs, but they can't agree on what approach to take and usually windup beating each other up instead. After bathing Rilian puts on his armor and gets ready to set out.</span></div></div>",

After gathering more than enough orcs to topple a small city Rillian and his army marched towards, Dakford, the city where a human overlord has been using orcs for slave labor. After a good thirty minutes of walking Rillian and his troops arrive at Dakford. Before he commands his troops to attack Rillian steps in front of his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention my fellow orcs! Today marks a new era for orc kind. No longer will we let small humans enslave us with their magic and wits. Today we'll add to our numbers by liberating our fellows and eventually uniting all of the orc tribes! What I promise you is a kingdom where we orcs can grow and prosper! Now let's go down there and make our dream a reality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orcs let out a war cry after hearing Rilian's speech and proceed to march down to the village. What Rillian said was true. If he wanted his plot for revenge against his father to be realized he needed to strive towards making the orcs a unified nation that served him. It didn't take long for Rillian's army to conquer the village or to take in some prisoners. Those that Rillian viewed as not a threat were free to go, but at the size of an insect that is. The others would be either be executed for their crimes against orc kind or whatever other harsh punishment Rillian could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rillian pillaged a house he saw something peculiar. It was a ring with a strange insignia. As soon as he picked up the ring and put it on his finger he immediately transformed in a human, his former species. However, a half orc was hiding  behind the house when he witnessed the bizarre transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ring somehow turned me back into a human. This may come in handy in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRillian takes off the ring and transforms back into his orchish self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. I'll have to learn more about this ring if I intend on using this to spy on my enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRillian then catches the scent of the half orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself! I can totally smell you ya know!\" Rilian yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half orc cautiously enters the house. He then bows before Rilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? It's clear that you're a half breed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Titus Stone. My mother was a human who had sex with an orc slave. However, I have been used as a slave all of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so Titus? Then you probably know my secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret? You mean when you transformed into Rilian of Tryzantium? Are you telling me...\" Rilian cuts Titus off so he can keep his secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud. It's too early for these orcs to know the truth. The orc you see before you is the result of a trip to the Lost Temple of Seasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense. My mother was a witch who specialized in transformation magic. Her Ring of Forms allows anyone to become any species they think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking about humiliating King Ivar and to get revenge after all the hell he put me through by not bothering to search for me when I was Luna's prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains a lot. Especially why you raided this village. So what are you gonna do with a half orc like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something in mind. But we'll discuss that...\"</span></div></div>",

Looks like elements. A flame for fire. A thunderbolt for energy and storms, i assume. A tree for nature, or maybe earth, if not both. The skull for necromancy.. That would be a terrific power, as a dragon. The waves for water. The sun is probably light, so the moon would represent the darkness.. Hmm.. The snowflake would represent ice. And the shield..

Nine mists pours off the remaining of the relic, causing the human to stumble backward. But before he could regret it, eight of the nine mists suddenly rushes at him, seemingly getting absorbed. He rolls onto his belly, and feels compelled to stretch his body, while standing on all four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold feeling goes through his body as he could feel the fat in his body getting burnt away painlessly, getting remplaced by wiry, powerful muscles. His legs bends backward, reshaping into their draconic counterpart while his arms follows a similar fashion, before his hands and feet transform into three-clawed-toed talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian grunts as he feels his cock throbbing, before it shrinks back into his body, progressively reshaping itself into a clitless cunt, followed by his.. Now her backside, plumping you ever so slightly, before a tail painfully sprouts from it, lengthening and flexing with nimbleness and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck lengthen out, her skull loudly reshaping itself, with snapping sounds, into a more reptilian frame, causing her nose and mouth to lengthen out into a long snout and maw, filling up with sharp teeth. Then, her neck thickens up, before splitting itself into nine necks, each added neck finishing up into more dragon heads, much like the smashed statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach added head had their own specificities: The flame dragoness has a flame on to of her head, and bolsters crimson scales. The energy dragoness has row of small horns onto the back of her head, with two bigger ones curving forward. The nature dragoness bolsters a pair of large horns, curving downward then forward, while having a soil-colored scaled skin. The necromancer dragoness is.. Nothing more but bones, her bony neck attached to your fleshy body. The water dragoness doesn't bolsters any horns. Rather, her snout is more arrow-shaped, and bolsters fins onto the bottom of it, all covered in azur scales. The light dragoness bolsters two horns, while her head is actually covered by a white-colored helmet. Her scales are softly yellow colored, leaning closely to the sun's color. The darkness dragoness bolsters no horns, as well as deeply black scales. And lastly, the ice dragoness bolsters two curved horns, as well as a light blue scaled skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian had grown up a bit, during the transformation, roughly 10 ft tall, but he still had the last mist in sight, of a pure white color. It takes a misty shape of a dragoness, easily three times bigger than her! She shivers, of fear, and tries to back up, but, rather than to be harmed than the misty dragoness, she.. Smiles and headrubs Rilian fondly, before her misty frame blurrs up, getting absorbed in a similar manner as the other mists. Rilian suddenly feels overpowered and roars loudly, before she falls into slumber, caused by the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets woken up by a voice, the same that she heard when she first went inside, 'You've been reborn as a dragon. So shall your season start now. Perhaps we will meet again.'. She shake her head and spots a large mirror. She notices that the scales of her neck and of her body are of a pure white, much like the misty dragoness. She is also taller, given she felt more confined in the room. But then, what shocked her the most is the healthy and huge pair of breasts that stood on her chest. She tentatively rubs them with a paw, causing her to blush and to make the other dragonesses to growl mixed answers. Rilian complains, 'Give me some slack! I'm still getting used to this new body..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes more time to check out her body, when she notices some light. She decides to follow it, eventually managing to lead off the temple. 'Time to make things change!'.</span></div></div>",

All three looks humanoid, the third one being a drider. The first spider bolsters breasts, implying a female, while the two others doesn't give any hint of sexuality. And while all three have spidery abdomens, only the spiders' have a symbol onto it, respectively a web and a tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Three relics of spiders. With one of them being a drider. Beings with the upper body of an elf, and the bottom of a spider, they were living alongside, but eventually got exiled away. Rumors are that the driders were elves that got cursed for using forbidden spells,  revealing their true nature, and that, over time, would have fallen prey to their dark side. Nowadays, Driders are rare and few, hiding in dark forests and marshes, catching their unsuspecting preys in silky, or rubbery webs. There's been reports of human cannibalization, and on rarer occasions, mating between males of other races and female driders. Some say the matriarchs, the elder female driders retained her magical prowlesses, while their male counterparts are known for being tough opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that the web and the tear represents silk and rubber, and that i would be sure to be a female if i break the female representation, while i wouldn't be able to tell if i would still have any sexual bits with the two others. The unisex relics looks like they'd be some kind of deities from some dark race, implying experience and, in the drider's case, strong means. But the female looks so young.. Barely 17 years old if she was a human. And while the drider is the most imposing out of the three, the female has the biggest abdomen.. Intriging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of what i'd pick, some will consider me as a monster, and living among humans would probably become near impossible. Except maybe with the female.. But if i want my revenge, picking one of the deities would certainly give me the means to bring that old fool down. On the other hand, if i pick the female, i could more or less start a new life, fresh..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.. If i resume.. If i pick the female, i could more or less do everything that would allow this young body. If i pick the other spider, i would probably have to leave Tryzantium, exiled, but be able to live among other peoples, if i'm careful enough.

Feeling cheated, he was about to smash the two other spider relics, as well as all that would fall onto his hands, when a familiar voice can be heard, 'Very well. You shall begin your new season as a spider. May you thrive in your new life.'. Before he could do anything more, a blinding flash of light spreads in the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian had fainted out, given he's waking up, strangely enough onto the grass. He urghs, shaking his head before he stands up. In front of him, he notices a cotton tunic, a leather vest and leather pants, which would be more fitting a woman than a man.. There is also a one-handed bronze sword, an iron-wrought spear with a weird dragon symbol symbol on its tip, a leather satchel, a seemingly full purse and a roll of paper, sealed with the same weird symbol. He grabs the roll of paper and not-so-subtilely tear the seal off, then reads its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey there. Found you out cold. I wonder why you were alone, unconscious, so i moved and protected you. I've left some equipment for your needs. Call it a 'Welcoming' gift! Anyway.. How's  the little spider? Fine, i hope! Because i'd really want to meet you again. Don't die 'til then, okay?<br>\r\nNote: 's not good to be outside, completely nude. I know that some people ain't into bugs, but out of desperation, they ain't picky!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe folds the paper, out of anger, and spit, 'Little spider!? Who he-..'. Rilian blinks. His voice sounded oddly feminine, and his hand are.. Different. Delicate and humanoid in shape, covered in a black chitin, shining under the sun. He decides to peers on his, or rather, on her body, as she notices a generous pair of of E-cup breasts, that she couldn't be helped but to heft and to grope them, blushing at the unknown feeling. Reminding herself that she's nude, she, half-unwillingly, breaks up her own groping to peer at the rest of her body. Her body is lean and athletic, similar to a human, excluding the softly silvery and fuzzy fur on most of her body, while her breasts and belly are of a scaled white. Her shoulders, ankles and knees are exoskeletic, visible through her fuzzy skin. Her legs are thicker than normal, ending in large and powerful feet, ending in thick, chitinous toes, one per feet, giving her a sure footing to compensate the weight of her large abdomen, standing just on top of a firm butt. Knowing that she couldn't see her own face without a mirror, she grasps her head with her own hands. Her head is human in shape, without the ears nor a nose, merely remplaced by two holes for breathing. Finally, two pointy mandibles stands besides her now filled with sharp teeth mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs, as she grabs her new belongings, wearing up the clothing and leather armor, then growls, 'Why the vest and tunic are too short!?'. She tentatively tugs on them, to no avail. She grabs the weapons and puts them into their proper scabbards, wear the leather satchel and places the purse in it, after checking it was fu of money. 'I swear i'll make regret whoever made me wear this tunic and vest! I'm supposed to be a prince for sake! Not a random furred bimbo..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checks that she got everything set, and follows the road up, given she was near one. To a fault of knowing where she is, she could at least find a village or a town, and tempt her luck. She didn't wanted to go straight away for the kind, given she was nobody, she would need at least a small army for that.. Or competent mercenaries. And given her means, she'd have to start small..</span></div></div>",

She moves toward one of the gates, opened up for casual passage and merchants. Two human guards in heavy armor guarding the outside part of the pathway, equipped with long spears, standing proudly, being both 6 ft tall. That's when she notices she is 7 ft tall and 2 inches tall, given she's towering over the guards that blocked her the access in town with their spear. One of the guards says, 'Halt! State your business here, exotic.'. 'Rilian exclaims, 'Exotic!?'. 'Yes. Spiders as cute and beautiful as you ain't common 'round thoses parts.'. Rilian grumbles, 'I'm just an adventurer! I need to make some money to eat.'. 'Note that unauthorized weapons aren't allowed in and that-..'. He stops as the other guard whispers, inaudibly for her, while they keep you in sight, not visibly trusting you, despite that they are seemingly charmed by her looks. Getting impatient, she crosses her arms on her chest and repeatedly tap her feet on the ground. They stop whispering up, and pulls their spear away. 'You may pass, but before you go..'. 'Hrm!?'. 'Don't you want someone to accompany you..? Women like you shouldn't be roaming around alone in town.'. Rilian couldn't quite understand why they would let her pass just like that, but she had better things to do than to bother about mere details. She says, 'Oh? Heh. Don't worry. I can handle myself just fine.'. 'Don't cause any troubles, will you?'. Rilian shrugs it off and enters the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian has the feeling that she knew the town, as she steps in, without remembering why, given she lost the notion of time and space thanks to that maddened princess Luna. And to a fault of knowing the whereabouts of Tryzantium, she would at least tempt her luck at gathering informations at a tavern. Men are more prone to speak up after a good bottle after all. Or at least, she'd try to, if perverts doesn't get the best of her, giving she notices an abnormal amounts of lusty gazes. But she would've be going on her merry way, if she didn't got interpellated by a man. 'There you are!'. She turns back and takes a step back, a hand on the guard of her sword, when she spots who spoke to her. A male human, 30-years something, 5 ft 11 inches, plated chestplate, iron-reinforced leather pants and boots, and a two-handed sword on his back. His brown hair are cut short, on top of a visage toughened by years of harsh living, it seems, paired with a visible musculature. Rilian asks, 'What do you want from me.'. 'To speak a bit, as a friend.'. 'Prove it.'. The man grabs his own sword, causing Rilian to draw her sword out. But then, the man doesn't pull it fully, only enough to show off a symbol on the blade, the same on her spear. She tsks and says, 'Fine..', then she puts her sword back in her scabbard. He does the same with his sword before he moves past her, 'Follow me.'. She does and notices that their little stunt attracted quite the crowd, now leaving away to their own lives, some sighing, some giving angry gazes toward the man. Some of them wanted a fight. Or to fuck her senseless. Still, what bothered her the most is who was this man, given he certainly had quite the reputation here, from what she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man leads Rilian to the 'Drunken dead horse', making her ask, 'The Drunken dead horse?'. 'They say their specialty would wake up a dead horse, but i've never tried that personally.'. The building looks like it had been recently renovated, large and well-kept, with its own stables. Rilian replies, 'And how i'm supposed to believe you?'. 'Ask whoever survived it.'. 'Survived!?'. 'By that, i don't mean killed, even if it already occurred. I'm actually implying that you should ask whoever remember what they did before they woke up in a bed.'. 'What about you.'. 'Not stupid enough to dare.'. 'Bah!'. 'Heh.'. They head inside. The place is filled up with tables with occupied chairs by various beings, not paying any attention to the newcomers. They take places at one of the rare unoccupied tables and sits up on chairs. The man calls one of the servants, a female human, and orders up, 'Two be-..'. Rilian says, 'No beer.'. The man peers at Rilian then says, 'A beer and a glass of water, then.'. 'Don't you have something more tasteful!?'. 'Don't act like you own the world, little girl.'. Rilian grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant comes back with a chop of beer and a glass of water. The man gives a gold coin to the servant, which smile and silently thanks him, before she goes back to work. Rilian says, 'What was that.'. The man smirks, 'A little gift in this rotten world.'. 'Why.'. 'To teach you a few things.'. 'Hrm!?'. 'I'm here to judge and to protect you for the time being.'. 'Who's paying you.'. 'The same that helped you.'. 'Let me see him at once!'. 'Why?'. 'Thoses clothings are too tight!'. 'Oh? But i believe they look right on you. It shows your cute bellybutton.~ Even if you're not my type.'. 'What do you mean by \"Not my type\"?'. 'I prefer.. Humans. Delicate, smiling, motherly and patient. A woman that i would live with and have a family.'. 'Are you seriously implying that i'm ruthless and brutish!?'. 'Heh. Don't prove me right.'. Rilian grumbles and takes a sip of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you expect from me.'. The man smiles, 'I don't know. You're special. That much i can tell. Surely you'll be bound to greatness. I'm even tempted to put myself at your service! But i would first need to know you better.'. Rilian frowns, 'What about your master?'. 'I'm not bound to him by anything. I'm just following his directives because he pays me and that i accepted to work for him.'. 'And when i would meet him..?'. 'Two weeks at most. That's when i would decide if i join you or not.'. 'Aren't you afraid of what you'd risk if you decide to leave his services momentarily?'. 'Not at all. 'sides, i'm doing what he wants, so far.'. 'If you say so..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue to speak up, mostly to keep Rilian's informations up, before they decides to move out of the tavern, to seek an inn, given all the rooms in the tavern are already taken. Given the lack of available room for the night, they end up sharing up a room that they found out, paying up for the night, before they both lead in it. The room was alright, with an oil lamp on a wooden desk, a bed for a person and a window leading outside. Alright, in this case, meaning clean, given not all room were properly cleaned up..<br>\r\nRilian asks, Given we will be together for a moment.. What's your name?'. 'Christan. Yours?'. 'I'm.. Prince Rilian, of the royal family of Tryzantium.'. Christan blinks, 'But Rilian's an human!'. Rilian frowns, 'Do i look like i'm lying!?'. Christan blinks again, 'No.. But then.. What happened?'. 'As you know, princesw Luna kidnapped me so i would marry her. Given i refused, she spiked my food with weight gaining reagents so i wouldn't escape, on top of a tight watching. But one day, i did managed to flee, despite a bothersome bulk, and got trapped in a temple full of relics. A voice told me that i could leave if i smashed one of them. I did, and last i remember is a flash, before i woke up outside, besides the stuff i have.'. 'Very interesting. I'm sure my master would be very delighted to know that!'. 'Fweh..'. 'Two questions. What do you intend to do, and do you think that people would recognize you?'. 'Good point.. Well.. I intend to force into exil that fool that is my father! Far from Tryzantium, preferably. As for the second point.. I'd need my family's help for that matter..'. 'Until then, you should use another name.'. 'Like what?'. 'Xialamelya.'. 'Sounds.. Exotic.'. 'Like you.'. 'Right..'.</span></div></div>",

You will not remember nor miss your humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rillian could reply the area around him became distorted. He also began to become a Blorogon. As he transformed his memories were replaced with those of griwing up a Blorogon. In a flash of light Rilian transformed into a Blorogon and the fabric of reality had changed itself. Even the species of his family changed along with their personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ivar the Kahuna</b>: In this reality Ivar is the first king of the Blorogon kingdom. After being fed up with Blorogon tribal politics Ivar decided to unite the tribes into a kingdom. He did so by learning about sumo wrestling from the humans living in Bishan. Doing so has made him one of the largest Blorogons in history. Most of his subjects call Ivar a kahuna because of his love for surfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Helena the Dancer</b>: In this reality Queen Helena is a Blorogon dancer from a different tribe. Her dancing caught Ivar's eye years ago. It wasn't until Ivar bested Helena's father in a sumo match that they were allowed to wed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rilian the Mighty</b>: Due to breaking the Blorogon relic, Rilian's personal history has changed. Ever since he was a boy Rillian loved to seek out adventure. As a result he's served as a diplomat to other races and kingdoms. Rilian hopes to surpass his father in size and weight. He is also searching for a wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Isabella the Huntress</b>: In this reality Isabella is a mighty huntress. Her hunting prowess has caused many Blorogon suitors to ask for her hand in marriage. However, she rejected every proposal and made a declaration that she will only get married after her 23rd birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Edward the Sadist</b>: In this reality Edward is a cruel sadist who enjoys torturing others fir his entertainment. He even went so far to create a cult where his folloers must inflict pain on others in order to please him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emma the Traditionalist</b>: Unlike the rest of her family, Emma has a tradition view on Blorogon culture. Her traditionalist views are so strong that she gets on the nerves of her family. Like the Emma in the other reality she is a brave woman, but instead of picking up a sword she prefers using weapons that are traditionally used for Blorogon gladiator fights and other Blorogon sports apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Anders</b>: In this reality Prince Anders is a carefree Blorogon child. He hasn't decided what he wants to be, but he admires his father and Rilian. He despises his older brother Edward due to being bullied by the sadist on numerous occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the breakdown of Rillian's new life and reality Rillian was sleeping in his room until he heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to meet another suitor milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRillian yawns and strecthes.

Yet Edward believes that Rillian either got amnesia, turned into some horrible beast, or kidnapped by a psychotic woman who refuses to let him go until he agrees to marry her. Edward shivers at the thought. As Edward continued to pray, the candles were light by a golden pink flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward, why do you cry my child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward looks up and sees a young motherly woman dressed in a gold and pink dress.

He stares closer and realises that the scant facial hair that his father demanded he attempt to cultivate on his chin and upper lip is now floating in the holy font.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches his hands to his cheeks in surprise. The skin there is baby smooth. He fulls open the neck of his shirt. Again, his chest is smoother than marble. His fingers glide over the surface.

He swallows hard. \"Of cc-ourse, o-oh Goddess,\" he stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward can barely focus. He thinks back to his schooling and the words of the Mother Superior. He begins to recite, \"A<i>h-and it did come to puh-pass that Jezebel came unto the city of Jerash. And within Jerash she did find the townspeople starving, such that even the milk had dried in the mothers' breast.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingertips were now circling his nipples. Edward feels an odd tightness there and looks down to see two small mounds begin to swell beneath her touch. Faithfully he continues to recite, \"<i>And Jezebel did part her robes, and draw the men and the women and the children unto her b-bosom. And she did say, 'Drink of my milk, for it is my body.' And the townspeople did drink and were made well</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small buds have grown to such a size that they could be mistaken for anything but breasts, and generous ones at that. He can feel the weight of them pulling against his chest, though they do not sag, rather seem as perky as a maiden's yet as swollen as a mother's. His nipples stretch with the flesh, looking huge. The Holy Goddess begins to massage them, kneading her magic deep into the flesh. And even still they continue to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And unto Jezebel came all the men and the women and the children of Jerash, all forty thousand of them, and many who came back for seconds, and the bosom of Jezebel was as like a fountain, and the spirit of the Mother did fill their bellies and make them well. Such is the Blessing of the Holy Succor</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward places his hands on the stone lip of the font to steady himself, the heavy weight of his breasts dragging him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. You have learned your scripture well,\" She croons, her voice soft and close in his ear. \"Now you see how you are to lead my soldiers. For they say that an army marches upon its stomach. But in your case they will march on your chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward can hardly believe his ears. \"You want me to be a-a.... milk sow for an entire army?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just your army,\" She says firmly. \"For all who come seeking the Mother's milk must be granted it. Lest you incur my displeasure. Furthermore, I do not <i>want</i> it,\" the Goddess states haughtily. \"I <i>demand</i> it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis strength finally gives out as the weight of the massive mammaries fighting for space on his narrow chest pulls him forward and down, headfirst into the font. He fights to pull himself to the surface, only to grab a sip of air before the water closes over his head again. Just as he is about to drown, he remembers his wings. With a single flap, he bursts from the water and lands chest-first in a soggy heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess is gone, the candles in the chapel extinguished. Dumbfounded he stares at his tits, crossing his arms beneath them to support them.  The water runs from the impossibly smooth skin in beads and in an instant they are dry. The skin across his chest feels tight, swollen, like he could burst open. Tentatively he squeezes them. A droplet of golden mana forms and hangs from his nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of forty thousand grizzled, hardened soldiers suckling on them fills his mind. He utters a oath.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't do to sit in the boy's lap in full plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two men in Edward's company already, enjoying their daily rations fresh from the prince's generous breasts. The Captain dawdled awkwardly for his turn, grateful that there was not a queue this day, but Edward noticed him with some relief and ushered the soldiers away. They left, wiping their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Derwin, how wonderful to see you again. I was wondering how my war progresses,\" Edward beamed, readjusting his clothing to support, though not conceal, has vast breasts now that they were no longer being held up by the hands of the soldiers. \"You, uh, look hungry. Fighting must be hungry work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men were blushing. Strange, they had been going through this routine every day, ever since the rations ran out weeks ago, though it never become normal for either of them. Derwin's stomach rumbled as he stared at the boys majestic bosom, and he found himself licking his lips involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is, my la-lord,\" Derwin grumbled, awkwardly taking a seat beside the prince. Despite his station, he always felt uncomfortable within the presence of nobility, even more now that the young man's swollen breasts were rubbing against his arm. Edward sensed the uncomfortable situation and his body reacted instinctively to sooth the man, wrapping its angelic wings around the shoulders of the tired soldier. Derwin felt himself engulfed in a gossamer-soft cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The campaign goes well. We have pushed deeper into these godless lands than anyone has ever before, even the lost 7th legion. The men are in good spirits and good health, largely thanks to you-\" His eyes flickered down. \"-contributions. Normally our supplies would have been exhausted by now, and the men would be succumbing to any number of maladies. An army marches on its stomach, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or my chest,\" Edward sighed, considering his lot in life and the sacrifices to his pride he had made in the name of the Goddess. With a resigned tone, he said, \"well there's no point standing on ceremony here, Captain. I <i>do</i> have ten thousand men to feed today after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, your Highness,\" Derwin nodded. He leaned down, his head almost swallowed up within the prince's vast tits, fortunately concealing the young man's face such that they were not required to make eye contact as he maneuvered his mouth about one of his nipples. All at once, Derwin felt the hot, invigorating manna begin to flow into his mouth and sensed the shiver of pleasurable release pass through Edward's body that he always tried to hide and which the Captain always pretended not to notice.</span></div></div>",

It was like staring into the sun, so great was her beauty, but he found her could not look away. She was radiant, the Goddess Complete, all three aspects of her present in one form and in perfect harmony, standing here before him, right now, on the mortal plane. The sweetness, innocence and purity of the Maiden somehow did not conflict with the oozing, mature sexuality of the Mother, nor the wisdom and experience of the Crone. He felt a physical force of compassion and kindness emanating from her, enveloping him, a sensation he hadn't felt since his time in the womb, and knew everything was right with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess' voice was sweetness and light as she prepared to bestow upon her champion a second boon. \"But my gift is not finished  yet, my child.

A second set of chains formed out of the empty air to bind her wrists, and joined together to force her arms behind her back. Coarse hesian ropes spring into existence about her torso, as growing obscenely tight as to almost cut into her flesh, as they wove a complex lattice about her body. The breasts were spared, slowed to jut free from two gaps left in the mesh of rope, though painfully constricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout her slender neck, a thick leather collar.

Fortunately, there was a backdoor behind the altar. As Edward runs for his life he felt sorrow for his younger brother. Anders is merely a nine year old child. He knows nothing about running a kingdom and believes that everything is a game. After going through the backdoor Edward runs down a long corridor. Upon reaching the end Edward tries to open the door. Unfortunately, his had thought of that possibility and had blocked the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward shuddered in fear as the flames drew ever closer.

Through the heat Edward could see the shape of two majestic wings upon its back, beating back the flames. An angel sent to save him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stepped clear from the edge of the fire, embers falling from wings of black leather. Edward cried to see it was no angel, but a tiefling, a spawn of hell. The fire licked at his back. Though he did not feel it, the rest could not be said for his attire as the last blackened scraps of his clothing fell from his body, revealing an athletic form of crimson-coloured flesh. A thick serpentine tail whipped about him, while an even thicker appendage hung between his legs. Edward couldn't help but stare at the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward raised the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiefling reached for the dagger on his belt and found his belt was long gone and the dagger with it.The only thing on his person that was entirely untouched by the flames was a small satchel on his hip. He gave a dry chuckle. \"Well I don't have my weapon and you don't look like you know how to use that thing, so let's say we call it a draw,\" the tiefling said, nimbly sidestepping a falling chunk of burning timber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes prior, in the library that ran adjacent to the temple, all was quiet. Today was the Festival of Saint Valentina and even the clerks and librarians of the church had been called into the town to officiate the hundreds of impromptu weddings that marked the culmination of the celebrations. Only the sound of leathery wings outside disturbed the silence as Zarrut the Thief leaped from a gargoyle head and glided in to land upon the sill of one of the high, stained-glass windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steadied, flattening himself against the window to hide from the view of the guards patrolling the grounds below. \"I thought I tucked you away before I started,\" he snapped to his monstrous member, the bulge of which was now pressed against the glass and meant his tail stuck out over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany feet below, the guard lingered. Zarrut waited. The guard lit a cigarette. Zarrut waited. A second guard approached the first, with the command, \"stand down your patrol. The king needs us. The prince dies tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drew their swords and left. Gripping the stone sides of the window, Zarrut leaned back and looked down so that the sharpened points of his horns just touched the glass. With a crack of vertebrae he twisted his head 180 degrees, his horns carving a perfect circle in the glass, which popped out cleanly. He snatched it from the air before it could shatter on the sill. The wonderful smell of expensive parchment, oak and wax flowed through the hole cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he needed to do was get through a hole smaller than his head. He unslung the satchel from his shoulder. The satchel had once been sequinned and stitched with brightly-coloured thread proudly declaring it to be a 'Bag of Holding' but he had seen fit to cut away the sequins and died it a less eyecatching black after stealing it. He laid it at his feet and stepped into it, wriggling his entire body into the extradimensional space within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satchel wriggled on the windowsill to line itself up, then leaped straight through the hole in the window. It flew across the interior of the library, bounced off a bookcase and came to rest on a stack of books, disgorging a shaken tiefling a moment later. He straightened his jacket, ran fingers through his ruffled obsidian-coloured hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lit a candle. His silken shoes made no noise as he hurried down the rows of shelves. \"E for Elder?\" he muttered to himself. \"Or T for Tome. No, they're all tomes, that's stupid. Or P for Prophecy,\" he grinned as his gaze fell upon one book, larger than the rest with gilded binding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Elder Tome,\" he breathed, heaving the thing from the shelf and setting it on the table. Its cover was embellished with religious imagery - the Mother birthing the world, the Maiden throwing out souls like confetti to the new creatures, and the Crone knitting together the threads of fate in the background like a grandmother making a scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was the design she had used. Like most tieflings, Zarrut was no religious man but even he was awed. In here was written the past, present and <i>future</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis employer had been clear. <i>Get the tome. Do not look in it. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One glance couldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clasp smarted his fingers at the touch but came open smoothly. The tome fell open with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wut. Well I can't say I was expecting that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a double-page spread, a single image spread across two pages.

Lately the nine year old prince has been acting out more than usual. Most people assume that Rilian's absence fostered some built up resentment deep inside towards his father. Others say that it's just a phase. Whatever the cause may be all of the nobles agree that Anders is too immature to be heir to the throne and many believe that Ivar may be insane, The last few months the nobles kept their thoughts to themselves lest they incur the wrath of their king or that's the rumors that Anders has been hearing as the maids and butlers gossip while working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnders greatest prank was directed at his father. The prank was fairly simple and straightforward. Anders has managed to smuggle a piece of cake from the kitchen. He then laced the cake with some kind of potion that he stole from Janus's workshop. After pouring the potion onto the piece of cake Anders casually walks up to his father in his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pops, a got you some cake from the kitchen.

I was about to have someone fetch me a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar looks at the cake and sees that the cake is a pound cake with drizzled with a chocolate sauce, except it wasn't chocolate sauce though. What Ivar perceived as chocolate sauce was actually the potion. In almost no time Ivar demolishes the cake. Anders watches in anticipation to see if his practical joke worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good cake, yet something...\" Before Ivar could finish speaking he writhes over in pain as the potion takes effect. A mischievous grin forms on Anders face, \"Wha... What did you... do... to that cake!\" Ivar groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my prank is working on you old man.

It would also give us a chance to grow old together all over again. Plus I secretly wanted to have some fat sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnders cringes at what he hears. His father is actually willing to spend time with his mother. Clearly the massive man who sounded like his father clearly scared Anders. Such a radical change in his father's behavior would clearly creep out other people too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Go ahead sire. I'm willing to study how this transformation plays out. Well, until I can make a reversal potion for the inverse potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make the potion friend, but I won't take it. There's so much I have to make right. This new and larger bod represents my rebirth. As a younger and fatter man I can experience life all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar then stretches out a large meaty hand. Janus then cautiously shakes Ivar's hand. He also gives Ivar the deaging potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care Lord Ivar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar then waddles out of the room. Janus glares evilly at Anders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll get to help me test the reverse potion to that Inverse Potion. It just so happens that this frog transformation of yours wears off just in time.\"</span></div></div>",

People would of figured that a female guard would keep the perverted playgirl princess in check, but Isabella has learned to sneak about the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, the places where she went were the same places that her father would hide his lovers. This only drove Ivar to lock Isabella in her room all day and all night. Yet Isabella proved too crafty and would escape by jumping out her window and onto the roof or by picking the lock with her hairpins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father had arranged her to wed Prince Roberto of Ordania. However, Isabella didn't want to wait a week for some foreign prince. She wanted to have sex now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight she was planning on eloping with the captain of the guard, who was a close friend of Rilian. Yet with Rilian missing, most likely prisoner to some deranged beauty who has her own kingdom or something, Ivar saw this as an opportunity to wed Isabella off as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location were they would elope was an abandoned house at the edge of town. After climbing out through the window and avoiding the female guards patrolling the area Isabella snuck her way to the abandoned house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she arrived, her lover was waiting by the door. Upon seeing Liam she embraces him with a hug and a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we elope we'll be man and wife. The sorceress is waiting for us my lovely lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us elope my handsome knight. By doing this we shall become one my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella and her lover enter the house. After entering they see the sorceress and what they assumed to be a handmaiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome toung ones. I am Janice Smeade the sorceress. This lovely handmaiden Ivanna. Say hello Ivanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvanna mumbles something incoherent under her breath. Isabella and Liam kiss each other. This causes Ivanna to let out a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does your handmaiden not speak? Surely she must enjoy weddings. Even if we are eloping though.\" Isabella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivanna is just jealous because she had a loveless wedding. The poir soul had even taken up a life a life of prostitution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up bitch! My love life is my own! If you dare tell anymore I'll beat you to a bloody pulp!\" Ivanna yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivanna, mind your manners. Please forgive my handmaiden. She proned to violent outbursts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis howevet, made Princess Isabella uncomfortable. There was something oddly familiar about this pair. Her gut told her that she and Liam should leave immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, that handmaiden gives ne the creeps. She reminds me too much of a certain someone.\" Isabella whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're overreacting. Sure that... Why os that handmaiden grinding an ax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella and Liam decide to run away, but Janice froze them with one of her spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop grinding the ax now. These would have been elopers can't get away now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now undo this glamour spell before I kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an incantation Janice and Ivanna turn into Janus and Ivar. Isabella's eyes grow wide in terror. She had been played this entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you could pull a fast on me. As I have stated befire you're marrying Prince Roberto and that's final. As for Liam I expected better. How should I punish you. I know how you should be punished. Janus, turn this man into the dog he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus utters an incantation.  Isabella's eyes look on in horror as her lover is transformed into a dog. The dog that used to be a man starts wagging his tail and starts barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wretched monster! How dare you lecture me on remaining sexually pure when you yourself make out with whores! I wouldn't have these urges if it wasn't for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!

Isabella's hand moved unconsciously down and began to stroke around her clitoris in a rough manner. Rays of ecstasy rippled through her body as she quickly came (one of the few benefits of her curse) and her mind became able to focus on things other than fucking. Things like revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam was a dog destined for a dog's life; in the Tryzantian Palace, that meant he would either be fattened and make into a meal or bred to bolster the army's canine units. It all depended on how hungry her fat-ass of a father was at the moment. Either way, the man she had loved would soon be gone and it was fitting, Isabella felt, that her father be given the same treatment. Her trysts in her father's secret chamber made her well aware that the brute kept his own whores in the castle for 24/7 access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly changing out of her royal pajamas (and into a bustier), Isabella rushed to Queen Helena. She found the Queen in the kennel, tending to the newest addition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning my dear!\" Helena greeted. \"Your father actually got me a gift, for once. Look at this new breeding hound he got for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother,\" Isabella said, \"That's not a dog, it's Liam, our captain of the guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well, who he was isn't important; he is going to be one of our finest sires!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside her disgust at her mother's indifference, Isabella quickly explained the details about her father's secret room and hidden ladies. In a huff, the Queen stormed off towards the location in question. Following her daughter's instructions, the found the chamber, and the King himself in the middle of fucking! They were two girls, not much older than Isabella, though magic had granted them busts even larger than her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the King could offer a protest he was tackled by the massive Queen and squarely knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weak fool!\" Helena scolded. \"I shall see that this lecherous boy gets his just deserts. Thank you, my daughter! As a reward for your help, I will let YOU decide how we deal with these girls. And since your father transformed Liam, I think transforming them is only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella agreed.

She rose, washed, and spent two hours sifting through her wardrobe until she had found her most prettiest dress, the champagne coloured one with the almost transparent bodice of fine lace and the sweeping train that required a half dozen handmaidens to carry. This she carefully folded and put in a satchel. She thought for a moment. \"Hmm. Well that's everything. Oh, I suppose I should probably take some food too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was being served in the great hall. Her hated father sat at the head of the table and waved her over excitedly. Surrounding him were bowls of food the likes of which she'd never seen before. \"Come, sit, sit, my child! You must try some of this, it's wonderful. It's hashaan food, from the distant east. Look, look, they call these noo-dells. And this here is a sort of delicious grain that we can't for the life of us figure out how to grow. And this is - by the divine, this fish is raw! Is that chef trying to poison me?!\" Ivar roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella seated herself primly. \"What have you done with my boyfriend, father?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one your pet wizard turned into a dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, him. He's fine. I had the guards bake him away - I mean <i>take</i> him away,\" Ivar chuckled. \"Aaah, here it comes, my sweet, the centerpiece.\" The chef emerged from the kitchens carrying a large silver platter which he placed before the king and revealed with a flourish. Ivar applauded greedily, though Isabella could hardly see why the pile of boiled chunks of meat and vegetables was worthy of her father's delight. \"Exquisite. A hashaan delicacy,\" he said, lifting the bowl to his lips and tipping it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella wrinkled her nose as gravy and chunks of food dripped down her gluttonous father's chin but she took the opportunity while his face was buried to quickly grabbed some fruit for the journey. She rose. \"Today I shall me tending to my pony, father,\" she said, hoping this would be the last thing she ever said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid idea, girl. Enjoy yourself; I know I do. Don't worry, I'll make sure to have the stable boy castrated before you get there,\" Ivar waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Isabella went over her inventory. \"Dress, perfume, two apples.\" Good to go, she slung the satchel over her shoulder and toppled over. Carrying things was hard! How did her handmaidens do it with such ease? Perhaps she could elope with her entourage too. No. This was something she had to do for herself, by herself. Grabbing the satchel with both hands, she staggered unsteadily to the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sickly-looking stable boy helped her onto her pony. Elixir, a beautiful bronze-coloured mare she had loved since her 8th birthday, had been the perfect size just a few weeks ago, though her recent growth spurt made the animal huff a little as she settled her abundant, goddess-granted ass onto its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked the mare's mane. Into its ear she whispered, \"Say farewell, Elixir. We won't be coming back here again.\"</span></div></div>",

Because you are promised to Prince Roberto. Because I am <i>king</i> and my word is law! Now get off my back so that I can transform back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella gave his sides a particularly vicious kick, causing him to whinny in pain, and was rewarded by being rudely unhorsed as Ivar reared back, sending her tumbling onto her well-padded ass into the straw. Ivar huffed and began to scrape at a pile of straw in the corner of the stall, until he uncovered a glass vial wrapped in the king's trousers. The vial was filled with a bright blue concoction in which a few strands of silvery hair floated. Ivar began to carefully maneuver it with his hooves, clearly concerned about breaking it, as he tries to position his lips about the stopper. \"This was much easier with fingers. Oh, drat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phial tumbled from his grasp and rolled underneath the stall, beyond his reach. Quick as a flash, Isabella dived into the aisle, slamming and bolting the stall gate behind her. She grabbed the phial from where it had fallen, waving it in her father's face, just out of reach. The pony rattled the stall door. \"Isabella. Bring that back to me this instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the shoe is other the other hoof, now, father. Tell me where my real Elixir is, or I'll pour your elixir down the drain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar called for the stableboy, who approached slowly as if in great pain. \"Boy. Show my daughter where her animal is. And try not to bleed everywhere while you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stableboy nodded meekly and led her to the stall where the real Elixir was hidden.

The sweat was pouring down his face and there was a growing patch of red about the crotch of his trousers.

He took the blade we use for the horses, heating it up real nice and then... I was the last. I... I think I might pass out now, my lady, if it's alright by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella looked at the potion in her hands. This would be the first of her father's wicked deeds she would undo. She held out the potion. \"Drink this. It'll make you whole again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stableboy shook his head. \"That's the king's. He'll have my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> will be king. And <i>she</i> will be having nobody's head for a long time, except perhaps the head of my crop against her flank,\" Isabella giggled. She uncocked the bottle and waved it enticingly beneath his nose. \"One sip and a kingdom will be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy took it and drank. It cost him dearly, forty years gone in a moment as his body grew and bloated and sagged, and his hair turned to silver, but as he looked upon his new form his face broke into ecstatic excitement. \"Cor, blimey! I'm the bloody king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are, father,\" Isabella smiled. \"Now we must deal with the old one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gelding tool was an ugly, double-handed implement made of black iron, with a hole through which the horse's member could be slotted and a blade that would snap into place when the handles were closed, snipping it away. To think her beast of a father had used this on <i>boys</i>. Well now he would have a taste of his own medicine. The small forge for working horse shoes was still hot. She made sure the gelding tool was white hot before she carried it back to her father, the ex-stableboy in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar's brayed in outrage at the sight of the kingly figure stepping into view. \"What is the meaning of this? Don't tell me you mean to have congress with this stableboy now. Your own father's body, have you no shame.

I'll miss dinner!\" His eyes fell on the glowing gelding instrument Isabella held just below his nose. \"Hah! Do you mean to threaten me with that, girl? I think you'll have quite a night<i>mare</i> finding anything to cut off me, haha!\" he crowed, twisting around in his stall to display his fully-formed female parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a lasso flew about his neck, tightening and dragging him back so that his head was pinned against the stable door. As he bellowed in outrage, a large bit was forced into his mouth, pinning it open. His eyes went wide as he felt the hot metal of the gelding instrument sliding into his mouth, his tongue slotting neatly into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snip.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cauterised tongue tumbled into the straw at his daughter's feet. He tried to speak, but all that came from his mouth were dumb, unintelligible neighs. He stamped and huffed in horrified realisation as he saw the delighted look upon his daughter's face.

Since you broke your oath in regards to marrying me I have to curse your kingdom. However, I may forget all about that broken oath if you give me your children.

Ivar then attempts to strangle Isabella for cursing him to the existence of a horse for two weeks. However, Roland uses a spell to stun Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess all that time as a horse eroded any shred of sanity the real Ivar had left.

Though she has never met Princess Luna, Emma can tell from the magical air radiating from her presence that she was the one that kidnapped her brother. With a single motion she readies her men and they spring into battle stances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, now,'' Princess Luna chastises, ''that is no way to treat your future sister in law!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oi, you are no sister of Emma's!'' one of her retinue shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Luna saunters forward, slowly approaching the squad. The group is rendered frozen, unsure of what to do. Even Emma, usually cool and collected, finds herself unable to act. Is it some sort of spell? Or just jitters from fight such a powerful foe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dear sister, I know you are angry, but let's do what's best for Rillian,'' she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men watching has had enough. Letting out a cry, he raises his axe and charges. Before he can even get within 3 meters of Luna she raises a palm and lets out a tremendous burst of energy. The purple beam collides with the warrior, engulfing his form and wracking it with powerful magics. His armor melts away, leaving him nude as his body undergoes rapid changes. His lithe form becomes fat and pink, his limbs bestial and his face becomes that of a hog. In only a few moments what was a man has become a very fat sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the men jump back, taking a defensive position around their princess. Emma shakes as Luna continues her approach, passing the pig by. Only a few meters away by now, Luna stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dear, is that all your men got? They are no match for me!'' she cackles. ''I'd leave your other men unchanged, but the viewers at home wouldn't like that, would they?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her palm again, Luna lets out another wave of magical bursts. They hit the rest of Emma's retinue and like before melt away their armors. Except this time, their fate is much worse; rather than become pigs, the five men lose their limbs and animal features, devolving into what look to be tiny, 3cm long leech-like creatures. Again, where there were men before now lie mindless insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna approaches again, this time making sure than one of Emma's former guards winds up in her path. She crushes the poor thing beneath her heel with a satisfying crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sis, you are gonna need better guards than that...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''S-stop calling me sister! I have come here to slay you!'' Emma threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please, if I wanted to, I could have turned you into one of those things, you know. Listen, I've talked to your brother and I know you are his favorite. So here is my offer: go home and wait for our return in two months. Then we can work together to make a better kingdom. Try and attack me again, and I will turn you into a caterpillar. Or worse.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cannot even act before Luna snaps her fingers and teleports away, leaving her alone with her former retinue. Dejected, she takes a seat in the mud, taking care not to squish her former soldiers. Not one to give up so easily, Emma realizes that the only way to win is with some supernatural help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the region of Erolus is filled with many such creatures.

In a manner of seconds the warrior princess's chest goes from lean and slender to fat and bulbous. By the end of the change, she is sporting a pair the size of cantaloupes near in size to her sex-craved sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Kyaaa!'' Emma moans, falling limp. The transformative sensation and the pain of her breasts being smashed by the perfectly fit armor are too much for her to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body slumps to the floor as the tendrils retract, save for the two attached to her nipples.

After the woman finishes the potion she begins to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma watches in horror as the woman's body begins sprouting leaves and flowers. By the end of the transformation the woman was turned into a humanoid plant. One of the orcs picks up the bottle that she's in after noticing Emma's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little princess. The bossman may decide to spare you from that witch's fate. Let this be a lesson on thinking before you open your damn mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dungeon begins to shake as a massive and hairy orc walks into the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this business of you capturing a princess?\" The orc asked as he lumbered into the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This princess called us perverts!\" An orc shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir boss rolled his eyes. \"Resize her and have her clothed. I think we can make a bargain. A bargain that she can't refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orcs pull out a bra and Emma's clothes. They then resize her and wait as she gets changed. After changing their boss motions to her to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning from her prior mistake Emma does as the Orc asks. The orc leads her to a massive tent. Inside the tent are various weapons and a few maps. The orc ushers Emma to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky that you didn't end up like that witch. You are from Tryzantium are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so. Here's the deal. You help us get the treasure and tell your dear king to stop his warmongering and we'll leave your kingdom in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good deal, but I can give you a better offer. I'll help you, but you have to help me rescue my older brother. My father won't be willing to make such a treaty. Once I have my brother we'll be able to overthrow my father and Rillian would be able to make the treaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc scratches his bearded chin. \"Your offer's good. In exchange for helping us we'll help you rescue your brother so he can become king,\" the orc said. The orc extends his fat hand. \"I am Barnabus Draxtor. You already met my cousins as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma extends her hand and shakes the orc's hand to seal the agreement. \"Princess Emma of Tryzantium. Thank you for showing mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Yet if you cross us like that again your punishment will be a lot worse. We orcs favor comoradery and loyalty.\"</span></div></div>",

Because in our lands, such pacts are always celebrated with a feast!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma felt that nervous cold sensation creep back down her spine yet again. Her martial education about Orcish culture had involved stories of the grandiose feasts these beasts used to mark such occasions. Hundreds of cows, pigs, and even sometimes human slaves would be devoured in a sign of solidarity. More importantly, many known Orcish wars had been started by accidents committed at such feasts. Take Balian the Second; a former Duke of a Tryzantine colony, he and his entire family were shrunken and sold into slavery after he accidentally spilled wine on the war chief they were entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Erm, yes, let us eat...'' Emma said, forcing out enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exit the tent together, only to be greeted by the sight of a large, food-covered table right outside their door! It was packed to the edges with numerous sheep, cows, and pigs in variously prepared methods. Thankfully, no humans, though Emma did recognize one of the pigs as the one taken away from her during her capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah yes,'' Barnabas says as he takes a handful of mutton from the table, ''I had my men cook that pig of yours for you. You'll need all the energy you can get!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an only somewhat playful shove, Emma was forced towards the roasted pig that was her comrade. It wasn't the first time she had eaten a former human; in fact, it seemed to be her father's favorite way of dealing with ignoble servants and Isabella's numerous boyfriends. With only a small amount of regret, Emma ripped a leg of the pig and dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted delicious! The perfect blend of spices and herbs. And seared just right! She hadn't realized how hungry she was until that moment. She grabs another leg, then another, and another. And when the legs had been picked to the bone, she moves onto the fatty torso which too only survives for a few minutes against her gluttonous assault. By the end of 20 minutes, she had fully devoured her former companion, with all the remained was a set of bones and her oblong, distended gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wah...'' Emma groans pleasantly, ''That was a good meal. I am stuffed!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ha! I'd hope not,'' Barnabas replies as he swallowed an entire baked chicken whole, ''We are not even an hour in. We still have 11 to go. Now eat, girl, do not insult my hospitality!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looks back down at her food-baby, which was popping out a few inches. To stop now would be to insult her host, so despite her own desires, she turned back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the feast go for Emma?</span></div></div>",

After she had finished the bowl Emma began to feel strange. She looked into the bowl and noticed the same blue liquid from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma feared that she would turn into a humanoid plant like the other woman. However, Emma began to grow taller and her food baby disappeared. Her host looked on as she transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to mention that my cousin, Harris, likes to put potions into the dishes. For us orcs it makes us bigger and stronger, but it has a strange and random effect on humans' Barnabas said. \"I believe one time a man from a Tryzantine colony turned into an orc. Yet I think it was a seperate and private company though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barnabas ate and talked Emma kept growing taller until she was three inches shorter than Rilian who by the way is a very tall man himself. She then kneeled over in pain as she started to gain muscle mass. By the end of the transformation Emma was 6'6\" inches and had impressive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, her clothes were in tatters. By then Barnabas had already devoured the rest of the feast. He then noticed Emma trying to cover herself up due to her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaranabas took off his shirt and handed it to Emma. \"I forgot that you humans are not used to being seen in the nude. This should fix your problem until you get a chance to make clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma takes the shirt and puts it on. To her surprise it was large enough to be worn as a dress. Yet her host was rather huge judging by his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that our feast is over we should rest up. This dungeon houses a powerful artifact from our god, Bruskor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma blinked in confusion until she realized that she had heard that name before. Though not a believer of the scriptures like her younger twin she was taught about how Bruskor masqueraded as a human and impregnated one of the priestesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also heard that Bruskor tends to shapeshift from time to time. He's also the son the Goddess that the church worships. Yet she didn't realize that he established himself as god of the orcs as well as the god of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma yawned. \"I do feel a bit tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you would after your day.

Unlike the others, which are tattered and aged, his tent is grandiose and well made. Its purple walls stand out against the rest of the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, well, thank you,'' Emma replies. In truth, she is rather nervous about the arraignment. She had seen his sideways glances during the dinner at her chest and now with her new muscles she is the pinnacle of what orcs consider attractive: strong and busty. Did he want something carnal from her? Would he get mad if she turned him down? These are the thoughts that enter Emma's mind as she and Barnabas enter the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere inside is unlike anything she has seen in the rest of the dungeon. Mounted trophies cover the walls, dangling magical hooks to support their weight on the fabric. Most are animals, but a few are humans, magically kept alive through Orc body sculpting magic. They look over Emma pleadingly, but she has no intention of saving them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And here is where we will be sleeping tonight,'' Barnabas directs. He points to a dirty mattress in the center, covered in straw. It is certainly big enough for the two of them, though their bodies would be pressed together. Before Emma can fake a positive reaction, her obese host waddles over to a treasure chest and digs through it before producing a set of women's lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This belonged to my dear wife,'' Barnabas says, ''You would perhaps be more comfortable sleeping in this?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a white satin corset, designed for sexiness more than comfort. Taking it wordlessly, Emma approaches the mirror and tries it on. She slips it on under her large shirt, allowing her to change into it without undressing entirely. The last thing she wants to do is encourage her Orc host's lechery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a bit of effort, but she manages to get it on. Letting her shirt fall to the ground, Emma takes a full account of her new body. Her breasts, still impractically large, and now offset by her new height and muscles. They didn't grow with the rest of her, so while she is still as big as Isabella, they are more proportional. More still, the thick muscles in her arms, legs, and abdomen help give her an air of power. She is sexy, but not over the top like her sister. She is powerful, but not to the extent of Rillian. A perfect balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I see you are enjoying your change,'' Barnabas says suddenly as his sweaty belly presses into Emma's back. ''You know...''</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be in passing judging by his tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma quickly observed the trophies in the tent. Judging by the amount of trophies Barnabas was an execellent hunter despite his young age. Emma guessed that he is probably in his mid to early 20s. Before Emma could ponder anymore a large clank caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my wife's old gear. I hope it's to your liking. Realoom enjoyed wearing this when she was alive. Unfortunately she was turned into ash by a nasty witch,\" Barnabas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma picks up the war gear and examines it. The gear was silver and consisted of a helmet, a breastplate, a battle skirt, and a broad sword. Emma puts on the armor. To her surprise it fit like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor orc war gear it was pretty good. Yet considering that orcs worship the god of war it's no wonder why their armor would be decently made. Bruskor is known to be an opportunist and would change his shape in order to get people of other races to worship him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Emma couldn't believe that this dungeon was affilated with Bruskor.

Barnabas screams, rushing from the tent with Emma close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside is absolute chaos. A crowd of hooded wizards is doing battle with the orcs. Towards the entrance of the room is a man without a hood, wearing a jewel encrusted robe. To his left is a massive elephant sized slime creature, the same color as the thing Buxley became.

In recognition of your success here today, I have decided to grant you the power within this dungeon!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''T-thank you my l-Aaaaaaaargh!'' Barnabas screams as his body undergoes a set of changes. It starts with his left arm; like a snake shedding, his skin peels off, revealing a layer of pure metal epidermis. His hand starts to morph as well, stretching and sharpening to the point that after a few seconds his hand is entirely replaced by a battle-axe! But that is not all; his spine extends as well, bursting out just below his neck. The tube of bone extends out, becoming a magical cannon of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I... I am truly a warmachine now!'' Barnabas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Indeed you are!'' Bruskor replies. ''Emma, as you can see, if you agree to serve me, I will grant you power enough to overthrow your father AND defeat Luna. You will become the most powerful human warrior in the land. Do you agree?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma doesn't even take a second before nodding her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aye, this is more than fair, my lord.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good!

Indeed, she even feels the steel of her breastplate sink to an icy chill. Like a sponge absorbing water, Emma's figure takes in the magical energies vibrating through the air. She grows rapidly, her body and armor swelling higher and higher with each passing second. She quickly passes Barnabas in height and before long even the large Bruskor sinks below her head. Thankfully, the large ceiling in the chamber allows her to reach a final twenty five feet without any issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looks down at her shrimpy companion and her not-much-larger-god. She feels more powerful than ever; like a child among ants. Her muscles, though proportionally the same, are now massive enough to rip stone walls apart with ease. And her breasts are technically the largest in the kingdom, which would bring her annoying sister Isabella great shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I am... huge!'' Emma says, her voice booming. With a single punch she hits the roof, tearing the stone apart and opening a hole to the cool night air. Moonlight beams down on her heavenly form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Indeed you are!'' Barnabas says, poorly hiding his admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''From here on, you shall be known as Bruskor's Leviathan. No more 'Princess Emma', understand?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes, my lord,'' she replies, taking a knee in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, besides making you a great deal stronger, the transformation has made you resistant to whole body transformations. It would take a great deal of magic to change you entirely; an amount even Luna would struggle to summon.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I see. Thank you, my lord.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do not thank me child. If you must show gratitude, then do so by waging war! And remember: Bruskor does not reward torture, but neither does he reward mercy! There are no innocents in war, so pillage ever village in my name!'' Bruskor demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We shall, my lord,'' Barnabas pledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good. Now go, and conquer!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bruskor vanishes in a puff of smoke, leaving the two champions behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, Em... I mean, Leviathan, where should we be off to?

Her teeth, once a mixture of canine and herbivore have now all sharpened into deadly razors, some protruding out of her mouth and resting against her lips. Her muscle tone was thicker as well, imbuing her with more upper body strength (and more support for her still-large tits). But most shocking of all was her lower half; in place of her legs was a long, dexterous tail, covered in shimmering scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma is now a Vorelf and the unyielding urge to consume other beings nagging in her mind is just another reminder of that. Though her personality and memories persist, Emma is truly changed. Her wish to rescue Rillian and strike down Luna has become an urge to swallow that filthy sorceress whole! Her goal of ruling Tryzantium with a kind rule and deposing her cruel father is now instead about farming her population (sustainably) and showing him what it is like to be tiny and powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's martial education taught her many things about her new race: she could shrink things with her saliva, either instantly through biting or slowly with licking. She could extend her jaw and swallow other beings whole, like a snake.

With her saliva, she can take out these Orcs at her small size and even force them to restore her to her height. Or, she could try the other two pots.

Without a moments hesitation, she slithers out of the tent, abandoning the pots and further transformation now. Entering the grand chamber, she finds it empty; the table has been cleared and the orcs are no longer feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlithering towards the other tents, Emma peeks inside, finding her targets in various states of sleep. Some are passed out while others groggily fuck the half-disassembled captives. Luckily for her, her intended target falls into the first of those categories. In the farthest tent sleeping alone is the orc that devoured her previous cellmate. His fat gut is swollen and distended, like a satchel stuffed to the brim with stolen loot. Somewhere in there is the remains of the girl, mixing seamlessly with the other foods he he had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma slithers close, her anger swelling. Letting loose her long, monstrous fangs, Emma digs them deep into his belly, injecting him with her shrinking venom. In a manner of moments the beast-man dwindles down smaller, smaller, and smaller until his is tiny even by Emma's form. Comparatively, he is only 2 centimeters to her. She could swallow his helpless figure whole, or crush him with a single pinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that, though, Emma forces him awake with a violent shove. The orc hops to his feet, fists drawn and anger exploding when he rapidly realizes his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oi, what the hell's this!'' he demands. Emma's response is to lower her tail just above him and wave it menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Talk again and die,'' she begins, her new sadistic vorelf features kicking in, ''you shrank me not long ago and I know how your magic works. Restore me to proper size and live. Refuses or try to shrink me and die.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a hard choice for the orc to make. With a wave of his hand and a little incantation, the curse on Emma's body is lifted. She explodes in height, swelling up to about six and a half feet tall, thanks to her serpentine form. She's back to normal, save her snake features and still gigantic tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc below is even tinier in comparison and she can only barely make out his cries for mercy.

Like the world's slowest meteor's crashing to earth, her fleshy orbs descend and cast a shadow over her target. His beady eyes go wide as he sees what is about to happen. He tries to dash away, but his little legs aren't quick enough as her soft flesh makes contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bloated belly collides with the ground with a painful crack. He had almost nearly escaped and only his feet are trapped beneath Emma's weight chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Argh! Me feets!'' the orc screams. ''Get off of me!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lets out a sarcastic chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I can't hear you, little runt. Let me get closer!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadjusting her weight, Emma leans down even more, allowing her breast fat to sag forward even more. Like the world's largest, softest rolling pin her breasts gradually travel up his body, crushing more and more of the bloated creature. Perhaps most satisfying his when it reaches his gut as Emma can feel the taut ball of blubber pop beneath the weight. The last to go is his head, of course, and the orc lets off one last desperate scream before it too is smashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lets her chest remain on the floor for a few moments before lifting it back up. All that remains is a long red streak trailing down her tits. It gives off a sweet smell, like a freshly frosted cake, so Emma wastes no time in lapping it up. It tastes like cake, too! No wonder Vorelves so eagerly consume other people, she realizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, her thoughts turn back to the girl from earlier. If the orc ate her, and Emma just ate him, doesn't that mean she has eaten her, indirectly? For most humans, this would have been a horrifying revelation. But Emma was no human. Her brain has finally been taken over by her natural Vorelf tendency towards sadism. From her on out, there will be no mercy from the Serpentine Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter savoring the flavor, Emma's thoughts turn back to action. There are still 12 or so orcs left here. Her experience with this one has inspired her: she MUST deal with the others. But again, the question turns to how? Naturally, she can crush them the same way as this one or just devour them (after all, the orc was quite tasty). But her mind turns back to the vats. Messing with them could be quite fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sees the existence of the transformative vats as something to be tested and maybe used in her fight against Luna. Maybe the could make her super-strong! Or maybe make her immune to the crazy woman's powerful magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma slithers out of the tent and back towards the one she was transformed in. Even at a normal sizes, sneaking around the camp is an easy affair, thanks to her captors being drunk off their asses. Even better, her snake lower half glides silently over the dungeon's stone floor. She encounters no difficult as she slips into the tent with the vats and goes to her second victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc from before still reclines in the corner, though by now he is completely out of it. The slave-head below still diligently sucks at his stubby little member, milking the thing for all it is worth. Rolling her eyes, Emma plucks the mindless captive off of her master and tosses her into the crimson pot. She disappears beneath the bubbling surface only for another creature to emerge a few moments later: a fat little rat. It plops out of the container and his the floor, unmoving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, the crimson is an animal transformation goo,'' Emma thinks as she bends down and inserts the half flaccid member into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc groans as Emma gives him a better blowjob than the one his empy-headed slave had been giving. Unfortunately for him, Emma's saliva, in addition to being a wonderful lubricant, also causes him to shrink. Like a slowly melting ice sculpture the orcs goes down until he reaches roughly the size of his recently smashed companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma plucks the little orc from the ground, grabbing him by his erect cock. His eyes shoot open as pain overwhelms him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Graaaaaah! My cock! What in the-!'' he protests, before coming face to face with the giant snake-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Silence. If you want to live, explain to me the purpose of these vats,'' Emma demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Graaaaaa-! O-okay, I can explain! That goop is whats we found in the dungeon. Its whats they use to change peoples. The blue one is completely random. Sometimes it turns humans to elvies, sometimes it turns them into monsters. The purple one is for size. Sometimes it gives people bigger boobies or bigger cocks, but sometimes it makes them super fat or super tall! The last one makes peoples into animals. Now please, let go of my freaking cock!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her own experience and the fate of the bodyless slave, Emma is pretty sure the orc is telling the truth. As a reward for his honestly, Emma decides to release him as he requests. Right over one of the vats, that is! She slithers towards the three pots, eying them eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oi, what's ya doin'?'' he asks as Emma playfully dangles him above the three different goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I decided to let you go, as you asked. But I get to decide where, understand?'' Emma says laughing as she released his cock, letting him fall into...</span></div></div>",

As he changes, Emma's attention turns towards the other subject: the former human-head turned rat sitting at her feet. True to its previous form, it was mindless and (mostly) unmoving, meaning that the orc would likely retain his own personality. That is, until the the ''naturalization'' kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturalization was the process in which transformed beings gradually adopted the minds and lifestyles of their new forms. With enough willpower and by avoiding actions characteristic of their new bodies it could be avoided indefinitely. But, as in Emma's case, her desire for sadistic revenge meant her new Vorelf mind is rapidly coming into control. The rat, meanwhile, was starting to stir, as its previously empty mind provides no resistance to its growing rat instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few moments of waiting, the bubbles ceased rising.

The woman was now a male rat and the orc a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new nasty plot forms in her mind. Grabbing one of the burlap sacks from a nearby shelf, Emma swipes the two rodents off the floor and dumps them in. Their forms twist through the thick fabric, trapping them side by side. Her plan doesn't end there, though; she spends the next twenty minutes traveling through the orc camp, repeating the same thing as before: biting an orc, shrinking them, and dipping them in the transformative liquid. The results are always the same as they too become ragged rats of the female variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the chieftain, at an imposing four meters tall and weight over five hundred kilograms is reduced to the smallest of the bunch.To make matters worse, the mind of the brain-wiped woman has finally reverted to true rat-dom, judging by how she finds her (him?) humping away at one of the orcs as she drops the last one in. All in all, Emma collects fourteen furry slaves, all female save for the former woman. She stuffs each on in her burlap sack for later use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, she collects some of the other shrunken humans from the vials and places them in the sack, as well as scooping a vials-worth of the three strange liquids for later use.

It reminder her more of the way her father would shake his rotund belly after a good meal. Fat is fat, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, Emma quickly finds that her new additions also prevent her from avoiding some of the dungeon's traps. One trap involving strings dangling across the length of the hallway are simply impossible to avoid with her figure. Had she been her regular self she could have easily slipped between them, but as it was her breasts were just too expansive. With a heavy heart she has no choice but to send forth her pack-pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt triggers the trap, retracting the strings and sending out a barrage of glowing green arrows. The poor pig is pelted with the whole volley and its body is quickly overwhelmed with the full force of their magical energies. Its body swells as its limbs shrink away. Pink skin is replaced by a dark brown bark and its head covered in a blanket of leaves. In only a few moments, her once-soldier pig has become a simple shrub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying a simple prayer, Emma gathers her goods and sallies onward. A few minutes onward, the princess is shocked to hear a voice ahead, pleading for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... help, plewaaaarbllll\" the woman cries, her voice cut away by what sounds like vomiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself, Emma rounds the corner, only to be confronted by a... mule? The creature stands before a set of three levers, one already pulled. The voice is louder than before but it seems not to come from the animal, but from below it. Glancing down, Emma makes a horrific discover: the mule's cock, erect and twitching, with the face of a young elf woman on the head. A small pile of what looks like semen sits below, no doubt dribbling from her mouth. She locks eyes with Emma and pleads again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me, pleeeease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid I have no means to return you to normal,\" Emma admits. \"Or else I would have rid myself of these awful breasts\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, not that.

Jerking off a mule isn't exactly on her bucket list, but this poor victim is clearly suffering.

Had her sadistic father been here, he would have ordered this elf hauled away and added to his stable, either as a breeding until or fattened for a special banquet, laughing all the while. The laws of Tamoria were clear: those transformed assumed the rights and responsibilities of their new forms; as far as the law was concerned this was no longer an elf, but a mule with a funny cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, Emma nearly tumbles having forgotten the weight of her breasts. Those globes of flesh collide with the erect mule member, pressing it in a death grip between her soft tits and the animal's belly. The mule lets off a pleasured whine and the elf follows suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yesss!\" the elf says, \"like that, give us more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body already in position, Emma realizes a tit-job would be the easiest way to get this done. Pulling down the end of her make-due blouse, she exposed as much of her cleavage as possible, worming the horses thick rod between. As deep as it is, the thing's just too big to fully fit! With the slightest rocking of her hips she manages to sway her upper body back and forth. Most of the shaft is forcefully smushed by her enhanced breasts. Such a firm-yet-silky-soft sensation is overwhelming for the creature (or perhaps the Elf? Who can say who is truly in control?). The elf-cock sputters once again as a geyser of creamy semen bursts forth, coating Emma, her hair, and indeed her chest in a layer of the stuff. Some even begins to pool in her still-pressed shut cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" The elf speaks up, her voice fading. The cock was rapidly deflating as it became flaccid again. The cock-girl mutters something in an Elvish tongue. A command, as far as Emma can tell (she's forgotten most of what she was tutored in regards to languages). The mule steps forward, knocking Emma out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pulls the second lever, triggering another trap. A burst of light flashes from the while, striking the animal. In a matter of seconds, its belly swells along with its legs and neck as it gains pound after pound, quickly become the FATTEST mule Emma had ever laid eyes on. If that wasn't enough, it pulled itself (belly literally dragging) to the next lever and pulled that too. Again a flash and another change: this time the creature's elf-cock was enlarged, swelling to around 4 feet long with a circumference much thicker than that. She can only image it at full-mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the last lever being pulled had also activated the wall's gear, opening the way further. Emma contemplates taking the Elf along, but instead settles on taking her goods (mostly her tunic, which she uses to wipe off most of the mule spunk). She also ties the animal to a nearby wall just in case she needs any support in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching deeper in, Emma is happy at last to come across some creatures than need an ass-kicking.

Okay?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth humans, now overwhelmed with an unnatural fear, could only watch in despair, noticing how foolish of them this adventure was. But..

I'll be nice this time around..~ But only if you help me. And don't worry, i'll make SURE that you hold your part of the contract, just get the 'treasure' you seek, and i'll tell you what to do, out of it.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, the cat press two 'choices' out of the roulette, ignoring its spinning speed, and wave his paw, weakening the spell he had casted, before both him and his contraption disappear in a poof of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth humans falls onto their knee, still affected, and goes under changes, as told, without being able to tell what would happened, having not catched what he choose for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma body steadily grows, quickly being restrained within her own armor, unable to remove, as her members are still unresponsive, pain-stalking digging within her skin, only to have her wearing getting forcibly removed, thankfully only falling besides her, revealing her nude body, as well as the various newly gained wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, through she was bleeding, she could stand, which didn't do her fine, as her growth, coming to an end, had made her head-bonking the roof of where she stood, forcing her to kneel down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another pain came up, around her back, as two pair of gosshammer wings, as large as her arms and as long as her chest sprouts up, starting the second parts of her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yellow fur, stripped of black, spreads onto her skin, healing up her wounds, leaving only scarred patches, as her joints, namely her shoulders, knees and elbows, thins out ever-so-slightly, bones changing into a chitinous exoskeleton, attaching themselves to her bones, in the same fashion as they would for a normal human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs becomes exoskeletic, her feet ending up being single-toed, balancing issues somewhat worsened as a large insectoid abdomen sprouts besides her backside, supported by sensibly widening thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continue on, striking her head, remplacing her hair and skin alike into that same yellow fur, covering her whole visage but her eyes and mouth, making her temporally deaf, until a pair of antennae sprouts and that her reshaped skull becomes sensible enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, her libido increase, mindlessly drooling from her mouth, now placed onto the bottom side of her pointy head, frantically rubbing her drooling cunt, ignoring that her breasts, those nipples gets perkier, grows as well to match a more 'feminine' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her legs going numb, she forcibly sits down onto Cylde, complaining loudly in answer, 'Gah! G-get off me! You're too heavy!', struggling against the colossal 26' tall female bee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping off her sudden lust, she hastily step aside, only to notice that her makeshift seat was some kind of anthropomorphic frilled lizard, around 10' tall, an athletic, but not overly exaggerated muscular frame, female with watermelons-sized breasts, and, strangely enough, a large tail where her legs would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, and despite the fact that the lizard looked more awestruck than scared or harmful, she readily sets herself into a fighting stance, only managing to inadvisely hit the wall with an elbow. Gritting her teeth, she tries to attack the 'intruder', until said say, 'Hey, wait! Don't! It's me! Cylde Arroweye!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And how i'm supposed to be believe you!?'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't you remember what just happened..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right.. But.. You know who i am?

The lizard peers down, and freaks out, even more so as one of her hands tentatively grope his missing maleness under her loincloth. 'S-since.. Uh.. Right.. That cat..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighs and places a hand onto the side of her chest, causing her to wince, noticing that her scarred skin is still sensible. 'Can i really trust you?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you really have much of a choice?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What shall we do, then?'.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the sound of a woman's scream's of terror tears you from your thoughts. Swiftly pin pointing the direction, you do what any hero would do and rush off to investigate. Who knows, there might be a reward involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking into the dark alley where the screams originated from, you spot a lovely young woman clad in a scanty tight, form fitting leather breastplate, a loin cloth, and not much else being menaced by a band of goblins, the small wrenched creatures dancing and chortling all around her, while leering and waving their weapons around, which mainly consist of long dull looking knives. Though  the knives don't look as though they'd be particularly effective weapons, you learned early on in life that appearances can be deceiving, especially where magic is concerned, and since you haven't had much experience with goblins, and therefore little idea of what to expect from them, you'll have to be doubly wary. For now, you decide that it would be in your best interest to stay hidden and observe until you can figure out what's going on, as there's no need to make enemies unnecessarily after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the goblins, who you assume to be the leader seeing as how he's the biggest and strongest looking of the group, steps forward and addresses the young woman,. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So  Zelana, it looks like we've finally caught up to you. You're going to pay for stealing from me!\" the goblin leader growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this woman is a simple thief, and therefore none of your concern, no matter how desirable she may appear, as she'd surely rob you blind in a heartbeat were you to rescue her. You're about to move on, but before you can do so, the woman replies \"I would like to Ogg, I really would, but business has been slow lately. If you give me a couple days though, I'm sure I can come up with.... WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!\" the woman suddenly screams, pointing her finger right at you! Crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hoping that the goblins will see the trick for the diversion it is, and indeed most of them do, but unfortunately for you, several of the dimmer or else more paranoid members of the group turn at the female thief's shout. One of them spots you and cries out a warning, causing the others to take note of you. Double crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Zelana, looks like you didn't come here alone after all. He can't save you. You three, take care of the girl, the rest of you are with me, we'll show these humans that they can't cross Ogg the terrible without paying the price!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the remaining goblins charge you, leaving you with no choice but to defend yourself, drawing your sword and perparing yourself as best you can for whatever they can throw at you. </span></div></div>",

Don't go, I still need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you begin looking around for the source of the voice, wondering for a moment if perhaps the woman is actually some sort of sorceress and turned herself invisible or something, but that turns out not to be the case, because as you begin searching the alleyway, stepping over and around the scatted body parts, one of the actually moves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Necromancy!\" You snarl, spitting the word like a curse and drawing your blade in preparation for dealing with whatever undead horror is about to attack you, though what good a sword will be against something that's already dead you're not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not necromancy, I'm still alive, I'm just in pieces is all.\" the woman's voice explains. though still wary, you begin moving towards where the voice seems to be coming from. Discovering the disembodied head of the girl from earlier, you roll it over. As you do so, the eyelids pop open, revealing a set of brilliant green orbs, just as the woman screams \"Boo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump back, resisting screaming like a little girl only with an act of will, as it wouldn't be particularly manly or barbarian like, and quickly take stock of the situation glaring down at the head of the woman who'd tried to get you killed, who's now laughing her ass off over your reaction to her little joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's funny?! You're lucky I don't chop you into even more pieces! How the hell can you still be alive after being cut up like this anyway, aren't you human?\" you asked more curious than wary or frightened by now, as no undead horror you've ever heard of spends time yelling boo and then laughs their ass off afterwards, being far more interested in consuming the blood, flesh, and souls of the living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic of course.\" the woman replies vaguely, and you get the impression that she would have shrugged had her shoulders still been attached to the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I gathered that.\" you remarked dryly. \"I may be uncivilized, but that doesn't make me an idiot. Can't you be any more specific? I'll need to know everything I can about what's going on if I'm going to help you, although to be honest, I should jut leave you here after setting those goblins loose on me like that.\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the blades. See dull looking knives the goblins were using? Those are goblin knives, magical weapons and tools that they use to sculpt the flesh of other races, slicing through flesh and bone like a hot knife through butter, all while leaving the victim alive and unharmed. They then can either replace the parts removed with new parts, or simply take them and sell them to whoever can meet their price. That last would have been my fate if you hadn't rescued me. Thanks for saving me by the way, I'm Zelana, what's your name?\" the disembodied woman's head asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Brand, son of Bruin, and I didn't rescue you because I wanted to, I did it because if I hadn't, those goblins would have had my guts for garters! Now, tell me how to put you back together so that we can get out of here already.\" you instructed, wanting to leave the area as soon as possible before the goblins returned with reinforcements. You were less sure about the idea of putting Zelana back together, but there was no need to tell her that, at least not just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple actually. All you have to do is press the stump end of the cut off limb against living flesh, and it'll attach itself just as though it's always been there. Be careful though, as once it's on it can't be removed again with out a goblin blade or other similar magic, or the good old fashioned method of hacking it off. That last one can be painful, so I'd prefer you didn't do that.\" Zelana explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know. I think I'll take a few of these blades with us, I have a friend that would love to get his hands on something like this.\" you said, grabbing a few of the goblin knives and stuffing them in you pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, goody for him!\" Zelana said sarcastically. \"Now could you please finish saving me and put me back together already?\" she impatiently requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly consider your options before informing Zelana that_________________________?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps Women in the southern lands behave differently than those in your homeland, or maybe it's just her, she does seem pretty strange already after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, ah approve of this plan?\" you ask cautiously suddenly unsure if you really want to go through with this or not, as if Zelana's happy, it could well spell bad news for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, yes. I mean, don't get me wrong, I would have preferred to be put back together first, but the truth is, you're not the only one who's turned on by weird shit like this, and you are sort of cute, in a ruggedly handsome sort of way. So I'll tell you what. I'll cooperate with you one hundred percent, allow myself to become your sexual plaything for the next few days, and all you have to do is help keep me safe from the goblins, and promise to put me back together and take me with you when you leave the city, how does that sound?\" Zelana offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up and scratching your chin, you considered her proposal. It seemed like a pretty good deal, as it was always more fun when the woman was willing, at least so far as you were concerned, and the thought of traveling with a woman as beautiful s Zelana did have a strong appeal all it's own. Of course, she's probably steal you blind at the first opportunity, not to mention the goblins you'd most likely have following you so long as the two of you were together, but hey, it's only money, you can always get more, and after that last battle, the goblins were likely to be after you anyway. \"Alright, I accept.\" you agreed, right before tossing Zelana's head into the bag, causing her to yelp and begin cursing you over your little act of revenge, before grinning and tying the bag shut and telling her to be quite, explaining that, even in a city like this, carrying around a sack full of living human body parts seemed like a good way to attract unwanted attention. Seeing the sense behind your words, Zelana silences herself, an uncomfortable silence falling between you, and your certain that you've yet to hear the end of this discussion before shouldering the sack, your powerful build making the weight of it negligible,  before setting of once more in search of a decent inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a block or so,it occurs to you that Zelana has almost certainly been in this city longer than and might be able to help you with your search. looking around to make sure that no one's observing you, you open the sack and whisper your request. \"I don't suppose you'd happen know the location of a good inn by any chance would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try The Pampered Pony, four streets over, and two streets up from the waterfront.\" Zelana suggested. It looks as though she wants to say more,loudly and at length most likely but she restrains herself, recognizing the fact that the two of you are still in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you whispered, before swiftly closing up the sack, and moving off in the direction Zelana had suggested, soon arriving in front of a two story wood and timber structure with a picture of a fat and happy looking pony eating out of a feed trough, while a pair of human servants saw to it's every need. It looks to be a good inn judging by the exterior, though a bit beyond your normal price range, but nothing you couldn't easily afford at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, you're immediately greeted by a fat happy middle aged gentleman with thinning grayish hair. \"Welcome to the pampered pony friend, the finest inn this side of the great sea! I'm Benson the owner, I run this place. So, what can I do you for?\" the man asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A room and some food would be nice enough for two. Some wine would also be good if you have any that doesn't taste like vinegar.\" you replied, good wine having become one of your guilty pleasures since coming to the south, though it's hard to get any that's drinkable in the establishments you usually frequent, as most of the stuff they sell tends to be of such poor quality and so watered down as to be all but undrinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I don't what sort of establishments your used to, but around here, we believe in serving only the best.\" Benson explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then how much for a bottle of your finest stock?\" you ask.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBenson quotes you a figure that causes you to turn pale, one that would easily be enough to feed a peasant families for half a year or more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, lets go with a lesser vintage. What's the cheapest thing that you'd be happy serving at your own table?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenson seems a bit disappointed at having failed to sell his most expensive vintage, but quickly recovered, replying \"That would be Tryzantium red, circa 6 Ce, a very good year for all of Tyzantium, or so I'm told. It's not nearly as good as most elven vintages, nor nearly as expensive, but you should enjoy it nonetheless.\" Benson says, quoting you a price that seems much more reasonable. You pay the man, who them hands you a carefully crafted iron key before ringing a small bell, signaling a porter to help carry your things up to your room. Yes, this is definitely  a much higher quality inn than what you're used too. In fact, you're slightly surprised that their letting you stay at all, let alone being so curious. They must be used to adventures, or maybe their just afraid to ask you to leave. Whatever the reason, the service so far has been excellent, though you insist on carrying the bag that Zelana is stored in yourself, for obvious reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've been escorted to your room and stored your equipment, you proceed to wait for your food to be delivered before unpacking Zelana, something that she's not too pleased by, and she tells you as much, but you reassure her that she'll be out soon enough, there's no sense in frightening the locals after all. Soon your food arrives, delivered by a serving girl in a low cut peasant dress, causing your eye to be constantly drawn to the generous swell of her chest. She doesn't seem to mind your attentions either, even flirting with you a bit before she leaves. She's pretty cute, if a bit pudgy, and if you hadn't already had a far more beautiful and interesting woman in pieces waiting for you to let her out of the sack, you might have asked her to stay a while so the two of you could get better antiquated. As it is however, you soon dismiss her, sighting tiredness as an excuse so as not to hurt her feelings. She seems a bit disappointed, but doesn't object of try to force the issue in anyway, and soon you're alone, just you and Zelana. Placing the bar across the door so as not to be caught unawares, you open the sack and begin pulling out Zelana's body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Zelana hasn't forgotten what you did earlier, as well as having a whole new list of complaints about being bounced around in a hot smelly sack all over town, which she's not shy about voicing now that the two of you are alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time! Do you know hot hot it was in that sack? And the smell! I've smelled three day old corpses that smell better than that thing! I'll probably have to take at least a dozen baths just to get the smell out! And don't think I've forgotten that little stunt you pulled with my head earlier! I'll get you back for that eventually, mark my words!\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. You about done complaining or do I have time to take a nap first?\" you replied with fended disinterest, though truthfully you were rather amused by the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nap!\" Zelana cried. \"You jerk! I almost die of suffocation, and your worried about a nap?! That's it, the deals off! Put me back together right now, and maybe, just maybe we can go our separate ways without me putting a dagger in your spleen! Of all the idiotic, smelly, ignorant excuses for...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can go any further you silence the angry female head the best way you know how, pulling her in for a passionate kiss, your lips pressing roughly, almost bruising against her own enjoying the sweat taste of her, despite the few faint muffled protests she makes to the contrary before she ceases her complaints altogether and begins kissing you back, her passion nearly the equal of your own, your questing tongues joining together in blissful harmony as the two of you continue to make out with an almost feverish intensity, only coming up for air once you absolutely have to, your lungs screaming for oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you pull back from one another, both gasping for air, a thin trail of saliva still connecting her lips with your own, staring speechlessly into one another eyes, attempting to organize your thoughts, before eventually you tease \"What, nothing else to say Zelana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gasping for air, Zelana gives you a brief glare, though it's clear that her hearts no longer in it. \"Kiss me like that again, and I just might consider forgiving you.\" She answered after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly.\" you responded, pulling her in for yet another incredible kiss, every bit as passionate as the previous one before finally getting down to buisness, slipping out of your clothes________________________?</span></div></div>",

Despite being unfamiliar with your new body, you know you have only seconds in which to act. Springing to your feet, almost loosing your balance, you reach down and scoop up the chair, Brands sword having been lost when the giant orc punched him across the room, position it in front of you like a battering ram, and charge, driving your improvised weapon into the gut of your over sized opponent, who's more than a little surprised to see an angry barbarian, now with two heads, charging towards him after a punch that would have easily felled a steer. As such, his reaction time is rather slow, allowing you to force him back out of the room, then slamming the door and baring it once more. Knowing that such a beast would make short work of a simple wooden door, you begin frantically tossing the parts of your original body back into the bag, along with those few supplies you feel you have time for, making sure to grab Brands sword, as it's a near certainty it will be needed in the near future. By this time, the door is already starting to splinter under the repeated blows of the orc, and you know you have only seconds to get out of here before it will be too late. Crawling out the window, intending to drop to the street, you glance down, only to spot a group of around half a dozen goblins milling around below you. Not wanting to attempt to fight them off in this unfamiliar body, you instead start climbing upward instead, Brands greater reach and strength making reaching the rooftop a cinch. of course, making the leap to the next building over may be more problematic, as unlike the various warehouses and businesses down by the docks which are set within mere feet of one another, the homes and shops of this more upscale district are further apart, making such a leap a dangerous prospect at best. Still, it's better than staying here, so stepping back as far as you dare, you take a running leap before launching yourself into space, aiming for the roof of a two story bakery across the street. </span></div></div>",

Your bizarre string of luck continues however, as rather than slamming into the hard cobblestones of the street below, you're saved by a passing carriage, tearing through the roof, your feet getting caught in the frame, leaving you dangling, Brand's unconscious head wedged inside the cleavage of a rather busty young noblewoman, who seems just about ready to have a heart attack. Suddenly, Brand seems to stir, your body's hands reaching down to fondle the two massive mounds. \"<i>Men! They always seem to have such one track minds!</i>\" you think to yourself, torn between exasperation, amusement, and just the slightest hint of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasserting control of your shared body from the groggy barbarian, you yell \"Brand, there's no time for that! Company's coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why didn't you say so?\" Brand demanded, shaking off the blow to the head quickly in typical barbarian fashion and pulling his head from the woman's cleavage. \"Wait, how did we get here? And what are you doing with my body?\" he demanded, blinking in confusion upon realizing the situation the two of you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain latter! Right now we have a getaway to make!\" you responded, tearing your legs free from the roof of the carriage, causing you to tumble fully inside, landing firmly planted in the cleavage of the noblewoman once more, only this time it's your head that's buried therein. Not being as interested in such things as Brand, normally possessing a rather healthy set of boobs yourself, you quickly pull your head free, noting that this time the poor girl had fainted, as well as a rather expensive looking necklace she's wearing, which quickly snag, as you've never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, before climbing to your feet. As you do so, a startling transformation comes over the young woman, as she becomes older, and far less appealing than previously appeared. There must have been more to that necklace of hers than you thought. You decide to keep it, it could come in handy latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to your companion, you explain \"We're in a carriage. If we can take out the driver, we can use it to make out way to the edge of the city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Brand agreed, hopping up and looking over the top of the carriage.  having noticed your entry, as honestly, how could he have not, the driver is prepared for you, lashing out at your heads with his whip, forcing you to duck. Reaching back behind you, Brand uses his great strength to rip a piece of wood free of the frame, using it to intercept the drivers whip, which wraps around it, allowing him to jerk it out of the drivers clutches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drivers not out of tricks yet though, for as you climb up out of the carriage, intending to wrest the reins from him, he pulls back hard, bringing the carriage to a screeching halt, and hurling the both of you out of the carriage and into the street! As the two of you land, the driver urges the horses forward, forcing you and Brand to roll aside or risk being trampled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go after that carriage! My body's still in there!\" you yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of harsh goblin voices coming your way, Brand yells back \"There's no time!

Of course, a bit of profit wouldn't go amiss either, as you've little to your name at present beyond your sword and the clothes on your back. If only you weren't such a lousy gambler.... Still, the sun is shinning, and the air is fresh, so different from noise, stench and overcrowding of the city, and you can't help but relax a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're relaxation is premature however, and nearly costs you your life, as only your keen senses and quick reflexes allow you to dodge the massive ax being swung at you as the first orc steps out from behind the tree in front of you and charges. Quickly, you draw your sword and prepare for battle, as two more of the creatures step out and move towards you. A quick assessment of your opponents leaves you unimpressed. You've fought orcs before, and you know how tough they can be, but though massively built by human standards, each of them standing well over six feet tall, by orcish standards, the group before you are little more than children, a pair of males and a solitary female, young warriors out on their first raid in an attempt to prove themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to use the orcs inexperience and innate stupidity against them, you allow the two males to flank you. Adopting a defensive stance, you wait for the males to make the first move. the young orcs oblige you almost immediately, charging forward recklessly. Raising their weapons, the two orcs strike, one going high, bringing his ax down in an overhead smash, while the other swings his sword low, attempting to slice you in half at the waist. Such an attack might well have worked against a less experienced warrior, but not you, as dive to the left and roll away at the last moment, causing the young orcs attacks to strike each other instead, splitting open the head of the sword wielder like a melon, killing him instantly. The ax wielding orc fairs a bit better though he's still nearly cut clean in half by the attack of his companion. It's not enough to kill a creature as tough as an orc, at least not right away, but it's certainly enough to put him out of the fight and allow you to deal with him at your leisure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to your feet, you move in for the kill, when you hear a twig snap behind you. You'd forgotten about the female! Acting on instinct, you duck, the she orcs blade whistling through the air where your head had been just half a second before, and stab your sword behind you. You strike true, causing the she orc to shriek in pain. Knowing such a feeble attack isn't enough to finish her, you quickly withdraw your blade and roll forward, springing to your feet and turning, just in time to block an overhead slash by your opponent. Not having had time to set yourself properly, the she orc's massive strength is enough to drive you to your knees, your arms nearly buckling beneath the force of her blow. Why do orcs have to be so damn strong! Fortunately, you're stronger, and with a mighty heave, you thrust your body upwards, driving the female back a few steps, providing yourself with some much needed breathing room. Quickly, before the female can regain her balance, you launch your own attack, quickly slamming blow after blow into the she orcs defenses. Though nearly as strong as you are, and most likely possessing greater endurance, the females wounds and the weight of her over sized sword make her slow, and it doesn't take long for you to spot an opening, which you exploit ruthlessly, your sharp blade severing the orc girls sword arm just below the elbow, causing her to scream in agony, clutching at her injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneer before asking in orcish \"What's wrong orc girl, feeling a bit short handed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn human! I'll kill you!\" the orc girl screams, drawing a knife and charging towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you could easily kill her now, you're having fun, and decide to prolong the battle a bit longer. Transferring your sword to a one handed grip, you allow the orc girl to close within arms reach, then your empty hand lashes out, quick as lightning, seizing the orc girls wrist in an unbreakable grip, before raising your sword high above you, and bringing it down hard, severing the orc girls remaining arm at the shoulder, before doing the same with the stump of her sword arm, followed by her legs, removing them both at the hips, leaving her a bleeding, screaming torso lying there on the ground. As she writhes in pain, you study her. Even though she's an orc, the females surprisingly attractive, or at least would be, if she wasn't covering in blood and writhing around in agony. In fact, aside from the green skin, and small fangs, she appears almost human, though much more heavily muscled than most human women. She's probably some sort of half breed, an orc human hybrid most likely, though an orc elf combination is also possible. As you study the orc girl, her wails of agony begin to get to you. Though it seems almost a shame to kill her, it doesn't seem right to make her continue to suffer either. You have to do something. </span></div></div>",

Well, it could be worse, who really wants to live in an orc encampment anyway? So Borona, now that we've got that out of the way do you have any objections to me mating with you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing once more, Borona inquires \"Would my objecting make any difference?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\" you answered playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than do what you have to.

Far larger than any you've ever seen on a human woman, her breasts are huge, each one larger than her head by a good margin, their dark green nipples standing out proudly from her chest, though whether due to the cold or the prospect of mating for the first time your not sure.

Should I have it prepared for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNephew Guran knelt at his feet, the heavy bronze shield raised up like a platter. A fine cut across the boy's abdomen displayed his pink intestines but the young warrior's face did not betray him by showing it, nor his arms shake. Khades Khagan languidly regarded the still pulsing organ of the centaur leader before reaching out a thick hand and lifting it to his teeth. He ripped off a large mouthful and chewed, relishing the taste of his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the centaur settlement and their pathetic garrison had fallen faster than the slaves could even erect and clad the Khagan's tent and thick billows of black smoke passed through the bare, wooden structure from the burning city, carrying with it the delicious smell of cooking horse meat and the music of screams and neighs. Most of the herd had fled and were now being chased and corralled by his men to be gelded, branded, chained and sold on as slaves, or simply butchered, their bodies adding to the supplies and the strength of his marauding warband. The more beautiful of the centaur women would be kept for the pleasure of the men and their stallions alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across at the tent at the young boy that sat within the group of his wives and concubines, he wondered if they might be fortunate enough to find human women to slave here. It was unlikely this far into centaur lands, yet he would have appreciated a slave to gift to his first born and heir, a nubile maiden by which he might cease to be a boy and become a man as soon as he was physically able. The child was almost 8 years old - at that age, Khades had already killed his first and united the clan behind him. Yet Qara had spent the entire assault hiding among the skirts of the concubines, staring at the violence with wide fearful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will not lay out the spoils for him so easily,</i> he swore to himself. <i>It would only make him look weaker in the eyes of others. He must learn to seize them for himself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting out the last, gristly remains of the centaur elder, Khades pointed a bloody finger at one of his shield-maidens with a grunt of \"armour\". She stepped forward to give her nimble fingers to the cause of stripping the fur and plates of bronze spikes that adorned his shoulders. To the nephew, he simply waved a hand, and he rose and walked rigidly from the tent to collapse outside of the Khagan's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhades curled his toes within the mound of pearls, gold, and silver plated nose rings and horse shoes. Warriors carrying armfuls of jewelry and gems waited eagerly for their chance to lay their offerings at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined his great-axe. The double-edged blade was slick and shining like a ruby, but the shaft was merely spattered. \"A short fight,\" he grunted to himself, though his voice carried a weight that was heard by every ear in the room. \"Too short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the men in the tent were less eager to approach the Khagan, at least within swinging range. They crept forward like mice, eyes locked on the blade which he was regarding with dissatisfaction, while some simply lay down their loot and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be other fights to come, brother,\" came the voice of Taban Khan, stepping into the tent. His armour was untarnished and undented - bloodied, though there were some that said Taban was privy to steal blood from the vanquished dead to paint himself with undeserved glory. His fingers were already glittering with fine rings and held the reins of a beauty, a cream-coloured mare dragged forward. She dug her hooves into the well-churned earth only for a laughing soldier to drive a glowing brand into her backside, sending her kicking and screaming forward. Other than the saddle that the men had forced on her, she was naked and tattood from human head to horse hooves with twisting sigils. Her eyes were bandaged and she thrashed her head blindly towards each noise, golden hair sweeping back and forth as she saught out a target to strike out at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Taban's urging, ropes were slung across the mare and staked to the ground and she was soon restrained against the soft mud. \"An oracle of the Newa clan, brother. Famed the world around, they can speak no lies. She will speak you the future, brother. She will tell you where the next fight awaits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet snort of appreciation huffed from Khades nostrils at this unexpected gift. Those who knew him would never think that the great leader concerned himself for future things, only the present, but happily he approached his brother and embraced him. Then, kneeling beside the oracle to remove the bit from her cursing mouth, he said \"Speak well and I may not cut out your tongue. Tell me...\"</span></div></div>",

Chosen to serve others, maybe. \"If you want to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haughty mare stared vehemently at him for a couple of seconds, thought of something, exhaled a sigh, nodded, and resigned to her fate. She lowered her head before her new \"lord\" and began to recite:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Then I shall tell you your fate<br>\r\nThat you yourself should await<br>\r\nYou shall conquer the lands far and wide<br>\r\nAnd be able to look at all the skies above<br>\r\nBut one day your son<br>\r\nHaving mastered the techniques of the polearm<br>\r\nShall intrude upon you on a summer day<br>\r\nAnd all the debts he will repay<br>\r\nYour hardened self will surge<br>\r\nAnd in a fountain you shall explode<br>\r\nOn your deathbed...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anymore. Or rather, she wasn't given the chance to say anymore. The chief's war-axe cleaved through her torso as smoothly as it would through butter, the strength behind the swing separating the bones, tissue, and muscle as if they weren't there. The 40-pound torso flew across the field, landing into a ditch 20-feet away with a thud. The raging fury could be clearly seen on the chief's face, blood vessels about to pop. His retainers slowly retreated, not wanting to fall into the path of another axe swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who!\" Khades erupted, his spit spraying forth from madness. \"Who dared to bring this unintelligent beast before me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, brother,\" Taban Khan interrupted, catching his swinging axe with an extended arm. Only Taban could match the strength of his brother, albeit he would lose in the end. \"There is no guarantee to the truth in her words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you the one who claimed otherwise?\" Khades roared, grabbing his brother's wrist. If his answer didn't satisfy him, he was going to use his utmost strength to crush that muscular limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, I told you what <i>she</i> had claimed. Do you really believe that such beasts would have an oracle? I assure you it was simply in jest.\" Taban could feel his brother's hand loosening its grip. \"What can your young one do anyway? He's still sucking on his mama's teat, unlike my own, who distinguished himself in battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son is now dead, I have nothing to fear of him. Mine isn't.\" He finally took his hand off his brother's wrist, leaving behind a reddening mark. \"Still, you're right. This beast was bluffing her way out of the situation. Poor choice of words if you ask me! But we best removed any trace of spears within our tribe, and convince their bearers to take up other weapons. Actually, it's best if we kill them outright. Can't have the boy learning the polearm. Good thing we don't too many of those around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Taban nodded, as he went to fulfill his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 7 years since that furious war with the centaurs. The resistance they put up was almost non-existent, yet it remained in the memories of all due to the event that happened at the end of it: the prophecy of the oracle. Most of the tribesman brushed off the foretelling words as ramblings from a desperate beast, trying to curry the favor of the chief, but they couldn't help but keep it lingering in their memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you had no memory of the incident, only hearsay of it. Apparently, it had involved you, Khulan Khagan, only son of the great chief, Khades Khagan, but you knew nothing beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khula! Come join us!\" Your mother waved to you, sitting among the other wives and concubines of the great chief. You trotted over and sat on the floor of the tent, filled with patchwork of wool and cotton and silk. The women were knitting new garments for their dear lord, ones that were used in battle and outside to provide him comfort. You picked up a bundle on cotton fabric and some pins, and began knitting woolen underwear for your father. Winter was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly bizarre sight to see -- you, a man, sitting down and engaging in woman's activities while the rest of the men were outside, sparring. Of course, you did go out every night and perform simple exercises here and there -- pushing your up from the ground and carrying heavy weights -- so that your body possessed lean muscles, but you were unlike all the warriors outside, training with their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was what you wanted. You never had a penchant for those activities, always considering dance and other feminine arts to be at the peak of creativity. Your father was naturally disturbed by that when you were young, but had laid off forcing you to take part in sparring since you were eight. Perhaps he finally recognized the path you've chosen and acknowledged it. He didn't even appoint another heir, which pointed to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women, on the other hand, considered you their own. In fact, at times, they hardly even treated you any differently than a girl, dressing up in their sarafan dresses and braiding your long hair. It really threw off your father when you were young, leaving him wondering where this young girl had appeared from. Now that you were more muscular, though, you stuck out within your company like a sore thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Khulan,\" A dark-haired, young girl, about 22 years of age, had slid up to you. She was a newly-captured, the daughter of a governor that your father had killed and had his town razed. Your father had, of course, claimed her as his 47th wife. \"I am supposed to serve your father in bed today, and the women around here said that you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off with a gesture. You were also the one that inexperienced women were sent to in regards to training. After all, you were a boy yourself, so you knew the pleasures that could be brought to a man, and thus, you were considered to be a better tutor than any of the women -- even your mother, the first wife of Khades. You pulled a wooden figurine out of a sack that was lying nearby: the chief's penis, whose dimensions were exactly comparable to those of the real thing. The women here used it for training in order to please their lord, so that they may move up the rankings that were determined once every summer. Your wife had held first place for the last seventeen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch how I do it,\" you instruct, gripping the firm wooden cock within your hands. It was big, at least 11 inches long, and your hands, though dainty, could barely reach around over half of it. \"First, you wet it to make it easier to accept it all.\" You gave the head of the wooden phallus a couple of licks, then drew your tongue along the shaft. \"It's important you do this, or else it will be painful. Then, you place it on your tongue like this.\" You placed the head on your tongue, the angle of the shaft bent slightly downwards. \"And then you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Khulan!\" A large man threw the flaps of the tent open, entering it. You just barely managed to stuff that wooden pole down your throat, and clasp your hands over it. Your uncle thought that homosexuality was the pinnacle of debauchery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother has summoned you,\" He looks at you, observing your reddening face. \"Are you all right there, lad? You look sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Thankfully, that was all that you needed to do as your uncle hurried out of the tent. He was a maniac when it came to sparring, always trying to surpass your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is how you do it,\" You said, after extracting the wooden shaft and taking several deep gulps of air. The entire tent broke out into applause, the wives and concubines around you clapping as the young girl launched herself onto you like out of a catapult, in order to embrace you. You probably spent a minute like this softly yanking her off you and heading to your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, I have arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I have a mission for you, son, that will force you to wander to a faraway land called Tryzantium for some time. The mission is...</span></div></div>",

The crude drawing had been hard enough to follow before some of the ink had started to run, and you didn\u2019t feel like getting lost down in the twisting passages beneath the ground. Deciding on one of the branches, you set off again, senses alert for whatever had been following you since you came down here. It was subtle at first: a quiet scratch here, a soft sniff there, and the barest glint of something hiding in the shadows beyond your light. When you went under and your torch went out however, you could tell it rushed to get closer to you in the sudden darkness. With your sword illuminating the area around you now, it had backed off again. Whatever it was, it was obviously tracking you, but remaining away from the light as much as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also kept an eye on the floor below in order to avoid another fall if possible. The clear water gave you fleeting glimpses of your reflection before the ripples washed it away. Your midnight black hair was mostly hidden beneath your helmet except for a stray lock that peeked out at the edge. Thick plates hid most of your curvy body, but a careful observation could give a hint of the shape that lay beneath. Your sword was practical and without much ornamentation, except for the pommel: a gemstone that swirled with an inner light, serving as a focus for your spells. You typically went without a shield on the other arm to leave your hand free to cast spells, but could summon a magical replacement if it was truly required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral branches and backtracks from dead ends later, you came to what had to be your destination: a large grotto in some of the deepest reaches of the cavern. Within the shimmering depths, vast deposits of crystals sprouted from the walls. Releasing the spell on your sword, you saw that the crystals indeed cast a gleaming glow of their own; something the wizard did get correct. He said he needed several of the crystals to help maintain the barrier around the city, as well as for his own experiments, and he was paying you good money to get them. Before you left, he went into a longwinded explanation about the nature of the crystals, but the only bit you remembered was that the cave was a nexus of magical energy that allowed the crystals to constantly replenish given enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that the glow of the crystals would be enough to keep whatever was out there at bay. Drawing the provided rock pick from your belt, you found a cluster of easily reachable crystals and set to work. Before long, you had a double handful of the glowing crystals tucked in a pouch hanging from your waist. You turned towards the exit but stopped and swiveled back again. On the side of one of the pillars was a crystal that caught your eye; rather than the usual greens or blues of the rest, this particular cluster was shot through with a reddish hue. Nibbling on your lip for a moment, you decided to take one of those as well, but not for the wizard, you had something else in mind for that one. It proved a bit more stubborn than the others, but after pounding for what felt to be a long time, a large piece finally broke free. You stared at the almost blood colored glow for a moment before tucking it into pocket and put the pick away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to say the spell to relight your sword when you heard the plop of a stone hitting the water, right next to you. Glancing up, you just managed to see a dark shape clinging to a stalactite above you; apparently the light of the crystals wasn\u2019t enough. In a flash, the shape dropped from the rock, slamming into the spot where you had been standing a split second before, sending a wave of water in all directions. Your quick dodge had left you sprawled in the water again, and you had only barely managed to get back to your feet before the creature was on you again, slashing at you with sickle-shaped claws and trying to take your head off. Bobbing and weaving, you managed to avoid the creature\u2019s first swipe and the subsequent follow ups, but you couldn\u2019t seem to hit it either. The dim glow of the crystals around the chamber didn\u2019t allow you to see much of whatever it was that was attacking you, but you managed to see that it was both scaly and shaggy at the same time, with big eyes and an even larger tooth filled mouth. The beast was quite surefooted on the rough floor, even with the layer of water churned up by the motion hiding what lay beneath. You, on the other hand, were often stumbling and barely managing to recover to avoid a lethal blow. Sparks fell from your armor as one blow came far too close for comfort, the claws scrapping across your breastplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to duck into a cramped crevice in the stone wall that provided nearly enough room for you to get in while still keeping the claws just out of range. It kept trying though, slamming into the stone and breaking bits free in its rush to get to you. Now with a moment to breathe, you focused again, drawing on the magic within. You weren\u2019t just going to light up your sword this time however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlarulsi Caniecto!\u201d you shouted, screwing your eyes shut as a tremendous flash of light burst from your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast howled in pain and reared back. Grabbing a hold of a rocky outcropping above you, you pulled yourself up. Jumping out of the crevice with a cry of \u201cIncenticum Consilendio!\u201d you felt a rush of energy flow into the blade before it burst into flames. The creature was just starting to recover, but it was too late. You fell atop its head, driving the point of your sword through the top of its skull, searing the meat as it penetrated. With one last gurgle, the beast collapsed into the water releasing some steam from the toothy maw before giving a final shudder and falling still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting heavily, you pulled your sword free, before wiping the dark blood off on the matted fur of the corpse. You gave the sword a quick inspection, as well as the beast, but you had no idea what it was. Thankful that you had taken only minor injuries, you illuminated your sword again before heading for the surface. The smell of charred meat and the damp clung to the inside of your nose, nearly making you gag on the short trip back to the city. Once there, you explained the trouble you had encountered and was able to get some bonus funds in compensation. He thanked you for a job well done nevertheless, and was quickly at work, even before you were out the door. Patting the pocket with your earnings, you set off again for your next destination.</span></div></div>",

Everyone thought of you as stupid muscle, as a senseless brute who meanders along and kills anything you lay eyes on.  They thought of you as a stupid mook who, despite killing to live, was too weak to kill even the lowliest of \"true\" adventurers, and instead where destined to die by the blade of some spiffy young scallywag just learning the ropes of adventuring.  That wasn't really fair, was it?<br>\r\nYour people had a complex pantheon of gods, a deep societal structure with a full code of laws, a fully fledged language system, your own system of morality that while different than other's systems was far more closely adhered to.  All this and you didn't even have a written language, showing the true power of the Orcish brain!  It's true that you and your people were a warrior race, and that you raided supply lines and towns for your sustenance, but they had put an unfair spin on things and never told your side of the story.  The humans with their superior numbers and their dishonorable, uncivilized, and cowardly fighting methods (such as using disease against your people and poisoning your supplies of food and water) pushed the orcs to the brink of extinction, and the hypocritical elves burned your ceremonial homelands to inhospitable ash.  The remaining band of orcs had to flee to the fringes of the elven woods.<br>\r\nWhereas before your people hunted pig and bull for food you now had to raid cities.  Whereas before your people only attacked cities to prove the strength of newly elected chiefs and appease your fickle gods you now had to do so to frighten the other races away from making direct attacks against your encampments.  They forced you into the corner and expected the orcs to die, but they held on and bravely persevered in the face of adversity, rebuilding your once mighty empire from mere ashes, but that story was never told...<br>\r\nIt was true that your people weren't the smartest, but you weren't too proud to admit it.  It's true that orc culture and sports were not very refined, but it's good to enjoy the simple pleasures in life.  It's true that your usage of magic was limited to body augmentation, but that just made you tougher and more direct in battle.<br>\r\nYou were a proud soldier, and respected in your clan.  Your father had died gloriously in the heat of battle and during a domestic dispute you had decapitated your mother, her head (which you had kept living with magic to this day) now kept on podium in your hut as a constant reminder of your power.  You were an only child, which was very rare in your society.  Now, what are you?</span></div></div>",

On every orc's 17th birthday they randomly choose one of three trials. Once they haven chosen a trial they must complete it within a month. If an orc fails to complete the trial they will have to wait three months before the residing warlord approves of their trial. You couldn't wait to get started. Once you complete your challenge you could marry the orcess of your dreams instead of listening to your mother's head complain about her wretched existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out the door your mother's head starts ranting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're leaving now.

Once inside you see a bunch of orcs talking about where to set a campaign next, which as evidenced by your increased excitement isn't boding well as the councilmen and councilwomen are threatening to kill each other. At the end of the table is your tribe's warlord. Unlike other tribes your warlord is actually a female orc your age became warlord.

You were rather sexy and were not one to be modest about it (few orcs were).  You had a full set of curves to accompany your muscles and you had the strong jawline to match your cute dimpled cheeks.  You had what for your size were only C cup breasts, but compared to a human, elf, or dwarf they were downright huge.  Unlike most orcs though you had a ponytail reaching down to the small of your back.  Most Orc cut there hair short so it wouldn't be a hindrance in battle, but you were confident enough in your skill as a warrior that you thought it wouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\nCurrently you were in the combat arena fighting a bout of honor against one of your fellow female warriors.  During your last raid you got a LITTLE careless while storming a set of dwarven mines.  They laid traps that in your hormone induced battle rage you walked right in to.  The traps, designed for bears, severed both of your feet just above the ankle, meaning that you had to fight the remainder of the battle embarrassingly hobbling around on your stumps.  Afterward you stopped the bleeding with your magic, making the stumps into smooth green skin, but before you cast the spell to regenerate your lost feet you caught this bitch making a sassy remark.  She claimed that you were getting soft, and that you were unlikely to get through the next battle.  Naturally you challenged her to a duel, and on a dare you claimed that you could beat her without your feet!<br>\r\nShe accepted, and as she was the defender she chose the weapons.  She decided to make the fight with only daggers.  So far the two of you were at a stalemate, your naked bodies covered in a layer of mud from rolling around on the ground.  Fighting in the mud of the sparring arena made your lack of feet practically a non issue, as your stumps sunk in the mud giving you just as much stability and equal maneuverability to your adversary, though the sensation of the tender flesh of your stumps sloshing around in the soft dirt was a little distracting.  She took another swing at you but you managed to duck under it, delivering a heavy counter punch to her left breast.  She grabbed at it as the pain registered, using her knife wielding hand to try and swat you away but it was of no use.  The blade of your weapon slammed into her gut and she again sank into the mud, her bare ass splashing as she resisted the urge to double over.<br>\r\nYou brought up one of your footless legs and delivered a kick to her teeth, but as you did so she brought her knife up into your calf and pulled you down with her.  You grunted with pain as she rapidly got up and straddled you, her warm and lightly haired pussy pressing against your stomach.  Despite being in the heat of battle you couldn't help but notice just how wet she was, her lips spread wide and pressed against your body you felt her fluids drip onto your skin.  It was a little mesmerizing, and felt very nice while you were lying under her.<br>\r\nYou barely react in time as she plunges her knife at your neck, catching it by the hand guard with your own weapon just a hair's length from your throat.  She grimaces and tries to force her blade past your defense but you are unyielding.  You realize that you still have a free hand, and decide to cause a little distraction.  Reaching up you slip your free hand past your left boob and force it directly into her snatch, your fingers grinding against her clitoris causing her to gasp in shock.  You begin fingering her, smiling wryly as her face reddens and she starts losing her grip on her knife.  You can tell that she is about to lose it in more than one way when a shock wave rolls through your body, staring from your crotch.  She's moved her hand behind her back and is now fingering you as well, her tender yet strong fingers rolling over the lips of your labia.  You start panting, fingering her harder, which in turn causes her to hasten as well.  For nearly three minutes you lock eyes, a fire glowing in hers that you're sure you're returning.  You're about reach climax out here in the mud and judging by the way she's shaking she's also about to blow.  Then...</span></div></div>",

Your cock started to harden at the sight of her bare ass, which made your hand play more roughly with your chest than you had planned.  Hours before you had just finished mopping up the last of a poorly thought out human fort, its pathetic resistance barely even slowing down your mighty warriors as you breached the gates.  It had been your first time in a command position and it had been a resounding success!  As such you had been given first pick of prisoners to be your personal slave.<br>\r\nContrary to popular belief Orcs did in fact did take prisoners from the surviving civilian population, they just never lived long enough to tell other races of that.  Many were used as living training dummies for the young to learn the basics of combat and magic.  Despite at times being twice their age very few managed to kill the students assigned them, and if they did the student clearly deserved it.  Some were cooked and eaten in grand feasts, the whole raiding party taking pieces with the person who captured and cooked them getting their pick first.  The rest, mostly nubile women, were used as breeding stock for half orcs.<br>\r\nHalf orcs were the cannon fodder of your society, and the pinnacle of disposable muscle.  They were not as big as true orcs, not as strong, not as fast, not as smart, and had much weaker senses, but they were loyal to a fault and would follow orders to the grave.  They also matured very quickly, growing into full adult within a week, though few lived a second week.  The woman you had taken was young, likely still in her twenties, with full hips and a delicious rump accentuating her jet black haired head and snatch.

While your childhood hadn't been perfect it seemed that in recent years the gods seemed to be particularly interested in you, more specifically they seemed to be interested in finding new and interesting ways to bend you over and have their way with you like a cheap tavern wench.  It all started about two years ago, on what was supposed to be a rather routine snatch and grab.  The client wanted you to track down and take a magical artifact that was a family heirloom of his unrightfully stolen by a gypsy who'd recently gone blind.  The money was good, the task simple, and while you were never particularly troubled by what society deemed to be morally correct the job fell on the better end of the spectrum so you could even claim moral high ground in this case if you so chose.<br>\r\nTracking her down was simple.  After asking around the last town she'd been seen in the people pointed you towards her hide out, a cave not too far out of town.  What was less simple was actually getting to her.  The cave was crawling with the undead, which should've been a dead giveaway that this wasn't just any gypsy.  While necromancer gypsies were quite common these weren't your typical shambling skeletons, they were well armored, equipped, and powerful zombie creatures, each one quite a real threat to you.  Still inspired by the prospect of reward though you pressed on, eventually coming face to grey eyed face with the gypsy.  She was quite a looker, apart from the constantly bleeding bandages around her eyes.<br>\r\nDespite having no sense of sight she seemed to have no trouble tracking your movements, fighting you as an equal with magic and minions.  While you had not entered with the intent to kill her, planning only on stealing the artifact and making it out unseen you were however forced to put her down to survive.  Searching the cave though you found no artifact, and questioning the dying necromancer she informed you that she hadn't stolen anything.  The person who sent you was actually a low ranking demon in disguise and a rival of this gypsy.  He'd sent you here on false pretenses to murder someone he deemed a threat to his plans, though you didn't know what they were and the gypsy didn't tell you, instead using her dying breath and last of her magical energy to curse you!<br>\r\nWhile human animal hybrids were certainly not new most of the ones living today were either born that way from ancestors long passed or magically blessed who did so to themselves.  They were second class citizens and seen as barbarians or even lower, animals, by many and the gypsy had transformed you into one!  Not only that, but she changed your gender to female and gave you a very curvaceous body, visually pleasing features, and sultry voice to boot, making sure that you were either objectified by perverts, vilified by 'civilized' folk, or run out of town by racial purist mobs wherever you went!  You had tried seeking magical aide but the mages informed you that the curse was a binding spell and could not be lifted unless you completed specific criteria.  This one was bound to a person: the demon who'd sent you after the gypsy in the first place, and it'd only be lifted if the demon were slain.

You screamed for help to no avail, and started sobbing when you finally gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, the orc had finished and started coming towards you.

She had thick, long, soft, hair that flowed down to rest on her shoulders. It looked like it was made of liquid gold,and was illuminated by the sunlight. Here eyes had a maching golden color, and had a kindness and warmth in them. Her skin was also a golden color and she had a large rear, and large breasts. Her clothing was modest, not showing any bare skin. She wore warm and fluffy attire that was suited for traveling. The elven maiden had a warm smile as she gazed at you, and you noticed that she was very tall, towering over you with a height of 8ft 4in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked, your voice quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Alyndra little one.\" The elf replied. \"I am a golden elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in supprise. You have heard of the golden elves. They were the tallest of the elven degradations, and also the kindest. They were very gentle and passive, yet very skilled in battle and magic, only using their skill to protect themselves and others. Dispite the prejudice against elves, golden elves were allowed in almost every single human settlement. Sadly they were the rarest of the degradations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were very hurt little one.\" Alyndra told you with a frown. \"You had a nasty injury on your head. Is your memory intact?\"</span></div></div>",

Tears started flowing out of your eyes as you started sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyndra had been trying to think of what to say next when the fox woman started crying. The fox woman had a height of 4ft 2in, exactly Alyndra's height. Her body had a thick coat of short fur. Most of it was orange. Her belly had white fur, and her hands and feet had black fur that stopped at her wrists and ankles. Her feet were human, except had traits that reminded Alyndra of paws. She had a large, long, fox tail that was very fluffy. Finally her face was human-like, except it was covered in fur. She had brown eyes, a cute nose, and short ginger hair. The elven maiden noticed that She scooped up the little thing into her arms and rocked her back and forth.<br>\r\n\"Shh. It's alright little one.\" Alyndra said in a soothing tone. \"I'm here for you.\" She let the little thing cry until she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you noticed that you were in a bed and in Alyndra's embrace.

You noticed she seemed nervous.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I've just got a question for you.\" Alyndra told you in response. She then took a deep breath. \"You see, I've become very lonely these days, and I'd like some company. I'm becoming very fond of you and I'd hate to see something bad happen to you. So is it okay if I adopt you as my pet?\"<br>\r\nYou were suprised to hear her ask this. You were hesitant, but the elven maiden had been nothing but kind to you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An animal in human lands can be one of three things: it can be useful, it can be tasty or it can be vermin. Vermin is as good as dead in the long run. You don't want to be vermin and aside from a few strange looks from the Hashaan that suggest otherwise, you don't think you're very tasty either, so you quickly found it necessary to become useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmployment options for \"subhumans\" are limited. The guilds are effectively barred to you as none would ever wish to be associated with your kind, while owning your business is out of the question, after all your our status is that of property, and property does not own property. There is always manual labour for those derived from robust stock - the dogmen or the minotaurs - but your feline form was never built for breaking rocks or plowing fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lucky few, prized for their rarity or exceptional beauty, find their way into households as pets and their lives are blessed, but that is a pedigree you could never hope to attain. You are a street cat, and two years in the gutter has only made that more plain to see by the ragged look of your ears and matted fur. This form was undeniably appealing - a fact you were forced to accept each miserable day - but too much in the way of a tavern wench, too sexualised for the refined, sensitive tastes of the nobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo survive in human lands, it was a sad fact that most female animals took to a form of prostitution grim ever by the standards of that profession. Their clients were the lowest of the low - stinking, piss-soaked tramps, orcs or those with more money but more deranged appetites. Most experienced the short lifespans expected of animals, to the point where the common knowledge was that beastmen had naturally brief lives. You had been six months a street cat before you learned that this was false - you were doomed to this existence for the remainder of a full human life. You'd almost cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike natural-born halfbreeds, you still have pride. Unwilling to stoop to prostitution, you'd found yourself in the only career path left for one with a body like yours. Mouser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the basement of the Boastful Bard, you are crouched atop a barrel, your rat mallet in your paws as your bright green eyes peer through the darkness. Rows of ale casks disappear into blackness too thick even for your animal eyes to penetrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour tails already hang from your belt. A trickle of gore runs from the business end of the mallet, down over your paws, and you wipe them clean on the matted, tortoiseshell fur of your calf. It's not easy sitting still for so long. The fleas infesting your coat itch like crazy today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had a shower a few times in the two years since your humanity and manhood were take away, whenever it rained, and a bath once when somebody pushed you in a river. You resist the instinct to lick yourself clean on a daily basis. You figure it is best to be as physically repulsive as possible. Less chance of somebody trying to put kittens in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was tasty,\" you mutter to the empty basement. Pigmen waddle through the streets behind their masters, fat and healthy and happy, while a good milk-giving heifer is highly prized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rat skulks out from the shadows between two casks, sniffs the air and scuttles to the lump of cheese set out on the basement floor. Your already expansive eyes widen, the fur rising all along your spine. The rat is the size of a small dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap, the mallet striking a heavy blow on the skull. It shrieks. Its teeth sink deep into the thick wooden shaft as you swing again, nearly snapping it in half. Had that been your arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving it time for another bite, you let go of the mallet, claws springing from their sheaths, slashing at the creature's eyes. Its own claws rake along your chest. Acting on instinct, you sink your teeth into its neck, blood pouring out as you puncture skin and veins, and with a powerful thrash of your body you fling the thing against the floor. The already shattered skull caves in completely. It twitches and dies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath, you survey the damage. Scratches cover your chest. A lot of blood but most of it is the rat's. You draw your knife and reach down to retrieve your prize - the thick, pink, snakelike tail that winds its way into the shadows between the casks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is moving there, writhing and rustling. The dead rat is dragged inches over the floor. With a hiss of outrage, you grab the tail and pull back. This is yours, you fought for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tail is pulled into the weak candlelight, you see a lump on the end, a ball of encrusted filth and dry blood into which four more massive tails are knotted. A Rat King. Dropping the carcass, you back away as the four conjoined rats step into view. With a single mind, they lunge. The weight of their dead brother is the only thing that saves you, slowing them down as they drag it across the floor. You sprint across the cellar with them snapping at your bare heels, leap and land atop a high casket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing your back against the wall, you push against the barrel with all your strength. Ever so slowly it rolls, falls, hits the Rat King with an almighty bang and four death screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN THE BLAZES OF HELL IS GOING ON DOWN HERE!\" The basement door is thrown open, the barkeep silhouetted against the light of the inn. You climb down from the shelf, sever the bundle of tails from its bodies and climb shakily up the stairs. As you step into the bright warmth, he stares at the blood and gags. \"Did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit out a glob of blood and growl, \"When you said you had a big rat problem, what you really meant to say is you have a Giant Rat problem, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of his mouth flickers up. \"Well yeah, that's what I said. Big rat problems. Aint my problem if you don't listen right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have been killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, that aint my problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the grisly bundle into his hands. \"I want my reward. A room for a week and food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. You promised me twenty tails,\" he replies indignantly. \"This counts as one. Get back down there and make sure the job is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself shaking. \"I don't deserve this... I was a human once-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm the Prince of Tryzantium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had rights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you got rats. Or rather, you don't got enough. So you get more. Or you don't get paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother failed job. If you don't find work soon you'll starve. You turn and push through the patrons huddled in the warm inn who gawp at you as you pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filthy animal! Getting blood all over my floor. My wife'll use your hide fer a dishrag! Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. We had a deal. I want my twenty tails.\" Your tail is seized tightly in the innkeeper's hand. He is trying to drag you back to the cellar door. Either that or he's trying to pull your tail off. You dig your claws into the floorboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The agreement was for twenty rat tails,\" you howl. \"You're not paying me enough for Giant Rat Kings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush passes through the inn. The innkeeper let go. You turn to see him casting nervous glances around as the low murmur of gossip begins to build. His customer are suddenly edgy, glancing for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis huge hands grab you, muffling your mouth and dragging you back into the kitchen. \"Keep your mouth shut,\" he hisses. \"No more talk of Rat Kings. I'll pay you more, just clear out the damn cellar. I'll give you board for a month. Fresh straw every week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that pride again. \"No deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If people find out I've got a Rat King downstairs, I'll lose all my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said... that isn't my problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to leave, he seized your arm. \"Three months and ten gold pieces. These creatures, they're ill omens. Unnatural.\" He lowers his voice to a hush. \"People say they herald the presence of... demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is as though a weight has been lifted from your shoulders. He frowns as you smile wildly and shake his hand enthusiastically. Finally, a lead!</span></div></div>",

What in the name of the Mother is that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeepers wife has returned to the kitchen to find a bedraggled you dripping blood on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearest, this is the mouser I told you about. She's going to deal with our problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is she doing in here? I want her out of my kitchen! Out out out!\" She reaches for a rolling pin and her husband quickly evacuates you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a well-oiled gossip mill operating at full speed is unmistakable as you step back into the inn. The innkeeper leads you through the crowd with remarks of, \"Rat king? No no. You misheard. She misspoke. I aint interested in hearing what you think she said. Get all your news from animals do you, Mrs Midgeley? You'll be asking a dog for the weather next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls you to an out of the way room on the ground floor. You notice it has locks on both sides of the door. Inside is sparse - a basin, a pisspot and a large mound of straw illuminated by a thin slit of a window. \"Normally we keep this room for the orcs,\" he says. \"Don't mess it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he has gone, you lock the door. Alone in your room, you sink into the straw. It feels wonderful. Your exhausted limbs begin to shake and you let them. For months you've been sleeping rough with just your fur for bedding, one eye always open in case somebody tried to steal what little you had left. You're asleep almost instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep is the one aspect of life that has been enhanced by your transformation, if only perhaps because waking life is so grim. Cat dreams are simple and vivid, concerned with simple pleasures and delights. You dream you're chasing a demon. You dream you capture him, toy with him with your claws as he slowly dies. Lastly you dream you are a human man with a house and a real bed and a wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud metal scrape jolts you awake. Something is being dragged down the hallway outside the room. A hand tries the door handle then raps impatiently. You draw your knife. \"Wh-who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The damn owner, open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unbolt and open the door. The sweaty back of the innkeeper fills the doorframe as he drags a heavy copper tub into the room. It is a third full of steaming hot, murky water. Another third is slopped down the innkeeper's apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compliments of the missus. This is what us humans call a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff the water suspiciously. It smells like turnip and there are rinds floating in it. \"Are you trying to cook me?\" you ask half-jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water from the kitchens. Wife isn't happy keeping you but she says if you're staying you're gonna clean yourself. She doesn't want you stinkin' the place out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't bathe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something I don't know,\" he sniffs, wrinkling his nose. \"First rule of my inn, don't piss off my wife.\" Tossing you a lump of yellow soap, he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit you're pretty disgusting. Straw clings to the congealed, black rat blood that coats the front of your rags. The flies buzzing about your head make your ears twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water turns pink as you step into the tub, clothes and all, turning a deep red as you lower yourself in inch by inch. You splash water on your face, careful to avoid getting water in your large sensitive ears, then take the soap to the dirty fur of your neck and arms, scrubbing out the tangled knots and progressing down to gently scrape the grime out from within the claw sheathes. The claws themselves are an ugly yellow-brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrub both arms and legs. At the first touch of soap, the rags all but dissolve, the last vestiges of your human clothes held together only by dirt at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet fur clings to your breasts which rise above the filthy water. You give them a ginger, cursory clean. Two years on the poverty line has reduced them from swollen excess to modest and manageable and your fur feels loose, like a wooly jumper two sizes too large. Two neat lines of small nipples, six in total, lead down a torso crisscrossed with long, shallow scratch marks. You look like a tic-tac-toe game. Steeling yourself, you rub the soap into the mound of thick, soft fur that sits between your legs, feeling dirty even as you clean yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you leave the rest to soak, allowing the heat to work its way into your tired muscles. You doze for a while. When you wake, the water is cold. You climb out and sit on the side of the tub, shivering yourself dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew clothing is an absolute priority. Perhaps you can wrangle some rags from the innkeeper. Or there is the town's nightmarket - you could venture out under cover if darkness.</span></div></div>",

The demon always seemed to know when you were getting close because each time you followed a trail to the end, you always told that you had just missed whoever the demon was masquerading as at that time. Your journey spanned much of the civilized lands and beyond, even taking you to the frozen wastes of the north, and the broiling deserts of the south. Throughout it all, you had come to grudgingly appreciate the body the gypsy had \u201ccursed\u201d you with: the raw strength and power that your form now possessed had served you well, as had your now feminine wiles\u2014you lost track of how many times you had saved your own life or at least made things easier by batting your eyelashes, rolling your hips, or even flashing some cleavage. Bandits in particular seemed more likely to pay attention to your feminine shape, rather than the katana hidden beneath your cloak, or at least they did so until the distraction proved their undoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo amount of seduction was going to help now though, as your blade sang with each stroke, a wet thud or a muffled crack in response for each.

The job had started simply enough, stuck between where you were coming from and where you were going, you had taken a notice from the local bounty board; the pay being enough to pay for your passage to the next city, and hopefully another breadcrumb in the latest trail of the demon. It was just supposed to be a simple item retrieval job from the ruined fort up in the mountains above the village. A search of the ruins hadn\u2019t revealed your target, and you were starting to wonder if it hadn\u2019t been a trick or something. If that was the case, it might have explained the sly grins and chortles that some brutish thugs had traded as you set out. But you had little time to consider that, as hat\u2019s when the rotted floor beneath you gave away, dropping you to the floor below, which didn\u2019t stand up to the impact of you falling, neither did the next, dropping you into a hidden network of tunnels beneath the fort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the notice hadn\u2019t mentioned was the fact that fort had belonged to a rather industrious necromancer, but you found that out when your sudden appearance awakened several shambling skeletons. They were put down rather easily, but the noise attracted what seemed to be never-ending waves of zombies. They weren\u2019t nearly as well made as the zombies that the gypsy had possessed, but there were just so many of them down here, and they seemed to be remarkably resilient: no matter how much damage you did to each, some part of them always seemed to keep moving and trying to attack you. It came as a bit of a shock when you lopped off both arms of the first, before moving onto the second, only to find your feet tangled up because of the severed arms entangling with your legs. You freed yourself just in time and had settled into the repetitive, but still harrowing, task of hacking and slashing through the undead flesh and bones that continued to press ever closer to you. Despite the strength and endurance that your body possessed, you were beginning to feel fatigue weakening your swings and slowing your reactions\u2014sweat was flowing freely, mixing with the foul ichor that splattered from the walking corpses and matting any lose locks of your black hair to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour options to try and free yourself were limited though, too little room to use your wings and try to fly up and out, the passage behind you quickly dead ended at a cave-in, and the zombies were pouring out of the three remaining corridors. You could try to continuing cutting through the wave of rotting flesh, but you were unsure if you could keep it up without making a dire mistake that might cost you everything. You could also try falling back into the blocked passageway and see if you could find a gap that you might be able to slip through. And third, you could pull out a last ditch move that you saved in case of emergencies, and it certainly seemed like this might be one of those times. Inhaling deeply, you made your choice and acted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few more swings of your blade cut down the next couple zombies, but then the blade skipped off of a bone and became wedged in the ribcage of the next undead monster. You were forced to leave it in place, jumping back to avoid a fatal strike from claw-like fingers nearly tearing your throat out. A few more hops back the passage behind you and you had opened up a little bit of space and found that the cave-in had indeed sealed the way through, maybe if you weren\u2019t fighting off the horde, you might be able clear enough to get through, but you had no time now. Without your sword and no way out, it was time for your emergency trump card. You turned your attention inward, focusing down into your body for the little spark of magic within. Clamping down on the little bit of magic with both muscle and mind, you felt it start to blaze into life. Briefly turning your attention to the undead creatures, you saw that they continued their slow march towards you, though the pile of their fallen comrades had slowed them down slightly. The little bit of magic became a swirling tempest, barely contained within your body, but you still had to hold on, you were only going to get one shot at this so you had better not waste it. Your body and mind trembled as you tried to contain the awesome might within yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of the rotting flesh rolled over you and you felt their grasping hands reaching out for you, so it was finally time. Releasing your hold on the magic, you let loose with a tremendous roar and a torrent flame that slammed into the zombies. The impact knocked those closest to you back, while the heat roasted all of them. The smell of the burning rotted flesh was horrendous, but you continued to pour on the heat, making sure you got every last one. You only hoped that you wouldn\u2019t bring the whole building down with such an outpouring of energy. As your magical reserves ran out the flame died down, leaving mounds of blackened and shattered rotted flesh behind. Now completely drained, you dropped to your knees before falling face first into the grimy floor. Too little energy remained in you for you to do much else then lay there and hope that you had gotten them all; you were in no condition to defend yourself if you missed even one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to some time later, your nose filled with the stench of the burnt rotted flesh surrounding you. A puddle of putrefied and liquefied ooze had leaked across the already dirty stones and almost reached you. Your throat was still sore and it hurt to breath, but you weren\u2019t dead, so that\u2019s a bonus. Shakily getting to your feet, you found that you had apparently succeeded in destroying the zombies, not a single piece had moved since you fired your last attack. Dodging most of the goop, you made your way to one of the corpses, and pulled your sword free, the flesh around the cut crumbling as you did so. Your katana was blacked and scorched a bit, but had actually been protected from the worst of the inferno by the zombies. Now armed again, you listened intently for signs of anything else in the ruins, but heard nothing except for your ragged breathing and the wind mournfully wailing through the cracked and broken stones above. Satisfied that there wasn\u2019t any further immediate danger, you cautiously move forward, and spared a glance up the hole that you made earlier. Only a pale glow leaked down through the broken fort, the sun having long dipped out of sight, in its place only a pale sliver of the moon cast its light, and this was partially obscured beyond wispy clouds that shrouded the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you had the chance, you could certainly try climbing out that way or clearing enough of the debris out of the way to see about getting out, but you weren\u2019t going to give up on this job, not after everything else you had gone through. Focusing on the task at hand, you adjusted the dented and dinged plates of armor strapped around your body and wiped off some of the foul ichor that still clung to you, staining any exposed patches of midnight blue scales a noxious shade of greenish-yellow. After that proved only mildly successful you moved on, taking one of the passages that the zombies welled up from. The darkened passages further down were barely lit by half-functioning magical lamps, but they still provided enough light that you didn\u2019t have to rely on a torch or anything else that might attract more attention. The stench of decay still lingered in the dark dank corridors, though now it was overlaid with a bit of smoke due to the flames that you expelled. You continued walking on and on, the hidden passages much larger than the surface ruin might suggest, eventually going beyond where your flames seemed to reach, though there was still no sign of further zombies or anything else lurking and waiting to attack you. After continuing down a very long passage, you came across a large door that was inscribed with magical runes. An electric tingle caused the hair on the back of your neck to stand up and made your scales itch, a sign that there was almost certainly powerful magic beyond. You had no ability to read the magical symbols across the door, but it looked like they were inactive, some of them were even smudged and broken. Pressing against the door did little, but it did budge slightly. Gritting your teeth and slamming your shoulder into the stone slowly but surely caused the portal to creep and creak open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room beyond was cast almost entirely in darkness, similarly lit by flickering lanterns like those in the halls you came from . Machines magical, alchemical, and mundane cluttered the chamber, along with bookcases sagging under the weight of dusty and worn tomes. A number of opened coffins were scattered about as well, though fortunately their occupants were still dead and wouldn\u2019t be bothering you. You kept your eyes shifting constantly and your sword at the ready, wary of any threat that might lie in wait, but none were forthcoming. In the center of the room, you finally came across the necromancer that was likely responsible for the undead defense you had encountered. Your new run of good fortune seemed to be paying off again though, as the unfortunate human wasn\u2019t going to be much of a problem with his torso hollowed out. It looked like he might have been attempting a ritual or something judging from what you could make out of the gore spattered books in front of him as well as the alchemical apparatus that had been tipped over and long since emptied of their contents. His skin was dry and leathery looking hinting that it had been quite some time since whatever had happened, and the zombies and skeletons seemed to be just a leftover from when he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few prods with your sword, you turned your back on the disgusting tableau and set about finishing your task. You soon found your objective \u2013 a small worn amulet that had been gifted to the client\u2019s lover more than a decade before, prior to him running off into the mountains and vanishing \u2013 tossed into the bottom or a small chest that looked like the lock had been broken long ago. Tucking the item into a pouch on your belt, you started to make your way towards the exit, but then turned around and went back to the coffer. Reaching in, you pulled out an old and ornate looking ring that had caught your eye before. A layer of grime wiped away easily, revealing a ruby glinting atop the golden band. You weren\u2019t normally one to take loot from every dark and dank location your travels took you, but something about this ring drew you to it, so you slipped it into a pouch as well, thinking that it might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the door, a raspy sound came from behind you; spinning around with your blade raised, you found the room unchanged and nothing coming towards you. Dismissing the sound as just a gust of wind blowing through the forlorn ruins, you pulled the door shut behind you before retracing your route to your entry point, with little except the sound of your boots clacking on the floor to accompany you. The puddle of liquefied zombie ooze had spread and congealed in a vast coating seeping into the rough stonework. Doing your best to avoid the worst of the vileness, you dug your claws between the stones of the wall and leapt off and caught onto the jutting fragments of the floor above and manage to hoist yourself up and out of the tunnels; with that finished, exiting the ruins of the fort was a simple matter, especially since you had more room to make use of your wings above ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your journey back down the mountain, you adopted a more relaxed stance, but still kept your sword in easy reach. Before reaching the town at the base of the mountain, you took a moment to rinse off in a nearby steam, thankful to finally get rid of the noxious ooze that had clung to you the whole way. The extremely cool water splashing across your scales was bracing, more than enough to dispel most of the fatigue you were feeling from the fight and using your flame breath. You arrived in town a few hours before daybreak, and went straight for the local Adventurers Guild location, which in this rather small port only consisted of a room in the back of the main tavern. The little gnome there was a bit perturbed at being awoken at that time of night, but stopped his grousing long enough to express some amazement at someone having completed that job, as well as giving you the pay for completing the task. Leaving him behind, you slipped back out onto the silent streets, and made your way to the barn behind the tavern. Finding a quiet spot in a corner, you pulled your cloak tighter around you, keeping your sword in easy reach just in case, and a dagger in your hand as an extra bit of insurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first light, you were awake and ready to go. Before heading down to the port, you stopped off back inside the tavern and gave the tavern keeper some money to pay for using the barn. The old scarred orc grumbled a bit, but took the money and waved you on anyways. Down at the docks, you bought passage on a ship, even if the captain grumbled about letting someone like you on board. Soon enough, the ship was on its way, cutting through the scant waves with a salty breeze in the sails, heading for the next port and your destination.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The town of Sturd. Not a pretty name, granted, but picturesque nonetheless, sitting as it does upon the confluence of the bonny River Lae and River Trium within the northern strathlands, where the oakwoods begin to meet the pinewoods of the highlands. It hosts a population of around 6,000 souls, not including the hundreds of small bands of trappers and hunters that come with the seasons, and who produce a good chunk of the kingdom's supply of furs and leathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town is governed by Mayor Wulfred Laneig and has been for thirty years, by his father before him. He's a military man, cares more about his counting his guard than his gold, which is what you want this far north, where you start to see the fringes of orc and centaur raiding parties. Definitely not one of those soft mayors you get down in the lowlands. His eldest is Oswyn Laneig... capital educated, well-spoken and a little... fey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Finn. The tannery you work for skins and processes the thousands of animals brought in every week by the trappers and hunters and farmers, from bloody hide into finished leather. It's a huge operation employing dozens of men. Not a glamorous profession by any stretch - smelly, laborious, and long hours - but the pay is good and the townsfolk respect the work you do, if only because it means they don't have to do it themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason it pays so well is because the job is quite dangerous. Not in the way hunting is dangerous with the threat of disembowelment from bears or boars. Not because of disease either, though the work is unsanitary (With tanning you're always working with things half-rotten and doing things to them like pounding them with manure or pickling them in urine, so the risk of disease is quite high.) No, with tanning, the most dangerous aspect by far is the husks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHusks get around and have many names. In some places they're called fleshbags, or skinsuits, or the <i>flayed ones</i>. Scholars call them epidermites. Here in Sturd they're called husks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're a parasite, essentially, a bloodsucker like a full-body leech or a tick. When not attached, they look like the empty skins of animals or humanoids. They hang from trees or lie in undergrowth for their unsuspecting prey - anything with a pulse - to stumble upon them. Some even fill themselves with air and float on the winds. Storms have been known to bring them from as far away as Nagrandia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they sense the hot blood of a host, the empty husk strikes, wrapping around the host and sealing them inside itself. Immediately it begins to exude a chemical that liquifies the host's own skin, which it consumes while integrating itself into their body. The host's blood becomes its blood. Its pain become the host's pain. Within just a few hours, host and husk are one, the animal trapped within its own parasitic skin, inseparable until death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after death? Husks are endemic in the wild. When a hunter kills a deer, there's a good chance the carcass has a husk, and they don't often die with their host. They lie in wait until the hunter comes along and sticks his knife in them, then they leap from carcass to hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why catches are brought to the tannery to be skinned before being sent off for butchering. The hunters know not to risk their own skin. Because once a husk gets you, that's it, you can wave goodbye to your humanity. You're going to be spending the rest of your life inside the skin of a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdentifying which carcasses are infested takes a keen eye. There are certain signs. If the meat is putrid but the skin is fresh, that's clearly a husk. If the meat and the skin don't match, it's a husk, though that isn't reliable. An animal with the hide of a doe fawn but the muscular bulk of a male boar is undoubtedly husked, and even hunters know not to hunt those. But the husks are crafty and will slowly remodel the body of the host to match their own design as the parasite drains the muscle and flesh, reshapes bone, until what once was a proud rutting boar is now unmistakable from an infant doe. Even adult deer have been seen to adopt them as their own, so complete is the change. Only the behaviour of the poor trapped creature gives away its true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor tanners, husks are an occupational hazard to be lived with. Though you and your lads identify most of them, sooner or later they will get you, it's just a matter of time. About a third of the team are husked, mostly the older lads who've been in the job twenty-thirty years, although poor Janik got husked in his first week. They accept it, and they adapt to it, and they move on. Alas, so too do their wives, quite often. The townsfolk treat the husked tanners with respect and pity; the same dispensation isn't always afforded their families, and very few women are willing to deal with the public shame of sharing their bed with an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be worse. Most people taken by husks are treated the same as natural-born beastmen - collared and chained faster than you can say \"free slave labour\". Thanks to the Guild of Tanners, that doesn't happen. As long as you pay your guild fees, you're to be afforded all the rights of a full, human citizen even if the worst happens. Anybody attempting to put a collar about the neck of a card-carrying member can expect to have the Guild come down upon their heads like the proverbial tonne of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat isn't to say people treat them the same, mind you. Even the owner of the tannery fell to it three months ago while arguing over a delivery of skins from a dairy farm. Your boss, Oskar, went from an imposing man of late-middle age to a productive young milk cow when one of the \"skins\" slithered off the back of the wagon and swallowed him up. Working udders and everything. He makes a show of being the fearsome man he once was but... the lads aren't afraid of him anymore. They snigger when he birches them, and make jokes behind his back - the young, un-husked ones do at least. It isn't right. It makes you angry. The husks will come for them too eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou as well no doubt. You're thirty two, you've been in this business nearly twenty years, and you still have your own skin. Sooner or later your luck will run out, but you pray to the goddess each morning that it doesn't run out today. Not for your sake, for the sake of your wife and children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for prayer this morning. You awoke late. You hurry through the early morning streets of Sturd. The sunrise glows pinkish-red through the mist rolling down the valley side. In one hand swings your lunchbox, packed by your wonderful wife, Corinna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar stench greets your nose as you enter the tannery compound, walking past the steaming pools where the skins are processed. You pull on the heavy, stained leather apron and begin your shift.</span></div></div>",

He greets you with a warm smile. Nobody has ever explained what the proper title and greeting for a mayor's son is, so you give him a brisk nod and a \"sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spreads his arms, gesturing proudly to the catch laid out before him. A heavily pregnant sow lashed by the legs to a pole, and half a dozen rabbits. \"Looks like you're going to be busy today, Finn,\" he says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men behind him mutter quietly and roll their eyes. You know them all - they're the best hunters the town has to offer, honoured to hunt with the Mayor's boy, yet this catch represents a pitiful fraction of their normal takings. The problem is that the animals are able to see, hear and smell Oswyn coming from a mile away upwind, and you suspect that none of the men have the balls to tell the mayor's son to ditch the rainbow-coloured trousers, the perfume, and the endless chattering. Oswyn is a sensitive soul, a flower that wilts all too easily in the face of criticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble for something positive to say. \"A lot of skin on the sow, sir. And I dare say the piglets will have some too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I said,\" Oswyn beams. \"A pregnant beast must count for triple, surely. That one was mine of course.\" He raises and fires an imaginary bow - even now you can see his technique is all wrong. \"Pew. Shot it right in the heart. Perhaps I ought to get a portrait taken of this fine occasion...\" he grins, raising his boot onto the swollen stomach as if in a victory pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, sir, I haven't checked it yet!\" Your eyes widen as you see the pig flesh crawl. You move faster than you thought possible, dragging the mayor's boy to the ground just as the husk strips away from the flesh in a floppy, liquid blob and hurls itself at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters are good. They have their bows in their hands and arrows in the air faster than you can blink. The arrows pierce the husk and out the other side, barely slowing it. It latches onto the nearest hunter's hand and coils up around his arm and chest underneath his clothes. His screams turn to squeals as the pink flesh swallows up his head, sealing his human face within a porcine snout. The husk gives a ripple. A trickle of steaming green liquid comes from one of the nostrils. \"Get it off me! It's burning my skin! Get it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb off Oswyn and grab the man under the armpits as he collapses in pain. \"Somebody help me carry him,\" you bellow. The other hunters grab the legs and together you race him across the tannery to the flayman's hut. You kick open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the air is choked with woodsmoke. The blackened walls are lit only by the light from several braziers. Several dozen empty skinsuits hang from hooks, twitching slightly in the whorls of smoke. The flayman is the man charged with the processing and treating of the husks that get brought it, turning them into usable products. In here they are smoked for weeks until their predatory intelligence is killed off and they are made docile, able to be donned and removed at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smoke will slow down the creature,\" you tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flayman is there in a moment. \"How long has it been attached?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs the husk by the snout and heaves. The trapped hunter screams and struggles as though it is his own skin being pulled away, and strikes the flayman so hard it knocks him back. The other hunters pin the man's arms. The flayman tries again, and this time he manages to get some leverage. The pig face slowly, agonizingly peels back. He draws a knife and hacks it away, peels another segment, hacks it away. The human skin underneath is red raw and blistered. The flayman covers the exposed parts in a white power designed to counter the corosive green goo. The lumps of husk wriggle on the floor like worms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flayman knows it is a race against time - one which he ultimately loses. He succeeds in removing the skin only as far as the stomach. In the time it takes to strip the man's leather armour, the husk has joined fully with the host. As he tries to tear away the skin below the navel, human blood begins to flow. He shakes his head. \"I've done all I can. He needs a physician now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hunters carry the man away. \"Is he going to be alright?\" Oswyn asks tremulously, staring at the curly pink tail protruding from above his buttocks, which bounces with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be half the man he was before,\" you say honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would have been me if you hadn't pulled me out of the way. Thank you, Finn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing my job, sir,\" you say. \"We deal with them every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evidently,\" says Oswyn, staring at the racks of smoked husks in amazement. There are ones of all types - deer, wolves, sheep, even small squirrel skins and the occasional bird. The flayman cleans his blade, takes a broom and sets about sweeping up the scraps of husk and dump them in a deep barrel of water. The husk with decompose and break apart over many months, until it forms a sort of liquid flesh paste that can be spread on to wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step out into the fresh air, the mayor's boy turns to you.</span></div></div>",

He clearly cared for his soon-to-be-subjects. With unusual tact, not wishing to offend his delicate nerves, you say, \"If I might give you an honest word, sir, and I mean no disrespect to anybody, the reason you don't improve is cause the men set to train you won't tell you what you're doing wrong.\" You gesture to the violet-coloured cap in his hands and burgundy jacket. \"Wearing things like that - as nice as they are, sir - the animals can see you a mile off. They're too bright. The hunters aughta told you to wear browns and greens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One might be excused for thinking so,\" he says a little primly, bristling. \"But it is a truth not widely known that animals are completely colour blind. It makes no difference what colour clothes I wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your stubble. \"Maybe so, sir. I don't have the same education as you. But I do work with a few animals, and they say they see colours just fine. T'other thing is the perfume...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswyn splutters. \"But it's floral! It masks my scent with the smell of flowers! Surely that can't be a bad thing. Wh-what else would you have me use?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deer piss works good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some deer piss, rub it under your armpits, around your crotch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor's boy turns pale. \"You can not be serious. There must be some alternative...\" Then his eyes move past you into the smokey darkness of the flayman's lodge. \"What about those?\" he says. He moves back into the lodge, gingerly lifting the arms of one of the neutered husks. He sniffs the fur. \"These could mask my scent, allow me to get close to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock an eyebrow. \"Most hunters don't use 'em,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"A good husk fetches a pretty penny in the capital, most hunters don't make that sort of gold.\" Oswyn scoffs at the mention of price, reminding you who you're talking to. \"And I guess then there's the risk that one of your buddies might mistake you for a game animal and put an arrow through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll go out alone,\" Oswyn beams, the excitement building in his voice. \"Just you and me. I'll walk right up to the animals and shoot an arrow through their necks, and when we return with our trophies the town will marvel at my prowess.

She then puts her other hand down your soaked pants, finds your testicles, grabs them and squeezes them so tight, they almost feel like they are going to pop. She then strokes your penis, until it is fully erect and examines its length. \"This one is hardly a man, too weak and too small. Defiantly not worth mating\", she observes as she drops you on the ground hurting you both physically and mentally. \"Tabatha!\", the huntress calls in a commanding voice and another Amazonian steps out carrying a staff, she is much smaller than the others, only standing at 7 feet, she is also fully robed so you can't see her face. She is also wearing a necklace full of totems and has a few small books and potions tied around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Grand Huntress?\", Tabatha says in an old frail voice as so approaches the woman who just violated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare this one immediately\", she commands and then looks back over to you cowering in fear. \"You, there!\", she points to a young Amazonian woman with brown hair that is longer than you, she just stands at attention waiting for orders. \"Carry the prisoner back to camp and keep an eye on him while Tabatha prepares him\", the leader commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Grand Huntress\", is all she responds as she walks over to you, picking you up under the arms and walks with Tabatha back to camp. You don't even struggle as you are too tired and scared as she takes you into the tree line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of you, we march to Monzta!\", you hear the Grand Huntress command once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later you arrive at a rather large camp and placed behind the second largest tent, the Amazonian carrying you throws you at the ground. She takes off your clothes and armor placing it in a pile, leaving you completely naked. She then grabs some rope and ties your arms behind your back and pushes you to the ground. It hurts as your testicles land on a few small rocks and your ass lands on a stick. The Amazonian ignores your pain as she drags your bare ass along the ground and ties you to a post, giving you no room to stand then she binds ankles and gags your mouth. Your testicles and ass sting so much and you look in front of you to see a small trail of blood. The Amazonian woman the leaves you naked, bound and bloodied to attended to Tabatha's needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare a fire in front of our guest, I want him to see this\", Tabatha commands the young hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare a fire near our guest\", you hear Tabatha command from the tent behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later the young woman starts to prepare a spit not far from where you are sitting and lights it up. Before leaving your view once again, though you feel her presence behind you. You then hear some slower foot steps approach you and can only assume it is Tabatha, she places a two wooden bowls two cups and a mortar and pestle and some interesting looking tools in front of you. One bowl has a weird pink paste, the other has water. The first thing she does is grind a small amount of herbs with the mortar and pestle, scoops some water out of the bowl with a cup and places the herbs in the cup. The other Amazonian the pulls down the gag in your mouth, pulls your head backwards and opens your mouth, allowing Tabatha to pour the drugged water down your throat. Instantly your body goes numb, an experience you are grateful for as your pain subsides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Tabatha grabs an oddly shaped clamp, with Jagged teeth and puts it over the fire until the metal glows orange. She then grabs a paddle and scoops some of the pink paste onto it and holds it out. The other Amazonian then walks in front of you, unbinds your ankles and spreads your legs wide open fully exposing your genitals. The young Amazon, then grabs the clamp of the fire and walks towards you. You would scream if you could for the next part, but the herbs have completely paralyzed you. She brings the clamp to your genitals and squeezes removing them with one chomp, she then releases the clamp over the bowl of water dropping your genitals inside the cold water. as Tabatha spreads to pink paste over your open wound instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is customary of our tribe that the male eats their former manhood before embracing womanhood\", Tabatha informs you as she spreads more of the past over your chest and into your hair. Meanwhile the young Amazonian picks up your penis and testicles and skewers them before roasting them over the fire. Your former manhood shrivels and darkens before she takes them off and walks over to you. She then forces open your mouth, sticks a little bit of your penis in and slams it shut again severing it's tip. It takes a while before they make you eat the whole thing and you feel like you can't take anymore. Next Tabatha pours a small pink vile into the other cup and forces you to drink it. You then pass out as she starts to enchant some words in an old unknown language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you next awake, you are still quite numb, and although you can feel the cold night breeze, you can't feel any pain. The first thing you notice is that you are now bound and gagged once again, the second thing you notice it the hair coming over your eyes. Trying to move you spot some other changes, like that your skin is now smooth and hairless and there are two small lumps forming on your chest where the paste was, you also try to look down into your crotch but are not able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer focused on your self you now notice the moans and groans of men and women sounding through the air before loosing conscience again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake in the morning you are no longer tied to a post, but are unbound, in a caged cart cover over by cloth. The first thing you notice is that you are now surrounded by many beautiful, naked, sleeping women. Then you notice your own body. The lumps that were forming last night are now fully formed breasts and large ones at that, your hair is now blond and goes down to your nipples. Your skin is soft, smooth and pale. Instantly you reach for your groin and find, not a burn scare but a fully formed and fully functional vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream at the top of your lungs, waking up all the other passengers, who then start examining their own bodies and scream as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\", a young woman, with long black hair says. \"Calm down, we have to be reasonable in a situation like this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reasonable! We were dragged off by Amazonians, forced to eat our manhood and now we wake up as women, naked in a cage!\", a brunette responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\", a new comer says. \"During my duty as a knight I heard about this.... we're now merchandise of the Amazonian Slave Trade\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\", you ask finally gaining the courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we're going to be sold off for sex and who knows what else!\", she yells back, bring back all the screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough a little while later you are dragged off onto a stage, still completely naked and one by one auctioned off, you end up being.....</span></div></div>",

He limps over the broken sods of earth, grunting as he strains his tired old back to pick up the discarded tool. \"You ought to be more careful with the tools, Jack. If it were to break...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets it hang, his tone gentle but the meaning clear and grim. If the hoe broke, we would not have the money to buy another. The field would go unworked, less you were able to break open the hard ground with your bare hands, and both of you would starve. You hang your head in shame. \"Sorry, father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the rest of the tilling for me,\" he says kindly, as you know how worn and twisted his back his become from a life of toil. \"I've an errand I need you to run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me the herb that grows in the garden of the old hag. The one who lives by the river,\" your father's voice comes out raspy yet you can feel kindness in it. It seems that the years that have gone by have not relented their assault on your poor man, as his crooked back could barely support him while walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herb...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, specifically the Cecillia herb to---\" Your old man keels over suddenly, falling on the bare, cold ground, coughing violently, with short spasms in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FATHER!!\" You rush over to him, helping him up to his knees while he coughs up blood and bile onto your old rags. It seems that the plague that went around the outskirts of the Empire was still affecting your father greatly, no doubt due to his weakening constitution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now... my boy... it's nothing a bit of Cecillia will fix... I will tend to... the fields,\" your father says as he slowly picks the hoe back up, limping away from you. He had never wanted to rely on your help, and you're not sure why. It pains you to see him like this. Could this be the pride of a father...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, no!\" You scream back as you are shaken out of your thoughts by a large clunk, indicating that your father has started to till the fields. \"Please get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest will not put food on the table, young one,\" he kindly, yet firmly replies. You understand that it's his steadfast character acting up again. Not even a gnarling troll rushing at him would cause him to budge. You shake your head. Why can't he just get some rest? He won't even be able to do much work during your half-day trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine,\" you reply briefly. If anything, you will ease his pain by making the journey even quicker, lest he breaks his old bones by ruffling the the hard ground. The last thing you want to do is to grieve in front of a hastily buried body tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip takes a while but is quite uneventful. You have traveled this path many times with your father, encountering squirrels, sparrows, frogs, and even pixies at time. You smile as you reminisce about a time when you have went here as a kid and pointed out a pixie to your father, calling it a fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh the foolish young boy you were back then, not knowing that fairies live exclusively near elves, while pixies near humans. It took your father all of his willpower to not smack you when you were almost sprayed from head to toe in pixie dust, just barely dodging a tragic fate thanks to your father's quick arm. He was quite springy back in the day, not the ragged old man he is right now. And now it is your turn to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the river, you can feel a knot forming in your stomach. The old hag was never to your liking, always constantly gazing at you with her gray, dull eyes, as she gave a nearly toothless grin, save for one or two left. Something about that gaze has always perturbed you, but fortunately your father was a skilled negotiator, and would always finish his bargains quickly. You have wondered before what life would be like if your father had become a merchant. But he respected his father too much to go for a different trade than his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the garden, the beads of sweat rolling down your forehead instantly alert you to the old crone's presence. At first, you don't spot her, but then you notice her sitting on the doorstep of her hut, with stern eyes glistening in the sunlight. Eyes that you have never seen before. You wince as you approach her, not sure how to initiate the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there... boy! Heh heh heh...!!!\" She cackles as she looks directly at you, her piercing voice seemingly shaking your entire soul. \"Now why did you come here I wonder...? And all alone too! Where is your father, Sir Pretty Face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not the first time your face is brought up in a conversation and will certainly not be the last. For some reason, it seems as if your transition to adulthood is a little bit... delayed. Your eyelashes are just a bit long, your cheeks are a bit rosy, and your chin is devoid of any hair. Certainly, you have no resemblance to people of the fairer sex, but to say that you are a real man is a little bit... far fetched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honored elder,\" you bow as you decide to at least show her some respect. After all, you have come here for a favor and it is up to her whether she would grant it. You notice, from the corner of your eye, that her crooked fingers have begun to twirl in front of her face, pleased with something. You decide that your efforts must not have been in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to collect a herb called Cecillia for my honored father. As you know, it can only be collected here and after the plague...\" Your voice wonders off as you think of your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't speak more, boy. Indeed, the herb can heal the deadly disease that has swept through this region a year ago. Yet you should know that the herb is rare and it is exceedingly hard to grow. Nobles from all around the nation visit this humble garden, offering lavish gifts and royal services for this prized possession. What use is there giving it to a boy like you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... The... I will... give you a part of--\" You begin, but your voice cuts off as if though it is a puppet that had its strings cut. If you had actually worked on the fields, toiling day in and day out, instead of wandering in your dreams and tossing various tools onto the ground, perhaps you could have actually offered a part of your harvest. But as it stands, your father and you -- your mother has already been deceased for several years -- would barely have enough to scrape by through the winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I be such a fool...? Because of me... I... my father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs crumple to the ground as if though made entirely out of flax. Tears stream down your face, wetting your lips as they pass by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...!!! Is there anything I could do?! I would be willing to do anything!!!\" Your voice chokes as you beg the elderly lady. Your mind wanders to your father. To your kind, loving, and caring father. How could all of this happen...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy...\" You hear the old woman's voice resound nearby, as if though it is a soft melody. Perplexed by this sudden change of tone, you look upwards, gazing at her face. Her eyes and expression now look incredibly gentle, to the point where you almost think that a completely separate person has wandered in by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, are you sure you have come alone?\" She inquires softly, as her eyes wander around the area, seemingly looking for intruders. You don't say anything, simply nodding in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose then...\" She begins, and a sudden flash occurs, blinding your eyes for a few moments until your eyelids cover them completely. When they open, you check the ground to make sure that your jaw hasn't touched it yet. Standing in front of you is a beauty of unimaginable proportions. Her plump lips, her deep blue eyes, her fair skin , her long red hair, her narrow waist, her wide and child-bearing hips, her long legs, and her sizeable breasts all screamed 'You would die for sex with her' to you. Yet she does not look like a typical wanton slut that you can easily find wandering around at the market, this woman simply radiated beauty, and it would not be a far call to call her the 'fairest of the land'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ho! I suppose you have never seen a witch before, <i>boy</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... What.. But...\" You try to utter something meaningful, but only a gurgle of unintelligible words come out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost for words, I see. Do not worry, I will wait for you to collect the shattered pieces of your semblance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you going to eat me? Boil me in stew? Imprison me in a dungeon and and torture me? Drain me of all my life force through sex?\" You spout, terrified of her, though your last idea does give you a little warmth. If you have to die, you might as well die in the burning flames of passion. The witch seems to see through you, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! What are you saying? I do not even like men. Though with such a pretty face like yourself...\" She trails off as she begins to mumble something to herself. All you could catch is 'potential', 'can be fixed', 'rearrange a little', and 'as a girl', which seems like nonsense to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! If you want the Cecillia herb, I suppose...\"</span></div></div>",

She turns and hobbles away up the garden path towards her cottage, barking back over her shoulder, \"Well, boy, do you accept my offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say honestly, \"I have other duties on the farm during the day. But I will work every evening, and I promise to put in a full day's work during that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah! Promises, promises...\" the hag grumbles under breath. \"You are lucky you're pretty, offering a deal like that. I accept. Twelve months a slave, then you shall claim your prize, assuming you live that long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you follow her into the cottage, you are shocked to discover the inside to be far vaster than the outside would suggest. Even more shocking, the place is a complete tip. Teetering piles of filthy cutlery, plates, pots and pans rise to the cavernous like trees swaying in the breeze.The witch seats herself on a mound of dirty laundry, waving her hand at the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set to the labour without another word. The basin is dry, so you search around for a bucket. Unable to find one in the mess, you take a iron pot, fill it at the river and carry it back. It takes several trips but you fill the basin and start scrubbing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours pass slowly and as darkness falls and you are dismissed, you find you've barely made a dent in the workload. You trudge home, thoroughly exhausted and somewhat demoralised. Far worse is the look of disappointment on your father's face when you return empty handed. He sucks air through his teeth as you explain the arrangement to him. \"A deal with a witch is a dangerous thing, but not as dangerous as breaking it,\" he says grimly. He sighs and shakes his head. \"What's done is done... Thank you for this, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over, he sees that you're already asleep.<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\nThe next day is more of the same. Work the farm from dawn til evening, walk the long trial to the witches hut, work until dark, then walk home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the day after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the day after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks go by in an exhausted fugue of toil. Sweeping the floor, tending the garden, mending the fence, thatching the roof, carrying water from river to the witches' chambers. Your limbs ache. You just want to sleep. If only there was a way of making things easier.</span></div></div>",

Allies to beasts, elementals and ancestral spirits, these protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts and the power to call upon elemental might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Royal Colleges of Magic are institutions of arcane knowledge tasked with the training and deployment of all gifted humans.

These spellcasters thrive in the polytheistic country as long as they provide their findings to the ruler.Yet not all of these magic users are the same. The spirits they channel can only be accessed by each type of spellcaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Druids</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese spellcasters worship the spirits of nature. These spirits allow druids to talk to plants and animals. Unlike other spellcasters, Druids are very muscular and are formidable opponents in hand-to-hand combat. Upon learning to shapeshift druids are tasked to capture their first familiar. Ironically, druids are known to mistake Jade Wizards for actual wild animals. Whenever this happens their capture spell fails. Whenever a druid captures a familiar the familiar gains a blue aura that only druids can see. Druids are known to copy the traits and personalities of their familiars when in the heat of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Toll:</b> As druids age they become feral or they begin developing anthropomorphic traits. If a druid develops anthropomorphic traits they are forbidden to leave their homes without an escort, unless they get captured by a bounty hunter or infect someone to become an anthropomorphic beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elementalists</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese spellcasters can control either fire, water, air, or earth spirits. Unlike druids, they can't talk to plants or animals. Whenever an elementalist is born they are blessed with the ability to learn one element. Those that master all four elements are seen every 500 years. These individuals are regarded as the Ones blessed by the elements and are often asked by other people for sagely advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Toll:</b> As an elementalist masters their craft their bodies slowly begin to resemble the element that they are using. On top of that they tend to develop some form of insanity. Fire Elementalists often become pyromaniacs and take delight in burning all that they see. Water elementalists become obsessed with drowning people. Earth elementalists become obsessed with creating earthquakes. Lastly, Air elementalists enjoy killing people with tornadoes. When ever an elementalist loses their sanity mercy killing is the only way to end their suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shamans</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamans communicate with the dead in order to gain wisdom. Many shamans use the spirits to predict the future. This ability has lead many to also call them mediums. In the kingdom of Erolus shamans act as advisers to the monarchs in charge. In return, shamans are free to practice their craft as long as they have at least one acolyte before they move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Toll:</b> As a shaman ages they begin to lose their physical presence. As they lose this presence they gain a shadowy appearance. To slow down their toll a shaman will bind some of his or her energy to a place or item.

Braziers have been lit on every street corner. Taverns resound with festive cheer. The abattoirs run with rivers of boar blood for the heitstrenging. The tradition of the Yule Log Run is held each night in Old Town, where crowds gather to cheer as athletes race against flaming logs set tumbling down the steep, narrow streets, twisting ankles and necks in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the hardworking men and women of the Crimson Order, Yulefest is mere background noise against which their work continues unabated. For as the motto of their college goes, 'Non est pax impiis'. No peace for the wicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA background noise that is often unwelcome. The sound of drunken carol singing rises from the snowy streets far below to your attic study as revelers stagger home. \"Humbug,\" you grumble, throwing closed the shutters on the window against the unbearably cheerful noise. You slink back to your desk, moving with the slow, stooped gait of a old man upon a body that looks no older than thirty years. You are Silas Zeno. You are a Crimson Order wizard. In appearance, you are of the dark-and-handsome variety, though your features have become somewhat twisted from a century of cruel sneers and your beard is long and unkempt, your robes and faded ragged with age. When angered, your eyes flicker with flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embers flicker out as you sink back into your desk chair, leaving your eyes tired and red. You are burning the midnight oil tonight, shuffling through the stacks of paperwork that fill the sparse room - notes delivered from informants and other Crimson wizards, tax returns, books of genealogy, purloined letters sent between lovers and conspirators, and a thousand other scraps of information. Straightening the spectacles on your crooked nose, you lift the guest list of the queen's famous yule ball into the candlelight, muttering to yourself. \"Countessa of Orrinshire, absent from the ball... short notice... Duke of Goulcrest, also declines to attend... The Duke's entourage are dismissed for the evening. Shortly after, bottles of Orrinshire wine are sent for and delivered to his household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise and carry the candle across to one wall. Upon it have been pinned a hundred or so sheets of parchment, a collage of all VIPs currently within your area of the city. Each person has a sheet of parchment pinned to the wall, with a small portrait and a list of any pertinent information - their holdings, wealth or any powerful items in their possession; family, including all known bastards; allegiances; criminal activities; sexual habits and fetishes; and so on. Anybody who is anybody is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCross-referencing the Duke's taste in women with the Countessa's portrait looks promising. You dip your quill. \"Observe for infidelities,\" you scribble in red ink upon both of their sheets, unpinning and repinning their sheets side by side. Balls of coloured yarn sits nearby. You pick up the pink yarn, knot the end around the Duke's thumb-tack and tie the thread around the Countessa's. The wall is a network of rainbow-coloured yarns. Pink for sexual or romantic relationships, green for debts, black for vendettas, and so on. It is your job to track them, and to know which string to pull to get the desired results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from saving the world from demonic incursion, this is the one of the most important duties assigned to the Crimson Order, particularly in times of peace. Selecting, studying, and \"collecting\" people, bringing them under your control for that one day when they can be called upon to aid the institution in its goals, whatever and whenever they might be. Suppose a lord needs to be made to vote a particular way, or to make a donation of gold or men to the order's warchest, or simply abdicate to an heir who will. In that situation, leverage is required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeverage can be anything. Bribes work. They often spiral out of control however, and any self-respecting Crimson would be loath to go begging to the Golds for cash. Threats of violence have a tendency to backfire. Seduction is very good. Blackmail is best. Everybody has their dirty little secrets - the nobility most of all. Find out what they are (or engineer some yourself) and you have them by the balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeduction <i>and</i> blackmail, now that was your favourite. You often work alongside brothels, using the whores to draw the rich and powerful into extramarital of (ideally) illegal trysts, which you record. Right now, your study is situated within the attic of the high-class brothel known as the Sweet Sanctum, which sits within the Old Town district and services many well-to-do locals, visiting nobles and foreign diplomats. As well as the whores, a team of informants -mostly street urchins- work under you to gather information on everything happening in your district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploiting the worst of human nature for the betterment of mankind is a Crimson wizards duty, and manipulation is a job you excel at. Not all enjoy it. Even you didn't at first, but it doesn't take long before the Crimson order toll begins its slow, insidious effect upon the mind, tainting it by some aspect of those unnatural, extra-dimensional predators that watch the souls of this plane with hungry eyes. After that, the job becomes a hoot. You have devoted your life to it - weaving your webs, spreading your influence until whole noble houses dance to your tune. There is endless pleasure to be derived prying into dark, private crevices of your targets, often in a very literal manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou light your pipe and flick through more correspondence as the smoke shrouds you. Patrician Benikor is a week late paying his taxes, despite claiming to be rich as hell. Bankrupt perhaps? You note to examine his finances further. There has been another \"accident\" in Sir Castwell's household - the third maid in two months to take a \"stumble\" on the stairs. The man is a brute worthy of investigation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the night progresses, there comes the tap-tap of heels upon the stairs. The door swings open and one of the whores leans in, breasts spilling from her gown. You have worked with her before, a woman named Sarya. Like many of the women who work at Sweet Sanctum, she is half-elven, her silver hair plaited and pulled back to expose the slender ears that the clientele love so much. Only exceptionally talented human whores make it into Sweet Sanctum. The clientele desire for rarity more than they do quality, paying for exotic delicacies that stretched the boundaries of feasibility and legality. Just last week a hashaan diplomat had swanned in and demanded with perfect sincerity to bed the Goddess herself. The brothel madam had plied him with drink and a beautiful aasimar girl, and swindled him out of a small fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Customer for you, ma'am,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bristle. \"Do not refer to me as ma'am when I am not in dress,\" you say sharply. \"Nor do I have \"customers\". What I have are targets, or marks. Do not mistake me for a common whore such as yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy mistake to make,\" she smirks with a shrug, slipping a little more from her loose dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tone, whore,\" you bark, flames flickering in eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts teasingly. \"So I guess you aint interested in this guy then. 'Cause I'll take him off your hands if you don't. Got a wallet out to here.\" She sighs theatrically. \"Guess I'll just tell General Volkov of the Ordanian military that our top girl aint free tonight then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>General Volkov!</i> You jump up from your chair so fast it tumbles over. \"Volkov is here?! Now?! Downstairs?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him and half his army,\" she grins. \"Haven't even got through the lieutenants yet and my jaw's already sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large chest sits in the corner of the room, the only other item of furniture besides the desk and bed. Your hands are shaking as you unlock it and throw open the lid. Inside are your most prized possessions, your collection of husks. Fourteen empty skins, each unique, exotic, gathered together over decades. They are neatly folded into two piles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you made him comfortable? Does he have wine? What mood is he in? Has he been serviced yet?\" You glance between the two piles. \"Men or women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \"He didn't say. He just asked for the book so we sat him down in the red room. Nobody's gone near him yet. He's all ready and waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne does not keep a general waiting long. You doff your robes, feeling no shame as you stand naked before her. After all, you've seen each other naked before, having shared clients on occasion. As you remove your spectacles, the world becomes fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin you lift from the chest is a tiefling maiden with curly black hair and creamy white skin. The empty face is folded facing upwards, sharp little horns topped with corks to save them from damaging the other precious skins, the bundle tied up with a slim black tail. You let the skinsuit hang, teasing open the mouth wide enough to slip your bare legs inside. You wriggle yourself down into it as fast as you dare without tearing it. The velvety, warm, elastic interior tightens and seals itself against your skin. Your look down to see the ugly bulge of your crotch melting away into a female mound, your ass swelling, hips widening. As you work the suit up over your chest, the weight of the breasts hangs on you. Your beard you have to tuck inside the head of the suit. Finally you pull the face over yours, holding it in place until it suckers on like a hungry limpet, sealing you within the tiefling maiden form. You test for articulation, flicking your muscular tail side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarya smiles. She knows this body well, both inside and out. She has even named it, as she does many of your husk-forms. \"Oh, Chastity, it's good to see you again,\" she giggles, pulling you into a hug, her soft tits pressing against your own. \"Why can't you be you more often. You're so much nicer than that mean old wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new form responds to her proximity, a strange buzz building within you as her lustfulness quickens your tiefling blood. You can almost taste the wanton thoughts inside her mind. You push her away before it has a chance to <i>really</i> affect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ready Volkov for me. Tell him I shall be down shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select a low-cut purple dress to wear and apply makeup and perfume generously. Then, bracing yourself, you step out of the sanctuary of your study, descending into the brothel proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ragea.net/rpgimg/index.php?q=image/1160.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ragea.net/rpgimg/index.php?q=imag...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarya wasn't exaggerating. There are Ordanian military officers everywhere, many still in uniform, medals pinned to their chests as they queue for rooms or are even serviced out in the corridors. Goblin girls hurry back and forth with pitchers of wine in their hands and bundles paper money stuffed between their breasts. The eyes of the men follow you as you descend to the Red Room, sweaty hands grabbing for your tail. You merely giggle and pull it away, batting your eyelashes as though flattered by the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip discreetly into the Red Room, closing the door quietly behind you. A four-poster bed draped in red velvet sits in the center, on which General Volkov reclines, naked. A book lies open beside him. His thick, hairy arms have hold of Sarya by the ears as her head bobs up and down in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine him as you creep closer. His face is scarred, misshapen, and ugly - the man has seen a great deal of combat. There is a gold band on his finger - the man is married. That's good. People often liken the Ordanians to bears, and Volkov is no exception. His expression is ferocious, his muscular, barrel-like chest covered in thick, black hair. The manhood between his legs, upon which Sarya is sucking, is of a magnitude that makes your knees go weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The things I do for my country.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a demure cough, you announce your presence, and his dark eyes turn to you as you lift the dress and sink into  a curtsy, making sure to flash him both cleavage and what lies beneath your skirts. He licks his lips, sizing you up. He barely even notices as Sarya removes her mouth from around his cock and takes her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce alone, you seat yourself in his lap, feeling the throb of his meat against you. You wriggle closer, coiling your serpentine about the base of his shaft. Though he is evidently pleased to see him, his expression remains like a stormcloud. You lean back and twist to kiss his lips. \"A thousand apologies for keeping you waiting, master, but I am here now.\" You stroke your fingers through the fur-like hair of his chest. \"So... have you decided? What would you have of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunts something in a foreign tongue and jabs a finger at the tome that lies open on the bed beside him. It is the Book of Mortal Delights. It is a book that you had made yourself, years ago, and it has been an invaluable tool throughout your job as a seducer and blackmailer. It is a catalogue of services, each of its three hundred pages depicting a single act painted in exquisite detail. It begins innocuously enough with 'cuddling' and quickly escalates from there through oral, vaginal and anal until by the middle third of the book things start to become... unusual, acts that (while not necessarily illegal) could easily tarnish a man's reputation if made public. Using a whore is one thing, but using it for <i>that</i> is much worse. By the latter third of the book, the acts depicted have progressed to a level of depravity generally sufficient to be illegal in most places, while those in the final few pages are an affront to the gods themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trick is to get your target to choose from as far into the book as possible; it makes blackmailing them later far easier. You see that the page he is pointing to is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The book is opened less than half-way. A pity. To blackmail somebody as powerful and untouchable as a foreign military leader, it really needed to be something from the later section, something truly dispicable. \"A little tame, my lord. Perhaps you wish for something a little more...challenging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out to flip the page forward. His hand closes around your slender wrist. \"Don't tell me what to do, bitch.\" He jabs the book again. \"I want that. Bring it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man who knows what he wants,\" you croon. \"Your wish is my command. I shall have it washed and brought to you at once.\" You take the book and hop down from his lap. The hand closes painfully tight around your tail. \"Yes, m'lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing. Is it...tame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no Orc can be said to be truly tame, my lord,\" you smile sweetly, as you retrieve your tail from his grasp and scurry from the room. Once back in your study, you open the chest and lift out a skin of bright green, muscular flesh. An Orc. A very male Orc. The General had requested what was sometimes known as an Orc Handshake. While certainly unusual, as far as you know it isn't exactly illegal in Ordania. A pity. Still, satisfied customers tend to return for more, often demanding ever more outlandish things. Perhaps you will get lucky next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't bother to remove the tiefling skin, simply pulling the Orc skin over the top of it. It is massive, the empty skin weighing almost as much as you do whole. The green flesh quickly seals itself to your skin and you flex your swollen musculature, feeling strong enough to punch through a wall. Your hand reaches down to cup the monstrous member that hangs like a third leg. You hope the sight of it doesn't discourage Volkov. For decorum's sake, you hang a loincloth over it. It is like hiding a dragon under a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ordanian solders clear a path as you stomp back to the Red Room. Volkov rises warily as you stoop to enter the doorway. The colour drains from his face as you pull aside the loincloth. His arousal however, appears undiminished, as he sinks to his knees at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven using two hands and his mouth, the Orcish cock is too much for Volkov to effectively handle, but it doesn't take long before it begins to swell with green blood. As it rises into the air, several feet in length, he gives a short nod of readiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his credit, he takes it on the chin like a man, not flinching once as you grab your monstrous member and bludgeon him about the head with it. The second blow staggers him. The third knocks him to his hands and knees, grunting in pleasure, but rises again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy is made of stern stuff. For half an hour, this unique sparring session continues, as you methodically pummel every inch of his body into bloody, bruised submission. As you rain the final blow, the General crumples back onto the bed, blood pouring from a broad, satisfied grin on his scarred face. Thankfully he is still breathing. With a resigned sigh, you complete your end of the bargain, blowing your green Orcish load all over his unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Some people and their fetishes,</i> you shake your head in bewilderment. Well if people were normal, your job would be all that much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lumber across the room and pull back a false panel on one of the wall. Behind it is a small cavity in the wall containing a clockwork device of glass and brass. You lift it out as gingerly as you can with your hands. It is a thaumascope, one of the most useful inventions to come out of the workshops of the Tyrian artificers of old. With a combination of magic and machinery, it can record and replay moving images onto crystals. You are relieved to see that Sarya remembered to wind it up this time. </span></div></div>",

After that, they, their king, and his new wife will be leaving for their homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week is plenty of time for Volkov to pay a second visit. Judging by the broad grin on his sleeping face, he is satisfied by the service. Perhaps next time he will be more adventurous. Until then, you conceal the recording device in your massive palm and move for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clumsy feet snag on the General's uniform strewn across the floor. A small scroll tumbles out of the inside of his jacket. The broken seal catches your eye - the impression of a five-toothed cog in black wax. Curious, you unfurl it, trying hard not to crush the tiny rolled slip of parchment beneath your meaty fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn faded yellow ink is a brief message. '<span class=\"cyellow\">uif gjstu ibt cffo gpvoe. pvs qmbot dibohf. nffu jo uif dbuifesbm po zvmfgftu ebz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-pp</span>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the Ordanians had never been particularly good at cloak-and-dagger. A brief glance tells you that it is a simple substituion cypher, one even written in the common tongue. You make a curious sight, a massive naked Orc sat with his tongue between his teeth and his brow furrowed as he sits and slowly decodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The first has been found. Our plans change. Meet in the cathedral on yulefest day. -OO</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to consider the message, Volkov splutters up a mouthful of blood on the bed and rolls over, grumbling as his eyes flutter awake. Quickly you stuff the scroll back into the jacket and depart as fast as is possible without pulling the door off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surly glances of the soldiers fill you with some unease as you lumber back to the attic. There are over two hundred soldiers inside the city walls - a courtesy guard allowed inside to protect the visiting foreign king and his son. If they are planning something sinister (and there efforts to conceal the message rather suggests that they are), they could certainly do a lot of damage. Tonight is Yulefest Eve. Tomorrow, Volkov will be meeting with this 'OO'. It is important that you be there to observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs leading up into the attic space, the cacophonous sounds of the organized Ordanian orgy fade away. Just as you reach for the seam of the Orc suit to remove it, you notice the flickering red light of a fire pouring from the ajar door to your study...</span></div></div>",

Your first orcish impulse is to kick down the door and snap their necks for daring to invade a wizard's sanctum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc skin is unwieldy and slow and while an orc's internal organs are robust and redundant enough to shrug off the occasional blow, your human insides are not. It is better to be fast than strong. Additionally the skins have something of their own mind, a bundle of instincts that add themselves to their host's. It's very easy in combat to get lost in the orc battle rage, and a wizard that loses his wits loses his spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching under the armpit, you run your fingers over the small nodule of nerves. The heavy skin shudders and goes limp as it sheds itself from your body. You discard it as a fleshy green puddle on the floor, the bulky weight lifting from your shoulders. You step out of it and set the thaumascope down beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have never been a good fighter as a human, one of the reasons why you got reassigned away from the front lines. You suspect you're even worse after so longer behind a desk. The tiefling skin is light and lithe and nimble however, and packs a mean punch. The tail is stronger than it looks with a barbed point can do serious damage to unguarded soft spots. The horns too, deceptively short and cute, perfectly spaced to gouge a man's eyes out. Its innate combat instincts cut through your paralysing second-guessing, knowing exactly where to be at the right time to not get hit, turning a fight into a beautiful dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floorboards approaching your study are creaky. You leap them with silent, elegant grace. Outside the door, you extend your senses, both mortal and infernal. There is somebody inside, you can hear them, but the tiefling senses draw a blank, detecting no emotions of malice or greed emanating from the sneakthief. They must be concealing them somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek around the door. Your vision is poor your spectacles but you can see a roaring fire has been lit in the fireplace and a blurry, red-skinned figure rises from the chair in front of it, turning to face you, a slender sword in one hand, a blunt club in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrike now while you have the surprise. With a savage cry, you burst in and pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sail through the air as if in slow motion, your short-sighted vision focuses the fuzzy figure into a male puazi tiefling in a woolly sweater, a poker in one hand, a bottle of wine in the other as the words \"Merry Yulefest!\" die on his lips. It is Kaleb, a private adventurer from hell under your employ. Without missing a beat, he ducks and as you soar majestically overhead, his hand snag you out of the air. You faceplant hard, horns gouging long grooves in the floorboards. His knee digs into your back as he pins you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your paws off me, you filthy halfbreed!\" you snap, lashing him with your free tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop struggling, ma'am. I don't want to hurt you but you intrude upon a wizard's private sanctum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> intrude? <i>I</i>?! Look to who you speak to, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitates. \"Do you... work for Mister Zeno too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> him, you idiot. I am Silas Zeno. The man who pays your wages. The man by whose good graces you are kept on this side of the great divide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say another word, you are lifted bodily from the floor and set down in the chair before the fireplace. A glass is pushed into your hands and shakily filled with wine. The terror rolls off him in waves now, setting your tiefling senses abuzz, raising the hairs on the back of your neck. He is sweating. You didn't even know puazi <i>could</i> sweat. \"I am so sorry, boss,\" he mewls. \"I was passing by a cleric today and she was saying how important it is to think of all the people alone at yulefest time. And that got me thinking about how... nice it would be to drop by and wish you a merry yulefest. And your friend said you were busy and might be a while so it would be okay for me to wait inside. Sarya, I think her name was?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a year on the mortal plane and already he is being contaminated by disgusting yulefest cheer. \"Do I look like the sort of person who has friends?\" You spit the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I would say no,\" he says, tentatively trying a smile but abandoning it. \"Why are you...\" he searches around for the right word, gesturing at your body while valiantly avoiding staring at the breasts that have slipped from the dress during the scuffle. \"...dressed like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be the first time Kaleb has seen you use one of the skins, you realise. You don't like it. You like the keep your informants firmly under your heel and terrified of the bitter old miser with the godlike powers. Your face burns as you tug your breasts back into the flimsy purple dress. \"A wizard's business is his own affair. Hell, I could say the same about you. Who looks more absurd, hmm?\" you bark, jabbing your tail at the demon's garish knitted sweater. It has a yulefest tree on the front and tassels in the shape of miniature yulefest puddings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tradition, sir,\" he says. As if that justified dressing and acting like a fool. Wiltering before your fiery gaze, he quickly pours himself a large quantity of wine. He clinks his glass against yours with a timid \"Merry Yulefest\". The high note of reverberating glass fills the icy silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering your voice to a growl, you say, \"Tell me why I shouldn't banish you back to the nine pits for this insult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis slender ears twitch and he nearly chokes on his wine. \"Okay. That's fair. Number one, I think I might be the best agent you have.\" You give him a begrudging grumble. Kalem might be wide-eyed newcomer on this plane, but he has proven himself competent and unwaveringly loyal. His faults are his offensively upbeat attitude and tendency to politely decline missions he feels are \"unethical\", whatever that means. \"And secondly...\"</span></div></div>",

The liquid seems to boil in it, fumes spreading out throughout the room. Kaleb winces, tugging his head into his neck. Yet he does not back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it! Like, see? Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, you lessen up on the glass, lowering it. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe straightens out, filled with confidence, as he continues in a shaky, yet firm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see... we tieflings are quite good at sensing emotions, as you... ehm... might have found it. I have spent many years roaming the nine circles of the Underworld. I have been under the employ of many people.\" Kaleb reaches out to pour himself another glass, looking at you for approval. You simply hand wave. He nods as he begins to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave drivers, all of them!\" He exclaims with a sigh, another glass disappearing into his seemingly bottomless stomach. \"And hatred? Hoo, it simply pour off them by the waves. Their malice is simply incomparable to anything in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slouches in his chair, relaxing. \"But you... you are different from anything I've seen, boss. Not a single speck of malice escapes you. Even when you beat me for doing something wrong, I don't feel anything coming from you. It's as if it's only an image. A front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly growl. This bastardy fool has been reading you like an open book this entire time...?! How dare he! Gaining control of the situation was quite important now. If he blabs this to one of your subordinates - Sarya, perhaps - you would be laughed at. A conniving man has been a softie underneath the whole time? No, this won't do. The Order has taught you that you must remain by your lonesome self this entire time. Do not trust anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know that I can conceal my emotions...\" You begin, but are cut off as you notice his smile. It terrifies you. It is the smile of someone who knows that he has won, and that the sweet taste of victory is right ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" He doesn't back down as he leans forward, seeing eye to eye with you. \"I can sense the confusion and doubt right now. The truth is simple, boss. You're actually a nice guy. And I mean really nice. There ain't a single shred of hatred inside you. I honestly don't know why you had become a wizard. But all I know is that you are hiding your face under a mask right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" You hiss, but cannot find a reply. Under a mask? Preposterous! You have been trained in the highest Order! The most prestigious! Such nonsense and foolishness is beneath you. You are... you are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip as you look away. How can this be...? You have been trained to handle yourself well under pressure! And yet, you break down in front of this young boy. Has your age dulled your senses this much already. Nevertheless, you roll your eyes, stretching out your arm with the glass. To put such a shameful display in front of someone... You have no choice to admit defeat to him. But only just this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...\" You begin, but sigh as you realize that you shouldn't fall to such heights. Such disgust is beneath you. \"Well? Get on with it, fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see his eyes brighten up, as if a candle flame flickered in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Yulefest, sir\" he says, the sounds of high-pitched glass reverberating through the air. You gulp down the wine, admitting that Kaleb picked out quite a good variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, boss,\" he intejects...</span></div></div>",

Of course I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins. A parcel wrapped in colourful paper and ribbons is placed eagerly in your lap. He gives the ornate bow a tug and the whole thing unfurls to reveal an ugly woollen sweater patterned with images of a jolly Mother Yulefest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, nestled on top of the sweater, a small cube of intricately interlocked pieces of lacquered wood, not entirely dissimilar to the cheap puzzle boxes often found in Yulefest crackers, except one possessing rather more hellish power. It was a Lemarchand's Box, one of very few. By disassembling and reassembling it in different configurations, it is capable of opening portals to any number of hellish demiplanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisbelieving you turn it over in your hands. The wood is slightly warm to the touch and perfectly smooth except for the almost imperceptible cracks where the pieces slot together. It is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship, priceless.  As you hold it to your ear, a faint alien tune hums from within. As you run your fingertips over the surface, a star-shaped section rises out of its own accord, twists half a turn and sinks back in, the song growing in intensity and complexity. Such an innocuous looking device. In the hands of a competent occultist, capable of bringing forth the armies of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's all yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tear your eyes away from the powerful device, you see Kaleb staring at you with a strange, vacant intensity, the wine glass paused half-way to his lips. His unfocused eyes blink twice as if coming around from a half-trace. \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation clicks into place. Kaleb <i>does</i> have a knack for choosing the good stuff. Fine wines. Old vintages. Rich flavours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes sense now. <i>You</i> are Kaleb's vintage. Perhaps he's right, perhaps you aren't as nasty as you like to think. But you are certainly acquisitive. You'd be a poor information gatherer if you didn't enjoy <i>gathering</i> things. No wonder he enjoys his job so much. Every time he brings back a new piece of intel or artifact, he gets to taste your old soul overflowing with avaricious delight. For a tiefling, your wretched presence must be like ale for an alecoholic, opium for an opium fiend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can even sense it, now that you know what to look for. It's weak, as most positive emotions are, but there - a faint contended glow.<i> Does he even realise he has a problem or is he concealing it?</i> you wonder, inspecting his honest face for any hint of addiction. He looks merely like a dog happy to serve its master. Your gaze flits down to his crotch. At least he isn't <i>that</i> pleased to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir? Did I do well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of- of course. Very... very well. How in the hell did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the goblin selling it wasn't exactly subtle about it. All I had to do was find him and explain the situation to him. I apologised and told him that we all have to make sacrifices for the greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, understanding perfectly. \"And then you drove your sword through him and stole the box! Excellent work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? N-no, then he gave it to me. After I described all the damage the box can do if it fell into the wrong hands, he said he certainly didn't want that on his conscience and that it should be destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dumbly. \"The goblin... just gave you it? For <i>free</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. More or less. I insisted on paying him what I could for his trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this thing is worth a <i>kingdom</i>. No goblin would ever trade it for so low a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one did. I suppose you can't put a price on peace of mind,\" he shrugs. \"If you always expect the worst in people, sir, that tends to be what you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. You're starting to sound like a yulefest cracker,\" you grumble. \"He's probably sold you a fake.\" You rise from the chair and retrieve your spectacles from the desk. Perching them loosely on your diminished nose, you inspect the item closer for any sign of forgery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real. I know it is. He even already had a buyer lined up-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah! So he claims!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-some guy called OO.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how they play their cons, they lie and tell you - wait, did you say the buyer was called OO?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Two Ohs. Or I suppose it could be 'Oooh'? I don't know. They only communicated by letter, that's how they signed off. Apparently they were very keen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd. You scratch your beard, too embroiled in contemplation to even notice its absence. The Ordanian's contact had signed off as OO. Can it be the same person? Have the Ordanians been trying to get their hands on a Lemarchand's Box, an artifact capable of summoning hell itself within the city walls?</span></div></div>",

It seems that Kaleb has actually done quite a fine job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, you cannot recollect a single moment where he has let you down... that is, when he isn't organizing such farcical nonsense as Yulefest celebrations. But when it comes to missions, he has always managed to somehow complete even the most difficult of them... in the most bizarre ways (asking someone to give you a Lemarchand's Box? Ridiculous!) You cannot deny that his claim of being your best agent is not unwarranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb breaks your concentration with a remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the most important thing... we have to try this out!\" You hear Kaleb say, almost giggling like a maiden fawning over her royal knight. It disturbs you, in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...? Absolutely not! You should know that this is a very dangerous piece of--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada!\" You glance upwards to see Kaleb holding up the woolen sweater which is adored which Yulefest imagery. \"How does it look, sir? I've knitted it personally myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, staring at it for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely atrocious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Kaleb's ears wane, drooping on his skull as if though they have a personality of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, boss,\" he mutters, as he thrusts the sweater towards you, causing you to flinch. \"It's the Yulefest spirit to be wearing this. And I tried so hard too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should have spent that time on something better--\" You begin, but stop, looking down at the gadget on your hand. After all, he did somehow find and obtain this very precious and valuable device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you spit, wrapping your tail around the woolen sweater, yanking it out of his hands. Kaleb lets loose a brief smile, which does not go unnoticed by you. You groan, reaching for under your armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you help me with this? I can't seem to find the nerve nodule,\" you say after a couple of tries. It seems that you are not that tolerant to alcohol in this skin. Either that, or you are a complete fool for designing this skin with a small nerve nodule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knee-urv know duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" you respond as you throw the sweater onto yourself. It takes around twenty seconds, nearly ripping it apart twice with your sharp horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look awful,\" you remark, twirling and checking yourself. The sweater droops all the way to your knees, acting more as a dress than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. You look good, boss,\" Kaleb says, as he rubs his chin with his arm. He steps up to take a closer look at you, knocking the empty wine bottle out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, anything would look good on you,\" he pauses, gulping visibly. A brief look at his crotch reveals that he is not actually aroused. You almost feel insulted by it at this point. \"E-especially in that body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother glance reveals the same result. Is he impotent or something? Or are you not attractive enough? You somewhat panic. Operating inside a brothel, your skills determine the quality of your work. If you have lost your touch, you would need to train yourself further in seductive maneuvers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think I will head to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about the cake?\" Kaleb cries after you, unwrapping yet another package with a Yulefest Celebration cake. Your eyes widen as you recognize it. <i>Holy Rosemary!</i> It is a legendary cake, of which only ten are baked per year. How did Kaleb get his demonic hands on one...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip. You do not want to admit to your subordinates - since it is a weakness of yours - but you have a bit of... a sweet tooth. You gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tomorrow,\" you barely audibly mumble, eyes still cast on the marvelous specimen. You have to summon all of your willpower to begin walking to your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget to put it in the cooling thermopressor\" You shout, pointing at it, before nearly sprinting to your bedroom. Closing the door rather loudly, you take several deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShedding the sweater, as well as the dress, you slump on your bed nude. Those fools with their nightgowns! Pah! They do not know what they are missing out on. Tomorrow is going to be a long day. You must spy after General Volkov, find out the mystery of this 'OO', and decipher the various configurations ofthe Lemarchand's Box. Oh, and get a bite out of the cake too. You drift to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake with a numbing pain in your skull, as if though it is being split apart form the inside. <i>Too much wine yesterday</i>, you think. You sit up on your bed, rubbing your palm against your forehead. <i>Alright, time to--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are cut off by a shriek that escapes your lips, as you notice...</span></div></div>",

You're sticky with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet smack, the butchered head of a goblin lands between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething unfurls from the roof above. It lands just as you roll out of bed, crushing it beneath its weight and turning the linen into a cloud of feathers with a blur of blades. Slowly it rises out of the wreckage. It is humanoid, vaguely. Its limbs are of black glass and fingers that end in serrated knives, all dripping with gore. Within its torso ticks intricate clockwork. The face is a polished mask, a single red crystal in the center serves for an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The box,\" it crackles, the voice warped and machine-like. The mechanisms inside its body tick faster as it contracts upon itself like a coiling spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you seek to conjure a ball of hellfire to hand, you are made aware of a nauseating cold that fills the room, penetrating your flesh far deeper than the mid-winter air. The fire gutters out between your fingertips. Something is sapping your powers. You stare in horror at the glassy \"flesh\" of the golem. Obsidian, arcane's bane. A single shard enough to weaken even the strongest of magi, and this thing is made of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clockwork cogs in its chest suddenly stop, then reverse. The thing lunges forward with a unbelievable speed. Your human mind freezes, powerless and paralysed. Fortunately the half-demon aspect in your muscles takes the wheel, rolling beneath its blades and rising into a sprint as the machine embeds itself in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell do normal people do in this situation? What recourse do they have, besides calling for a wizard?</i> you think, as your magic continues to fail you. Not even a simple flare spell springs from your fingertips. <i>Oh, that's right, they <b>die</b>.</i> You tear open the drawers of your desk, grabbing the Lemarchand's Box. An artifact of such power will surely not succumb to the obsidian's presence easily. If you can solve the puzzle, you can tear open a hole to hell and summon demons to your aid, or take a jaunt through an outer plane to safety-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen knives erupt from your chest. Their removal is far worse, tearing and ripping ragged holes in your flesh as they leave. The box drops from your limp hand. A mechanical rattle, a laugh perhaps, rings out as you thud on to the desk. Blood pours out of your mouth. You are vaguely aware of it collecting the box and departing via the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh...,\" you gurgle. <i>Obsidian Order.</i> It hurts. It hurts so much. Your pride, that is. You're an intelligence analyst; this is exactly the sort of thing you're paid to see coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't seem to move even a finger, nor have the energy to try as the life pours out of you, spreads over the desk and drips over the edge, steaming in the cold air. You try to call upon even a weak spell, a cantrip, anything. Nothing. Your magic is gone. Perhaps some part or poison of the creature remains in you. It seems you are to die a civilian, a mortal man. Less even. A naked, dead tiefling whore in a brothel. Nobody to mourn her passing. It will be the new year before your superiors note the absence of the monthly report and come to seek you out. The watch will have thrown your body in a ditch long before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the dark curtains are drawing about your vision. Death holds no fear for a crimson wizard. It is what comes after that terrifies them. There is a special circle of hell reserved for the souls of the wizards who have held back demonkind for millennia. An expedition even confirmed it. You can see it now - the demon in the room, come to drag your soul down to hell. Shaking you. Putting his hands all over you. Wearing a crown of brightly coloured paper. You must be delirious. Hallucinations of a dying brain. It almost seems as though it is wearing one of those stupid yulefest hats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon is pouring something down your throat. Pain spreads out from your stomach, burning in your chest and skin. It drags you back, clears your head. You sit bolt upright, gasping for breath as the wounds in your chest knit themselves together, only to slump back down as the rush of energy burns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb is not his usual composed self. He frets over you - fear, doubt, sadness and more emanate from him. His mouth moves but you can't quite make out the words. Perhaps he is asking for orders? He disappears from view, returns a moment later to bundle you up in a blanket. You are lifted into his arms. Weak and shivery, the warmth of his body is irresistible. Huddled up against his chest, you fade in and out of awareness as he carries you downstairs and out into the snowy streets.</span></div></div>",

The streets are covered in it, Kaleb's boots sinking as he begins to wade through the blizzard, shielding you from the battering snowfall. The streets are barren, all the people in their comfy little homes, celebrating the Yulefest Eve without a care in the world. A fortunate turn of events. At least there won't be anyone watching as you die a humiliating, dog's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb is taking you somewhere. Where - you have no idea. Frankly, it was already too late for you as the last of your blood was draining out of your system. The poison was quickly circulating within you. No magic would save you now. Anything arcane would quickly evaporate as soon as it touches your skin. And you doubted that even the most skilled physician would be able to cure the gaping holes within your stomach. And it was okay. You had already accepted your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets keep changing and changing as the puazi tiefling runs, sweat glistening in freezing temperatures, as the only thing that keeps you alive is the blanket and his warm body. You want to tell him to stop, that everything was fine, but your voice could no longer escape your weakening body. He constantly keeps glancing over at you and muttering something. What - you don't know. Your mind has already stopped hearing anything, bodily functions continuing to shut down. You hope that he doesn't overstrain himself carrying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb was a talented adventurer, with a bright future ahead of him. You always envied how he managed to resolve situations in the most efficient manner possible, yet also delighted as well. Embarrassingly enough, you even secretly considered him like your own son, watching the growth of his boy like any proud father would. That was how attached you became to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a pity, really. Kaleb had always attracted your curiosity as a member of the Crimson Order. He was quite unique even for a puazi tiefling, his generosity seemingly off the charts. He was also restrained. Whereas a regular tiefling, puazi included, would not be able to control their base desires and cravings, whether it be  knowledge, anger, wealth, or love. But Kaleb... Kaleb was different. He almost seemed human... almost. You would even venture to say he was purer than most humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear escapes your eye, sliding down your cheek before it stops to rest on Kaleb's chest. You aren't sure if he felt it, but you do notice him slow down, yelling something as he pats you on the back in a comforting manner. How... soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are thrown in disarray as Kaleb comes to a brief stop in front of a building. It was a building you knew all too well. A building that every subject in the city knew. A large cross adorned the triangular white roof, as the arches supported it along with the pure white walls. The cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to focus your voice, trying to warn the young tiefling. \"N...no... d-don't...\" is all you can moan before small body relaxes, practically crumbling in his arms. You knew that the priests didn't take kind to demons, tieflings included. You needed to warn the young adventurer, to keep him safe from peril, to protect him from death. Your death was already determined, the least you could do is to have his death bear on your conscious. None of their arts and mastery could help you, other than their holy relic, the Holy Grail. But it could only be activated once a year, a precious commodity that wouldn't be wasted on dying filth - a mere tiefling maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your arm, your leg, your mouth - you couldn't move anything. You couldn't stop him from moving to the sacred ground. You couldn't stop him from approaching the guard, who was ready to spear him through in one blow, anger and fear clearly shown on his face. Your eyes flutter, wanting to close in order to avoid seeing him pierced through the entire length, but remain open with knowledge that closing them meant to never open them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are as much surprised as the guard is to see <i>something</i> thrust out in front of him. It dangled from Kaleb's hand, swaying in the wind as he silently stood there. You don't know what it is, the details escaping your hazed gaze, but the effect on the guard is visible as he drops the spear and visibly scurries into the cathedral. Kaleb takes this time to press you close to his chest, rocking you up and down like a baby as he keeps muttering something. The guard finally returns with... the Archmother Helena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus your concentration to the max, trying your hardest to discern their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...willing to give?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything! I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you fall unconscious into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt upright, the cold floor nearly freezing your naked legs as you glance around from side to side. The surrounding walls, barely discernible in the dark, do not look anything like the Ninth Circle of Hell told in legends. In fact, it looked very much like the cathedral you sparingly visited. Does that mean... that you're alive? Your tiefling hand quickly bolts to your stomach. Restored! It was completely restored, no wounds in sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb!\" You exclaim, glancing around excitedly in search for your assistant. But you saw no one and nothing in this barren room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb...?\" You yell a bit louder this time, voice reverberating through the stone columns. Again, nothing. What happened to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand upright, your nude body exposed to the cold air as you begin walking to the great iron door. A quick push opens it, revealing a network of intricate hallways before you. You pick one. It doesn't matter. All of them eventually lead to the exit. You aimlessly wander around before you stumble upon a door that piques your interest as you hear the voice...</span></div></div>",

Slumping back downwards, you notice that you are lying inside a bed - one that is much smaller than the one you're used to - covered in linen sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance under the sheets reveals a naked tiefling whore body, thoroughly wrapped in bandages. There's a bit of red in several places where the flow of blood is too strong, causing it to stain through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I cannot believe it. How am I even alive...? I am supposed to be dead!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander your eyes around the room, looking for any clues. The room itself is pretty small, and humble. In fact, it seems as if though this entire room <i>is</i> the house. The smell of freshly cut wood and newly painted lacquer blows throughout the room. It seems that this house has been built not too long ago, possibly in the last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small Yulefest tree is standing in the corner of the room, decorated with Yulefest lights and miniature Yulefest cookies. Presents are strewn all over under it, though the contents of them remain a mystery to you. A large, green Yulefest sock is nailed into the wall near a tree, filled with Yulefest candy. A smaller one is crookedly hanging there, empty, as if though it has just recently been added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise interrupts you as the door to the cabin is burst wide open; a cold breeze accompanying the figure of Kaleb lugging a big turkey on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder when boss will--\" He begins, before he notices you staring at him. He instantly drops the frozen turkey on the floor with a large thud as he rushes over to you, grabbing you by the shoulders. \"Boss! Boss, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop shaking me so much, you buffoon!\" You reply, feeling as if though your wounds will reopen any minute now. \"And close the damn door! It's freezing outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, taking a few steps to close the door, before sitting on a stool beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling, boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like shit,\" you reply, grumbling. Not only did your body feel as if though it has been rammed by a club of some orc, your mind has also taken a toll. You have just been outwitted. You rephrase that in your head. <i>You are an intelligence gatherer and you have just been outwitted.</i> Those bastards. Now you understand what this 'OO' is, but you still cannot believe it. How can they betray the city...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we anyways?\" You ask, looking around. If Kaleb has just barged into some stranger's house and taken his--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my house. Doesn't it look nice?\" He says, sweeping his arm across the room, stopping on the fireplace where the last embers are burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... got to add fuel to the fire,\" he adds, picking up some logs from beside it and tossing them nonchalantly into the fire. You stare at him intently as he does so. Finally, he returns to his seat, wiping his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... house...? When did you have time to buy one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, boss. I built it myself!\" He puffs out his chest, looking proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you... wait a minute... so all of those missions where you suddenly go missing...\" You can see his eyes shift away from yours. <i>Got him</i>, you think. \"So you <i>were</i> slacking, you conniving thief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible gulp escapes his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see...\" He begins, twirling his fingers and he looks downwards at the ground, avoiding your gaze. \"My mother has kicked me out of the house over a year ago. 'Go find yourself a wife, you lazy bum', she said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands up, walking to the fireplace with a poker in his hand. He stabs at the pit a couple of times, peeling off the charred bark from the wood. Suddenly, he drops the poker on the ground with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But women these days...\" He continues, downtrodden. \"You know how they are. Money. Riches. Debauchery. I can't find a single honest girl these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There he goes again</i>, you think. He's always like this. Talking about honesty and traditional values. Bah! What use are they in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... that's why you build this house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Just for me and my future wife,\" he replies cheerfully, despite being downtrodden just a moment ago. \"Although, it's Yulefest Day and I still--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what?\" You shot, springing up from the bed. You wince from the pain, but don't slump back down. \"I... I need to get to the Cathedral immediately. If the Obsidian Order and General Volkov meet up, then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Kaleb says, planting his hands on your shoulders, pushing you downwards. \"You need some rest. You were just stabbed god and devil know how many times. Recovery is a must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, hellfire, demons, portals, and other monstrosity threaten the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie down, boss,\" he coldly says, looking at you with an almost begging look. You do not back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemarchand's Box! It is a very dangerous piece of equipment. The proud capital of this empire--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to lie down, boss,\" he says once more. \"You need rest. Let me handle this instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip. What a stubborn subordinate. You should really send him back to the nine circles of hell for a while. He frets way too much over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they have incurred my wrath. Have dare they embarrass me in such a way?! I will regain my honor in this following battle! I will show them not to mess with a wizard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb sighs. \"You're not going to make this easy on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to wish you a good night, sir,\" he says, as he swings his head downwards on you---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" You yelp, as you rub your horns, as they suffered the impact. Kaleb does the same with his. \"What the <i>hell</i> are you doing, you rapscallion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sorry, boss,\" he replies, still clutching his own horns. \"I just tried to knock you out and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By... using your head, you flaming idiot?!\" You yell, throwing the pillow beneath your head at him. He dodges it by a minute amount. He remains silent as he tries to think up of an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss...\" he suddenly whispers in a low falsetto. \"I cannot let you go there... It's just that...\"</span></div></div>",

It is for that reason that the skin you hold in your hands is so rare, for it does not resemble a living thing at all. The empty husk of flesh in your hands is deathly cold, palid white and damp to the touch. You unfurl it carefully. There is not much to this one, it is not particularly robust and slow to heal any tears that come upon it. Delicately, like the lover of a virgin maiden, you tease open the thin, grey lips of the face. The mouth yaws ever so slowly wider until it it just large enough for you to squeeze one foot it, then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the tiefling, the inside of this is not a warm, velvety smoothness. It is moist and unpleasantly cold, such that you are shivering one it is up to your waist. Like wading into a pond of freezing water, it is better just to dive in. Wrinkling up enough slack, you push the skin up your chest in a single fluid motion and draw its head over your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the magic of the suit permeates you, the heat rushes from your body. It is not unpleasant, simply a change from one state to the other - at least the midwinter cold no longer bites. Half way through a beat, your heart stops. Your breathing gutters out with a wet gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parasite that grew upon on corpse never received much nourishment and as such is half-dead itself, requiring gentle encouragement to complete its alterations to your form. Massaging the marble-white skin of your chest swells two small, malnourished breasts into existence, while you have to actively help the suit with your manhood, which has formed a saggy pouch in the front of the suit, by pushing it up into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, the pale body of a starving urchin girl stares back at you with soulless eyes. Her long, black hair is matted as though she has been dredged freshly from a ditch. Her skin is bloodless, as though thoroughly exanguinated, She is evidently freshly dead, except for the fact that she is moving and fiddling with her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you need is your dick falling out in the middle of your liaison with Volkov.

Besides that she has raised an army of werewolf huntsmen that obey her beck and call, captured foreign troops and spike their food with random transformation potions, and many other things. Yet most of her actions are driven by her inherited insanity that all of those born in Erolus experience. In short, she's more psychotically evil than flat out evil though.

I after I give Excallius his tribute he'll spare our kingdom. The last thing I need to do is piss off the Dragon King. I then follow the guardsman outside.

Hopefully some breakfast will help see that I love him. Once I enter his room I scream with glee as he finishes off the last bite of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're here to ask me to see if I changed my mind the answer is no. Like I said before you will have to court me for a few months before I think of marrying you. Keeping me as your prisoner and fattening me up won't do you any favors either.\" Rilian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian is so cute when he says things like that, however I need an answer from him now. I was going to consider slimming him down once he agreed, but he's so adorable with the extra 120 lbs. on his body. Plus he's stronger than before due to the accidental ingredient I added to the weight gain potion. Soon he'll see that we both despise his father equally. I just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to? There's no else in the room. I also don't blame you for hating my father. That douche is a danger to Tryzantium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I need your hand in marriage. Marry me Rillian. Together we will make an empire.\" I said as I stroked his bearded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This is not proper. I will never marry a psycho like you. Besides, my younger sister Emma has probably left to rescue me by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI storm out of Rilian's room. I've heard reports that Princess Emma and her men were seen in Daybreak. I sent a huntsman to intercept her party. In the meantime I will meet with the council to discuss where we should go to aquire an alliance or where to start war.

Queen Agatha is an imposing woman with pepper-gray hair. She's not a dedicated follower of Ordin but, enforces his laws when it serves her purpose. It is also said that Agatha loves to gamble behind closed doors at the late hours of the night. She is also known to cheat to ensure that she wins. She often uses her prize money to increase the size of the Ordanian army or to purchase unclaimed territories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King Franklin the Large</b>: A true follower of Ordin and the high bishop of the brotherhood of Ordin. Like many in the brotherhood, Franklin believes that women should only be responsible for making laws, cooking, making clothes, playing female only sports, or supporting the royal army either by magic or as a foot soldier to serve the generals, even though there are female commanding officers in the army. Over the years Franklin became more of a glutton. For every child his wife bore he gained a hundred pounds or more. He has no shame in his size because he considers fat men to be extremely manly in the eyes of Ordin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jillian the Wanderer</b>: Technically the heir of the Ordanian throne, she loves seeing new lands. As the eldest daughter of the king and queen she often goes on long expeditions. Recently she never came back from her recent expedition. It is unknown if she is dead or if she kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Roberto the Pervert</b>: Most commonly called a playboy, Roberto has been given <b>Ordin's Enriching Blessing</b>. Roberto used to be a quiet individual, but his mother insisted that he receive the blessing so she could get him to marry Isabella of Tryzantium. His father objected at first until Agatha persuaded him that the Ordanian throne needs an emergency heir in case Jillian is dead. After receiving the blessing Roberto has been trying to woo over any woman he finds. As a result he is locked in a cage and guarded by two heavily muscled guards. Any woman who tries having sex with Roberto is made sterile as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia the faithful</b>: As a royal princess Amelia has been fascinated by the church. Due to her being a female she can only serve as a temple maiden/priestess. As such she must dress in scanty clothing since it is a requirement for all females who serve Ordin. Her mother objects to this and demands that she learn how to rule Ordania if her plans for her first emergency heir backfires. Agatha even threatens to banish or kill Amelia if she doesn't comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bartus the Fearless</b>: Bartus is only a year younger than Amelia. Unlike his older brother Bartus is loud and brass. He care about building his extremely muscular frame and fighting in wars. He is by far his mother's favorite son. Not only knowledgeable in war, but politics too. She even put him in charge of searching for his elder sister. Agatha hopes that he can meet a woman that shares his interests and who is also a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Princess Cassandra</b>: The youngest member of the royal family. She is a youthful trouble maker and is constantly disciplined by her parents.</span></div></div>",

The sole memory you have of your days before becoming a Djinn was the night you were tossed into some foul chamber, nude and bound. It was there some dark creature transformed you into the thing you have become and imprisoned you eternally into your lamp. Since that fateful day, you've eagerly awaited for the day you escaped from your gilded cell and could unleash havoc upon the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile, you've used your powers to their fullest extent to abuse those foolish enough to seek your blessings.

Most who encountered you survived, but they never remained unchanged from their original form and almost always it was in a way they had not been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake, for instance, Emira, novice witch of the Ellesian Woods. She had come to you seeking to subdue the goblin tribe that was plaguing her woods. Though she had wanted them dead, her exact wording was that she should ''be able to subdue them''. So, with a flick of your wrist you had her beautiful elven form explode into a thousand gold pieces. It was with these pieces that her kingdom was able to bribe the goblins into moving on to harass another city. She had gotten what she wanted, even if it meant her conscious being eternally locked into a sack of coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr take Jorund, a foolish young blacksmith who, before the great calamity that had afflicted the Hashaan, had lusted after a rotund noblewoman. His position in the caste system meant that she would never be with him, so he came to you for assistance. Alas,the poor boy wished for ''Alessa to love me'' which sealed his fate. More than anything the obese woman loved to eat and it was for that you transformed Jorund into a delicious cake. Alessa unknowingly feasted on him that evening, devouring every last bite of his sugary form. As with Emira, he spent the rest of his existence trapped on her belly, nothing more than a conscious belt of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminiscing on these situations and others was how you spent most of your free time.<br>\r\nToday, though, your trip down memory lane is cut short as you are summoned from your lamp, only to meet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To your shock, they are as engorged as the rest of him! His balls are the size of a pregnant woman's belly and his cock truly resembles an elephant trunk in length and girth. It seems this foul sorceress had more than just a fat prince in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And how will I do that, O' master?'' you ask, staring his crotch down still. ''Want me to turn the sorceress in a bloated mess like yourself?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please, only my father would engage in such petty revenge. No, I shant use your power for evil. All I wish is for you to turn me back to normal.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold yourself from letting out a horrendous cackle. Of all the possible wishes, anything to do with ''normal'' was your favorite. It provided you great leeway to change your victims into whatever YOU deemed normal. For instance, you could make his obesity his ''new normal'' and change history to as if he was always fat.<br>\r\nOr, even more insidiously, you could make his being lost as normal, turning him into a nomad.</span></div></div>",

The fat nobleman sits stoic, unphased by the dark magic flooding the chamber. If only the poor bastard knew you are about to ruin his life, or at least, his chance at a decent figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Forces of below,'' you begin,'' I command thee: grant this man his wish! Turn his obesity into a permanent reality!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, wai-'' the lardy man complained before a shocking pain in his temple stops him dead in his tracks. The pain becomes overwhelming as the dark miasma filling the room condenses around him, covering him head-to-toe. His screams of terror and pain become muffled as the magic works its wonder, rapidly overwriting his memories to fit the new reality you are creation. Meanwhile, all across the land thunderstorms erupt as history is subtle changed to suit the now fat-filled past of Rilian. All in all the process takes about two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it comes to and end, and the shadow blanket wrapped around the prince dissolves. Free from his bindings, the obese man rises to his feet, his mind utterly ravaged. Unable to think clearly, he turns towards the only figure in the room: a beautiful woman in a revealing set of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who are you?'' he asks in a hoarse voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I am your Djinn, master. You passed out upon summoning,'' you reply with a lie. ''Not uncommon, but do you remember who you are, master?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah yes, the djinn... My name is Rilian, the engorged prince of Tryzantium. Three months ago I was kidnapped by a sorceress and thinned against my will to the form you see now. I was once much fatter, you see. Early tonight, I escaped with not a single belonging; not even my clothes. It was by chance that I found you in this decrepit temple when I sought to hide myself.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh master, you were even larger?'' you ask while feigning surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Indeed I was. As the beloved son of the king, my mother Helena and the Church of the Goddess selected me to become the first male recipient of the Bountiful Blessing. It gave me a truly powerful form that before my capture, rendered me nearly one thousand pounds. Now I am but a third of that weight...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking the prince over, you notice some subtle differences to his body. He's just as fat, but his breasts are saggier as is his gut. Definitely more wear on his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now then, Djinn, I believe you owe me a wish, do you not? I wish that...''</span></div></div>",

Despite reports of his death, some noblemen have learned that a woman named Luna has kidnapped and thinned him in some attempt to gain his hand in marriage. Her spoiled, rotten father is refusing to act on the matter, declaring them false, so Emma has decided to plan her own rescue. As it is technically illegal to go against her father's orders, she has sent her guards out of the room, using the privacy to scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh Rilian...'' Emma thinks to herself, tears welling in her eyes, ''I wish that you were back home''..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the gods themselves answered her prayers, a large, absolutely massive beast of a man suddenly appears a few feet above Emma. His girthy, rotund form immediately crashes to the bed below, directly onto the nude and defenseless princess. Rilian's fat ass engulfs her, squeezing her gentle between his two cheeks as he collides with the mattress. A wall of sweaty flesh swallows the poor girl, sealing her off from the outside world like a flesh cocoon. It is soft enough that she is not crushed, though her breathing has become incredibly difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-where am I?'' Rilian asks. He struggles to get up, having fallen squarely on his back. His blessed legs can't help him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I believe this is Emma's room, master,'' you explain as you phase back into reality. ''I saw that this room was empty and her large bed was your best means of arrival.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But look at me! I'm like a turtle on its back. I can't get up!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the fat acts as a sort of insulator against Rilian's nerves, for he doesn't seem to notice the pair of muscular legs sticking out from beneath him. They kick wildly, desperate for an escape that will never come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I believe turtles roll onto their bellies, master.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wonderful point, Djinn!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your suggestion the blubbery prince begins to shift his body back and forth, back and forth in an attempt to roll off the bed. Unfortunately for Emma, these movements gradually cause her trapped figure to slide further and further upwards, straight towards Rilian's starfish asshole. Her years of training and condition help for nothing as she is too weak to fight against his flesh or the motions. Before long, her head enters his anus with a sickening pop. Emma's legs disappear under his body as more and more of her is unintentionally devoured into his ass. Even his more sensitive insides are unable to detect her struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the prince has enough momentum to leave the bed, Emma has been swallowed up to her waist. He tumbles over the edge, smashing his 10,000 pound body into the stone flood with a mighty crash. He lets out a pained sigh as Emma's legs and his ass are forced into the air. You watch with glee as gravity does its worth, sending Emma's toned thighs and feet sliding into her big brothers colon. With that, her fate is sealed. Nothing escapes his godly body undigested and it is only a matter of time before she is absorbed entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah...'' Rilian says, letting out a pleasure moan as the last of Emma enters him. His engorged cock sits erect, with little bits of semen dribbling from the tip. His fatness is truly turning himself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good work, master. You've escaped!'' You congratulate him with a playful slap on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Indeed, but... something seems off. I think I can feel something in my colon...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It is probably nothing, master. You're just adjust to your new form.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hmm...

Hopefully Rilian doesn't grow too suspicious of your intentions though. With a flick of your wish you grant Rilian's wish.

You grin evilly as you think of the various ways that you can twist their wishes. However, you suspect that Rilian might grow more suspicious of your intentions. You might have to be a little bit more clever when granting his wishes or he may outsmart you and prevent you from wrecking havoc on the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we meet my family I'll have to prepare to embark for the nation of Bishan.

It's just that I taught my sister how to use the sword in my thinner days so she could become a warrior.

I'll let you know when I need something,\" Rilian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then follow Rilian to his room. Again the doorway enlarges so he could enter without being stuck. He then proceeds to a rack that holds a few pairs of clothes, which would of fit him if he was 990 lbs. that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing Janus put an expansion spell on my clothes. That way I don't have to replace them if I grow larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilian then picks out a regal purple tunic. As soon as the fabric touches his belly it grows to massive proportions, but that's not all. The rest of his clothing adapts to Rilian's proportions as well. You then notice that the purple tunic instantly puts itself on Rilian. After that undergarments, trousers, stockings and boots that go with the outfit do the same thing! In a manner of minutes Rilian stands before you fully clothed. You have to admit that this royal wizard thought of everything. You'll have to find a way to dispose of the wizard sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I am clothed we can meet my family. Usually at this time they are usually in the throne room, or at least most of them. Isabella is always pampering her dogs at this hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceed to follow Rilian to the throne room. You joyfully plot in your mind which member of the royal family you'll screw over first. You could mess with Emma since that stench will take several days to remove, then there's her twin brother who's always bullied by their father. There's also Rilian's other sister Isabella and youngest brother Anders. Both would be fun to mess with. Finally you can also mess with the King and queen. Of course you could always screw around more with Rilian who for some reason has been enjoying your wishes, save for one. You'll have to decide after you meet them all of course.

I am your brother's Djinn, T'Slai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Djinn? Was that how my big man survived? No wonder why he's so well fed. Every new pound makes him more holy before the Goddess,\" Queen Helena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about the Goddess? With a Djinn I can finally crush my enemies and watch them tremble!\" Ivar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father! You're scaring Roland!\" Isabella quickly picks up a black lab and brings him close to her chest. \"It's okay little Roland. Someday you'll be able to defend yourself against that meanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone seen Emma? Rilian has come home. Finally the real fun can begin!\" Prince Anders yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then smell a terrible odor from down the hall. Looks like Emma wasn't able to get rid of that stench. You think to convince your master to allow Emma to borrow your services, but there's also other victims ripe for the picking. Emma's younger twin brother, Edward would be perfect to torture. His very appearance screams insecure wimp. Also Anders would be fun to screw with. Children are always easy to manipulate. Finally the king and queen themselves could lead to some intense wishing wars. By the time they are done making wishes they'll regret meeting you. Also you could ruin Rilian's chances of finding a wife too. Heck, you can even trick the fatso into becoming a Djinn for the 21st wish. This is just too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rilian, can I borrow your djinn? Someone stole all my soap again.\" Emma said while glaring at Isabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault? These adorable puppies just keep getting dirty. Isn't that right you naughty dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to think about it. I don't like making too many wishes in a row. Also T'Slai's powers should be used in emergencies only! She isn't an object to be used in our day to day lives,\" Rilian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's the last thing you wanted to hear. You want to grant 21 wishes before the week passes. After the week passes the number of wishes needed would revert to 21. So far you granted 5 in one day which is a new personal best for you. Most times you were only able to grant three wishes and then the count would reset since your previous masters died by the very wishes you granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have to be so fickle master? You could allow her to make one wish. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to enjoy this. You could make Emma smell so wonderful that it drives everyone insane or you could make her smell worse and have everyone else desensitized to her odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but this is the last wish for the night. We gotta reserve those wishes for emergencies or if Princess Luna marches with her army.\" Rilian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't disappoint you, master. Now what shall your wish be, mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Emma makes her wish. \"I wish for something to get rid of this smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this should be interesting. The wording allows you to twist this wish in various ways. You could give Emma a bottle of Moon Flower perfume. Sure she'll smell nice, but the toxins from the Moon Flower perfume will make her the target of any living thing. It can also cause the opposite gender to act a little naughtier than usual. However, could give her a special soap that will gradually turn her into a plant, Now that would be fun to watch. Which way do you decide to twist this wish.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As horrifyingly wonderful it would have been to turn Emma into an inanimate plant, you decide to go with the Moon Flower perfume. Invented long ago by Amazons wishing to coerce especially defiant captives into sex, the mere smell of the odor would be enough to implant feelings of lust within those who smell it. And not just a purely sexual lust either; Emma will be the target of any strong desire. Take, for instance, the long forgotten story of Duchess Lilia. One of you earliest victims, Lilia was foolish enough to use the perfume in proximity of her especially busty mother. One whiff later and the older woman was filled with an intense desire to transform her daughter into the perfect brassier for her weighty chest. The court wizard obliged and poor Lilia spent the rest of her existence as a piece of fabric clinging to her mother. Perhaps Emma will be so unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Prince Rilian,'' you say, turning towards your fat master, ''do I have your permission to grant the wishes of your immediately family?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aye,'' he says, eyeing you suspiciously, ''But nobody else shall ask a wish from you tonight, understood?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe command was directed more at his family than you. Unfortunately for the pudgy moron, his wording meant that you still had full permission to grant the family's wishes. It would be up to them to not partake in your powers. Truly fate was on your side this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Very well, master,'' you concede as your wrists begin to work yet again. Due to the simpler nature of this wish, only a small bit of darkness generates around your wrist before evaporating. The family looks at you with awe, dumbstruck by your evil powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It is done,'' you say as it dissipates. ''I have summoned a powerful perfume in your room Emma. Let us go and check it out.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Use caution, sister,'' Rilian interjects, ''She almost had you killed, after all.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the family departs, each heading to their own things. Rilian and his also obese mother go to the kitchen to enjoy a return meal. Ivar seeks out one of his many hidden sex chambers and one of his many whores. The siblings, meanwhile, return to their rooms as your and Emma go to hers. The journey is awkwardly silent as you can feel the distrust from Emma radiating off of her. Conniving her will be difficult indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you are back where you arrived not long before. Sitting on her bed is a small, glowing vial filled with a blue, iridescent liquid. It bubbles and froths like a hot soup, but is ice cold to the touch. Emma, the brave woman that she is, does not hesitate to break the seal and splash a fair amount of it on her neck. While initially odorless, the moment is makes contact with her skin a wonderful smell explodes into the room. Like a field of fresh flowers it reeks and fills your nose with pleasant sensations and dark desires. Even you are not immune from its lustful effects, though your inability to use magic freely hampers your chance to feed this feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hmm... I seem to smell much better and I have not undergone any weird changes. You have done well this time, Djinn,'' Emma admits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to sow some discord from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my dear Emma, I always do well, I promise. If you can keep a secret, it truly was Rilian who ordered you to be devoured. He wanted you to wind up inside his colon!'' you say, pleading for understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bull. My brother would never do that. He is a good and decent man.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But Princ-'' you begin before the slamming of the door interrupts the conversation. It seems her wonderful smell managed to waft into the hallway, triggering the deep desires of one of the royal family members. Who is it and what do they want?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The poor girl looks to be a mess and has been crying for some time, judging from the dampness on her chest and the stuffiness of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Emma!'' she howls between sniffles, ''it is not fair! They did it again!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lets out an annoyed sigh. Despite their differences, you can tell she truly does care for her sister and the wetworks are clearly getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Did what again?''

Emma chides, ''Mother told you not to get too attached to him. You know the laws of royal transformation, after all. He was no longer your boyfriend or a pet. He was property of the king and queen.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But he was soooooo cute!'' Isabella cries. Emma guides her sister back to the bed, taking a seat beside their unconscious father, who she had moved before Isabella's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-what happened to Father?'' she asks, her nose and eyes starting to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I am not sure. He came into my room in a lusty rage and tried to rape me. I think it was the doings of the Djinn.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The Djinn?'' Isabella says, her nose finally clear. She takes a deep, powerful breathe as her nose floods with the enchanting aroma of Emma's evil perfume. Her eyes widen as she is filled with a dark, selfish desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a serpent striking, Isabella swiftly leans back and reaches into her unconscious father's breast pocket. She gropes for a few seconds before pulling out a few vials, one of every color of the rainbow. With a smirk she undoes the top of the green one and places the rest on the bed before turning towards Emma. Armed with a sinister smile she jumps on her sister, pinning Emma to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What the heck are you doing?'' Emma asks. She tries in vain to force her sister off, to no avail. Emma was a master of martial combat but her actual strength was not that different from a regular woman's. Add in the extra strength from Isabella's blessing and she had a truly equal foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I got the perfect plan! If I turn you into a puppy, then I don't have to worry about our parents. They wouldn't turn you into soup, or send you to the pound, or give you to foreign diplomats as a gift!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You damn Djinn!''

Your feel giddy at the possibilities. The gods delighted in dishing out punishment to mortals almost as much as the djinn. In her younger eons, The Goddess had been quite the vicious bitch - not the more mellowed-out mother figure she appeared as today - and had whole lost canons of holy scripture given over to detailing in intricate detail exactly what ironic, horrific judgement was to be meted out for each particular crime. Towards the end of the book, she even started coming up with sins just to punish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut high up in first place on the list of sins was adultery. The list of punishments for men guilty had once comprised the entire Book of Castigation, the bulk of it could be boiled down to one word, Castration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last copy of the Book of Castigation had of course burnt up centuries ago in the fire that destroyed the Great Library of Alexandra. Fortunately, you're a djinn. With a snap of your fingers, a slightly singed-and-smoking copy of the Book of Castigation lands in your hand. The illustrations really stick out at you, as you flick through it. Like <i>really</i> stick out at you. A lot of scribes clearly spent a lot of time drawing a lot of dicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess did not mess around with unfaithful men. Castration by hungry rats. Castration by horse (getting the animal to stamp its hoof in just the right place was always a hassle). Castration by lye-filled codpiece. Castration by being tied out on a mountaintop in a lightning-storm wearing nothing but a metal codpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was only the introduction, the part written for courts who had access to only mundane methods of judgement. For cases severe enough to warrant being brought before a magically-empowered clergywoman of the church, there were far more exotic tortures designed to emasculate an adulterous husband, like having his dick turned into a pillar of salt or a fiery serpent.</span></div></div>",

The two of them are so into it they don't even notice your arrival, nor the cloud of multicoloured smoke that heralded it. With a wolfish grin, you wait patiently for your prey to be finished. It will by the last time he gets to use his crown jewels after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hggh,\" announces the king at last, his face going as red as a beetroot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're done,\" you say, grabbing the king by the back of the neck and teleporting the pair of you away, leaving a trail of royal seed in your wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on the wet stone cobbles outside the Cathedral. Ivar roars in confusion and outrage. A cart rumbles past through a puddle, its wheels splattering him with the human waste that runs down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are here on divine business, it is right that you dress the part. With a quick spin, a priestess gown the colour of moonlight forms about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, mummy, the king has no clothes!\" shouts a little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come away from that filthy beggar,\" the mother cries, hurrying him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvar has begun to scream for his guards. You simply grab him by the beard and drag him, kicking and screaming, over the cobblestone to where the stocks stood. Here the sinners condemned by the church would be brought out and chained up for the cityfolk to mock and jeer for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaised up on a high platform for all to see beside the stocks there was an interesting contraption. In the floor of the platform was a wide brazier filled with firewood. Suspended face down above this small bonfire by thick chains was a hollow metal statue of a woman, almost like a full suit of armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Iron Maiden they call it. The Church hasn't used it in year but still keep it outside as a warning. It is an instrument for the painful torture of heretics and sinners. First they are sealed up inside the hollow metal shell. Then a fire is lit beneath it, until the metal is slowly heated to the boiling point of flesh, plenty of time for the guilty to reflect. The pain is said to be indescribable. Yet the heat does not kill. Divine magic imbued into the device keeps them alive, and their flesh melts and runs into the mold of the Iron Maiden, pouring into the breasts and hips, conforming to the whorish mask of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their flesh mostly resolidified, the guilty would be eventually be released, though their punishment didn't end there. Their foreheads would be branded with the letter 'S'. Supposedly it meant 'sinner' or 'shame', though it could as easily mean 'slut' or 'slave'. While the ownership and prostitution of women is an affront to the Goddess and thus illegal, the church is more than happy to look the other way when it comes to 'women-shaped men'. Most who suffer the Iron Maiden wind up as cheap whores, unwillingly or through no other recourse in a city that spits upon them, a fate accepted as a fitting extension of their punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rear of the Iron Maiden opens on creaking hinges. Ivar screams at his impending fate as you push him forward into the cold metal confines, forcing his hands into its hands and his face into its mask. His flabby flesh spills over the side of the whorish mold like over-risen bread, and it takes some minutes of pushing and squeezing and kicking before he is squashed in enough for you to swing shut the rear of the Iron Maiden. The moulded metal buttocks click shut over his male counterparts, grown flabby from comfortable years upon a velvet throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king rattles around inside, his muffled screams gradually drawing a crowd of curious commonfolk.</span></div></div>",

He shrieks as you coax it out of the hole, his tender flesh feeling the touch of the blades all around. The commonfolk jeer at the appearance of the shriveled pink organ. Beneath it is placed a small wicker basket, the likes of which you might see for catching heads at a guillotining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'll give you anything! I'll do anything!

The iron grows hotter and hotter, glowing red then orange until it is bright white. The smell of hot fat fills the air as his excess flesh runs in torrents out of a number of holes near the top of the Iron Maiden. Listening closely, you can hear the steady gurgle of his liquifying belly flesh pouring into the huge, globular breast molds slung beneath it. Within the flames, his manhood shrivels and blackens to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH! I'M MELTING! HELP ME! I AM THE KING! THEKEEAARRGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sinner! Sinner!

That was a huge mistake on his part. Queen Helena used this to seize complete control of the throne. On top of that the crime rate has risen dramatically.

All the other kingdoms have been creating new endeavors to better their populace. Rilian figured that it was due to the desire to create new technology, improve magic institutions and to build larger churches. Rilian mainly desired this because he doesn't want his people to suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rilian worked his new adviser, Marrissa entered and bowed before her massive lord. \"Your majesty, the priestess who has punished your father is almost finished with him.

Wordlessly, she bends down and picks up the cock from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Diana, look,'' she says. ''This is his cock! The rest of him is gone!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh no, what do we do?!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A fine, young dragoness. Gifted with a muscular frame, a greater than normal size for her age, and being highly sensual among her breathen. She would have been promised to a great destiny, if other young dragons hadn't tricked her, out of jealousy. Being the victim of a powerful spell, she got corrupted and immobilized, allowing the dragons to mercilessly beat, bite and claw the dragoness to death, until she's agonizing. Then, they leave her up, spitting up at her while doing so, visibly disgusted, and leave her there, as good as dead. She whispers, in her draconian language, 'Why..', trying to reach something with a paw, silently hoping that she would be saved, to no avail. As the rest of her forces leaves her, her vision blurs up and darken, until she faints up, seemingly dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then.. She wakes up elsewhere, and inadvertly hit a roof with her head. By reflex, she holds her head for an incoming pain that never came. Feeling something wrong about her paw, she lowers it so she could see what's wrong about it. Out of fear, she suddenly scream, making a ruckus until she inadvertly slip off and fall down.<br>\r\nA voice could be heard right afterwise, 'So the girl has woken up? Feeling alright?'. She growls. The voice came from a man, around 6ft, and whose body is concealed under a large cloak. And yet, the dragoness felt something's odd about him. Something.. Dark. 'Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you.'. Still not trusting him, and with the memory of her betrayal still fresh, the dragoness tries to back up, causing the man to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There is something i want you to see.'. The man drops his cloak off, shocking the dragoness. In her mind, one word formed: 'Draconian'. Yet, despite that, the human isn't fully draconic per say. His head is human in all regard, aside from a pair of horns. His chest is lean and athletic, with patches of scales scattered around it, with a similar pattern on his right arm, human in form. On the other hand, his left arm much like a feral dragon's one, with a hand ending in three claws. And so does his left leg too, forcing him to stand onto a digitigrade stance as his left foot is a three-clawed talon. Lastly, his right leg is perfectly human, free of any draconian stance. He wears steel claws on his toes to maintain his balance up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness growls, pointing at the stainless leg. 'That? No idea. I got bitten by a dying draconian and the transformation occurred, but not fully, as you can notice. Since then, i've been wandering around, seeking entities like you.'. 'Grrr?'. 'No. Not dragons in particular. More.. Corrupted beings.'. 'Grrr!'. 'Oh yes, you are. Against your Will, i suppose. Glad you aren't affected by it.'. 'Grrr...'. 'Oh, yes. Before i forgot.. When i reanimated you, i had to literally put my mind onto it, meaning that some of my knowledge sapped into you. Normally, i wouldn't be able to do anything with raw draconic magic, but, in your case, it was like your being had been twisted in such a manner it could be messed up and/or be bent up with. Thankfully, it was me who did, meaning you are free. I could also suppose that you can now use the human language. Why don't you try?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness tries to speak up, moving her mouth, but only manage to let an unintelligible gibberdish. After a few tries, she manage to articulate some simple phrases, 'Why?'. The man answers, 'Why,  what?'. 'Why occurred?'. 'What so?. 'Twisted magic.'. 'Ah. Badfully, i can't tell. Ask your aggressors..'. 'Help me.'. 'I don't dwell in personal revenges.'. 'No.'. The dragoness point to the steel claws. 'Oh. Right. I'll see what i can do. But in exchange, i'd take some notes of who you are.'. 'Why.'. 'Safekeeping. And even if don't stay in touch with thoses i help, i can get to contact them for various errands. Remembering who they are is a huge help for certain matters. If you accept, just tell me your name.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u><b>Some time later..</b></u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness meets up with the man again. He gives her some steel claws, a helmet,  two blades and spikes for her tail, and a onyx pendant. She also learned that the man was at the head of a secret order, whose goals are to protect whose who need against corruption, cleansing it if needed, and to guide thoses being corrupted that have kept their good side. She also learned that she could detect 'corruption', much like the man, who had been corrupted himself. Thankfully, she could tell if corruption would be evil, good, willing and/or unwilling. After some training and a few errands she could do, both decide to go on their way, while the man had a piece of paper, about the dragoness: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Onyx, female dracolich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n - Size: 20 ft tall, 45 ft long. Plus another 20 ft for the tail<br>\r\n - Goals: Revenge against dragons. Being a living being once more. <br>\r\n - Skills: Flight, unarmed fighting, elemental breathing <br>\r\n - Equipment: Steel claws, steel helmet, custom tail weapon: Two blades and two tails<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Onyx travels throughout the roads by feet, to get to explore and, as she was told, to understand the 'uniqueness' of her situation. She sighs, given she would've reached the mine by now if she had simply went up in the sky, flying to it, especially since things had been pretty calm for her, given the other travelers, if they didn't just scurried off at her sight, preferred to stay away from the undead dragoness. At least, it gave her the time to think of what occurred to her since the last previous days. And given she still had a couple of hours of walking before she reaches her destination, she reminds herself of what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u><i>Flashback, three days earlier:</i></u></b><br>\r\nOnyx was training up herself, targeting trees, to a fault of having proper sparring partners. She tears the trunk of a tree, before she slams it, causing it to fall with a loud succession of cracking sounds. Then she peers behind her, feeling a familiar presence, the man in cloak. 'How's my lovely piece of jewelry doing?'. She growls. 'How often do i need to tell you to call me by my name!?'. 'No idea, cutie.~'. The man grins and add, 'How's the dragoness?'. 'Heavy.'. 'If it's from yo..'. 'No. Not that. It's that forced inactivity that weights me down. I feel like i'm gonna root anytime!'. 'Heh. I know the feel.'. 'When would i-..!?'. 'I have a mission for you. Should be easy..'. 'How easy is easy?'. 'Actually, i don't know for sure.. Something's wrong..'., he sighs, 'Ahem.. Your mission is to investigate the mine of Ferrhills. It has been raided by Regef Cinderstar, a noble human, with a troop of 40 soldiers from what i gathered.'. 'Why me, then. People would just run away an-..!'.The man stops her away with a movement of his hand. 'The noble's an idiot. When he was young, he was a promising strategist-to-be. But then, his father had an accident and the boy's education had gotten.. Lax. Afterwise, he's been known to to get a liking in the pleasure of flesh. Not a matter i'd dwell in, so don't ask. But give' that his father had died before he got to know it, and that her mother had left them, he got his hands onto the family's fortune. As time went on, he got more greedy and daring, eventually recruiting mercenaries to force people to act the way he wants. To a poor avail, given his fortune eventually melted away, forcing him to flee. Last i know, he barely had anything to sustain himself. He couldn't even pay up for a weapon, let alone a small army of mercenaries!'. 'What about it.'. 'As you can tell, someone is probably pulling the strings from behind. But i couldn't tell who, nor why. That's when you come in. Being unknown to the population, and being a dragon, i believe it'd make you able to it. Just.. Consider it as a test, okay? Just.. Don't overdo it if it gets too dangerous..'. 'Hrmf.'. 'Just a few things.. I disallow you from flying to Ferrhills. Also, if you can be helped, don't harm anyone.'. 'Why.'. 'The goal is to free the mine, and eventually giving you a good reputation. You could even get some good armor out of it!'. The dragoness grumbles, then says, 'Fine. Count me in..'. 'Perfect! Now, let's handle the preparations, shall we?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness snaps off of her mind as she hears yelling from further on the road. A caravan, composed of a merchant, a young lass and four mercenaries, protecting a chariot, lead by two horses, are circled and surrounded by a group of bandits. And while most of them are merely swordsmen in leather armor, two of them are actually mounting horses, and their seemingly leader, from what she can see, is the only one covered in heavy armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the bandits speaks, 'You know that the mine is under the rule of our chief. Since then, all that pass by must pay the passage. If you don't pay up, we might.. Need to be more persuasive. Ain't that right, boys!?'. Some of the bandits laughs. The merchant replies, 'But we need that money..!'. 'Oh yeah? Then why are you heading to Ferrhills, then? Surely you could spare some means.~'. The merchant tsks and one of the mercenaries grunts. The leader grins, 'Uncooperative? Fine by me. EVERYONE ATTACKS!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness leap off her position, rushing at the bandits, yelling, out of anger, 'DON'T YOU DARE!'. She swings one of her paw at their leader, throwing him away, before trying to slow herself by sliding on the dirt road, bumping and sending sprawling three more bandits away, using her momentum to swing her tail at a fourth bandit, breaking up his sword, and wounding him at the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the ruckus the dragoness made, the horses tries to flee. The one attached to the chariot makes their way away from the dragoness, forcing the bandits to step aside. One of the mounted bandit get tossed away, his mount fleeing toward the nearby forest, while the other one flee the opposite way of the chariot. The bandits takes steps away from the new enemy while the mercenaries back up toward the chariot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness positions herself between the mercenaries and the bandits, then roars up, making the bandits scurry off. Then, she turns on herself to check up on the mercenaries. They points their weapon at her, cautiously walking backward. One of them speaks up, scared, 'B-back away.. F-foul beast..!'. The dragoness sighs, 'That's how you thank your savior?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenaries blinks, then looks at each others, before lowering their weapons. 'You're.. Not going to harm us?'. The dragoness shakes her head. 'Are you going to Ferrhills?'. 'Yes. Would you... Join us until we are at town?'. 'Sure.'. 'Just.. Don't try to scare the horses again.'. The dragoness grumbles, 'I'll try..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chariot, thankfully, didn't went far, given the merchant and the young lass managed to keep the horses <i>*somewhat in check*</i>, given they probably had their fear of their life. After some rough explanations and after calming down the horses <i>*again*</i>, they manage to reach the town by sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few words of thanking and some good hints, the merchant gives the dragoness a large leather satchel, helping her to wear it. Then they leave a bit of money in it, and as the caravan goes to a nearby inn, the dragoness tries to make her way to the 'Wrought-Iron Tavern'. She had to meet someone by there, which would supposedly help her, but given she couldn't just enter, nor damaging the building away, she had to wait outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the sounds came from the tavern itself, and given she wasn't quite blocking the pathway to it, she would mostly.. Be unnoticed. Or rather, wouldn't make too much of a ruckus, surprisingly. Until she hears a voice from a male human. 'He said she should be here now.. Meet a tall being with an onyx pendant.. You would not be able to miss her, he said...'. You hear a sigh, then the man speaks again, 'I really hope she'd be able to.. Wuaaaaaaah!'. You spot the man, as he falls down onto the ground, deperately trying to back up, seemingly from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is 30-something years, 5'6\", wearing a dark green cotton tunic, attached by a leather belt, leather pants and boots, and have somewhat short and not quite kept black hair. Having heard what he said, the dragoness cautiously approachs the shivering man, making sure he'd see the pendant. He stutters, 'W-wait.. Y-you're the one s-supposed to h-help us..!?'. 'Yeah. So what!?'. 'S-sorry. J-just that i'm.. S-scared of you.. Y-you're a skeleton!'. She growls, 'I'm a dragoness. Not a pile of bone!'. The man meeps, 'S-sorry! E-err.. O-onyx is it?'. 'Yes.'. 'M-meet me up outside the town.. W-we'll speak of what need to do for tomorrow..'. 'Why not for today?'. 'B-because it's going to be night time and that you should rest a bit..'. The dragoness grumbles but agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting up where she would have more place to move, they speak up and organise what they'd do, eventually parting ways for the time being, as the dragoness places herself somewhere to rest until the sun would rise, wondering if it's a good idea to trust such a wimpy man..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragoness stood there, in the outskirts of the town, patiently waiting, given she couldn't sleep anymore, eventually growling at whoever dared getting too near her belongings.<br>\r\nEventually, the night let place lazily to the day, as the sun start to be visible, leaving the dragoness with a sentiment of sadness at the sight of the dawn, until she silently moves out, heading straight to the mine. Even if it was mostly used for ferrous materials, small amounts of gold and a few, albeit small, pieces of jewelry, never of great quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meets up with the man that she saw last time, and given they had some time before Regef actually goes in the mine, the man tell the dragoness of some of the happenings in town:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Regef, aware of the luxury potentially found, and being rather untrusting, regularly pays visits to the mine so he get his hands onto the valued findings. The main problems being that he visit the mine too often for what it offers, and, sometimes, remains in it for hours. Some attempts of understanding what was going on in there, albeit rare given the situation of the country, had been setted up. All failed. The most promising had been from an elf adventurer. He tried to chase the man down with one of the miners. The mine had been never heard of again, while the elf, certainly prideful of his skills, had came out insane, screaming and severely wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf had fainted, just outside of the mine's entrance. We managed to move and to mend him, but when he woke up, he had a vicious grin, and yelled that we'd all die, before laughing in a maniacal manner. He then lunged at someone, to choke him! And despite his seemingly frail frame, he had an inhuman strength. So much we had to knock him off with a heavy log.. After that, we tied him up and left him there, trying to know what we should do. A few hours later, he had been sighted fleeing the town by some, while some others implied he went straight for the mine. All that he left was the rope that was actually holding up, torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferably, i would let you go inside alone, but then you would get lost.. S-so, i-i'll be joining you inside..'. The dragoness grumbles, 'And why would i-..'. She momentarily peer inside the cave leading to the mine. She complains, 'I can't see anything in it!'. The man ignite up a torch, before he holds it and shows it to the dragoness. She adds, 'Why you in particular.'. 'Because i know the mine, and Because i'm probably t-the only one that would help you and guide you around..'. 'Fair point..'. 'I'm Jason, by the way. N-nice to meet you, Onyx.'. '..Stay near me, Jason.'. 'O-okay..!'. Both walks into the mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason skillfully travels through the labyrinth that is the mine, at times in galleries being hand-made, sometimes leading in natural caves. Not that it stopped Onyx from complaining, 'Why is it so tight.. I can barely move..!'. The man laughs softly, 'Generally, the mine is used by humans. It wasn't meant for.. Uh.. F-for.. Powerful beings like you..!'. 'What's that supposed to mean?'. 'Nothing!'. The dragoness could tell that the human is acting strange, but she couldn't tell that Jason was actually blushing. Either way, Jason lits up another torch in the mine, making the dragoness ask, 'Why are you only igniting a part of the torches? Aren't you scared of getting up spotted?'. 'Not much of a choice.. Without light, we can't get anywhere. Besides.. If they come from behind, you have your tail, no? And if we have to flee, we can follow the trail of light..'. 'Why would i flee!?'. 'I'm no fighter, and you can hardly move.'. 'Fair point.. I hate to admit th-.. Wait, what's there?'. The dragoness points to a gallery to the left. 'There? Nothing. No minerals had been found this way, so they disregarded it.'. 'But there's <i>*something*</i>. Give me a torch. Place it in my maw.'. She opens her mouth up, and Jason places \u00e0 lit torch in it. The dragoness adds, 'If i'm not back in ten minutes, flee.'. 'W-why?'. 'Something reeks. And i don't want to endanger you..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reachs the end of the gallery and idly places a paw onto the rocky wall. Nothing seemed wrong, but corruption could be felt behind it. She starts to store up energy in her maw, when she remembers what she said. She decides to dissipate it, thankfully keeping the torch lit. And, to a fault of telling her presence, she could at least hide her breathing prowlesses. She takes a step back and swing a paw at the wall. Surprisingly, her claws went though like butter, revealing a enlightened passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast it is some sort of hallway, large enough for her to move with less troubles than inside the galleries. A man stands in the end of the hallway. He speaks up, 'Another intruder!? This'll be fun! Last one was thin. But heck he packed!'. He goes into a crazed laughter. The man turns up so he faces up the dragoness. It is a noble human, 5 ft 5 inches tall, a protubering stache and a creepy grin that seemed to stretch up to its ears. When he spots the dragoness, his grin disappears, his eyes widens sensibly and he lowers his head slightly. She smirks and adds, 'Oh my. You're big! Doesn't matter!'. He draws a rapier and charges the dragoness up, grinning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it would be child's play for the dragoness, given the human wouldn't even normally bent her bones with such a thin sword, but her instincts told her to actually be careful. The man attempt to swiftly stab the dragoness, but she dodges by jumping over him, using that moment to swing her tail at him. A heavy metallic sound could be heard soon after. <br>\r\nA peek at the dragoness' tail explains why: One of the blade is missing, cleanly cut. She tsks and takes a step backward after she landed up, feeling suddenly trapped.<br>\r\nThe man cackles insanely, deviously blocking the way from where she came from. He sings, 'Breaking you will be.. So..  FUN!~'. He lowers his rapier so the tip of it touches the ground, running it on the ground with a metallic sound, obnoxiously moving slowly. As the man advances up, Onyx backs up, until a voice could be heard, 'DON'T YOU DARE!.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man appears, moving behind the noble, before he violently swings a burning torch, successfully knocking him off. Then, he kicks the rapier off, drops the torch down and rushes toward Onyx, adding, 'Oh, Onyx, you're alright..!'. 'What are you doing here!?'. 'S-sorry, but i just couldn't be helped..'. The man hugs one of the dragoness' fore leg, crying. It was Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness whispers, 'Move.'. 'Why would i..'. The dragoness grits her teeth, as the man starts to wake up, 'Seriously Jason.. Move..!'. 'Wh-..?'. 'Sorry, little man.'. As the noble stands up again, and rushes at the dragoness, yelling, 'DIE!', the dragoness push Jason aside and stabs the noble, her claws piercing through his body, before he falls down, dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the shock of both, the corpse stands up again, but rather than to attack, it bends backward in an inhuman angle, before a black mist pours off its mouth. Two eyes appears as a voice, seemingly coming from everywhere, speaks up, 'WHO DARED TO-..! Oh. I seeeee.~ Tell your master he'll never defeat me! Heh heh heh..'. The black mist disappears, and the corpse eventually falls down heavily onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbling sounds could be heard as dust falls down from the roof, causing Jason to scurry off to the gallery they came from. Then, he yells, 'HURRY ONYX! THE PLACE IS GONNA GET DESTROYED!'. 'But i need to-..!'. 'NOW!'. Loud crashing sounds followed by falling rocks can be heard and seen in the hallway, forcing Onyx to follow Jason. The man had taken some advance, but, thankfully, the dragoness could follow up the trail, as he said, even if it was done with unwanted charges into some of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Onyx reachs up a natural cave in time, as the gallery she was in just crumbles away, pouring away a large cloud of dust. As the dust falls down, she notices that Jason had made it too. He says, 'Thank god. You made it too..'. 'What was <i>*that*</i>? 'I'm not sure.. But we should speak of it, later. Outside..'. 'Yeah..'. Both silently makes their way out, until they are outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey greeted by a harsh light, coming from the sun, but not fully concealing the crowd that stood around the entrance. Miners, inhabitants and guards were part of it, with more soldiers standing, somewhat away from the crowd. Whispers and voices goes in the crowd, when one of them yell, 'Monster!'. Jason rushes in front of them, extending his arms onto his sides, placing himself to protect the dragoness. 'She's with me! She was here to help us.. And she killed Regef Cinderstar!'. The soldiers that were standing besides started to back up, visibly scared, while the crowd watched them. One of the miners asks, 'What happened?'. Jason answers, 'We went it, following Regef. We found a secret gallery in it, and.. After he died, black mist poured from him. And a landslide occurred..'. 'What tells us she's not controlling you!?'. 'She's with him.'. A silent felt onto the crowd, before they yelled, against the soldiers. 'Go away! Never go in our town again!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them scurried off, except one. He's a towering human of 6 ft 2, wearing a heavy chest plate,  leather skin on his chest, and leather pants. His body is pretty muscular, especially visible with his nude arms, and carries a large two-handed longsword. He smirks. 'Ugly hairface is dead? That's good.'. One of the townfolk comments, 'But he recruited you, no?'. 'Yeah. But i didn't liked him. Only joined 'cause i needed money. 'sides.. Did i harmed you?'. 'Well.. No..'. He moves up, standing in front of Onyx, 'Accept that i put my sword at your service, great bone dragoness.'. Onyx snarls, 'Call me, Onyx, ya will!?'. 'Sure would. 'Onyx'.'. The dragoness grumbles. Then Jason asks, 'Onyx..? Can you approach..?'. 'Sure..'. She executes and.. Get kissed by him! She takes a few steps off, confused. Then, the muscular man says, laughing, 'By the way, i'm Klaus 'Bearskin', lucky jewel!'. 'Shush you want!?'.</span></div></div>",

The townfolks accepted to help her, forging specifically for her wings and legs additional pieces of armor, fitting her. They would've also offered a moneyed reward, but given that they lost a part of the mine, and due to the bad reputation that Ferrhills had gotten, thanks to Regef, they preferred to keep it to restore the town's prosperity. Instead, they offered some ferrous minerals, as well as a refined steel ingot. Onyx would've preferred Jewels over mere metals, but accepts nevertheless, feeling she could make good use of it some day, and not wanting to make them feel bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was alone, Onyx would've simply left by night, not wanting to stay for too long, as what she saw in the mine bothered her. But given she'd travel with Klaus 'Bearskin', she helped him gathering provisions for the oncoming days. <br>\r\nThe only problem being that Onyx has no intent of lowering herself to the level of a horse by transporting anything else but her own belongings. Thankfully, one of the horses, that she scared when she met the bandits, had made its way back to Ferrhills. Attached to its saddle is two large leather bags, probably meant for transporting loot. But they were empty, aside from two bronze knifes, a small amount of money and a pair of leather gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard part with the horse wasn't to persuade the horse to follow Klaus, nor to charge it up with the provisions, but to calm it down, so it would tolerate Onyx. After all, after trying to retain the horse, it kicked the dragoness, causing her to yell up, 'Stupid beast! Do that again and you'll never see the light of the sun again!', making Klaus laughs. Onyx then commented, 'It's going to be a long travel..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx remained outside the town for the night, while Klaus passed the night in an inn. As the day rises up, Klaus meets back up with the dragoness, followed by the horse, soon joined up by Jason. Klaus says, 'How's the lover doing?', making Onyx growls and Jason blushes. Jason then replies, 'I'm just asking Onyx to stay..'. She says, 'I can't. I need answers.'. Jason sighs, 'If only i knew more about it..'. Onyx adds, 'You could join me.'. Klaus complains, 'But he'd slows us!'. 'I'm the one in charge, there!'. 'Tsk! Fine..'. Jason smiles, I'd want to, but i can't. I need to stay. They need my help. And to guide for the incoming investigation.'. 'Oh.. Right. Then i promise you that i will meet you again!'. Klaus smirks, 'Two little loving birds. So cute.~'. She growls again, 'Shush, you want!?'. 'We should get going, tho.'. She sighs, 'Yeah.. Let's go.. Until next time, little man!'. Jason says, 'Until next time, Onyx..'. Klaus adds, 'Toughen up, man!'. 'I-i'll try..'. He turns around and scratches his head, blushing. Onyx whispers to Klaus, 'You're an oddball.', then waves up to Jason and moves out, followed by Klaus. He whispers back, 'You're no better.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the town is out of sight, Onyx asks, 'Why did you wanted to join me?'. 'Rumors of that order. Wasn't the first time i heard of it. But i didn't believed it till yesterday.'. 'So.. If you joined me, it wasn't for what i am?'. 'Nope.'. 'Why, then?'. 'Curiosity. If beings like you are part of it..'. 'How did you knew.'. 'You have no idea of the amount of information you can get with a good beer at a tavern.'. 'You could've tempted your luck alone. I'm not forcing you.'. 'It gives me better odds to meet your master.'. 'I'm not under the rule of anyone.'. 'Heh. Even then, you are seeking him up.' 'I need answers. And help getting by..'. 'Eh?'. 'Bah. Let's say i've went through a.. Jarring transformation. Don't ask the details. I don't trust you enough for that.'. 'Oh.. Fair enough. But then, after we meet with this man, i'll decide whenever i stay with you. That's also fair, no?'. She sighs, 'Fine.. I accept. But know that he might not want to see you.'. 'Oh yeah? Why.'. 'There's more than meet the eye, about him.'. 'Heh. We meet back to him and i'll adapt then.'.  'Yeah.'.</span></div></div>",

Raid a crypt and you risk triggering ancient enchantments to ravage the flesh and minds of intruders. Crossing a Goblin and his cursed blade is likely to see you become a part of his collection. Lose a fight with an Orc and expect to be reduced to a sliver of your former self, while straying into Elven woodland could forfeit your humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Note from author: Since I rather wrote myself into a corner with the previous wizard-focused version, I've decided to make this one as expansive as possible.
