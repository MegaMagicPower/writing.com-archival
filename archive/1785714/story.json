I had to shake my head, since she is a witch, and probably used magic to cheat her way though it. \"Melanie, some of us don't have powers....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't cheat!\" she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. Mel can get so defensive at times. She is probably right; her powers are extremely unstable, even after using them for 8 months. She'd conjure up clothes for herself, and find they're boys' clothes, or she'd crave icecream, and litterally get that, ice and cream. \"Yeah, you're right. You're probably conjure up a <i>fail</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming to the mall with me for that, miss smartmouth\" she said. Its not the first time she's said that, though thanks to her unstable powers, she usually regretted it quickly. After all, I most of the time, I didn't end up as the teen girl she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. Got this assignment\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life in the middle ages to early industrial revolution....\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that....\" Mel giggled as she rushed off upstairs. She returned with a book in her hands. First I was afraid it was her magic book, but it was something worse. The book was tittled <i>The reluctant princess</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No No NO!\" I scremed. I had encountered that book before. Eight months ago, eml's mom showed myher son, and my best friend, John, that magic was real by first turning his clothes into fairytale princess attire, then sending him into this fairytale type world. He was given a few wishes to help him (or her) adjust, and of course she wanted help. That help was me. She the book as also being read to her princess loving little sister, Hannah, I took a liking to turn John into a Cinderella like character, both to annoy him and to lighten my own mood since I was turned into a girl too.. He'd been looking for ways to pay me back since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, the book adjusts for the witch who reads it. Since its for me, its going to be more adult this time\" Mel said seriously, as she cast her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie...\" I screamed, as a blacked out.</span></div></div>",

If she can teleport me somewhere, or worse, send me into that accursed book, what else could she do? Her powers made unstable seem a good thing. Quickly I placed me hands to my chest, and much to my relief, it felt as flat as always. Just to make sure, and since i didn't want anyone seeing me (I forgot nobody was around) I quickly pulled some hair from my head. It was brown, a good sign since I had discovered if someone changed me into a girl, my hair changes color to rosewood. Something to do with my genetics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Melanie. You've had your fun. Now get me back home. I've got too much homework to play magic games\" I shouted. Of course there was no answer, so after a few minutes, i walked down to the beach. <i>Why would I end on the coast?</i> I thought as I walked along. It gave me some time to think. <i>She did say the book adjusts for the witch reading it, and she would know I'm pissed. Maybe she'd get Hayley to help</i>. Hayley was her older sister and much more experienced with magic. <i>Of course John could help, if they change him. And Hannah....</i> She was the youngest of the Harrison witches, and a fanatic when it came to princesses and all that girly stuff. Her favorite was Cinderella, mainly due to her shared hair color, as John found out to his misfortune, and own genetic makeup. but she knew plently of other princesses too. Then the most horrifying thought entered my mind.<br>\r\n<i>The little mermaid had red hair....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly I</span></div></div>",

Before I knew it, all my clothes began to dissolve into nothingness, leaving me completely naked. Even though nobody was in sight, I covered my manhood mainly due to reflex. Even if I was thinking, I'd have the same reaction since Mel said the story would tailor itself to the reader meant someone adolesent was reading this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie. I'm going to kill you\" I growled, wondering what to do. I knew not to dive into the water, just in case my mermaid fears were correct. While i knew this was impossible in the real world, in this world the  magical restriction on keeping me fully human did not apply. Still, I couldn't stay there all day with only my hands covering me. i needed a plan. It proved irrelevent. As soon as i stood up, I felt my manhood shrink away, leaving only a feminine looking crotch. And with that change, the rest of me quickly followed. i gasped, as i felt my chest begin to itch, and my nipples spread out. within a minute, the tell tale signs of my new breasts began to appear, as they began to push out. My focus was on them, so i didn't notice my hips and ass where doing the same as my waist contracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. these are nearly as big as John's\" i said softly, thinking of when he was turned into a princess. Now that i was turned, or mostly turned into a girl, i feel more resigned. if i was going to be a hot looking girl for a while, I was going find something enjoyable. And I knew the perfect thing. mel could be somewhat jealous, and I knew she would be somewhat put out that i had become a hotter girl than her. especially since I was hotter than the last time I found myself female. \"Mel. I know you're the reading this! how do you like the fact i'm a hotter chick than you? No answer? you know what to do! Change change me back and we can forget this ever happened...\" i flicked my flowing rosewood hair, to prove my point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. i knew that i was in a seriously bad situation. if I was in a fantesy world resembling my own, its best not to be a naked beauty on a beach. I'd end up pregnant before i could scream 'stop'. I looked down and screamed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!' I yelled, seeing that my legs had started to turn green. \"crap. Crap Crap. i didn't have to be in water!\" i looked around as the green discoloration crept up my legs until it hit my waist, where it stopped. that wasn't the only change, since another discoloration happened over my breasts. this time purple. 'Crap, I really am turning into her....\" I moaned, just before I fainted.</span></div></div>",

Plus I knew something from history, despite Mel''s warping of it. I immediately stormed to the vanity to get my corset (which was under my gown) off. \"Damn that witch! Does she have any idea how it feels to wear that thing?\" Once relieved of it, I felt better. \"Okay, I'm stuck here for a while.

The problem is that my bratty seven year old cousin, Hannah, is a witch and she is after payback; okay, the <i>real</i> problem is all my female relatives on my mommy's side of the family are witches. It isn't my fault that I find it funny smashing a water balloon over Hannah's, or in fact any other girl's head. Its for their own good. Its not like us boys are going to cry off to mommy if we get wet. I just wish they'd toughen up.... Hannah of course, sees it differently. She thinks I'm gross. Yeah right. She's the gross one! Anyway, haven't smashed a water balloon over her head in months, especially since she threatened to smash a balloon over <i>my</i> head, and concidering those freaky powers of hers.... I really don't want to be in the same room with her, even during school, but mommy told me that I'd be going to Hannah's house after school for a <i>month</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mud magnet!\" I taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slime head!\" Hannah retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oatmeal brain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess\" a third voice said.

Plus Hannah is a princess freak, especially for any princess that is blond, like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" I said, wondering what I was thinking to go anywhere near her room. Surely failing art class is better than getting turned into a girl by me deranged cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd look cute\" Erin urged, as Hannah reached for a book on her vanity.

SHe's been acting weird since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in the mirror and got the shock of my life; a 11 year old girl was standing where I'm supposed to be. Instantly a feminine scream escaped my lips, and it wasn't long before mom stepped into my doorway, looking pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm mom. What happened to me?\" I stammered, seeing she was not surprised to see me like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a witch Jacintha, and I turned you into a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? change me back. How long will I have to be like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is you. You're a girl now. For life. And you're going to be a witch. Just like me.\"</span></div></div>",

Third, I do not want to be a witch if magic is all about forcing others to be who they are not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed heavily, my anger mostly spent as mom looked at me patiently. \"First, the change is permanent, I can not change you back, even if I wanted to.\" she said, softly. \"Second, as queen of this land, I have <i>every</i> right and making you the future queen ruler of this land is hardly abuse. Third, boys can not work magic, only girls can. That said, you now have the power to protect your little brother, once you learn magic... my princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a step back, alarmed and confused. \"Since when did you become the queen of anything?\" I asked, worried about mom's mental state. Sure, changing me into a girl proved that she was a witch but queen!? \"Also, what do you mean by calling me 'little princess'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled and pointed out the window. Curious, I peered out and nearly screamed as my once two story house in the suburbs had somehow become a massive castle in a valley somewhere I didn't recognize. Shaken, I turned back to mom. \"What!?... How!?... Why!?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice was becoming more and more high pitched with my panic as mom gently took me into her arms as I then began to sob on her shoulder. \"There, there, my princess.\" she cooed. \"Let it all out. Your girl training will begin once your tears go dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long while before my tears dried up and mom immediately began my 'girl training.' Unknown to me, I was inside a story book with mom reading the story as it progressed to her design. Standing next to the desk where mom was reading was Elvira Strange, the head witch who seemed very unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that, if a daughter emerges from that book in one month's time, you would have permanently changed your son's gender by force.\" said Elvira. \"That is highly frowned upon under witch law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize the risks involved, madam head witch.\" said mom, softly. \"It's my responsibility, either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira drew in close, causing mom to shiver with fright. \"I just hope the risk you are taking with your son's life is worth the reward you are seeking.\" she said, whispering, before vanishing from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom swallowed hard then turned back to the book to see that your first girl lesson was in....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Failure to please them will result in you being a girl forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what is the third condition?\" you asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The third condition is the hardest, solve the mystery of the reluctant princess.\" explained the queen. \"One of my daughters will go missing, you have to will take her place and try to solve who had kidnapped her and why.\" she then gave you a sad look. \"If you fail to solve the mystery within thirty days, you will return home a girl in body and mind forever, Mike Cutie will die and Michelle Cutie will take his place....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must chose quickly.\" added the eldest daughter. \"If not, we will be forced to chose for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your heart pounding in your throat as the queen and the three princesses waited for your answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't say such things with that pendant still around your neck.\" you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla looked at the pendant and screamed as she saw her breasts grow slightly more. \"Curse this thing!\" she snapped. she screamed again as she felt her hair kiss her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd just play along if you don't want to leave this a girl for life.\" you said. \"I was given a choice as to what role to play, not that I wanted to play any of them.\"  you winced, not wanting to hurt anyone, hen added, \"Queen mum told me that, if I did not chose, she'd have to chose for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla was silent for a moment. \"So, we're all trapped in here, so to speak.\" she said. \"Maybe together, we can find a way out this crazy storybook and hide it so no one else will get trapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I sort of have to behave too.\" you said. \"Otherwise, my fate will be the same as yours, a girl for life.\" you shuddered at the thought. \"I like girls but I really don't want to be one forever, its not worth the risk.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to hide your smile; it must be killing her not to snarl, or throw an insult at you, or any girl. \"Anything that isn't too frilly, or revealing\" you say. You look over and watch her walk to the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I don't think anything here is your style\" Karla says. She picks up one dress and says, \"Too puffy\", followed by \"Too pink\", then \"Too girly\" You sigh, she is terrified of that thing around her neck. \"I need to look my best. Remember who's book this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little <i>witch</i>\" Karla says. Neither she or yourself notice the pendant glow slightly, but the only change is a slight lengthening of her hair. \"I just need to look 'my best'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got just the thing\" Karla says, passing you a gown that fits all three of her earlier complants. You frown, increasing as Karla asks, \"Do I have to dress you, princess Shelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like that thought. \"No, I can manage\" you say, as you grit your teeth, remove your clothes, and slide the dress onto your body.
