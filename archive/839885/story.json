You went to bed after a party and awoke to find yourself floating through... what looks like website after website, flying past you at incredible speeds!  You're in the internet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a woman's voice breaks your awe.  The soft voice sounds comforting, soothing.  \"Hello.\" it says, \"My name is Radia.  You have been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen?\" you ask, confused, \"Chosen for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have watched the lives of the chosen for aeons, my child.\" it speaks warmly, like a mother to her own child, \"But only you have been called and chosen to save the Digital World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Digital World?\" you blink, \"You mean... like from Digimon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" Radia says, \"The Digital World in your television show is connected to every and all universes in existence.  In that sense, your television show is reality, the core of existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEFINATELY one hell of a cocktail.  You shake your head, \"So... everything there is REAL?  It's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense.\" Radia replies, \"However, there is a problem.  Ken Ichijouji never released power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is still the Digimon Emperor, past the time when, in the show, he was supposed to have relinquished said power.  Now he fights even harder to destroy the DigiDestined and completely rule the Digital World, and beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And beyond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadia sighs softly, \"He knows that he who controls the Digital World controls existence.  Once he would take over the Digital World, he would expand his empire to every other universe there is -- your own included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're getting worried and even more intrigued, \"And the DigiDestined are still fighting to keep him from taking over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  However... both sides have started to up the ante.  The fighting has become even more fierce than you would have ever thought possible on the show.  More and more kids are being brought into this conflict... and more and more of them die.  While many of the children fight on the side of the DigiDestined Resistance, the Emperor even has his own group, called the Dark DigiDestined, that serve him unquestioningly.  There are some yet that choose neither side...\" she hesitates, \"...however, they are hated by both sides for their refusal to join their group, and many are killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, somewhat overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you now...\" she continues, \"It does not matter which side you are on.  The fighting in the Digital World has become so bad that the world has threatened to destroy itself.  And without the Digital World... the core of existence will be destroyed.  In other words, if the Digital World is destroyed, existence, as we know it, would... CEASE to exist!  We'll ALL be destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver, the idea of such frightening you half to death.  Now, you know how serious this is.  You pinch yourself.  Twice.  Three times.  Before you get get to the fourth, you hear Radia say, \"This isn't a dream, young one... this is reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what can I do!?\" you exclaim, \"I'm just a kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is just a kid, child... you have the abilities... and I will give you the rest of what you need to succeed in your task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What IS my task?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join the Digital Empire.  Join the DigiDestined Resistance.  Join neither, and go alone.  You MUST stop this fighting before it's too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe websites stop flashing past and everything goes dark.  When light reappears again, you're standing in a small chamber, like an elevator.  Before you is a small panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be watching you, child.\" Radia's voice echoes into your mind, \"Choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the panel before you.  Words flash across the screen:<br>\r\nCHOOSE YOUR DESTINY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first choice: which side will you join?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The image of your new \"master\" faded from view as the room sank into utter darkness. This silence gave you a moment to put everything in perspective. Assuming this was not all some sort of warped dream, you were being dragged into a struggle for reality itself; what you had thought was a TV show was infact the core of all universes. But this raised a diffrent question; if the show was wrong, did the creators mistake the reality of the situation, or did something infact alter history, preventing Ken's redemption? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your knowledge of the series you were able to form a quick list of \"likely suspects\" that could have something to do with it. Because Ken was still in power, assumedly Myotismon was still in spirit form; interfering with Ken's objectives was not in his favor. Your attempts at rationalizing these events were pushed aside as the lights around you began to reappear, and the transportation sequence started. For an instant light flooded your vision, and then as quickly as it had appeared it was gone once again. However you now stood in a new area, you recognized it as the exterior of the floating base which Ken had used for his stronghold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large door before you was open, it seemed Ken expected his soldiers to at the very least be capable of finding the way to him on their own. As you started towards the door you realized that you now wore new clothing, obviously the uniform of the Dark Digidestined. From your belt hung a rather fancy looking sword, however a mere glance could tell you it was far from simply decorative. A cold wind blew across the fortress due to it's altitude, making it rather uncomfortable outside, and staying in it did not seem a wise choice. You did have a few moments to let the reality of your new purpose to sink in however. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thought of staying out in the wind is unpleasant, however making Ken wait is probably even less wise for your health. The large door in the side of the rocklike structure suddenly begins to shift, it's obvious that the Emperor is not happy with your stalling. You break into a run as the door begins to drop, however it is slow moving and you make it in with time to spare. The door seals shut a few moments later, leaving you in the darkness of Ken's stronghold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot much remember the layout of his fortress from the show, though it would not likely be a large help in three dimensions, and you are forced to find your way through the complex's tunnels. Thankfully you find it relativly straightforward, there are only two major intersections, and at both going straight seems to lead further towards the center of the building. A large steel door marks the end of the hallway you had followed, and as you approuch it begins to creak open. The sound is truly chilling, however what you see next wipes the fear from your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy from before is at the end of the room, standing atop a large pedistal. Beneath him is a large group of children around your own age, all wearing the same uniforms, and many digimon. As you slip past the steel door Ken turns on his platform to give you a look. \"Well, I thought you might never make it. Now that everyone is here...\" As the Emperor spoke, the door behind you slammed shut of it's own accord, sealing you into the dark chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can begin. I assume you gained at least a basic understanding of the situation we are in before you were transported here; we can move on. All too often the chosen are immature children who simply want to play hero, and immediatly sign up for the resistance. These people tend to be short lived, however they can also provide a problem at times. You are the largest group of Dark Digidestined yet to be chosen, and this can only be a sign that the ignorant are gradually being weeded out; you have all indeed made the smart choice.\" Ken paused for a moment, to let his statement sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that a thought entered your mind. Ken seemed to be unarmed, aside from two bodyguards nearby, and the other new recruits were likely in the same mental state as you. With your sword you could likely overpower Ken before his guards could reach you; and once the Emperor was dead the others would have no reason to assist the guards against you; you could very well take his place in one swoop. On the other hand this sort of orientation was obviously common, and Ken more than likely had survived a number of assasination attempts. He more than likely has some form of protection you do not know about.     </span></div></div>",

One of them, a tall boy with black hair covering his eyes, stops near the throne room's entrance, and slams his fist into part of the frame. It shudders, the opens up to reveal a lever which the kid promptly pulls. A loud and panicky alarm begins to sound. The boy then runs off, never once looking back.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nAll throughout the Dark Emperor's castle, the alarm rings loud and painful, clear as day, to all the Digimon under Ken's control. It rings with a message.<br>\r\nYour Emperor is dead. Avenge him.<br>\r\nAnd all throughout the castle, the Digimon begin to march towards the throne room, with one clear goal in their minds, thier CPU's and hardrives.<br>\r\nAvenge the Emperor.<br>\r\nAs they march, a Digimon breaks of from the group. HI-Andromon, his name is. He rasies his finger to where his ear would be, and presses down, before speaking. <br>\r\n\"The King is dead. Long live the king.\"<br>\r\nAnd the he returns to the Digimon marching to the throne room.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nAs the last of the Dark Digidestined falls to the ground, unconscious, you allow yourself a moments reprieve. The guards lay, code spilling out of them like blood. The kids that Ken intended to turn into his personal assult force are knocked out....they were just like you. Normal kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you aren't normal...not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what's wrong with you, but ever since you made your choice, you feel....different. Wrong. Like you aren't quite you...or right. (IS THIS THE SWORD'S DOING.....?)<br>\r\nThen you hear and feel it. The marching of a thousand terrible things. Ken's forces. How many Digimon had he enslaved that the show didn't recap or reveal?!<br>\r\nYou have two choices. Attempt to run, or stay and fight. Ether way...you may not make it out alive.</span></div></div>",

Once called File Island, it had been converted into a massive city-fortress that housed the small army of DigiDestined and Digimon that fought against Ken\u2019s unrelenting army. Morale was currently on the low. Why that was, was due to lack of progress in pushing Ken out of his seat. The current grip he had(or had, they didn\u2019t know that yet) on Sever was a big wide hold, and File Island was the only safe haven, as the retaken lands of Sever that the DigiDestined had were constantly under siege. And even then, File Island came under bombing runs now and then......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the main communication center, people sat, listening to the channels of war. Some listened with broken hearts of the Sever line, other listen to the communication channels of their own fortress, others made sure they weren\u2019t bugged while bugging Ken\u2019s lines.

He was less optimistic, the war having shattered his optimism long ago when it had shown him the horrors of it. Never the less, if it was true......something had to be done. He could either actvate the Mega Riser, which was their ace-in the hole, a field that could force their Digimon into the Mega Level, powered by Calumon, and then order for a full on assault on all fronts, which could leave their bases undefended if Hi-Andromon had be hacked and was lying, or allow Davis to take Magnadramon and blow a clear hole right through the enemy defences....last time they had done that, Ken\u2019s Dark DigiDestined had snapped back really hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While walking, you were watching hesitantly at your Digi-Transporter. Watching as Digimon, and the occasional human blip crossed your path, hiding from all. Suddenly, a rather large blip came, straight for you! Judging by its color (on the radar), it was a BIG Digimon. Ducking behind a nearby rock, you tried desperatly to figure out how to use your 'Powers'. You didn't even know how sharp your sword was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat blip was right on top of you, you'll have to wing it! Jumping out to face your opponent, you realized that it was none other than an Omnimon, one of the strongest of all digimon. It stopped, and landed right in front of you, crossing it's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soldier! Why aren't you at your post?\" It asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What post?\" You respond snyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean-?\" It asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!\" You yell as you strike, then dodge a punch. CRAP!! It didn't even scratch him! Well It was now or never, you were never going to get away, so it was a fight to the death. Wich for you, wasn't much at this point. You calculate, that one solid hit would end you. You dodge another punch, swinging and stabbing anything you could was your only option... that and not getting hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your sword glows a light blue. You could see the form of the sword change from a normal sword, to a skinnier, slightly curved form. Probably to adjust to its new strength. Omnimon was stunned at the newest development. You took this opportunity to attack, the sword struck and a scratch was made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The Omnimon was once again bewildered, as he took more and more attacks, he noted that your sword slowly sunk deeper and deeper into his thick armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having a blast, it was like a game, fight to level up so you could take on the boss. You felt more energetic, faster, and as you continued to attack, you felt stronger. The Omnimon was getting pissed, not getting a hit in, and taking continually increasing damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next slice drew blood! Not much but it was a start, you were in the clear. But something hit you, memory-wize. Digimon had Special attacks, that they could use freely. You looked up at you opponent, to find that it had charged Fire ball in his hands, it grew, and grew, and when you got over the shock, it was to late to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody ever Chooses, Neither! Because they all died!\" It yelled as he threw it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the sword out in front of you to block it. It closed in, and you prepared for the worst. The ball collided with your sword, and you pointlessly tried to push it back. To your surprise it was working, not to well, but it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know, some wind powers would really come in handy right about now!' You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind blows your hair, you look to see a wall of air pushing against the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't have been that easy!\" You yell, Angrily. You jump back, and try something else,<br>\r\n'Fire should erupt from my sword, slicing this ball in two, and hitting my opponent.'<br>\r\nA swirl of fire erupted from the hilt of the sword, engulfing it in flames. Swinging it, it slices right through the ball, and a scream was heard. The dust settled, you fell to you knee's, weakened. The strength was drained from your body, as you look at your enemy he was in the same boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...say we...call this... a draw?\" It asked in between gasps, \" neither of us can continue... this fight for much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw...\"You gasped, dropping your sword to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats your name?\" it asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me...\" Seeing as you were pretty sure that you would be here for a long time, you could think up an ailias to go by.<br>\r\n\"X!!!\" You say with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmnimon started to walk away but turned slightly, \"We will meet again...X!\" It yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the sword in it's newly shaped sheath, you stumbe over to a rock, laid down next to it, and tied a chain around the hilt, so you would wake up to intruders wanting to take it.</span></div></div>",

Both were laying on the ground, looking realy beat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly grabbing a cloak from a nearby clothes rack, you pull it over yourself. <br>\r\nOne of the dark Digimon was preparing the final swing, but you stopped it. Your sword seemed happy to be free from it's sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" One of them hissed.<br>\r\nSilently, you hacked away at them until the dissolved into the air.

Time is now resuming it's course and the digimon vanished quickly, the digimon on the ground paralyzed him with fear, for your blade was at it's throat.

We can always accept help in this crisis.\" He asked. You just crouch down to his level, pat him on the head.\"No, this battle i'am fighting alone, your side may not like that, but i'm not taking a side.\" You say happily.

A yellow fox appeared in the sky overhead shadowing your current point. You roll away taking out your sword and slowing time. A crack resounded from your sword as its flat side hits the yellow fox in the side of the head. Something farmilliar came out of the renamon's ear. A com system, and shes communicating with someone close by. Your answer came quickly as a gleem of light appeared from a nearby house. A reflection from a pair of binoculars. The Renamon was still dizzy from the blow and should remain that way for a little bit. You run toward the house trailing your lengthened sword like a ribbon. You fling the sword forward destroying the window instantly. The binoculars pulled back after having a sword flung at them as well as whoever carried them. You hopped through the destroyed window then realizing that the soles of your shoes were made out of metal. In the next room what could be considered human was at the front door trying to break it down. The sword regains its origional length with three clicking sounds. The girl was clad in jeans and a blue and white t-shirt. She had sunglasses and a pair of binoculars around her neck and had reddish hair. She heard your sword and spun around. She didnt speak at the sight before her. You had your sword pointed directly at her ready to strike. Renamon's footfalls could be heard outside. You spin behind the girl and place the blade at her throat. Renamon appeared and busted down the front door in a flurry of diamonds. The renamon was stunned at the sight of Rika being captive. Obviously the renamon will kill you if you hurt rika and she doesnt much care for your company either. You release the girl hoping to calm them both. You were knocked out by the Renamon.</span></div></div>",

Rika walks back to your chair releasing the restraints, you check your wrist for marking as you rub it over to cease the itching. The small boy pulls the trigger again, a lousy shot as it broke the glass hitting the wall across the room. You stride out of the room activating your time slowing ability reducing all but the renamon to a slow crawl. You ran toward the cliff blurring real life images. You were before the boy as your sword extended shearing off the scope hitting the boy's head with a thunk knocking him out instantly. The renamon comes out of nowhere ready to kill the boy when you whip the sword resounding on the renamon again. Rika came in preventing the angered Renamon from killing you both. \"Stop both of you, renamon hes knocked out cold as our recruit did, recruit only knocked him out without delivering the killing blow.\" she sighed looking over the three. \" I guess we could always tie him to a chair like we did you.\" she obviously liked this notion as a smile crept on her face.</span></div></div>",

You steady your aim and pull the trigger, the bullet shot out of the barrel and tore a rather large chunk out of the rock. \"Whoa this thing pack's a punch\" you say out loud after you holster your weapon and start walking again. After walking for a while you sit down for a break and open the sack to find food, bottled water, and some wood and flint. (Wood+Flint=fire for those of you who did not know that) After you light a fire you snack on some of the food that was in the sack and a bottle of water.

Without a moment to spare you burst from your cover, and yell\"get down\" at the slave who flung her self to the ground. As the spear flew past her head you take a shot at the group of evil digimon, one of them fell with a scream of pain, \"WERE UNDER ATTACK\" the group started yelling. \"So much for an easy fight\" you mutter as 10 more guard's came runing from all over. You shot the next two who came at you causeing the rest to duck and look for cover. \"Get over here\" you say to the female digimon, she looked up to you and smiled and began to crawl toward's you.

Most likely these were the remains of some old colledge or military sketches turned digimon. They had surrendered with only a few fires of your pistol. The girl that was with you ran off to a nearby shed marked storage. You hearded the automatons to a nearby cell and blew allt the locks off of the other cells. The girl returned with two guns, one around her back, a sniper rifle you whould guess, in front of her was what looked to be an assault rifle, an assault rifle she was throwing at you. You fumbled with the gun almost pulling the trigger. The other prisoners went to the shed to retrieve items taken by the warden upon capture. Rifles, shotguns, pistols, submachine guns, heavy suppression fire guns, bazookas, one kid even walked out with a chaingun. There were other items, swords, shields, axes, throwing knives, even what looked to be a magic wand! It was time for answers from the Automatons. You approached the cell door with a stern look and a menacing weapon, it was all you needed to get answers here, good ones. You gestured to a large male in the group, he appeared human except for his newest arm and leg. \"What are you doing out here?\" you say with a stern voice, gun trained on the cell your response wasnt by the large guy but by a female. The response was clear and needed no interperetation. \"Experimentation.\" Well....... It needed some explenation. \"What kind of expirements do you run in this slaughter house?\" Again the girl answered. She looked almost completely human, you could tell she wasnt by her voice. Her response was, \"For our savior, the Digital empire.\" Your next question whould halfto wait, an enemy signal had been fired. Across the field was an army of horifying beasts more chopped up than the automatons. This was the enemy, and he wants blood.</span></div></div>",

Somehow her gaze had calmed the fort all the digimon and humans looking up to her commanding look. She looks back over to....... you as does the entire fort's gaze. You seem to curl back as if their stares for help were looking for you to lead them, wich you were. You grunted at their stares replying by looking back over the wall to the enemies.

Some smaller digimon were going into the storage shed retrieving weaponry and digivices a a steady rate. Something was amiss, everyone wore different armors and you could even see the armours of the digital emporer, same armors a those who oppose this fort. You go up asking, \"Why are you attacking your own army?\" he simply replied by tearing the patch from his shoulder. It was all the answer needed. All the snipers and gunners took their position. the fort continued to wail, the enemy ranks stirred looking uneasy as the fort walls turned into a figurative giant battleship, snipers .50 caliber machine guns roosted here and there among the bricks. Left and right of the front gate were swordsmen and women with varying weapons ranging from basic swords to giant lances all ready for the charge. A few other humans and digimon reinforced the walls as the humans were strapped in armors similar to those of their digimon. The signal was given, the wall erupted with a wall of lead, the forward enemy lines had broken as the back lines moved forward, massive beasts appeared, their armor resisting the gunfire from the snipers as all other shells bounced off.They charged forward, massive hammers prepared for striking down the defenders. The melee fighters emerged from the gates brandishing weapons that glowed in the clearing clouds. The men with lances were out front, impaling the massive beasts holding them at bay whilst the swordsmen went to work on their armors. The wall opened fire again killing the weakened beasts as the swordsmen holding dual blades caused havic further in the enemy lines at a stunning pace. At the back of the group someting massive stood up towering over the rest like a monolith emmitting its own howl. Everyone seemed to be running towards the fortress now, the gunners resumed firing clearing enough for the fighters to come in and secure the front gate. The enemy lines were devastated leaving only the strongest all eyes locked on the massive beasts, especially the big one. The remanants of the army ran at the fortress except for the big one. He dislodged a sword that looked like a flattened bus sharpened to a point then melted with fifteen other buses. The gunners opened fire again getting through the damaged armor. The larger one emitted another howl hitting the wall with a glancing blow throwing his sword into the neabry dessert floor. He tugged hard trying to dislodge the blade. You saw the chance, you signal the swordsmen and assault gunners to climb the beast. Over the wall they slid down, the stupid beast didnt notice the sword was crawling with troops firing several hundred bullets into his arms as well as the swordsmen going at it with a hacking motion. The beast let out another scream as he pulled hard on the sword dislodging it from the sand, he had just noticed the crawling troops over his armor. The girl re-appears handing you a shell labeled, \"CAUTION, High Explosive shell\" she grabs your gun dropping the clip and ejecting the one round putting in the new bullet. She points to a weakened point of the giant's helmet before jumping back to her ledge shooting the smaller beasts with her rifle. The point was there with splattered paint bullet. The giant shook the smaller troops off, good because this shell was going to hurt. The giant looks toward you noticing you looking in his red eyes. He screamed lifting his blade ready to strike. you yell back, pulling the trigger. The gun seemed to take a second to fire the mysterious bullet. It rocketed out of the barrel screaming to the giant leaving a pale green smoke trail. The bullet hit tearing into the armor and further into the giant's skull. It screamed again dropping its monstrous blade gripping is head at the impact site. It kept screaming before being rocked by a huge explosion tearing a three-foot hole in the head. The beast stumbled backwards away from the fortress away from the waiting troops before falling into the dessert sand. The wind wipped the clouds away revealing the fortress glowing gold under the light.</span></div></div>",

He then said something that made your blood cold,\" its very rude to linger like that you know.\" As he turn around he seemed to vanish, and rematerialized right in front of you! You fell backward and rolled back down the dune. When you got back on your feet, there he was, smiling wickedley. \"I feel a sudden urge to, spread my WING'S\", he then reached behind his back, and pulled out a toy gun. \"Beezlemon, mode CHANGE!\", a flash of light then you saw that beezlemon, had wings and a large gun, where his right hand should have been. \"Beezlemon Blast Mode\", he then took to the skys and put his focus back on you. \"Corona destroyer\", as the energy wave rushed from his blaster and charged at you, you heard Radia's voice, 'block it, raise your magnum child quickley'. You raise your magnum not seeing the point, that is until you see the wave was  being stopped, by the gun! Then Radia's voice again, 'hurry now child push it back, quickly!' You pushed back as hard as you could, and to your relief and amazement, the wave flew back at a very surprised Beezlemon. You then saw a small explosion, when the smoke cleared, the Beezlemon was nowhere in sight. You smiled until, *ahem*, you turned around to see, the Beezlemon was right behind you! But, he was smiling as if he were, happy, like you had impressed him. \" Let me see the gun, now if you'd please\", he said holding out his  hand. You felt uneasy about disarming yourself, but then he frowned obviousley growing impatient. You surrendered your gun to him to him, he examined it and smiled again, he held the gun to where you saw a symbol, a bird glowing various colors. \"As I thought, you were brought here by, Radia a powerful spirit.\" You nod, your only move, but then you saw him, make a small gesture to take it back. You re-holstered your weapon, not taking your eye off him a moment. Beezlemon changed back to his normal form, and started walking west. \"You coming?\", he said looking over his shoulder. You struggled to run after him. \"Where are we going?\", you ask him. \"To a friend of mines place, she loves company and always starts cooking dinner around this time and always cooks a lot of food. I was on my way there anyway, I'm sure she'll be happy to set a place for you. But, remember this advice, always keep a smile, always compliment her, and her cooking. Never frown, and never insult her food. I once made a mistake like that, and I spent the best part of, the next 3 hours running around the desert, avoiding her. If she ask to kiss, hug, or to touch you, or your things, always say, 'that's fine', never say,'no'. If she chases you, for some reason, always run or hide, eithers good, never fight her. You will lose guaranteed, that gun won't help you, she is much stronger than I am.\" \"Scary thought\", you say. \"Yes it is, oh I just remembered I never got your name.\" \"Oh, right my name is, Gordon\", you tell him. \"Lame, while your here you may need a new, better name, I'll call you Rex.\", Beezlemon said. \"OK, speaking of names, your friend.

She has long red claws, and gold rings on her arms and tails. Her dark purple eyes turn to you with curiosity, then she shows a wide toothy smile. You can feel her soft gray fur, when she jumps on you. She starts licking you, and rubbing her head on your chest as she purrs. You try to look into her eyes, but they are covered by her long red hair. *ahem*. \"Beastmon, this is my friend Rex. He's a human of course, but Radia brought him here\", beezlemon said. Beastmon gasped, before she turned back to you with a much stronger sense of curiosity.\"So wait, does he have a digivice?\", she asked in a serious tone. Beezlemon shook his head, \"he chose to get a gun instead.\" Beastmon looked almost disappointed, but a timer going off seemed to interrupt her train of thought. \"Oh ya, wash your hands boys, dinnertime!\", Beastmon said smiling. As you and beezlemon washed your hands, you hear Beastmon handling her pots and pans to set her table. \"Is she always like this? So energetic?\", you ask beezlemon. Beezlemon just laughs, \"she's been worse.\" Beastmon's table was packed with food, it was hard to see all she made. Through the whole dinner, beastmon asked you question after question. After dinner was over, you and beezlemon helped with the dishes.\"Hey Rex\", beastmon asked you as you looked up. \"I understand that you and beezlemon are gonna save the digital world alone. So your gonna fight the empire, while not being in the resistance. That's dangerous so, could i come with you two?\", beastmon asked while watching her own feet. Beezlemon looked at you with a shocked look on his face, waving his hands erratically. You just say yes to her, beastmon is excited. Meanwhile, beezlemon is groaning in disbelief. When the three of you set off, beastmon is trying to keep beezlemon from hitting you. You're walking when the area starts to change, from desert to rocky terrain with some vegetation. You hear a massive crash over the next hill, you start running in order to see the commotion. You see two digimon, one is a rock monster. The other is smaller, a women with a snake arm and knee length braids. \"Who are they?\", you ask your friends. \"Golemon and Mervamon. But what are they running from?\", beezlemon asked. \"BLAST BLAZE!\", a fireball misses golemon as multiple black shapes appear. \"Oh, blacktyrannomon. That makes sense\", beastmon said calmly. beastmon shook her head, then looked down only to see you shooting at one of those viral behemoths! Beastmon drags a confused beezlmon down the hill, in order to save you from the beast. Mervamon and golemon were unsure of the strangers, but decided to stand by them to fight til they could get answers. Beezlemon changed to blast mode, before getting in the fight. You and the digimon stand against the enemy, 3 of them for everyone of you. Golemon and mervamon stood ready, while beastmon pushed an exhausted and confused you back from the fight. Beezlemon poised his weapons, and the digimon launched their attacks. Beastmon: \"Vampire wave!\" Golemon: \"Rock punch!\" Beezlemon blast mode: \"Double Impact!\" Mervamon: \"Olympia Kai!\" You watched not only in awe at the ease of which the army of evil digimon was destroyed, but also in horror as a stray had backed you into a corner and knocked your gun away. \"Madness Merry-Go-Round!\", said a female voice as a small tornado tore the digimon apart. Mervamon and Golemon, stand there while you and your friends tell them how you'd come to be on the hill. Mervamon says she and Golemon are on the run, from the digimon empire. You then pass out, much to the others concern. Then shock, upon closer inspection, there is a gash on your arm where blacktyrannomon hit you. You wake up to see black nothingness, then a bright light. \"Fear not Rex, you are only having a vision in your sleep. You had fainted from blood loss\", you turn and realize the voice is radia, the one who brought you here. Meanwhile, your friends are tending to your wound. Out of nowhere, your gun begins to glow. In your vision, radia wanted to replace your weapon with a more useful tool. She described two tools, you choose the.. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gripped your digivice tightly and then said three words \"Dark D.N.A. charge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a ominous purple aura surounded you and Agumon. You knew what was happening, Agumon was digivolving into that of his virus form. You wathced not in horror, not in fear, but instead in happyness as Agumon transformed into SkullGreymon. SkullGreymon picks you up and sets you on his shoulder and then the both of you charge into the slave camp, screaming, laughing, and enjoying it. You felt alive as you slaughtered the evil digimon using SkullGreymon's Dark Shot. You hop of SkullGreymon's shoulder and walk towards the cages as the fires from the battle burn in the background. The helpless captives before you, scared and some beging for mercy as you aprouch. You chuckle a small laugh and then smash the locks on the cages with a simple punch, freeing the captives. The all exit the cages but don't run away which you found odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you run away\" you ask them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have nowhere to run to\" explained a teenage girl about the age off thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so\" you asked and the rest of them nod \"Why don't you go back to the resistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becuase they abandoned us as soon as we got captured\" the teenage girl's digimon replied, she was a floramon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards\" you grip your fist in anger cursing the resistance for abandoning such helpless kids and digimon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we come with you\" asked a small younge blond haired boy no older than you'd say six?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch in front of the little boy and then place yoru hand on his head \"Sure you can\" you reply with a smile. You stand back up and SkullGreymon is standing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemies have been exterminated\" he tells you somewhat happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" you reply then turn around to your new outcast allies \"My name is Alex and this is my partner SkullGreymon\" you yell speaking like that of a leader. \"For too long has this war ravaged this world and for too long has the evil's of this world gone unjustified. I am speaking not only of the digimom emperor but also the resistance as they have as much to do with the deaths and engagement of you countless children and digimon. I, Alex, shall not stand for this! I can't stand by as my fellow digimon and human friends watch as their brothers in arms or sisters in arms die! I shall create my own group...no my own army! One not of darkness, not of light, but of true freedom and peace! Who is with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army of human and digimon alike all cheer and shout as they pledge their undying loyalty to you. You walk over to a small destroid shed and find cape that of the digimon emperor and put it on before having Agumon burn the symbole off replacign it with you own, a symbole of a digivice.You then go back out and fidn the girl from before and her floramon bowing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise\" you tell them \"no need for that\" you tell them \"this is an amry of freedom not one of lords or kings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" they reply standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then takes the time to introduce herself \"My name is Nina Tachina but you can just call me Nina\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\" you reply \"as well as you Floramon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgumon walks up to you and asks you \"Where do we go from here?\"</span></div></div>",

You nod and quickly rush forward but stop short just of a clearing as there were several beings there, some digimon and one or two were human. The humans had black leather whips in hand and seemed to be surrounding someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please don't\" cried a female voice from the center of the group! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha you're going to pay for running away\" cackled one of the evil digimon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we have anything to do about it\" you shout and th group turned towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's a resistance fighter doing here\" one of the evil humans asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but let's get them\" ordered his evil digimon partner as they begin to charge towards you, leaving their original target behind them. You grin and then pull out your digivice, you grip it tightly and then a black aura begins to glow around you and Agumon. Suddenly in a flash of dark light Agumon digivolved into SkullGreymon to the shock and awe of your advisories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye\" you say as you shoot out your hand and SkullGreymon grins before launching his Dark Shot attack and wiping out the group. You smile rather evilly and then walk up to the corpse of one of the individual humans to find him alive. You grab the kid by the neck and told him to be thankful that you spared him and also to tell the digimon emperor that he has a new threat to worry about. You let go of the kid and then as SkullGreymon approached they run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then set your sites on girl who was previously being attacked and you quickly run up to her to see if she was alright. You noticed that she was that of a digimon who when you check your digivice it said she was a BlackGatomon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright\" you asked? The BlackGatomon groaned as if in pain and you then noticed a large gash across her right arm in the shape of a whip mark. \"Those monsters must have whipped her till she passed out\" you say angrily as you rip up your shirt and wrap it tightly around BlackGatomon's arm as blood kept flowing out of it. After you tided it tightly around the wound it seemed to stop bleeding so bad.You sighed thankful that you had managed to save the digimon's life and carefully picked it up like that of a fragile baby and cradled it in your arms when suddenly you heard a noise coming from a nearby bush. \"SkullGreymon go check it out\" you ordered \"I'll stay here and care for our little friend!\" SkullGreymon nodded and then went after whatever made the noise as he descended into the dense woods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you had started a camp fire as it was starting to get a little dark. You sigh and shiver as a cool breeze began to blow, you looked over to your unconscious companion to see that she was alright and smile slightly before suddenly...</span></div></div>",
