He say Mrs. Locke was gone, to who knows where but didn't seem to care. He continued over to the desk and sat down. He glanced around the office and a feeling that he shouldn't be in here came over him. This passed just as soon as it had came and he once again felt comfertable again. He glanced over at the clock and saw that it had been about an hour since you had given him Miss. Lockes orb. Seeing that he had about three hours before he had to go and begin teaching classes, which today would be mostly Study Hall, making the day much easier and less stressful. He began to look at papers and grading them inputing them into the computer. For a moment he thought of playing video games or looking up music on youtube, but this too passed. He decided to take a break and got out of the chair. He began down the teachers lounge and poured himself a cup of coffee. He looked and saw Mr. Richards, John's math teacher and also the man who had gotten Ms. Locke her job, walk into the room. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMr. Richards looked over and said \"How has your day been so far Misses Locke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine\" John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been getting some work done John?\" Mr. Richards asked. \"I know you have a very long break this time of day, I hope you use it responsebly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do Ted,\" John told him. \"I got some papers graded and I'm about to go back to it, then in about two hours, I teach classes, you know my schedule,\" his voice was now much higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll let you get back to that Ms. Locke,\" Mr. Richards stated leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn began to head back to his office. When he arrived he looked at the mirror as he entered. He ajusted his glasses, and straightened his long blonde hair that went down to about the middle of his back. He reapplied his make-up, and sat back down at \"his\" desk. He began typing again, when he seemed to remeber what had happened earliar. Grabbing his new hair he began to panic. He recited his ABC's only to find his voice much higher than it should be much like the athorritive sounds of Ms. Locke. He opened up a document and began to type all he could see that had changed. He typed about his changed personality, last name, voice, life, interest, eyesight and suddenly as his mind began to slip back again he saved the document to a flash drive and put it in a small corner of a purse that he sadly didn't know Ms. Locke had stopped using that day. He began to start working on grading papers when he heard the bell signaling lunch. He got up and stood in the halls. Telling students to stop running, put away their cell phones, and other things. He even saw you run by only he hardly recognized you and began to wonder what had happened to you, but this soon passed. The bell rang again signalling that all students should be in the lunchroom. John then began to head again for the teachers lounge where he entered cooked his lunch and began to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John finished his lunch and began back to his office, swaying his hips much like Ms. Locke. He stopped off at the bathroom, upon entering a stall he stood, did his buisness and left the stall. He went over to the sink, washed his hands, noting that he may need to reapply new nail polish as his was beginning to fade. He readjusted his bra and began to go back to his office. He sat back down, and began grading papers. Feeling uncomfertable he removed his high heel shoes that seemed to be about four sizes too small. He got back to grading papers. Soon he glanced over at the radio, and decided to turn it on. He first tried to find a rock station, but soon he wondered who would listen to so much garbage. He instead turned on a Beetoven CD, and went back to work listening to Ode to Joy. Soon he found himself out of work, as he finished his last paper. He moved over to his lesson plan, and began to plan about two months in advance. He now had began to write with his left hand even thought he was a natural right handed person. A little while later he found himself to writing in cursive and that his handwriting matched Ms. Locke. He decide to take a break and layed back in his chair, and began to nod off to sleep. He awoke later his head on the desk, he brushed his blonde hair out of his eyes, and stared at the clock, he couldn't believe it. He still had an hour until he had to get to class to begin teaching. He reviewed his lesson plan, noting that two of his classes were regular English, while one was Study hall which fell right in between the two English Classes. He decided to slip his high heels back on and was pleasnetly suprised to see that they fit. He started to remember how he had gotten them on sale at the mall, and began to think about going there after school and getting some new suits. He got up and went back to the mirror. He didn't see the change, but now he had a much larger rear, and curved hips which were streaching John's pants. He looked at his nice top, and notice how it fit so snuggly(it was Ms. Locke's). He decide to put his hair in a ponytail and began to collect his things and shuffled down the hall to his classroom. He sat down at the desk, and began to file papers and prepare the assignment for that day. He finally heard the bell ring. He moved out into the hall and monitored the students he walked into his class when the bell rang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quiet everyone\" John stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn in your assignments on my desk, and pick up your new ones of the table in the back of the room, you will find all the info you need on page 53, it's only ten questions, I decided to let you all off easy on a Friday, so you probably won't have any homework,\" John said he sat back down at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was expecting some questions from students but wouldn't be asked any for the rest of the day. He began grading the new papers he had just recieved. Soon he adjusted his skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, \"Ms. Locke\" got up, and told the class that \"she\" would be right back. She went to the bathroom and passed by the mirror. He looked in the mirror and saw that he was now completely Ms. Locke except for one place that haden't changed all day, the only thing that had changed about his head, was his hair, which now had stopped at just a little past his butt if it hadn't been in a ponytail, his ears were now pierced, and he now wore glasses and makeup, but his face had not changed at all, and he didn't think it would he went about his buisness and went back to class, he sat down at his desk and told Marissa and some of her friends to stop talking he didn't know if it was you or really Marissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the day would be over and \"John\" who still had his first name, would head home.</span></div></div>",

Getting up you pick up your cell phone and just choose a random girls number, which wasn't hard as there wasn't many. Finding the number you dial it and call over the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon there is a knock on the door, getting up you open up the door, and standing there you see the girls number that you had dialed, Cindy Lane. Cindy was the defenition of nerd, she loved sci-fi, could have been married to her school work, wore thick glasses, among other things. You invite her in and she goes and sits down on the couch, and you examined her more, she was short, about half your size, had black frizzy hair that fell down to about shoulder length, and were others had matured, she hadn't. Unlike many of the girls at your school, Cindy wasn't a complete jerk, she always helped you if you needed it, and you'd worked together on projects. You also figured that she wouldn't mind switching personalities with anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour, John arrives. You go and let him in and are suprised to see who he's brought to this little \"party\". He had brought Jorden Walker, who is probably the hottest girl in your school, but also probably the biggest air head too. She had long blonde hair that cascade down her back, and a body that put most modles to shame. You heard her ask John \"So, uh, like, when are you gonna do, my, uh, like, homework?\". \"Later,\" John tells her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drag John into the kitchen has Jorden settled down on another couch. \"How in the world, did you get her to come here?!\" you demand. \"I just told her that if she came over that I would do her homework, it was as easy as that. I asked her if having another person's personality sounded like an interesting idea on the ride here,\" he explained. \"And what did she have to say to that?\" you inquire, \"Well at first I had to explain the words personality, interesting and idea, but she said it sounded cool. So here we are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we go about deciding who's personality we each well get?\" he asks you later. \"Well, I figure we can toss a coin and if it's a head I'll switch with Cindy and you switch with Jorden, if it's tails I'll get Jorden's and you'll get Cindy's\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that sounds fair, ok,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the coin into the air, what does it land on?</span></div></div>",
