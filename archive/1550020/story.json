            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Asari are a humanoid species that hold one of three permanent seats on the Citadel council at the start of the game. All Asari are mono-gendered, although they display, from a human point of view, female characteristics, with the ability to bear and nurse children. Their reproductive and dual nervous systems allow them to mate with any species or gender, with whom the offspring is always female and of the Asari race. The Asari are capable of participating in and enjoying physical sexual contact. However, to produce offspring, they form a mental and spiritual connection with their partners, and by doing so, draw genetic material which is combined with their own to produce offspring resulting in an offspring that is primarily Asari in genetic makeup, however it might possess recessive traits from the father species. For example, a child that is the result of a union between a Krogan and an Asari might inherit Krogan disease resistance. Sexually, the Asari could be considered as xenophilic, as not only are they indiscriminate in regards to the races of their mates, but prefer to mate with other races, believing that the genetic and racial traits of other species, when combined with Asari genetic make-up, is of benefit to the Asari race as a whole. Conversely, they tend to attach a stigma to those born \"pureblood\" between two Asari, as they believe that nothing is gained when two Asari procreate (although most are too polite to openly speak of their prejudices). Their homeworld of Thessia is composed of an interconnected system of city-states, similar to those of medieval Italy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the species in Council space, the Asari are the most widespread, powerful, and respected, due in part to their being the first species since the Protheans to achieve interstellar flight, to discover and learn how to use the Citadel, and their position as a founding member species of the Citadel Council. Despite this, the Asari are open in their service to others, to the point where there is no cultural stigma attached to performance arts, even sexual ones. This has led to salacious rumors of Asari promiscuity, which they consider unfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the galactic species, the Asari are the most economically powerful; their culture, products and entertainment dominate the galaxy. They are governed by a loose democracy, known as the Asari Republics, and are known to be politically centrist, favoring stability that is conducive to cultural and economic development. Politically, they practice a form of direct democracy that could only be described as an e-democracy, where citizens contribute to the general consensus via a huge interconnected network. However, they also have a matriarchal council that heed the will of the people and make decision for their welfare accordingly. The Asari can live for a thousand years going through three stages in life; the Maiden stage (lasting to 350 years), an energetic phase in life in which an Asari is considered a youth and setting the initial course of her life; the Matron stage (lasting from 350-700 years) where an Asari draws back to a more deliberative phase and begins to lay the foundations of a family and her place in society (though some Asari have been known to start families as early as 100 years old), and finally the Matriarch phase (700-1,000 years) where the Asari takes her place among the elite in society, participating more in cultural and political affairs and generally leading the next generation to fruition.</span></div></div>",

Forgoing the usual Maiden choices in life, Isha devoted herself to training and learning as much about police procedures as possible. Eventually she became a C-Sec officer, working on one of the upper wards on the Citadel. She took her duties seriously, and eventually her ward became crime free. Her superiors took notice and suggested she become a Specter, which she accepted. Standing a 6'7'' due to odd genetics, Isha towers over most other races. Her centuries of training have also given her an slim but athletic build. She is very serious-minded: she always put her job before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana D'tevo: Kana is an rarity: an Asari born with no biotics and unable to receive any. Although bullied because of this, Kana let nothing get her down. She joined the Alliance to show she could be useful without biotics. But, during a mission to a junk planet, her team was ambushed by Geth, leaving her partners dead and her badly injured. After undergoing extensive surgery, Kana was left with a cybernetic arm, leg, and eye. But she continued to fight, eventually rising to the Specter ranks. Kana stands at 5'7'' with a slight athletic build. Her cybernetic limbs are pure silver and her cybernetic eye is purple with black sclera. She is optimistic and proud to be a fighter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Salarians, who possess one of the three permanent Citadel Council seats, are a species renowned for their mental acuity, technical skill and their high aptitude for espionage. Salarians have a very high metabolism rate, lowering their life expectancy to about 40 Earth years, but also necessitating very little sleep, around 1-2 hours per day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the interstellar community, they have created many of the major technological advances that now fill the galaxy. Highly intelligent, their mental acuity is galactically renowned. In fact, they are considered to be hyperactive by most other races; Salarians, however, disagree with this prognosis, considering other races to be slow and dim-witted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey favor political liberalism, making them a counter-balance to the conservative Turians and centrist Asari on the Citadel Council. The Salarian Union is largely governed by a group of dynastic families ruled by female elders. Of the three permanent Council species, their economy is the smallest, but is still substantially larger than that of the human Systems Alliance. The Salarians were responsible for the elevation of the Krogan race to combat the invading Rachni, and they were subsequently responsible for creating the \"Genophage\" biological weapon used to quell the later Krogan Rebellions. Militarily, they are considerably weaker than the Turians in head-on combat, preferring to employ sabotage, reconnaissance, counter-intelligence and commando operations against any enemy. However, in unconventional warfare, the Salarians are perhaps second to none. They excel at information gathering and while they consider outright direct war to be a last resort, once they do engage in war, it's almost always by surprise (they see a declaration of war as strategically unsound) and by a strategically dominant force - after all, they've long since figured out what and who they are fighting against and how their foes are going to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalarians are not notably religious, but as free-willed sentients there are exceptions. One of the less-favored Salarian religions (which the Council deems a \"cult\") worships a goddess, and claims that a certain pattern of overlapping craters in the southern hemisphere of Trelyn resembles her. There has also been a small movement towards a kind of \"wheel of life\" form of pantheistic reincarnation that has taken root to a limited extent among Salarians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the novel Mass Effect: Ascension, a \"Salarian Lystheni offshoot\" is mentioned. It can be speculated that the Lystheni are a criminal organization similar to the racist, human organization Cerberus as the novel describes them as \"those unwelcome in Citadel space\", it could also be speculated that they are a Salarian subspecies.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Turians were the last of the Citadel species to join the Council. The Turians gained this position after defeating the Krogan for the Council during the \"Krogan Rebellions\", employing a Salarian-developed biological weapon called the \"Genophage\", which virtually eliminated the possibility of new Kogan births and caused that species to go into a steady decline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurian features are avian in nature, resembling Terran birds or raptors. Most also have tattooed-on markings on their faces whose design and color denote which colony or system they were born or raised in. This cultural observance was first developed during the Unification War, in which various Turian colonial holdings fought each other for territory and influence within the Hierarchy; however, years of infighting made most of them too weak to oppose the unifying influence of the Hierarchy itself. Outmatched, they accepted unification under the Hierarchy's leadership, but the markings remained. There are some Turians who do not have face markings; during the war, they were typically Hierarchy loyalists and were referred to degradingly as \"bare-faced\". While Turians without markings are no longer singled out as such, the slur remains and is commonly used to imply that certain Turians are \"politicians\" or \"untrustworthy\"; in Turian, these terms are synonymous and interchangeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurians have a reputation for skill and bravery in combat, but are not considered bloodthirsty. In combat, Turian units are highly adaptable and highly disciplined. Turian lines rarely break, even in highly disadvantageous circumstances; they will retreat and withdraw if necessary, but will do so in an orderly fashion, setting up vicious rear-guard actions and ambushes along the way. A rigid code of honor and strict discipline are the hallmarks of any Turian officer or enlisted-man. This includes humane treatment of prisoners and conquered enemies. A Turian unit will never willingly leave behind one of their own, no matter what the cost of going back to retrieve their comrade. Turian society in general is very honor-bound, concerned with the performance of one's duty, regardless of one's role in society. All Turians work for the glory of the state and most are state-employed in some way. Military service is mandatory for all Turian citizens, as well as client races who wish to become full Turian citizens. While there are some Turian criminals (a rather low number due to the typically Turian devotion to the state and to society), even they maintain a level of conscience unheard of by criminals of other races; a Turian criminal will, like most other beings, attempt to evade capture and consequence for their actions, but once caught and taken into custody, he or she will almost always to admit their guilt and accept due punishment (which, in Turian jurisprudence, is often harsh). Despite this preoccupation with law and order, many are surprised by the importance Turian society places on personal freedoms. Turian society allows for freedom of speech, religion and the practice of practically any activity that does not harm or undermine the state. There are Turians who are known to observe and adhere to Asari and even human religious practices; there is an increasingly large segment of Turians who are known to practice Confucianism and/or Zen Buddhism, as well as some earth-originated monotheistic religions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir species is governed by the Turian Hierarchy, a collection of military leaders and autocrats, and of the three permanent council races, they possess the largest military force, even if they are not as powerful as the technologically, diplomatically and economically superior Asari. As such, they are largely employed as the front line of the Council's combined military forces. Most Council peacekeeping forces are made up principally by Turians, and Turians are also the largest racial group employed in the Council Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance (Spectres) and Citadel Security Services (C-Sec, the station's law-enforcement body; it was the Turians who suggested the agency's formation). While autocratic in nature, Turian Hierarchs almost never cross the line into tyranny or despotism, for devotion to the well-being of the people is ingrained into every Turian from childhood. Politically, the Turians are conservative, paying great observance to tradition, duty, loyalty, honor and the preservation of the status quo. Still, they generally get along well with most other races. There is a great deal of hostility between the Turians and the Krogan for obvious reasons, and there is a lingering degree of distrust and enmity between the Turians and the human race, the bitter memories of the First Contact War still very fresh for both races. However, the Turians still greatly respect the military tactics and aptitude of the humans as demonstrated against them in battle during the reclamation of the human colony of Shanxi. The rate of human colonization, material wealth and influence within the Council is known to irk some prominent Turians, but there is a grudging respect between the two races.</span></div></div>",

Human society in Mass Effect is both similar and dissimilar to modern human society. Independent and separate nations still govern various landmasses on Earth. In regards to the galaxy at large however, the Systems Alliance is the face of humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Systems Alliance is a multi-national independent entity supported by the various nations of Earth that is, for all intents, its own political, governmental, and military entity; it controls and manages all off-world activities. A recent addition to the galactic stage when the game is set, human society advanced significantly with the advent of interstellar travel, made possible with the discovery of lost Prothean technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans quickly expanded outwards and established more and more colonies on uninhabited planets. This rapid expansion brought them into contact with the Batarians and Turians, with whom they quickly came into conflict. The human-Turian First Contact War brought humans to the attention of the species of the Citadel Council. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the System Alliance's quick and effective military response to the Turian occupation of the human colony of Shanxi and the stunning defeat of the Turians at the hands of this relative newcomer to galactic politics, the Citadel Council wasted no time in mediating an end to the war and gave the human race considerable latitude in their colonization efforts, much to the dismay of the Batarians, who abandoned their Citadel embassy in protest. In the brief decades since their appearance, humans have quickly risen to prominence. In addition, humans have recently been given an embassy at the Citadel as associate members of the Citadel Council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans are seen by most galactic races as intelligent, aggressive, and highly adaptable. Their brisk population growth and rapidly developing military strength have led to resentful speculation that the newcomers will soon be given an invitation to become full members of the Council, at an unprecedented rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to their military aptitude and rising force levels, they are limited by the First Contact War-ending Treaty of Farixen, which limits the Alliance military to 1/5th the number of dreadnought warships the Turians possess. In order to gain diplomatic recognition and respective associate member status on the Council as well as an embassy on the Citadel, the Systems Alliance agreed to this stipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the game, Commander Shepard (the main character) comments on the difference between the lifespans of the Asari and humans, saying that humans are \"lucky if they reach 150\", therefore implying that humans have extended their average lifespan by several decades.[2] It is also revealed that humanity makes extensive use of in utero genetic screening and engineering to eliminate or repair many congenital defects. Genetic engineering is also used (mostly by the wealthy) to enhance appearance, physical ability, and mental acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease specify which sex you are...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n1.

But the sounds also grew closer and soon the whole bunker was shaking from each impact as cannon fire exploded all around their bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a lull came over the battle field followed by a tremendous roar of an explosion from somewhere outside as the power inside the bunker flickered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" asked Lin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know but it didn\u2019t sound good\" said Danny<br>\r\n<br>\r\na second later the hatch blew inwards and in walked a dark figure with a singular glowing light to show it where to go. Strange noises could be heard from the creature every one kept silent hoping it wouldn\u2019t find them. After a little bit the things turned around and began to leave. As it began to leave Danny accidentally knocked over something instantly alerting the thing as two more of the things filled into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the power came back online and revealed who the creatures were for the three to see. It was the Geth! Their robotic bodies unmistakable in this light. But as they saw the Geth the Geth also saw them and raised their rifles and fired tearing the three humans to shreds another one said something in their strange language and they headed out leaving the bloody bodies where they lay.<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Roth headed to his room which was at the very end of the hall on the third level. Opening the door reveled a room of not much in one corner was a single bed to sleep in another was a desk covered with paper work and a screen on a wall with the symbol of the human Alliance Navy on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess its time to get back to work and fill out those damn papers.\" Roth said walking to his desk and sitting down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty five minutes of paper work Roth\u2019s intercom buzzed for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked activating the intercom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir we are approximately five minutes out from Sol sir thought you would like to know. However we are receiving a priority call from Alliance command on Sol sir shall I patch it threw?\" asked the comms officer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please do.\" replied Roth walking over to the screen with the Alliance Navy symbol on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later the face of a human female appeared on her shoulders she bore the rank of a captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Captain Dalaya what can I do for you?\" asked Roth obviously being a smart ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out with the bull shit Roth it doesn\u2019t suit you.\" She said crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then lets get to the point just what is it you want me and my ship to do now?\" Roth asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to go check on the Reyk system we just received a distress signal from that system about an hour ago.\" Dalaya said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reyk system? isn\u2019t that in the Verdant Ridge Nebula area?\" asked Roth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. And before you ask no they cant Admiral Duath is currently engaged in other duties in the nebula with the second fleet. All other vessels are currently in the yards getting refitted and repaired after that Geth stunt not to long ago you are currently the only one who is able to react fast enough to be of any use.\" Dalaya explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your going to owe me another drink for this Captain you know that right?\" said Roth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn\u2019t be the first in fact I believe this would be the thirtieth one you said I will owe you for making you go out instead of letting you come back in.\" Dalaya said with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some times Dalaya the only reason you ever send me out is so I can\u2019t collect on those drinks.\" replied Roth smiling back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your orders Commander carry them out Captain Dalaya out.\" and with that the connection cut out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well there goes that shore leave I had planned for the crew. Lets just hope this isn\u2019t a waste of all our times.</i> Roth thought returning to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain on deck!\" shouted the young enlisted by the door as Roth exited the elevator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you were.\" Roth said walking to the nav-bridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir we are approximately one minute from hitting the Sol gate.\" said lieutenant Davidson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Pilot begin plotting an instant gate jump to the Reyk system  as soon as we enter the Sol system.\" said Roth giving out orders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye sir beginning now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir are we not returning to Sol today?\" asked lieutenant Davidson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative we are need in the Reyk system apparently one of the colonies there has sent a distress signal out about an hour ago and we have been tasked with finding out what the problem is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn\u2019t the Reyk system fall within Admiral Duath and the second fleet's patrol area shouldn\u2019t he take care of it?\" asked Davidson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does however the Admiral and the second fleet are currently engaged in other matters and we are currently the only available vessel so it\u2019s our job to go see what\u2019s up in the Reyk system.\" Roth replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have your orders I expect this ship turned around and ready to hit that gate the second we exit warp understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye sir will do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good weapons officer begin a check of all ships weapon systems I want them ready for anything should we find something out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right people we have a job to do now let\u2019s go out there and do it and get home before they lay another job on us.\" said Roth as every one went  about their jobs getting everything ready.</span></div></div>",

Inside the belt many valuable ores necessary in the building of ships can be found making the Reyk system an up and coming ship building system.

I want this system to be in Alliance control yesterday. This is to be assumed as a retaliatory strike against the human alliance and its allies for their defeat back at Citadel station as of now we are entering enemy held friendly space. Expect heavy resistance the Geth aren\u2019t known for their love of humans.\u201d Commanded Roth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, sir setting course now bringing all systems online for engagement sending out a priority call to alliance command for back up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain we are receiving a transmission from the Reyk III\u2019s surviving marine detachment outside the capital city Tarna Vos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatch them threw now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Staff Sergeant Major Alex of the Reyk III marine detachment to Alliance command vessel thanks for the timely arrival we could really use some help down here.\u201d In the back ground explosions are heard with gun fire <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKEEP FIRING DON\u2019T LET THE THREW! Sorry as you can tell we are in a bad way and could really use some help please tell me your with the second fleet and that the rest of the fleet is behind you on their way now.\u201d Asked the Sergeant facing the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Commander Roth of the destroyer <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> We read you sergeant we are on route now to clear the space over Reyk III and send down a ground team to help with the Geth.

Sir we are almost shit out of luck we are damn near completely surrounded in a corner near the out skirts of the city inside a large Plaza with a large group of civilians that weren\u2019t slaughtered by the Geth during the initial assault. I am unable to contact anyone else in system or on this planet as far as I know me and my men are the last surviving marines from the Reyk III marine detachment along with our civilians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much longer do you think you can hold out for?\u201d asked Roth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir but probably for as long as this building stands most likely but I don\u2019t know how much longer that is would advise that is if you do something you do it quick or else me my men and these civilians are all done for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAcknowledge will be sending ground team as soon as the space above Reyk III is secure enough to send down a transport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCopy sir please hurry\u2026 \u2018BOOM\u2019 COVER THAT HOLE!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two medium turrets on the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> port and starboard side opened fire upon the Geth ships their ruby red laser fire catching two of the ship unprepared with their shields down and causing massive damage to them sending secondary explosions threw their hulls that eventually destroyed the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery one on the Bridge gave out their own hollers in joy over the destruction of two of the enemy ships. With the destruction of two of their own the Geth were caught completely off guard and proceeded to open fire at extreme range with the own weapons filling the space above Reyk III with their own green laser fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second barrage of the mediums striped one of the ships of their shields completely and crippled it to where it was no longer anything but drifting junk. Now within range the Geth lasers started to hit their mark better but still most of their shoots went wide with range and evasive maneuvers from both sides decreasing the chances of hits. The crippled Geth ship in an attempt to disable or destroy the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> self destructed sending out a characteristic emp pulse that stripped any ship within the blast range of their shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blast hit both remaining Geth ships and the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> taking away all their shields. When the blast hit the alliance ship a malfunction appeared in the electronics for the medium turrets disabling them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with no shields and the advantage of range gone the battle came down to a \u201cKnife Fighting\u201d range where the smaller turrets on the destroyer would be next to useless in order to prevent the Geth\u2019s lasers from firing properly either as the safety mechanics for any turret prevented firing at anything at extreme close range so as to prevent any possible damage caused by an exploding ship or debris to collide and destroy something important on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the range closed to \u201cKnife Point\u201d the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> pulled hard to their port rolling over on of the Geth ships with the port side stabilizer creating a gash in the Geth ships hull that if it were a human vessel would have created a vacuumed death to all on board but as it was a Geth ship all that happened was to have the Geth inside sucked into space leaving the ship a drifting hulk with no crew inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe range now open some bath the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> and the remaining Geth ship instantly opened fire on each other. As they continued to open fire the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> regained the use of its mediums and opened fire with them at the Geth ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both mediums and the small turrets raining death down upon it the Geth ship never stood a chance. Inside the Geth ship could have been a computerized hell as all the electronics inside fried and exploded the Geth inside working as fast as their servos could to keep firing to destroy the human alliance vessel and live despite the extremely slim chances. Then like a small sun going Nova the Geth ship exploded creating a small shock wave of fire and emp  that washed over the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> like a tidal wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce passed all that was left in space was floating wreckage from the Geth ships and their one lifeless ship, and a very badly damaged Human Alliance destroyer with a destroyed port stabilizer with burns marks going across the hull. Just the fact the ship was still overall intact aside from a couple of hull breaches and the port stabilizer provided a testament to human building design.</span></div></div>",

Small electrical fires where being brought under control by the ships crew the ships own fire protection system having failed halfway threw the battle.

One... Two... Three... NOW!\" Shouted Alex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewie tossed a grenade down the corridor once it exploded he as well as every one else made to look over the cover and fire the grenade seemed to had done its job stopping the Geth temporarily. Then Lewie using his biotic implants sent a kinetic push threw the air that tossed several of the closer Geth back away from them and into the others.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say the Geth were giving a final push would be an understatement at the numbers facing the remaining marines now. The disticnt shapes of the Geth walkers or armatures as they were called were being protected by several hundred Geth the main purpose of the walkers even being there to destroy any resistance that may come from the marines giving the Geth free field to slaughter them and the civilians inside the plaza. Among there numbers were Geth destroyer\u2019s dreadnoughts and one Geth Prime obviously the leader of the Geth if it could be called that as Geth never seemed phased when one was destroyed but it was obvious when one was destroyed a small but distinguishable difference could be noted in the rest of the Geth actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright men this is it we either hold the Geth here or allow them to kill our families and loved ones. I have said it before and I'll say it again I am damn proud to have had the honor to have served with all of you now lets hold these Geth HERE!\" shouted Alex rasing his rifle down range a loud \"HO RAH!\" could be heared from the rest of the marines as they also readied to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my mark fire on the smaller Geth and work towards the larger ones!\" Alex shouted over the slowly increasing sound of the approaching Geth \"FIRE!\" he shouted pulling the trigger sending rounds down range pepering the Geth several dropped immideatly but for every one destroyed more took their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillie the only living biotic left used his implants multiple times to throw up kinnetic barriers to protect his fellow marines from the shots fired by the Geth walkers. But every time he used his implants he would grow more and more tired so used his implants sparingly or risk being a burden rather then an burden. The sounds of high powered rifle's could be heard as Ghost team Echo took out the Geth shadows to prevent their jamming abilities to effect the marines  at the plaza. For what seemed like an eternity this drove on as the Geth came closer and closer constantly firing on the marines pinning them and wounding them but for ever centimeter they took the marines made them pay dearly for it in their seemingly limitless numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's close enough Ghost team Echo activate the Tarantula mines.\" Alex ordered firing on the Geth as they passed a designated spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye sir cover your ears it\u2019s about to get loud.\" the ghost team leader replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once several large explosions took place in the street destroying many Geth and their larger counter parts. A second set of explosions went of that sent one of the near by buildings collapsing on the Geth walkers crushing nearly all of them. As the dust settled it could be seen that nearly every Geth had been destroyed or damaged beyond capable function. With a loud cheer the marines shouted and raised their rifles at their success but they were quickly silenced by the all too familiar sound of more Geth approaching them. This new wave facing the marines now made the first look like nothing as yet more Geth came pouring into where the other Geth had been firing as they went quickly followed by still more larger Geth and several walkers but what really was counting against them was they now had a Geth walker that dwarfed the other walkers and Geth they had brought out the big guns this time the Geth would not be denied they would have their victory here and crush any resistance from any organic life. With one shoot from this monster not even Wilie's kinetic barriers could prevent them from hitting their targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall back! Back to the second line! Move it!\" Alex hollered seeing how out matched they were sure falling back would only prevent the smaller Geth from over running their position but he had to get his men out of the range of the giant Geth walker before it leveled them all into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghost team Echo this is Alex fall back to a safer position it is to hot here I repeat fall back to a safer position before they spot you!\" Alex also warned the sniper team before the giant walker had a chanse to destroy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye were already moving just needing to holy shit fire fuck fire! Hurry get us threw we need to get out before that thing fires on our position... Dear god.\" and with that the comm cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Alex saw the large Geth walker facing towards one of the buildings being currently swarmed by Geth troopers when it fired at the building causing major damage to it sending the building collapsing down on top of anything inside or near it as it fell. Alex didn't even bother to try and see if anyone survived as he would be wasting precious time that he didn't have instead he turned and fired at the oncoming Geth determined to take as many of the things with him before he died. Firing with the rest of the marines they layed fire on the approaching Geth holding them at bay for a while before their walkers came into range and open fire on the marines forcing them into cover more then they could afford allowing the Geth to continue onwards. Followed by the far larger Geth walkers that had decimated Ghost team Echo in one shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall back, back inside the Plaza erect the barrier!\" shouted Alex as the Geth passed another range marker setting off another set of mines that destroyed more Geth but still they came on like an army of the damned with no end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the plaza the marines erected the large kinetic shield barrier that would keep any fire from the Geth from hitting the Plaza but would not stop the Geth from simply walking threw it to reach their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> this is marine detachment on Reyk III we need immediate air support request you strike at these coordinates!\" Shouted Alex into his comm for the currently orbiting ship to fire on the on coming Geth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> we read you loud and clear be advised that we will be firing awfully close to your position recomend you find some heavy cover and stay there <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> out.\"</span></div></div>",

Warning Alarms went off declaring imminent destruction if they did not reverse course. The alarms themselves were just as quickly turned off and left off as they were nothing more then a nusicence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking threw the atmosphere beyond all expectation's of its designers the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> flew threw the Reyk III sky breaking the sound barrier several times over is it made its approach from its entry to the planets surface to the last remaining city on Reyk III. Within several hundred kilometers she slowed down to cruising speed in order to better align itself for a run over the city and lock its turrets into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last few kilometers the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> powered her engines to full flying towards the city at break neck speeds to escape any possible AA that might have been placed by the Geth. Once over the city buildings on fire flew below the ship as it approached its destination. A giant plaza near the opposite edge of the city that was currently being attacked by several million Geth and one giant Geth walker about the size of one of the buildings. With out warning the turrets fired upon the Geth and their giant walker making small explosion's wherever they hit some of the buildings that got caught in the blast collapsed crushing countless Geth beneath them. The giant walker knowing its doom turned towards the oncoming ship and fired one shoot to put up any form of resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unerring accuracy the shoot struck the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> with a EMP pulse that instantly disabled many systems and destroyed other's causing the ship to drop several meters that brought it low enough that when it flew by the giant walker it was decapitated at the \"neck\". Once past the walker started to fall towards the ground shooting out sparks before it exploded sending out an emp pulse to knock the ship out of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geth within the area were instantly killed from the emp pulse as well as any other form of electronics including that of the marines weapons and the kinetic shield protecting the Plaza. However despite its speed the <i>SSV Forgotten Dreams</i> was caught in the pulse knocking out even more of its systems leaving it in a very dire situation. As it was now crippled by the blast it could not enter and exit the atmosphere without burning up and was forced to find some where to land but being a ship designed for space any ideas of being atmosphere capable had been nothing but a minor detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redirect primary power from shields and weapons to the anti gravitational generators if we cant land properly then we will make a forced landing.\" Roth directed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir if we do we will be open for any attack by the Geth.\" warned Davidson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the risk but we need to effect repairs to the ship otherwise we will be grounded here on this planet forever.\" Roth said.</span></div></div>",

An inexperienced soldier might have thought that hiding under the corpse of a comrade would provide safety. In reality, it invited a fate worse than death. Dead or alive, the Geth would convert any bodies they found into mindless husks. Not wanting to fall victim to such a fate drove Bolden to take action. Trying not to show any sign that he was still alive, he looked around for any weapons he could use. There was an assault rifle a few inches from his head, but it had been badly damaged in the explosion and would be useless. Having no other choice, Sergeant Bolden drew his sidearm from its hip holster and deactivated the safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding under a corpse alone would not save the sergeant's life, but it would give him the element of surprise. He discreetly peered over his fallen companion's body and watched the Geth squad as it approached. There were just a few of them, but Bolden was in no position for an intense battle. He would have to take them all out at once. Once the squad of mechanical soldiers drew close enough, he would spring out from his hiding place and hopefully take them by surprise. Otherwise, his situation would be no better than if he had decided to remain hidden entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the enemy was upon him. The Geth point-man looked down at the corpse, and then at Lincoln Bolden's apparently lifeless face. Storing its weapon on its back, the point-man picked up the corpse. The instant it was out of the way, Bolden raised his pistol and put a round through the Geth trooper's head. Its squad-mates turned to face the falling machine, and as they did so, Bolden flung himself into an upright position and fired five more precise shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Bolden stood as the last Geth trooper fell. His body was badly burned and bruised, but he lived to fight another battle. His legs were fairly undamaged, so he would at least be able to move. However, a lone, injured soldier would likely not be able to last very long against the Geth hordes, so he would have to link up with another Alliance squad, both for strength in numbers and medical attention.</span></div></div>",

Cruisers are the standard patrol unit, and often lead frigate flotillas. Cruisers cannot land on medium or high-gravity worlds, but do possess the ability to land on low-gravity planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruiser-weight starships are the standard combat unit encountered away from large naval bases, the \"poor bloody infantry\" of most fleets. Nimble scouting frigates have neither the punch nor the stamina to stand up to serious combat, and the mighty dreadnoughts are a strategic resource, carefully hoarded and committed to the most critical battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruisers perform routine independent \"show the flag\" patrols in settled systems and lead flotillas of frigates in small engagements, such as pirate suppression campaigns. In major fleet engagements, cruiser squadrons support the dreadnought battle line by screening their flanks against enemies attempting to maneuver for a main gun \"bow shot\" from their vulnerable broadsides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut SSV Venus is an experimental ship, highly classified and hard to see because the ship is colored of matt grey and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Shuan Quinn.

If the owner of story dose not like a fan made race its his prerogative to delete this chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraconians are a race that resemble dragons of old earth legends. There also a vary old and long lived race that could have with out the help of Mass Relays have visited Earth in distant past but its uncertain if they did or not. As it turns out there space travel and relay usage was quite prevalent but limited they did not really desire exploration as a people but only through adventures or wild individualizes that dared to look for new adventure did one of there ship find the Citadel and make contact, this was only 10 years after the Krogen rebellion. After contact was made a trade route and treaties were set up quickly, but unlike other races the Draconians didn't seek a position in the Council or even a representative at first. It was not until another 15 years till a member of the Draconian royal family volunteered to take the position in order to lean of the other races in the galaxy. Her name was Tira'gar Sinlu Dracones, Dracones is the royal name taken from they're worlds name Draconia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraconians have a humanoid build but are quite tall standing a average of 7 to 15 feet in height depending on age, some of the older Draconians are said to be even bigger. There bodies are covered in scales that are made up of hair that have congealed into harden scales due to oils in there skin. There colors can rang widely from across the color spectrum. Their colors are always two toned one darker color and a secondary lighter color running from their jaw to the tip of there tail. Other facial traits vary from hair, horns, tusks, and spines. Common to all are prehensile tails clawed fingers and toes, forked sticky tongue that can extend out like a frogs, and wing like appendages that allow them limited flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraconians are also naturally biotic users but can not use it as other races in stead they fire biotic blast from there mouths with varying effects. These rang form a pure blast of biotic energy to fire balls, gout's of flame, freezing energy, spiting a biotic acid, a bolt of lighting, or shards of ice. It is not known why there biotic powers manifest as such but it is looked upon as a blessing. Even being consider a sign of adulthood when there biotic breath manifests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother unique trait is that any other race they mate with even Asari will result in a draconian birth (though with Asari its a 50/50 chance).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of there size and strength a few have chosen to become mercs or join C-sec, and 3 have even become specters though there exploits are rarely if ever heard of.</span></div></div>",

It has sceance been modafide to acomadate him, being the royla runt had some percs after all, even this far from home. The ship was close to twice the size of a frigate, but only do to it being a draconian ship witch are often larger do to the races size. Its armed with only 3 gun batters one a draconian light cannon in its prow and 2 smaler truain twin bearrle medium cannons, one on each side of the ship. Again the reson Draconian sizeing allows for this stange mix given that a small draconian cannon is 2 times the size of the truan medium and are bilt quite difrently. Draconian cannons resemble a what would best be discribed as a cross between a mass efect cannon and a gatling gun. This design gives them a higher rate of fire compaired to other ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint of note Ships: is draconian's have adopted the same ship class as the citadell only with some difreances frigates are often considered small 2 to 3 man ships with saport craft like fighters and bomers only having one crewmber. Cruser are the smalles main battle ships thay bild with a avrige of 12 crew mebers. There dreadnuts and carriers are the second bigest ships they have often dwarfing thos of other races. Then there is the class of ship witch only they could bild and only 3 knowen to exsist. These are officly calld battle cariers by the citadell counsule. But the draconians call this class Goddess given that each is named for one. the 3 knowen are Goddess of Victory the Draconian flag ship. Her sisters are the Goddess Iron Maiden and The Godess of Death. Olny Death was ever seen in action when the counsle reqest help it came to the call missing the battle with savrin it did wipe out fleaing geath ships and is serving as a escort for the destinasintion till further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay arived at the docked in the citaden his large ship always catch the eyes of everyone it passed if they new it wasint even a real war ship most them would probly fear his race but given no one even hears of them unless they look for races at random in the citadel directery. The only ones that as about his ship are Quraines or Krogen, witch he dosent mind like both races Quraines for the elur and gearle intelgence of there race and krogen for how reliabule they are in battle and there food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jay left his ship he was met by a nervus human C-sec officer. *Must be the rumer mill about my race again.* Jay thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sir the councle wants to see you on the presidium.\" said the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay smiled \"Thanks and relax human my kind only look mean as long as you dont start any thing were as tamed as a rocks.\" he said as he walked by..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\nPrsidum tower<br>\r\n4 minuts later by taxi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glade to see you in person for the frist time your records show you as one of the best dispite you poor papper work skills....\" said the Human counsler<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to be wellcome. Next vaction i get i want to go to earth i hear its nice.\" said Jay in his good mannered voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cousle didnt find him as funny as he thought he was thoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asri spoke next \"In light of recent avents and a lack of anuff specters we are asining you a specter canadate that will aid you in your work and in trun you will grade her on her potenchle to be a specter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is my aprntice then?\" asked Jay <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Truran shook his head as he ansered \"A Qurain that has exspressed a desier to become a specter to fight the geth and fuster inproved relation between the citadel and the migrint fleet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  Salarein added \"Her name is Crela'Ra nar Alarei. She will be waiting for you at C-sec\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my mission?\" Jay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will give you some leway this time we have some rumers of arms smugling through omega that might be conected to the geth, theres also piret problam in a volose shiping lane, and lastly we need some one to investaget a the prtothen runis of Ilose and clear it of geth. We will asgin them all to you deal with them in what ever order you see fit.\" said the Asrai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be off then and not take up any more of your time.\" Jay said as he truned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\nC-sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm not loitering here im waiting for a specter!\" shuted a Qurian voice. As Jay looked to the right he saw a Qurain and a Asrai C-sec oficer argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't buy it why would a specter wast there time with a qurain like you.\" said the Asrai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asrai had the standerd C-sec uniform The Qurain had a red and black envirosuit and a body that made it look good. Jay watch and thought *If only they wher in a pool of grunker jell.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay then walked up unoticed and pated both girls ass promting both to trun and slap him calling him a perv in there oun langue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should arest you for sexule asult!\" shout the Asrai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay chukled as both girls gleared at him. \"Good you two stoped fighting. Im Jay'sar Acele Dracones of the specters. Im here to pick up a Qurain by the name of Crela'Ra nar Alarei by order of the cuncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arsai blushed and looked like shed puke reliseing she was both worng about the Qurain and had just slaped a specter. \"Um um excuseme...\" was all she could say as she slinked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrela looked at him \"Was pating both our asses realy nesacery to get our atention?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay grined and asered \"No but it was the funest way and i so rearly meet Qurains i had to at lest cop one feel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrela gleared at him \"Pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meat yah i think w will work well to geather. Lets get to my ship.\" Said Jay as he leads the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be a long trip....\" Crela mumbuled as she fallowed to the ship</span></div></div>",

They are 14 to 38 feet long and can stand up about half their body, the color scheme ranges on the color but the darker colors are male and the lighter ones are female. They have developed arms from their second set of legs and a much more sophisticated and stronger exoskeleton than their earthly cousins. They have a natural talent for engineers and can even bring efficiency up to 75% higher than a modern Albert Einstein with a masters degree in engineering. Although very sophisticated they have some 'primordial' implications such as the fore legs becoming venom claws that inject their prey with a powerful acid that dissolves the victim within seconds.Although they tend to be peaceful, they don't take kindly when they are insulted or mistreated, in extreme cases they sabotage the ship they are in or start screwing the person in their room via a rude wake-up call or deleting their files or digital belongings. They have also managed to alter their DNA to where they can fly via the 4 large wings on their back, although they cant stay in the air for more than 5 hours. They have an acute sense of sight, better than humans at 30/5 but they cant smell very well and they are about the same as a human in hearing. They have evolved to where they don't need to breathe, this allows them to go into the vacuum and survive for 10 hours at most along with going into gassed rooms to clear them out. Only in rare cases have there been a Centurion Biotic, far more powerful than even a highly trained Asari, allowing them to manipulate the atoms of objects but not living things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they are very large and smart, most of them joined the Alliance, allowing them to develop their own type of cloaking tech and applying it on larger scales, the <i>SSD NORMANDY</i> is proof of the Heat cloak they developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother unique trait is they seem to be unwilling to mate with other races, nobody knows why or how they developed this 'anxiety' or when it came to being, they also call themselves by human names such as \"Yuri\" or \"Price\" when around themselves or with others.</span></div></div>",

On patrol a ship receives a distress signal from a colony of an Geth attack reacting to the call the ship and its crew find the planet under heavy attack from the Geth. The Geth no longer under guidance of Saren or the giant Reaper named \"Sovereign\" have begun to attack colonies at random. To combat the Geth scientist are in the testing stages of a new weapon that will destroy the Geth code named \"Red Rose\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProject \"Red Rose\" is not necessarily a weapon instead it is a newly devised jammer that is intended to block the Geths ability to communicate with each other and work less effectively. Initial testing phases of this new jammer on several planets during the Geths invasion have proven to be successful however major field testing of Project \"Red Rose\" has yet to be made upon a ship. Current theories are that it can work on any ship ranging from corvette sized ships to dreadnought sized ships. A major draw back of Project \"Red Rose\" is that it renders the \"cloaked\" ability of ships like the \"<i>SSV NORMANDY</i>\" useless when installed on a ship. Current analysis place the cause of this to be due to the amount of heat given off while active as well as the hyper frequency or sub frequency that it can generate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome side notes to keep in consideration:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to keep to the technology level in the game when possible. Though bending the technology curve is allowable just no invincibility shields or \"Death Star\" like weaponry.<br>\r\n2. Feel free to create your own ship but remember a Specter dosent fly around in giant flashy ships that attract every one in the systems attention like a ship the size of dreadnought or carrier.<br>\r\n3. Anything that involves shrinking to six inches tall, the swallowing of, hermaphrodites, inflating, and other varieties of those type's will not be tolerated. There are already far too many of those that involve shrinking, growing, weight gain, Vore, etc. And will subsequently result in me changing your chapter to fit the story sorry.<br>\r\n4.
