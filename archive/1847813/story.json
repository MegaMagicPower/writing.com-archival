Your choice will determine your fate because one way or another your gem will control a part of your destiny. You can choose, go ahead pick, but remember this you are choosing, not just the pretty gem, and the cool name, you are choosing your own fate and destiny in this very choice. You can leave, you can stay, you can choose, or you can skip, it doesn't matter, and you will be back if you don't, because you cannot resist the pull of destiny and an adventure. You can choose between the violet Amethyst: gem of pure magic and courage, made by a fusion of a shard of the Ruby and Sapphire, the silver Diamond: gem of air and compassion, the red Ruby: gem of fire and aggression, the Sapphire: gem of water and calm, or some other gem.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up in your new bed, although it was about three years old it was new to you, you had been moved again this time to a small city named buffalo in New York. It was nice and the people weren't as bad as the last city you were in, you at least had your own room in this orphanage as well. You laid in your bed the entire day dreaming about your fantasies and magic dragons, hoping that one day you could meet one or at least get a family that liked them too. You got increasingly bored and tired throughout the day and didn't even eat dinner, you just day dreamed and laid on your huge chest, which was all you had throughout your life, it had carvings in pure silver done into the top of it depicting multiple dragons around one orb in the middle, the chest was big enough to hold all of your clothes and anything else you gained from your lonely life, and somehow when ever you lost something it was always in the chest. You were doing the same thing that you always did, just laying flat on the huge chest and had your eyes shut to day dream, when a shadow fell over you blocking the light from the nearby window. You just tried to ignore it thinking it was another kid come to pick on you, only to fail as you were able to tune out anything easily. Although after a few seconds of trying to ignore the intruder and them not saying a word you opened your eyes, to the most beautiful sight you had ever seen. A young teenage girl, with fire red hair as clean and smooth as silk, and a completely flawless face showing her bright almost glowing eyes of blue, her body was as curvy and smooth as her hair and she was wearing a long tailed trench coat of black. She also had the most beautiful ring on her right index finger, showing a Celtic looking serpent wrapping around her finger and shining a bright eye of Amethyst. You and her stared at each other for a few seconds, you still looking up from your place on the chest and her just standing in the room. The silence was broken when a woman came in with short black hair and an aviator jacket asking what she was doing standing in the middle of the room, not noticing you at first. You sit up a little showing off your light swimmer's build that you got from swimming leagues around the country, the only thing that you did other than day dreaming. The woman who seemed to be the mother of the young girl spoke up a little first, \"Excuse us, sorry to bother you.\" she says starting to pull the girl from your room.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she does not saying a word as the girl kept staring at you as she was led from the room. You go back to laying down on the chest, thinking why she just stood there and what she wanted. About ten minutes later something completely unexpected and life changing happened, the girl came back into your room and stared at you for another few seconds before you decided to finally speak to her, \"Like what you see?\" you ask smirking.<br>\r\nShe blushes a little before you hear her sweet quiet voice for the first time, \"Yes, actually I like \"what I see\" so much I convinced my mom to do something, try and guess what.\" she says plainly with a bit of a smile.<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat as you hear this thinking right away that the impossible, what you thought would never happen is, you just got adopted. You pause for a second before answering her, \"...What...would that be?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing special.\" she says modestly as she walks about the room, \"Just bought something...you know Mom, right brother?\"\u00a0<br>\r\nYour heart almost bursts out of your chest and you feel like jumping up and hugging the young girl in front of you, that is now your sister. You hold yourself back keeping the cool demeanor that you always had, \"...Your mom...adopted me?\" you ask showing your disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what I just said?\"\u00a0<br>\r\nThis time you do jump up off of the chest hugging her and lifting her off the ground. You laugh and celebrate with her for a few minutes before finally sitting back down on the chest.<br>\r\n\"So you gonna come out of your room or are you going to stay here?\" she asks after she stops laughing and heads for the door.<br>\r\n\"Ok one second just let me get my stuff and this chest, and can you send someone to help me lift it?\" you ask getting a few clothes and throwing them onto the chest.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's yours?\" she asks uncertain.<br>\r\n\"Yeah a chest like this is not something an orphanage would have.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh well...I don't think that...will fit.\" she says to which you freeze and stare at the chest.<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...so what your saying is...that I'm going to have to leave the one thing I've ever owned in my life?\" you say thinking that you will have to leave it.<br>\r\n\"Well...yes? You see...I don't think it will fit...\" she says afraid you'll\u00a0get mad.<br>\r\n\"Sure it will...it has too, we'll just throw it in the trunk.\" you try and reason almost talking to yourself.<br>\r\n\"Well we don't have a trunk it's a convertible.\" she says backing from the room.<br>\r\n\"...but...this is all I have...\" you stammer out.<br>\r\n\"Well you'll have so much more at our place. It's just a chest, what do you need it for anyways?\" she says trying to reason with you.</span></div></div>",

Your temporarily blinded by the bright sun and when your vision comes back you see a very clean looking hard top convertible that also looked very expensive. You pause for a few seconds reliving the thought of finally being free from the lonely poor orphanages you lived in all your life.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren's mother honks the horn calling you to get in as the top slides back and folds away, you shake your head clear and head over to the car and get in next to Saren in the back. Her mom revs the engine up showing off a little and then takes off down the road at almost full speed, Seren's red hair was flying in the wind and you were pushed back into your seat as the car cruised on down the road, you watched the orphanage until it disappeared from sight then you watched the buildings as they zoomed by, daydreaming about how good your life will be now \u00a0that you actually have a family and a friendly fortunate one at that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You have lived with your new family for almost a month now and it has been great. Your new family wasn't just prosperous, they were loaded. They had a big mansion, two cars from the convertible Mustang that you first rode in to an Aston Martin, they had a small personal Cessna plane, they also had a huge indoor pool and you even got the room with the $2,000 computer, which is how you spent most of your time when you weren't day dreaming or going to your new school. You actually went to the private school that Seren attended and you had all of her classes as well. Over the few weeks you were with them you had fallen in love with both your family, and Seren. Seren was a bit of a wildflower, she flirted with almost every boy, although she never actually acted serious, almost like she was teasing them. She also got into trouble a lot and used you to hide behind when there was danger, and everyone stayed away from you mostly, you weren't huge or anything, you were actually about as tall as Seren but you had just a dark thoughtful look about you that everyone noticed. They were almost afraid of what you could do if anyone challenged you, and they were right to be, you had fought a lot all over the country from orphanage to orphanage and learned a great deal of ways to defend yourself, there was no doubt you could hold your own if the situation came up. Although, you didn't like that, even when you weren't protecting Seren, people avoided you for the same reason, you looked dark and battle hardened. You almost always were looking into the distance completely tuned out and when you weren't doing that you were watching Seren.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind the privacy but you still wanted friends to talk to and hang out with. Right now though all you had was Seren, but even that was restricted on account of her over protective father, you couldn't sit too close to her, you couldn't hug only shake hands, the list went on. He still didn't trust you and almost hated the fact that Seren and her mother adopted you without telling him. He really thought you were some stupid orphan that couldn't read and hit on girls all the time, but you surprised him when you protected Seren from a drunken man that had started to put his hands on her a little too invasively, not only your instincts were acting up but also your jealousy, and after he tried something even more invasive, you let him have it. The police arrived shortly after and asked what happened, and you really didn't think the story, of how the guy tripped on the curb, was too believable if you counted the bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver this time you had also read pretty much every story, in Seren's father's huge study, that was about dragons, phoenixes, griffins, or any other creature that existed in the imaginative corners of mankind's mind. You had read and learned everything that was in the books and soon became an expert on the subject, and whenever a project would come up you would do so well on it, if you were able to tweak it to include myth and magic, that multiple teachers asked why you were in their class still.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in all have had a great time with your new family and loved the change in destiny from the dull orphan life you once had. You loved your family and life so much, and even though you were treated more like a friend that was allowed to stay at their place and not one of the family you still loved it. You also liked how you were treated because it would be less awkward if you ever told Seren how you really felt about her, she was beautiful, young, strong willed, smart and courageous. She was literally perfect in every way for you, although you still needed to gain the full and unwavering trust from her parents before you even acted like you liked her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day that you were going to try your luck for the first time with Seren, you were up in your room playing an online game over the Internet with some friends you had found online as a storm slowly started up outside. As you tried asking your friends what the best way to approach it was you heard a huge bang at the front door. You told them you'd be right back as you go to investigate. You had decided to stay home alone tonight and skip the swim meet, and plan how to approach the subject, so you thought it might be your family home early or something. You look outside your bedroom door and wait and listen for the sound again. You hear the wind whistling outside, the rain hitting the house, and a few small claps of thunder, but nothing else. You go to see what your friends said in reply to your question, but, as soon as you pull your head back in and take one step, you hear the wind howl and the bang comes once more. You jump at the noise at first then you head down the stairs and look out the window to see who, or what, was making the noise. You can't see anything through the darkness and rain at first, but then right as the wind picks up and you hear the bang again the sky lights up with the almost blinding glow of a bolt, to show a chest sitting at the doorstep and the wind brutally blowing the top open and slamming it against the door. You squint your eyes to get a better look as another bolt burns the sky and see what looks like the silver carvings that were on your old chest, but you had left it behind almost a month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to see if it was your old chest or not and you rushed over to the door and unlocked the bolt and threw open the door only to get hit and knocked down by the lid of the huge chest opening and smacking you right in the head. You sit back up and rub your head before getting up and dragging the chest inside and closing the door. You go into the bathroom to get a towel to dry up the rain that got inside when you opened the door, but when you get back you take one look at the top of the chest and drop the towel. The old silver engraved design of the dragons around the orb was glowing and changing. The orb in the middle divided into many different gem shaped pieces and the dragons grabbed onto them and looked menacingly at the other dragons. You stood frozen staring at the design as it stopped moving and the glowing slowly went down until a shine went across each dragon and gem in different colors, Ruby red, Sapphire blue, Emerald green, Topaz gold, Diamond silver, and Amethyst violet.</span></div></div>",

This is a strict interactive and was supposed to be a static story but, after I thought about it, I decided to make it interactive. The main story line is mine and only I am aloud to add to it unless stated otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The main character can not die and neither can Forta, Saren, or other main characters and the like unless I state otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please be descriptive and spelling and grammar smart. Plus please keep small chapters to a minimum and if you do need short ones make sure to add to one of the options soon before I delete it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Keep it interesting. I don't want short stupid entries like \"Ok what color flower do you like?\" Don't mean to hurt anyones feelings, but all I'm saying is be descriptive and try and make your chapter as long as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Please add when possible. I will try to make you as many choices as I can. I want you to add as you can because I might use some of your ideas to make the main story line better and other things like that. You will get credit if I borrow an idea and I will ask you first if you are willing to let me use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Breuddwydio Melys (Sweet Dreaming)</td>",
