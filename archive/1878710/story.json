It's okay if you don't go to college, your father didn't!\" My mom says, halfway through the car door still worried out of her little brown head. I giggle, pushing her the rest of the way in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mom, we can't come all this way, get me moved in, then turn around.\" I say, flashing her a reassuring grin. No way was I going to let my mother's nervous delusions stop me from being a successful vet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right sweetheart, I'm sorry... Be a good girl, okay? I love you so much.\" My mother says, giving me a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom come on, I'm not a toddler, you don't need to tell me to 'be a good girl'.. I love you to.\" I say quietly, looking around and blushing. I don't think anyone saw. She merely chuckles at me, waving goodbye as she backs away. Once she's left eyesight I sigh, one weight leaving my body and the other filling my entire being with dread. I didn't think the 'college experience' would be quite like this. I was originally just going to work at the family bookstore, but all of a sudden in december I got an offer for a full ride at this place I'd never heard of before, UoRS, University of Res Peurilis or something like that, must be a spanish name or something. We were all shocked, I was only a C student, sometimes even D's, but we were not going to turn down an offer like that. It's even an all woman college! While my father may not know, that is.. Let's see it's perfect for my taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some oddities, like nobody I know having ever heard of it, and the fact that they didn't hold an orientation or even virtual tour, but I just chalked it all up to this being a new school. The facilities all look very new.. Except for my dorm, that is. It wasn't even on the map, we had to ask around for twenty minutes before we found it. Then once we finally did it turned out to be some crumby, run of the mill apartment complex that got bought out by the school and doesn't start renovations until next semester. Even weirder, all of main campus is apparently locked off to the public until tonight, when a freshman welcoming orientation begins. Which I'm sooo excited.. Okay I can't lie, it's got me in a nervous wreck. But one of my strong points has always been making friends and being sociable, so I'm sure this will go over great! At least, that's how Mom put it, and she generally... overhypes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and flop onto the bed once I get back. I'm gonna get sick of all those stairs, my stubby legs can only move me so fast! It seems like almost as soon as I lay down though there's a knock on the door. I groan and get up, I wanted to at least unpack my things before people came by.. \"I thought we weren't getting any roommates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you sweet thing, it's been forever since I was in a dorm room as a student.\" A blonde woman who can't be past the age of thirty says, giggling as she strolls into my room wheeling some weird assortment of devices and wires in behind her then closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't remember reading about.. Any of... this.\" I say, gesturing to all the wires as she motions for me to sit on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about these. I'm just going to perform a checkup or two on you, and no needles! Once that's done I'll print your student card for you and you can go visit the main campus.\" She says, turning some knobs and other things before finally pulling out a thermometer... an odd looking one. \"Alright, butt out panties down.\" I gasp, my hands shooting to the back of my skirt. \"O-Oh, I'm sorry! I always forget, where I come from we pretty much only took temperatures this way, I'm sorry.\" She says, awkwardly laughing as she pulls out a normal thermometer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the checkup went without a hitch and she gave me my student ID. Thankfully enough when I got it the picture on it was of a five foot tall polynesian girl with short black hair grinning back at me. For a while I was worried that I might have shown up at the wrong UoRS... Somehow. And there was one more thing she forgot to mention at the door.. The white shirt and pink miniskirt combo that most of the girls I've seen getting on the bus to the main campus have been wearing. It almost looks like a sailor suit but something feels even more.. Childish about this so called 'orientation outfit', I mean it just barely goes to my mid-thigh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, you look adorable, come sit on mama's lap!\" A very mature womanly voice calls from the other end of the bus after I've been standing there a few minutes tugging on my skirt, due to all the seats being taken. I-Is somebody hitting on me before classes have even begun!? I smile and look around for the one who's calling me, my heart thumping hard. I've had so few romantic encounters back at home.. But already? Maybe college isn't so bad! Ah, there she is, an average height blonde with long hair sitting in the back wearing casual wear! an upperclassmen, interesting. I walk up to her nervously, smiling at her and her two friends, one with clearly dyed blonde hair, the other about my height with shoulder length brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Helo I-I.. um..\" Oh god, what are you doing stumbling over your words now..? I jump a little in surprise and feel my cheeks flush as they squee softly, the blonde pulling me onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're just so cute Malu!\" Ah, right, there's a name tag pinned on my chest, just like a preschooler. I guess that's standard stuff for orientations though. I whimper as they continue to coo over me and tease and snuggle me, rubbing my arms and legs some. People don't see my skin color a lot around here, between asian and hispanic, it always draws a lot of eyes to me. I don't mind all the attention but adding in all this skinship.. My face must be bright as a fire, and I'm feeling a bit lightheaded. \"Wow, she's really packing!\" I gasp as I feel the blonde woman grope me through my shirt, getting a good feel of my chest. \"Hey Malu, what size are you?\" She says warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just D... C-Could you please let me up?\" I say quietly, biting my lip and squeaking as she suddenly pinches my nipple, one hand going up my shirt. Okay, I'm not happy with this, this isn't romantic at all! People aren't looking at least. \"Hya!\" The girls snicker as she finally gets a quiet moan out of me, giving both of my breasts a rather deep massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby quit bullying the freshmen!\" A tall woman with dirty blonde hair cries out, suddenly grabbing my hand and pulling me off of her lap, sending a shiver down my spine as she puts a hand around my waist and smiles down at me. Ah, my knees feel like jelly.. \"At least control yourselves until after classes have started!\" She says sternly, glaring at the girls who were molesting me, who just sit there and smile playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right. We'll leave little Malu to you then.\" She says, getting up and signalling for her girls to leave with her. Ah, it seems we've arrived. I feel another shock as she smiles at me reassuringly, waving as she walks off the bus. No, she can't just leave like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on!\" I say, getting off after her. She looks back at me, looking a little annoyed. I gulp, tugging on the front of my skirt and looking down at the ground. \"Th-Thank you for helping me. My name is Malu.\" I say, looking up at her hopefully. She groans, seemingly deep in thought for a few seconds before she sighs, patting my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing pipsqueak, but now you got off at the wrong stop. The name's Frejya by the way.\" She says, taking my hand. Her hand is nice and soft, her fingers long and strong.. Okay Malu, pull yourself together, your constant blushing is probably weirding her out. Wait, wrong stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here then..?\" I ask as she lead me back to the bus stop. She looks back at me curiously, grinning as I make it clear by pointing to her outfit. Unlike the bully she's wearing similar clothes to me, though they fit her way better.. And her skirt's longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstood, I'm a sophomore.\" She says, indicating the red ribbon on her outfit. Because something that small being the indicator won't cause any confusion. \"Alright, now be good and you'll probably still make it on time, okay? And don't let any seniors lay a single hand on you!\" She says sternly, patting my head again when I nod meekly. I sigh, watching longingly as she walks away. I'm curious about where she's headed to, and I want to know more about her, but I also don't want to miss the very first college event of my lifetime.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She may have been a little demeaning about it but she's right, I shouldn't be late. So I swallow my desire and wait for the shuttle to come, sighing longingly as I manage to get a seat off of somebody's lap this time, watching the town and upperclassmen go by. I guess they don't have to go, makes sense, but then why was Freyja dressed like that? Suddenly the smell of urine pulls me out of my train of thought, gasping as I notice the girl across from me red as a firecracker, a puddle by her feet and her own pink skirt soaked as her friend gets her up, comforting her. \"I'm very sorry, please don't be upset with her.\" She says apologetically, looking at me. I just nod awkwardly, moving to the back of the bus. Both of them get off early, presumably to go handle the girl's accident... Didn't those two have red ribbons though? I guess sophomores aren't any more immune to accidents than the rest of us, but why were they headed to the orientation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ride is uneventful, but I do get a nice look at the campus. It's not the largest, but every facility looks very nice, and there are no roads through the campus itself, a vibrant green lawn covering most of the campus. The building's look big enough but I have no idea which is which, the dorms right on campus are pretty big, and the stadium is right on the edge of campus, still conveniently close to everything else. New facilities are great, I don't think any other college would have been quite this pleasing and convenient. There's only me and a few other girls left walking into the stadium, the last flow before things begin, all of us first years. The stadium is actually smaller than I expected, holding maybe five hundred, all of us only filling half of the stadium. It's got a pink and white aesthetic, with a stage set in the front, like an auditorium. Thankfully I'm able to get a seat close to the front, next to some not so noisy girls. I want my first impressions to be that I'm a good, respecting student!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cacophony of gossiping girls simmers down as the lights dim, all focused on the stage. An average height asian woman with some large glasses smiles as she walks up to the podium, I think she's the dean. \"Hello freshmen, and thank you for choosing UoRS!\" She says, the crowd cheering loudly. \"I'm glad to see so many beautiful girls this year, I'm envious of your youth. Anyways, this old woman will keep her speech brief so you can go have fun.\" She says, clearing her throat and shuffling her papers. Please, she's at worst in her fifties. \"We hope you all have a lot of fun and learn a lot this year. I'm sure we'll be sending a lot of wonderful woman into the working world in four years time. Now without further ado, your student council president would like to deliver an address on conduct, classes, and your general well being.\" She says, the crowd clapping loudly as she walks off the stage. Oh boy, some prude is going to get up there and talk about how we shouldn't drink or smoke weed or get in relationships or whatever, perfect. I rest my head on my hand and stare at the stage halfheartedly as we wait for the student council president, overhearing a few girls talking about 'a total hottie'. Well, maybe there's something to look forward to then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening ladies! Do you like what you've seen of the campus so far?\" A high pitched voice booms through the speakers, pulling me out of my daydreaming of Freyja. A girl about my height is standing at the podium, with long brown hair held in a sidetail by a pink scrunchie, wearing a black dress suit, showing her form quite nicely. At least there's some eye candy on stage for this boring seminar. \"Now first, I would like the cutest little girl in the audience to come up here and join me!\" She says, the lights shifting to the crowd as she looks over all of us thoughtfully. My heart beats anxiously, both desiring to get picked and pleading that I don't. She eventually grins as she looks my way, hopping off the stage and dashing straight towards me. \"I like you Malu, let's go!\" She says, holding out her hand. M-Me, the cutest girl out of all of these hotties!? No way! I-I can't!</span></div></div>",

I can't outright deny her, getting picked really made me happy after all. She giggles, patting my head to my discomfort. I straighten my hair out, gulping as she suddenly grabs my hand, pulling me forward through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so worried, it's nothing scary! You'll have to get on a stage sometime, but for now if you get to nervous don't worry about it, we'll just get another girl up here. So do your best!\" She says as she leads me up onto the stage, holding my hand tight. It's strangely comforting even though she's basically telling me to 'suck it up', nodding to her as she gets back on the podium, my shaking having gone down. Heh, she has to stand on a stool behind the podium. \"So, once again, I'm your student council president, Jane, and...\" She steps away, gesturing for me to step up. I gulp, gripping my skirt tight as I get up on the podium, having to raise the mic a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I..I'm Malu.. And I look forward to attending classes with you!\" I say, stammering out the last part quickly and pulling Jane back onto the podium, biting my lip as the crowd claps loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, first I want to talk about the rules. Malu, have you read the Freshman-specific rulebook?\" Jane says, an excited smile on her face. She must really like the rules, I guess she is the student body president. I shake my head no, our presenter looking a little more excited now. I jump a little as I suddenly hear some sort of snapping noise all around and some quiet murmurs from the audience, but Jane just smiles at me reassuringly so I'll ignore it for now. \"Oh but that's my favorite part of this entire school!\" She says, hooking up a mic to her collar as she steps off the podium, holding both my hands. \"I'm sure you all love those full scholarships, right?\" W-Wait what, every freshmen got a full ride here!? \"Well if you read your fine print like attentive girls, you'd notice that you all got a full ride because not only are you attending, but you've also been 'hired' for our university's activities.\" She says. What? What does that mean..? \"Ah, you look confused. Multiple experiments are conducted here yearly, largely on development and social experiments, but there's one in-particular that was the reason this school got funded in the first place five years ago.\" She says, looking over my shoulder as I hear some things get rolled onto the stage behind me. W..Is that a changing table..? \"Oh let's just cut to the point, I've been dying for this moment! All freshmen, with exception for medical conditions, are from this point on infants!\" She says, a deafening uproar rising from the crowd. I gasp as she tugs me towards the changing table suddenly, pushing me up onto it. I go along with her in my confusion, a little afraid of how hard my reputation would be hit if I ran off stage now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What in the world does that mean!?\" I cry, suddenly silenced as she slips a rubber nipple into my mouth, grinning down at me sadistically with a hand on my chest to keep me in my place. How much muscle is she hiding under those sleeves!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means exactly what it sounds like Malu! All of you freshmen are babies, and there's nothing you can do about it. If you leave the campus prematurely or disobey you'll be breaching the contract and fined ten times the amount we are paying to have you!\" I feel my heart sink as the news hits me, the crowd suddenly growing quiet as well. A baby..? I'm already teased over my height constantly, b-but baby!? What about college!? \"I won't explain to many of the rules, I don't want all you little girls getting tired or give your mommies nothing to tell you about, plus who tells a baby all the rules?\" She says with a chuckle, ignoring my horrified face as she strips me of my panties, holding them up like a treasure. \"Ooooh these are so cute! Wearing panties with bunnies on them even though she's eighteen! I'm soooo jealous of whoever gets Malu as their baby!\" She says as I cover my face in shame. I knew I should have stayed in the crowd god damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommies..?\" I mutter hesitantly, though I already have an idea of what that may be. She beams, taking my legs and putting them in spreaders on each side of the table, fully exposing everything under my skirt, though only Jane could see it well right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, upperclassmens who are in the child care program! We have a lot of majors that heavily involve things like child care, understanding, treatment, all sorts of things! Aaaah you're even already hairless, you're such a perfect baby Malu! Well behaved to!\" She says, taking out a ridiculously thick white diaper, unfolding it and slipping it under my bottom very quickly with expertise. \"And that's why you get to be the first baby diapered! Who's a good baby, who's my good wittle girl? You are!\" She says in a childish tone, shaking a rattle as she rubs baby oil into my diaper area and then coats my diaper area and thighs in baby powder, sweet smelling and thorough. Very quickly she folds the diaper up between my legs, the padding actually so thick that I have no choice but to keep my legs spread even if they were out of the spreader, and tapes it snugly in place, looking down at her work proudly and patting the thick poof between my legs before removing my legs from the spreaders, sitting me up on the edge.I tug on the skirt desperately trying to cover it, but it won't even cover half of my diaper! \"Naughty girl!\" I yelp as she suddenly slaps my hands, pouting at me as the pacifier tumbles out of my mouth. \"Good girls don't even touch their skirts, so mommy can check their diapys easily.\" She says with a suddenly stern tone, putting the pacifier in my mouth again and holding it in place as I try to spit it out, grinning. \"You will all receive punishments fitting for a baby of course, you all agreed to it in the contracts after all. Spankings, enemas, time outs, etcetera. And your mommies will be more than happy to deliver them.\" She says with a sadistic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough talk about naughty girls and Mommys!\" She says, grabbing my hand and pulling me off the table. I gasp as my feet touch the ground, having to lean against her just to stay up, the diaper forcing my legs apart. \"Tonight you'll only be fed bottles with muscle relaxant in them, and tomorrow is when the fun begins. You'll all start out in diapys like Malu here's, the thickest we've got that will keep you from walking on your own so you can't wander off easily.\" She says, kissing my cheek as tears well up in my eyes. \"There are ten different levels of potty training, and you'll all be starting at the same level as Malu here at level 1, the same as a newborn baby! Level six is where Mommy will start letting you wear training panties, and your student ID cards will allow you access to the bathrooms alone. It's also the potty training level you need to be at or higher by the end of the semester if you don't want to be a freshman again.\" She says, swallowing a lump in my throat at the thought. W-Well, I'm already potty trained so it shouldn't be hard at all, right? \"You've all been assigned a daycare class based on your schedules you filled out that you will attend every weekday as long as your mommies have class, where we'll keep your potty charts. The two babies that have the least accidents that week in the class get to move up a level in potty training, while the two who have the most accidents go down a level. Of course, if you're at level one already you instead get scheduled spankings for every used diaper for a week, and punishments before and after bed and naptime.\" She says, patting my padded ass and holding me in place. \"Sadly I think the time has come for you to go get picked up by your Mommies.\" She says, looking at me sadly. \"Be a good girl Malu, come play with Jane sometime...\" She says, kissing my forehead before picking me up and carrying me to my seat, were I get sat down and immediately strapped in. \"Now remember, sophomore mommies only get two babies, juniors and seniors get three. So don't bother a Mommy you like to much if she already has enough babies!\" She says as child harnesses are suddenly attached to us from the back of the seats, squeezing my chest tight. I watch as slowly the rows are filtered out, the leashes of the child harnesses getting grabbed by several upperclassmen with red and blue ribbons that pull all the girls along at the end of their leashes, clearly not very happy to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, I c-hya!\" I yelp as my leash gets a hard tug, sniffling as I get up on all fours, feeling more tugs from whoever's holding my leash. I stare at the ground in shame as I'm forced to crawl along behind them, hearing a few girls giggling at me even though they're about to be in the same position in mere moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Malu? Do you want me to carry you?\" A concerned freshman says, looking down at me. An average height girl with no chest to speak of and her black hair in a ponytail, clearly strong. O-Oh my, she's wearing black lacy panties. \"You look light, I'm sure I can do it!\"</span></div></div>",

A few other girls chime in as well, looking at me expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...It's soft... and heavy...

W-Well, I was coming here for veterinary studies. Hell if I know if I'll get that education any more though, maybe they have an accelerated curriculum for sophomore.\" She mutters, gritting her teeth. \"If I just did a bit more studying for that algebra final I wouldn't be showing off my tummy and on a leash right now.\" She says. Ah, it's true, it seems like they didn't have a uniform that quite fit her either so the skirt goes a little past mid thigh but her shirt only goes down to above her tummy... W-What would it be like if she had had a chest..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was coming for vet studies as well!\" I say enthusiastically, finally something remotely positive! She beams, getting into a discussion about how her older sister is a vet on call in Nova Scotia and some of her adventures there. She's so enthusiastic about it it's a little difficult for me to cut in and tell my own tales, but I don't really mind it since she's having such a good time. She has to come to an abrupt stop though as we finally reach one of the dorm buildings in the center of campus, the entire lobby is designed like an oversized children's playspace. I can see why the campus was closed off now, would spoil the surprise. Spread throughout the lobby are,a side from all the toys and shit, upperclassmen wearing the same uniform as us but with the ribbons, a pink changing mat and a stroller by each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright babies, go crawl to the mommy you want!\" One of the people who lead us on our leashes says, dropping them all. \"Babies that walk will get a playdate with Ms.Paddle!\" Charlotte gulps, setting me down on my rear and sitting down herself, the rest of the girls following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know any of these upperclassmen Malu? I'll follow you since you're the only one I know here.\" She says, blushing as she looks around. I gulp, getting up on my knees to get a look around as well. I feel my heart sink as I see Frejya, blushing lightly but waving to me, some rattles and bunny plushies on her lap. I jump a little as the door is suddenly slammed open behind us, Charlotte tugging on my sleeve. \"S-She went to my high school, she was the student body vice president and really nice!\" She says, piquing my interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mommy's late kiddies! Now who wants to be the baby of the best potty training Junior in this whole school?\" Abby says, grinning enthusiastically, wearing a t-shirt that says 'Tough love' in pink with a heart on it and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She molested me on the bus!\" I cry, Charlotte looking at me in surprise. \"Are you sure she's the same girl that was in your high school..?\" I mutter, gulping as she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Malu! Hey, I'd love to be your mommy, come here sweetie!\" Abby says once she notices me, kneeling down and shaking a rattle. I gulp, looking back at Frejya, who is still smiling, shaking a rattle a little as well, about to crawl to her but freezing as she waves to another baby as well. D-Does she really want me to come..? Maybe with Charlotte here she could keep Abby in check... What do I do!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as I feel like I'll regret this, I want to try trusting my new friend here, plus I at least know that Abby has some genuine interest in me instead of just being a girl she helped or something. So reluctantly I start crawling to Abby, who beams at me with joy. \"There we go, what a smawt wittle girl!\" She says, patting me on the head. \"Ah an you brought a friend! You're a little cutie to Charlotte.\" She says, Charlotte groaning as she pats her on the head. \"Come on, you need a diaper like your sister.\" She says, making her lay down on the changing mat, blushing light red as she takes off her panties. \"Oh my, looks like I'll have to teach you two to never wear these type of naughty, naughty panties again. But that can wait.\" She says, me and Charlotte looking at each other and gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean this isn't just a prank or some harmless fun or something?\" Charlotte says quietly, slapping away the rattle that 'mommy' shakes at her while she slides the diaper under her, pouting. \"You're a Junior, what... exactly is all this like..?\" She asks, Abby tilting her head curiously and grinning. That is admittedly a good question, I wanted to ask her myself but was a little.. afraid to. Oh no, I feel something building in my bladder... When was the last time I used the bathroom? I can't go in this, right..? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is super duper serious! Don't worry, in time you two will either learn to love it, want to be a mommy like me or... Well.. The babies who get held back normally spend summer and all their breaks with their Mommies.\" She says, grinning at me. I gulp, tugging on her sleeve hesitantly. \"Yes, what is it princess?\" She asks, not turning away as she rubs some oil onto Charlotte, who lets out a few squeaks and squirms. She's really touchy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go use the bathroom..\" I mutter quietly, gulping and feeling my cheeks light up as she giggles, turning around and holding me by the waist, her other hand pressed against my padded crotch, pressing the padding against me gently. \"A-Abby please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't baby. Potty training doesn't start until you start daycare tomorrow, and it'll take even longer before I start potty training you two at home. Tonight and tomorrow morning you and every other little girl on this campus are using your diapers to the fullest.\" She says, grinning with delight as I start shaking and get teary eyed, feeling myself already lose control as I start wetting myself, the nasty warm wet padding pressed against my skin. \"Wow, you're already going! I couldn't have even gotten you to the bathroom if I tried!\" She says enthusiastically, having a little to much fun squishing and rubbing my wet diaper. \"What a good girl! Be happy you aren't getting potty trained right now, you'd be getting a spanking instead of praised.\" She says, lifting up my skirt. \"You can still wet it further so you're keeping that on Malu. Now be a good girl while Mommy changes your sister's diaper.\" She says, making me sit down with a rattle. My heart is fluttering in my chest and I feel awful, like all eyes are on me, I just wanna go lie back in my bed and sleep. People are watching, because I'm the first one to use my diaper.. Somebody else please lose control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, all done and happy! That wasn't so bad now was it sweetie?\" Abby says as she sits up Charlotte, who's pouting and red like a beet, staring down at her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean... I guess it feels kind of nice.. But then it feels way more humiliating than nice... And stuffy.\" She mutters, the enthusiasm that had been in her eyes before faded into the distance. Abby smiles regardless, grabbing the handles to both of our child leashes and dragging us to the two person stroller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, ashamed little girls are good little girls. Most of the time.\" She says as she puts me into the stroller, a strap going between my legs and then over my shoulders, connecting to keep me in place.  (Pause here so I don't lose work, will add later.)</span></div></div>",

She wasn't particularly outstanding with her looks and grades either. Lily was very short and had small, almost embarrassing A-cup breasts. Her butt was rather small and unimpressive as well. She typically wore her long dark hair down, which sharply contrasted with her pale skin, pale because she didn't get out enough. Lily typically spent much of her time writing poetry and sharing it with her other nerdy friends, so she didn't go outside much (wanting to experience the world and go to parties was the reason she wanted to join the sorority in the first place). All in all, Lily was a scrawny loser, not someone usually thought of as sorority material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Yet here she was, little loser Lily walking across campus to the Pledge Ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus sidewalks were strangely barren. Very few people were out there. Everyone was still on summer break, so Lily wasn't quite aware yet about her university's... eccentric traditions yet. The tradition was, of course, that freshman students, especially sorority girls, dressed and were treated like babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily got to the sorority house and knocked on the door. Inside, the house leader, Vicky, looked through the peephole.<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Vicky said through the door, an evil smile on her face.<br>\r\nVicky had more of the typical sorority look: tall, athletic, an blonde. She was quite excited to be babying and diapering little Lily.<br>\r\n\"Hi, it's me, Lily. Remember form the campus mixer a while back?\" Lily said.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, well you're in luck!

They don't all have to take place in the same school, or with the same circumstances, the same characters, or anything. However I will say this, if someone started off a story before you and you plan to add to it, please respect what has been previously written about the characters. Don't just suddenly make the character okay with something they weren't previously without reason. It would be pretty jarring for readers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No vore, gore, inflation, weight gain, size manipulation, character death,or abrupt ending.<br>\r\n-Make them wet or mess eventually<br>\r\n-Humiliate them, don't go easy on them<br>\r\n-BDSM, pet play, humiliation, etc. are all okay.<br>\r\n-Have fun!<br>\r\n-I normally don't allow male characters, but I will allow them in this one. However, I will note that if a character's sexuality, gender preference, whatever is pointed out, then please respect that. It would be extremely odd to have a character be a staunch lesbian one chapter, and then the next she's having intense consensual sex with two guys and a goat in a burkah.</td>",
