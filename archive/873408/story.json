They were too bare, with few remaining leaves clinging despite the lashing of the wind.  Considering the distance of the lodge across the clearing, a clearing with deep valleys that would be now filled with streams of water gushing from the saturated soil of the hills, he cursed his decision to leave his jacket in the car.  The nippy breeze earlier in the day hadn't deterred him from his errand.  Neither had the call for storms.  Trevor didn't mind either, separately.  The mix of the suddenly-dropped temperature, the sleeting rain, and near-complete black, however, forced thoughts of returning to his car.  Even that would take effort with the seventy-mile-an-hour winds the weatherman had predicted appearing to be upon him and his car a couple of city blocks away. If he had still been in the city, that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was there, in the lodge, escaping him.  Escaping them. He couldn't allow it.</span></div></div>",

I should have a shower, look at my hair! It hasn't been this greasy since I spent a week with my sister. Get up, Eliza. Get up.

She darts over to the unlit fire and grabs the poker, gripping it close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Knock-knock.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza lets out a terrified scream. \"No!

Royce studied her name-tag, then her movement and apparent emotions, <i>you won't be any difficulty.</i>  He walked over to the counter and politely sat down.  He sat next to the waitress, so she would notice him quicker.

They could feel a great amount of power radiating off of him in waves. \"My name is Axel...

Curiousity worked hand in hand with stupidity and I ran after the group. It wasn't long before they stopped in a small clearing deep in the woods. If they didn't want to be discovered this seemed like the perfect place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do Ginny?\" Another girl's voice, not like the other, asked. I crept closer and was able to put faces to the voices. The two girls were not wearing anything winter related and the boy seemed barely alive.

The kid was supposed to retrieve and return something pivotal to peace between gods and mortals, but was killed by a traitor. Only Hestia and Poseidon saw reason, and now all the gods are coming to destroy our world.\" Ginny finished. Ann backed up against a wall, her eyes wide. A moan came from the corner, and Ann rushed to her boyfriend's side.<br>\r\n \"So what can we do? And how do you know this?\" Trevor asked. Ginny looked down.<br>\r\n \"I knew a demigod. Granddaughter of Athena. I don't know what we can do, but I know some people who can. I'll just get in contact with camp.\" Ginny answered.<br>\r\n\"Contact with camp...\" Elizabeth shook her head. <br>\r\nGinny pulled something out of her pocket. She walked over to the sink, and turned on the faucet, spraying the water in front of the dim ray of light projected from a prism. \"Oh Isis, goddess of the rainbow, please accept my offering.\" Ginny said, then threw the thing in the rainbow. It disappeared in the spray. \"Show me Prometheus, Camp director.\" The rainbow shimmered, and Ginny turned off the water.<br>\r\n\"Hello Prometheus.\" Ginny said.<br>\r\n\"Hello Ginny.\" the man answered. He had several scars on his face. <br>\r\n\"How's the new location going?\" Ginny asked, Trevor poked her.<br>\r\n\"Alright, of course. I am worried about what happened with Henry. I'm afraid that Zeus, in his anger, might end up destroying himself.\"<br>\r\n\"So what do you suggest we do?\" Ginny whispered.<br>\r\n\"Find a hero, someone you can trust. I'll send Laura and Luke to help you. I must keep Iaen here, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Laura won't like that.\" Ginny chuckled. She looked at the man. \"So, how will you transport them?\"<br>\r\n\"With a camp bus....\"<br>\r\n\"You don't HAVE a camp bus!\"<br>\r\n\"The Hephaestus cabin will help.\"Prometheus answered. A conch shell blew in the distance. \"I must go.\"<br>\r\n\"Prometheus, wait!\" Ginny shouted. But the man in the tuxedo was long gone.<br>\r\nThe gang sat in stunned silence, as Ginny stood, still watching were the screen was. Sobbing came from where Ann and Nicolas were.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was all so sudden that she had no time to think or feel frightened. It was all on instinct. The man was angry, and with each swing it was visible. His hard face was contorted in rage, and as he kept missing, he began to yell in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, finally, the dance of swinging and dodging ended. He swung forcefully, and Misty wasn't fast enough. The hooked side made contact with her arm, and she cried in shock, her arm searing with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled back, her hand reaching up and gripping her arm. Her bent over and grimaced against the sting, and when she peered through the gaps of the blond hair now fallen in her face, saw the man had switched the poker in his other hand and was advancing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to react, and he gripped the front of her blouse with his fist and pushed her up against the wall. \"Want to play games little girl?\" he snarled, his face inches from her. \"'Cause I can play games. We can keep doing this all night if you want, until your friend there tells me where she's hiding the boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza and Ginny were up now. Misty could see Ginny was creeping towards the door to the den were the phone was, and Eliza had made her way to the kitchen counter, her hand slowly reaching out to the block with the knives. Misty knew her friend would never use one, and that it was only for self defense if he tried to attack her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was now arousing from where he passed out on the couch. The man, still gripping her shirt, twisted his head to glance through the doorway that led to the den. Inside, the boy was struggling to sit up, groggy and dazed. \"Ow, my head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled deviously. \"Ah, there he is.\"</span></div></div>",

However, she might as well have been trying to scratch a rock, as all she did was damage her own nails. His skin was tough, and he took no notice of her efforts to break free.

She was at her friend's side in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I thought...\" The girl's eyes were wide as she stared at, but as she glanced around, she couldn't see anything in the dark gloom. She thought she had seen a shadow in the trees. Was her mind just playing tricks on her? \"Uh, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away then, her mind and stomach reeling. The smell of Trevor's blood and the death she had just witnessed made her want to throw up and cry her eyes out, but she had to keep moving. It wasn't safe here. She needed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn touched her arm gently and the two of them joined Luke and opened the back door cautiously. The man glanced out, assessing the darkness outside, and then nodded to them. The three of them quietly crept out and skirted the edge of the cabin, their eyes darting to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza was crying silently now. Tears streaked down her face as if a faucet was suddenly turned on and broken so that it was impossible to turn off. One agonizing thought kept ringing in her mind: Trevor's dead... Trevor's dead... Trevor's dead....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke glanced back and saw Eliza. A sad look came on his face, but he did nothing else to comfort her. There was no use telling her that everything was going to be okay, because they all knew that that was unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the far side of the house, Luke stopped. Rain was pelting down on them hard and Luke's long brown hair was plastered around his face, appearing black in the night. His clothes were soaked and now the girls could see the muscular build the see-through white shirt revealed. They didn't know him well, but they suddenly felt very safe with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go back to the car,\" he said matter-of-factly, his face grim. The girls already knew that. If anyone was waiting for them, they would be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where can we go?\" Robyn asked. She was shivering next to Eliza, for she too was soaked to the bone. The wind blew viciously through the trees, and Luke hoped that the weather would aid them in keeping them concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a cave near the mountain. It'll be safe there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza squinted in the night and spotted the loom of the large rocky hill above the trees. It was close, but it would take a long time to get there. \"Do you think we can make it without them seeing us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was still staring out at the mountain, lost in thought, \"I don't know. But we have to try.\" He turned around to face the younger woman, her hair black because of the rain. \"We can't go back in the house, but we need something to use to protect us. Do you have a garden shed nearby? Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza nodded gravely. \"Yes. I have a shovel inside that I think would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn and Eliza watched Luke for a moment as the thought, and then he nodded. \"Alright, show me too it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza crept back a little and skirted a few dark evergreens. The three of them traveled deeper into the woods, their eyes straining in the darkness, until they reached a small shed. Luke pushed through and grabbed the handle. As quietly as he could, he pulled it open. It creaked, and the three of them clenched their teeth, but soon Luke had it open and stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark and cramped, with pot and soil bags pilled on the ground. The man had to tip toe his way carefully around the things so not to hit one with his feet or trip. The girls were peeking through and watching him maneuver his way in. \"The shovel is in the back next to the weed-whacker,\" Eliza hissed. Her hands clenched the side of the door and her ears and eyes were alert for any movement of noise around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke saw the shovel and exhaled in relief. He reached out and delicately grabbed it, careful not to hit it against anything. With as much care as if handling a new-born child, he held it and crept back out of the shed. Eliza silently shut the door behind him, and the three of them looked at the shovel in relief.  It was short, but had a very strong wooden neck and a very sharp and hard shovel end. It was shaped like a pentagon, so the end was a definite point, perfect for defending yourself with. Luke held it closely, and he nodded to us and turned around to face the way of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hurried out, flanking the trees and trying to avoid the leafy ground as much as possible. If anyone was around, they didn't want the crunch of the leaves to reveal their position. They ran on in silence, their eyes flickering around them, alert for any sign of life. The wind howled by; covering their sound, and thunder clapped above. The three of them had never been so thankful for a storm in all their life. It seemed that the earth itself was on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about twenty minute in and climbing a hill when they heard it. The wind had carried the sound to them, and the sky was still when the gun shot rang out. It was quiet and muffled though, and they knew that it was far away -- back at the house -- but they stopped and glanced back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gun shot,\" Luke said, answering Robyn. He was staring the way they came, his shovel held firmly. Eliza's mind was reeling. Who would they be shooting at...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the man. Eliza realized she had asked it out loud. \"But we can't stay standing here any longer.\" He lightly grabbed Eliza's arm, and steered her away. They continued their rush for escape, climbing higher until they reached the crest of the hill and glanced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFields spread ahead of them, the moonlight illuminating the wide expanse of land. They had reached near the edge of the forest then, and were staring ahead of them nervously. They all knew that once they left, they would be exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to keep going. Only once we reach the cave can we be safe for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't say anything, but they thought the same. They made their way carefully down the large hill, and soon were skirting the first field. The rain was harder here, and the wind battered them painfully, sending chills down their spines. They felt miserable, but they kept pushing ahead, their quest giving them faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon had risen high in the sky when they were at their last field. Just a little farther and they would be at the base of the mountain where they would be sheltered by the trees again. Then they could begin searching for the cave entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light flashed in the corner of the travelers' eyes as lightening forked and struck a tree near them. A heartbeat later the sky clashed in thunder and the three of them jumped. Eliza felt as if her heart had leapt out of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" Robyn said while staring at the tree in fear. She hurried forward next to Luke's side. Eliza suspected that the girl liked Luke, but now wasn't a time to be thinking about crushes. Eliza hurried too, and soon they were walking side by side, Luke in the middle with the shovel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last they reached the cover of the trees. Relief hung heavy over the three. Luke told the girls where he thought the cafe might have been, and they began to search for it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was foolish for them to let their guard down -- to believe that they were safe. If they had been listening for the small snaps in the woods, and the silent crunch of leaves, then maybe they could have saved themselves. Maybe if they hadn't forgotten to hide behind trees and to watch the darkness around them they wouldn't be in the position they found themselves in. If Luke had reminded them to keep watch, or had not allowed Robyn to stray a little deeper in the woods, then maybe they might have noticed something was wrong. But they didn't and soon this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if I remember correctly, the cave should be near a large boulder. I think it was that way,\" he said, pointing left. They were deeper into the forest now and were facing the large hill and its sheer rocky face. Luke seemed to be more relaxed now that they were sheltered. The three of them had been traveling for about two hours. They were exhausted, and the only thought that must have been on their mind was to find the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls followed Luke as he made his way through the trees. The ground here wasn't as heavy with leaves, since it was mostly pine and evergreens. The needles acted as soft cushions and made little noise as they treaded on them, but the branches were higher and the forest sparser. It gave little cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few leaves could be found though, and most of them were deeper in. The wind had calmed as the storm was beginning to pass. The thunder clapped on in the distance, moving away from the mountain and the travelers. They though it a relief, but they shouldn't have. The wind and the rain and the storm no longer acted as a cover; protecting them from the enemy. It left them, and with it hope for concealment. Beside the black of the night, they were dangerously exposed to those who might have been in the woods with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn straggled away from Luke and Eliza in her search for the cave. She didn't think she'd gone far. She could still see their silhouettes in the loom of the moon, ambling through the trees. She glanced away and searched the sheer face for any sign of the cave. She was only three minutes in searching when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza had been with Luke, their voices quiet but not quite enough in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it you helped us Luke?\" Eliza asked. She was staring up at the man questioningly, but her eyes shone gratefully in the night. Luke was holding the shovel loosely, and was staring down at it contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I too am on the run from them. I knew you brother, Eliza -- Mike. He told me that you were in trouble, and I decided to help you out. People like us got to stick together, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza nodded. She had grown fond of Luke, and was thankful for all his help. She trusted him completely now, and would travel to the ends of the earth with him if she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she sighed. Luke looked at her and smiled. He opened his mouth to tell her that it was no problem when suddenly a gun shot rang out, extremely close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so quickly. Eliza's heart jumped, along with Luke's as they snapped their heads around to the source of the noise, their eyes wide and their breath caught in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the loom of the trees they saw Robyn crumble to the ground. Her beautiful long red hair fell out of her face as she collapsed backwards. Time seemed to stand. In the moonlight, she looked like a dying angel. Her mouth and eyes were open in shock as the bullet made impact with her chest. In her last dying attempt, she sprawled out her hands to catch her fall, but the strength seemed to leave her and she hit the ground hard on her side. Her hair draped across her face delicately, and her slender hands rested on the ground next to her head. She looked like she was sleeping, but they both knew she was not. She was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared in utter horror. Even Luke seemed immobile and surprised by the death. It was so unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo... no.... Eliza couldn't think straight. All that streamed through her shocked mind was that this was all just a terrible trick. She would blink and all this would be gone. This wasn't happening... it couldn't be happening....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen three men stepped out of a cave in the mountain base a little ways ahead. A large boulder rested next to it. It was the place they were looking for that whole time -- the cave. The one place they thought they would be safe, and it turned out it was the exact place they wouldn't. Some of them had been waiting. How did they know they'd go there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who killed Robyn turned his gun on them. Eliza panicked and dived for a nearby tree. Luke did the same, and the bullet flew by, it's bang ringing through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get them!\" The man ordered the other two, who were looking at him excitedly. They pulled out their guns and ran down the slanting ground towards them. Another gun shot rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" Luke shouted to Eliza, pointing towards the forest behind them -- their only escape. Eliza bolted with him at her heels, running faster than they had ever ran before, fainting and zigzaging through the trees to avoid the bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn they ran, running through the pain it their chest and the screaming of their tired legs. On they went, not looking back, dodging behind trees and running to the next.  The gun shots kept coming, each one missing, until they suddenly stopped all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't look back. They kept going and going, never pausing. Their breathing was heavy and labored, but they fought through the pain. They had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like they had been running for hours when Eliza tripped on a root and fell, clutching her chest as she tried to steady her heart. Sobs broke out and there she stayed, not getting up. Luke stopped too, and crouched down next to her, murmuring words meant to comfort her. Their pursuers were long gone. They were deep in the woods, farther away from the mountain and beyond the fields. They were in the real forest, far away from civilization. They were safe, or at least they prayed they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Eliza asked through broken tears, her voice thick with pain and emotion. Luke looked down sympathetically at her, but shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we can't give up. They'll just keep hunting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke,\" she whispered, her eyes wide and sad, \"Are we ever going to be safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked away and at the dark walls of the forest surrounding him. They seemed full of shadows and menace. His eyes clouded, and as he spoke gravely, a new wistfulness came to him. \"If we give up hope, then we never will. That will be when we are truly caught and killed. We must never lose faith, for faith is the only thing that can keep us alive now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After resting and catching their breath, Eliza and Luke continued through the forest. Without a compass it was hard to know which way to go. One thing they knew for sure though was to go away from the cave. Hopefully the forest would end soon and they would find themselves back at civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled in silence for a while. Cautious to make any noise in case they were still following them. Soon though, the storm subsided and they were able to tell that they weren't being followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said you knew Mike?\" Eliza asked Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We met back at camp. He was my roommate and there was an instant bond. We always laughed and joked around. He told me a lot about you. Showed me pictures your parents sent. I have a brother your age and so we compared you two a lot. When we left for his first assignments we made a pact. We would always look out for each other and our siblings. Especially if anything was to happen to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza hadn't gotten to know Mike that well so to hear someone else talk about him felt good. He was significantly older than she was and so by the time she was old enough to remember, their parents had already sent him to camp. She really only saw him on holidays and for a week or so during the summer. Other than that he usually stayed at camp. By the time she went to camp he was long gone and out in the world. She would receive letters from him every once in a while but she never knew where he was or what he was doing\u2013 just that he was alive. Until the day he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the day clearly. The new term had started and the weather was still warm. She had been training hard that morning and when she had been dismissed for lunch, a large man (much like Luke) was standing outside the dining hall waiting for her. He was dressed unlike anyone else she had ever known to be there. Cautious, she held back for a moment. The man looked at his watch and then rested his hands on his hips impatiently. She was just able to make out the outline of a gun along his belt line. Not a good sign. Prepared for combat, she tentatively approached the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Elizabeth Goode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I got by Eliza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective Joseph Markowitz. Mind if we take a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn't sure why this man was here but something inside of her told her to trust him. \"Okay. But I don't have that long for lunch so let's make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked behind the dining hall and made their way towards the dock on the lake. \"How well did you know your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that well. I never really saw him.\" She was confused. What did Mike have to do with all this? \"Why? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the ground then back at her. His eyes were filled with sorrow and regret. \"Eliza, Mike's dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze for a minute. Sure she didn't know him that well but he was still her brother. Greif started to well up inside her chest and soon the tears came. \"What happened?\" She asked with a sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's classified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classified? CLASSIFIED?!\" Eliza started screaming, rage now replacing the greif as she pushed . \"He was my brother! You could have at least had the decency to tell me how he died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I can't. You have to trust me though, if I could, I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crumpled onto the dock crying. Why was she so emotional over the brother she barely knew? Against what Eliza would have thought characteristic of him, he sat down on the dock with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I can never understand what you are going through but just know that I'm here to help.\" He pulled a business card out of his coat pocket and handed it to her. \"There might be some people who come looking for you to tie up loose ends of your brother's. These people are dangerous so if you ever think that they're following you, call me.\" He had a sense of urgency in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat with her on the dock for a moment but then got up. \"I have other business to attend to so I'll leave you to yours. Once again, if you ever feel you're in danger call me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is exactly what she had done. He had told her to meet him in Rosenberry, a town he and his team were currently using as a headquarters. She had been on her way there when the storm delayed her and forced her to rent the lodge. Now here she was trudging through a forest going towards who knows what with a man she had just met who supposedly knew her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what Mike was involved in at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've heard rumors. Nothing concrete though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued on for a while in silence. \"I think we should rest here for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we should take shifts keeping watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds good.\" He examined her head to toe. \"You rest first. You look you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout arguing Eliza laid down. A few moments later, once he was certain she was asleep. Luke wandered off into the forest. He get far until he met his contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Luke. I would have never taken you for an actor.\" The voice said out of nowhere. It startled him at first but he knew it was characteristic. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a figure emerge from the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, nice to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Let's cut to the chase.\" Peter said dismissively. \"Does she know anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like it. But she's also trained so who knows what secrets she's keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter let out a sigh of disapproval. \"Try harder.\" And with that he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and try not to be so deadly with the attacks okay? Make them believable, not life-threatening. Okay?\" Luke yelled towards Peter. Peter just waved him off. He returned to Eliza and after a couple hours woke her to take her shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the two headed off again in the same direction they had been traveling the night before. The clouds had cleared away overnight and so it was easier to get a sense of direction with the sun above their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza paused for a second. \"Cars.\" She realized. \"We must be close to a town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickened their pace and soon were greeted by a \"Welcome to Rosenberry\" sign. <i>Rosenberry. How perfect.</i> Eliza thought to herself. \"I know someone here who can help us.\" she told Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey navigated through town. Detective Markowitz had given Eliza directions to his office but she had left them back in her car which was now abandoned at the lodge so she was left to follow them by memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it is really tragic how your brother died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza paused for a second. \"How do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being burned alive must have been brutal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That information is supposed to be confidential.\" She said. She looked up at Luke and instantly she saw a look of 'oops, I wasn't supposed to say that' in his eyes. Then it hit her, \"You didn't meet my brother at camp.\" She thought back to Mike's letters. \"I never remember him mentioning a Luke and plus, his roommate was named Stephen.\" She didn't know who Luke was but she knew one thing. She had to run.</span></div></div>",

I saw something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre sure about this?\" Luke, the stranger, was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see? was it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Robyn.\" In reality Eliza had caught more detail, than she ever wished she could. Right on the other side of the window she saw what appeared to be too large and too furry to be who she was hiding from. No, whoever was outside, was not a man, but some sort of beast or animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was large. Like a bear or something.\" But it couldn't of been. It was staring right into the window upright, like a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she alright?\" Luke asked Robyn, clearly reserving no time for Eliza and her crazy beast-bear  siting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winds are blowing 70 miles an hour Eliza.\" Robyn said slowly. \"There are no bears hanging outside the lodge in these conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sure. I'm out of here.\" Luke hissed, feeling as though Eliza wasn't taking the initial situation seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Luke was the only man at the lodge between the three of them. Eliza and Robyn exchanged glances at each other, debating whether or not it would be safer to leave with him, and in Eliza's case, confront the beast.  Or, stick behind, as two defenseless women,and wait for the person they were fearing, to come find them. Luke said he was being followed. If it was the same person, that Eliza feared it to be, all they had was time before they were discovered here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go, Eliza.\"Robyn said. \"It's the best thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about that THING out there?\" Eliza whispered, weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza, no one else saw it but you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was halfway out the door. Frantic, Robyn grabbed Eliza's arm and dragged her behind her as she caught up with Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're coming with you, Luke.\" Robyn said strongly, aggravated, that Luke was just going to leave the two of them behind so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least one of you have come to your senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn shook her head, putting her disproval of this man behind her, because he was the only man. She knew she couldn't be too picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute the three of them stepped outside, the wind nearly blew them back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeese!\" Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't lying about that weather, you know.\" Eliza said, hiding behind Robyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, like i have reason to believe a hallucinating girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn clenched her teeth, close to saying something offensive to defend Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three moved slowly around the house, any farther from its walls and they'd probably blow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Luke questioned what was up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the group turned the corner, it was clear. The silhouette of a large and dark being stood on the opposite side of the house. It stood on its hind legs, it carried...a pole?<br>\r\nNo. A...<br>\r\nThe pole in its arms was turned to point at the lead of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aargh!\" Luke yelled. But his voice wasn't even that loud against the sound of the blowing wind. <br>\r\nRobyn screamed and came to a halt behind Luke, who was now on his knees. He dropped to the ground, his shirt only moving from the strength of the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robyn that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get back inside.\" Robyn said, but it was easier said than done. She was frozen with fear. It was Eliza this time that had the strength to take Robyns hand and pull her, against the wind, back into the lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe two of them rushed inside, failing to close the door behind them, as they escaped to the far side of the lodge. they dropped themselves behind the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Robyn said, on the verge of tears. \"I just couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know..just dont think about that.\" Eliza said but then she gasped. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What? What's wrong?\" Robyn's eyes were large and glossy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door is still open.\" her voice cracked. \"I didnt even close the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay. We'll close the door.\" Robyn looked at her. \"We'll close it together okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we have enough time? Do you think that thing hasn't already circled the house by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dont know Eliza, but either way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn was right if they didnt close the door, or at least try to close the door, they'd encounter this thing that killed Luke. One way or another they were screwed if they didnt try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them crawled out from behind the bar. Once they got to their feet, Robyn grabbed onto Eliza's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets do this nice and quietly...\" Eliza's vioce trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But quickly!\" Robyn charged towards the door,  Eliza flying behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet before her hand could hit the door. It swung open all the way, and slammed back onto the wall behind it, on the inside of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women screamed, and dropped to the floor from the impact. Whether this impact was from the outside wind, or the shock, they weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silhouette of the large creature stood in the doorway.<br>\r\nThe two girls started crying and holding each other tightly.<br>\r\n\"wha...what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature had to duck to fit beneath the door. Actually it had to turn sideways as well, because it's width took up the entire frame. But, the minute it stepped into the light the girls were positive. A bear. A bear holding a shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Robyn gasped. \"A bear killed Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a shotgun.\" Eliza specified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he's going to shoot us?\" Robyn whispered hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bear? Do you think he even knows what he's doing with it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he? He's a bear.\" Robyn sounded manic as she contemplated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the bear stared at the two whimpering girls on the ground.<br>\r\nHe, the bear, cleared his throat. The girls squeeled pathetically at the sound he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no ones going to offer me something from the bar?\"<br>\r\nIt came out low, like a growl, or a very sore throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn and Eliza looked at one another, to make sure that they both heard the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone here speak any english?\" It came out sarcastically from the bear, but he continued. \"It's the only other language I know beside my own lingo. <br>\r\n\"I've just started spanish...but I'm not that good at it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When the girls stared at him blankly, he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hablas ingles? I know you dont speak bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si.\" Robyn spit out, as though english really was her second language. <br>\r\n\"I mean yes, yes, we're both American.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both speak english.\" Eliza clarified, hoping that this information would please him and keep him from shooting them. With a talking bear, she had no doubt now that he knew what he was doing with a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" his voice was deep and threatening. \"Than why hasnt anyone answered my first question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza and Robyn have to stare at eachother for the question that they have both forgotten. How were they to remember his exact inquiry, when they were too busy trying to comprehend, the idea that a bear could be fluent in english.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nThe two of them shrug their shoulders pitifully. The expressions on their pale faces are desperately begging for mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear sighs. \"Humans.\" and shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"No one is going to offer me something warm to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", the girls think, curious as to this bears intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course!\" Robyn crawls towards the bar, until she has the strength to push herself up off the hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bears stares after her, unsure as to whether he is freaked out, or amused.<br>\r\n\"You guys act like you haven't even evolved yet. Heck, I feel I've evolved more than you.\" He chuckles and hearty cough sounding chuckle, and then stops when he realizes Eliza, on the floor still, is not finding it funny. Her eyes are still wide and pleading. Still staring up at him, like a rodent to a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear snorts at this.<br>\r\n\"Jeese, lighten the heck up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..Mr. Bear... you just shot Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Bear! Mr. Bear!\" he mocks in an unusually high snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza crosses her brow, not only afraid now, but offended too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak these words like you knew the guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Robyn returns from the bar, a cup with hot chocolate and whip cream on top. Bears must like sweets, she assumed. They ate honey didn't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...sir.\" she refrained from calling him Mr. Bear. Especially after witnessing the title fail with Eliza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared over at the drink in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot chocolate? there's whipped cream on top.\" Robyn states innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, I'm a bear. I'd like a beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you've never had warm beer before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Amatuer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn is silent. She turns away without commenting and rushes back to the bar to get this bear a real drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear turns back to Eliza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didnt know Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animal growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you treated him like he was completely innocent the minute he walked into the lodge. If you knew the guy and what his intentions were, you wouldn't of have been so lax about letting him in.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"If you knew him you would've treated him like you're treating me. Like I'm a monster. <br>\r\nAnd why do I get this treatment? Because I'm a bear? Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did kill someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke? and who do you suppose killed you're lover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Eliza squeaked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, you...\" The bear took a deep inhale. \"Deep breaths\" he reminded himselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke killed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza covered her mouth with her palm. Robyn was walking back with the bears drink, and had stopped in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so obvious too! He ran in right after he shot him.I dont know why you two didn't put the two and two together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he looked so innocent.\" Robyn spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" The bear growled. \"You can't always judge a book by it's cover...Hand me that drink, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn walked up to the gigantic bear cautiously. She never in her life came this close to a bear, let alone, hand a beer to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he said, clearly not as fascinated nor fearful as she was with this exchange. He brought the mug up to his mouth and took a sip.<br>\r\n\"Ooo thats hot, but good.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRobyn and Eliza took this opportunity to really calm down and breath. There really was no reason in fretting over what they had witnessed over the last half hour. Thinking about it would just drive them crazy.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" The bear put down his mug on a nearby table and took a moment to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Eliza said. She looked to Robyn for conformation. Robyn nodded, gravely. They both knew very well who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls were struck at once by his appearance; for starters, he was mind-bogglingly gorgeous. Robyn wasn't sure that such a face could even be human. But his eyes were a brilliant sapphire blue that, despite his aggrivated expression, was full of despair. That blue wasn't a normal eye color, of that Robyn was sure. He was tall and lean, but managed to fill out his clothes wonderfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay walked in and took off his coat. \"Brrr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, who are you?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Clay Hall.\" He put his coat on the rack by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help keep you safe.\" He said it as a matter of fact, with no particular emotion at all. Eliza frowned and asked, \"From what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shook his head. \"I'm sorry. I'd rather wait until the others get here to explain that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What others?\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eliza moved forward to a spot on the floor right in front of him. \"Look, I'm sure you're a great person, but I don't see how a teenage boy is going to protect us from anything. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't seem bothered by it. A smug smile crept over his face. He'd identified a challenge. Somehow the look made him more attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza felt a lump in her throat. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay nodded. He turned to the bear. Suddenly, his hands shot out, took the bear, and hoisted him over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!! <i>We talked about this!\"</i> the bear griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn smiled. \"Okay, put him down. You're about to rip your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I'm--oh, wait.\" He noticed how tight the fabric was around his arms. He put the bear back down gingerly. \"Sorry, ol' boy. She made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza gasped. \"No, I did <i>not!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay laughed. \"I'm kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew into the living room. A large bald man stepped in wielding a metal rod. He stepped toward the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't!\" The bear ran at him. A roar rose from his throat. The bald man cracked him in the skull and stepped aside as he ran into the wall and fell to the floor. He looked at Clay and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can take me, little boy?\" He laughed heartily. \"I tell you what. I'll even give you the stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed Clay the rod. Clay considered it for a moment and snapped it like a brittle twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Don't need it.\" He swung with his right fist. The bald man's shirt bunched into a ball and moved forward, and he was pulled right into Clay's line of fire. The popping sound was incredible. The bald man was thrown back into the doorway. Several teeth fell out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn's eyes were wide. \"Nice work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you.\" He wiped his hands on his jeans and stepped over to the bear. \"Alright, let's get to the chair, Buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled him up by the arm and steadied him when he was on his feet. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a knot on my head in the morning. Other than that, I'll be alright. Are <i>you</i> alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay gave him a look. \"Oh, give me some credit, Buddy, I've had more dangerous people come at me that this joker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind blew in as Eliza tried to close the door. Clay waved at it and it swung closed, wind or no wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telekinetic too?!\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked at her and smiled. \"I'm all <i>kinds</i> of things.\"</span></div></div>",

The light fell on a young blonde man. He was supremely beautiful. His eyes were the same sapphire blue as Clay's. He gave her a small smile and stepped into the room. He had four companions with him, a hooded young man with the same blue eyes and similar features, a nerdy looking guy with half-moon glasses, a beautiful (but normal-looking) young woman in a blue cloak, and a boy of about fifteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay hugged the young blonde guy. \"Dad!

I am Azrael. I think we're all that's coming. At least for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Robyn stepped right up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're travellers.

The storm is just going to get worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, can't we just hold it back?\" Clay asked. He seemed deeply troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> can, but we can only help a little. And when we start that, they'll know, and counteract us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going anywhere with you people if you don't tell us what's going on!\" Robyn was near tears. Eliza stepped over to her and held her. Clay could feel her mind's eye, only squinted but it had caught on to what was happening. She was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dear. And we have enough time for that. Let's go to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn drew a shaky breath. \"Would you like some coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzrael chuckled. \"No thank you, dear.\" He put his hand on her cheek and stepped into the kitchen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

God had tasked me in finding the elves which I have done and together we will destroy the darkness.\u201d The elves and human began to cheer before an explosion sounded and they beheld flaming boulders flying toward them.</span></div></div>",

In the distance, a horrific ripping sound rose into the sky. In the distance, a hill was ascending while a great maw opened in the earth at the base of a new limestone cliff. Shadows swarmed out of the abyss and descended upon them. Many could not survive their impact with the Elven shields, but those that could began to claw it open, and this was enormously effective. Eliza and Robyn backed into a narrow space between two tents. A hand grabbed them from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET AWAY FROM MEE!!!\" Robyn shrieked. She turned swinging. Clay caught her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA! That would've broken my nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we retreat. Hastily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Robyn looked around. The shadows were locked in fierce combat with the elf armies. Adonis and Azrael were handling themselves well, and saving many lives in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon ran to them. \"Let's grab Joey and slip out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Ila and Marcellus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ila's helping Marcellus get to a safe place and she plans to join the fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Joey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon blinked. \"Well, actually, he's right there.\" He pointed behind Clay. Joey strolled up and grinned briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay nodded. \"Alright. Simon, you and Joey sneak out the back. I'll get the girls out. Meet us on the trail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dashed away. Clay wrapped his arms around each girl's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed with pure white light, and he had six white wings. They pointed up and slammed down. All three of them vaulted high into the air, above even the shadows. Eliza squealed and buried her head in his chest. Robyn watched, wide-eyed, but otherwise paid attention to her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle below was ferocious. The shadows were inflicting heavy damage, but they were generally vanquished by magic and the light emanating from Azrael and Adonis. A few Elves discovered that prayer worked against the monsters, and the idea was spreading through the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming down. Everybody hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought them down quite gently on the path. Marcellus was leaning against a tree trunk. Relix was with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcellus looked unhappy and disappointed. \"How is it out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay sighed. \"Brutal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcellus shook his head. \"I want to be out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But we have to keep moving. We have to keep them safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep them safe?\" Relix stepped forward. \"What about Marcellus? How are we to keep <i>him</i> safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay frowned. \"Marcellus is a tough guy. I have complete faith that he can take care of himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you would say that, Angel.\" He said it like a swear word. \"'He only helps those who help themselves.' Isn't that what your kind is always spouting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, my <i>kind?</i> What is THAT supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, what's illness and injury to someone who can't die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stop.\" His voice cracked a bit on the last word. Only Robyn was astute enough to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just keep on trucking. This life is unimportant, right? It doesn't mean much, right? So if he keeps on, keeps losing blood, then it won't really matter when he drops dead at your feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix charged at him. His entire body was starting to bristle and pulse. The girls ran in opposite directions away from them. Clay raised a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaiyar Elohim et ha'ovr ki tov; vaiyav del Elohim, bein ha'ovr uvein ha'khoshekh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn didn't understand the language, but the meaning was imprinted on her heart: \"And saw God the light that was good; seperated, God, the light from the darkness.\" In that moment, Robyn and Eliza observed the world in distressing extremes: pure white light, represented by Clay, wings engaged, halo blazing, and ink black shadow, represented by Relix, and everything else was colored one of the two hues. Relix screamed and flew back twenty feet, and the moment was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay stepped over to Relix on the ground. There were tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ben Malak Ha-Mavet. You will not underestimate my respect for life, do you got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix clenched his jaw and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Clay continued. \"When I said we need to keep moving, I meant for the safety of everyone involved. That includes Marcellus. In a few minutes, the fray will make its way to this spot. We have to leave before it does. We have to find somewhere safe to hole up for the night. Preferably somewhere weatherproof. My brain needs to rest awhile from keeping this weather in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one stopping it?\" Relix seemed shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young does not mean powerless, Relix. You know that better than anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix nodded. \"If we're going to go, we need to make sure Marcellus won't come to any further damage while we're moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" Marcellus sounded much better than he had the last time they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix stood up. \"No, you aren't, you say that every time you take a hit! Remember when you tried to fight after your ankle was broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, that was ONE TIME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix helped Marcellus up. Clay stepped over and pulled Marcellus' arm over his shoulders so he could help him walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got him. You just help me keep an eye on the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix rolled his eyes. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey and Simon ran up from the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were nearly killed.\" Simon's breath was coming very quickly. \"A gaggle of them swarmed us. We would've been gone if Joey hadn't the good sense to pray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good that you made it.\" Marcellus said. \"We're about to leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the others?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll meet us.\" Clay said. \"Let's just go while we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tree fell down somewhere close behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, what <i>now?!</i>\" Relix groaned.</span></div></div>",

Along the way this bear stumbled across our paths and was asking about someone named Clay, with word of the newcomers already spreading through our ranks I was told to go find them.

Clay groaned as he slipped into his more angelic form due to all the darkness. In the middle of the circle Aihia\u2019s eyes began to glow with that same light and her hands were illuminated, her hair blowing straight out. A bright light engulfed the clearing and when it was gone, so were the shadows.  \u201cWhat\u2026just happened?\u201d Marcellus asked. \u201cthat would be more of a question for Azrael.\u201d Was Clay\u2019s confused reply.

The streetlights outside the curtains made fantastic shadows on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't sleep?\" Robyn asked. She was laying beside her. In the other bed, Ila slept snuggled next to the bear. The boys were in another room. They'd come across the Armstice Motel as they came down the mountain from the battlefield. Clay was preparing to hypnotize the young man at the desk, but Robyn pulled out a credit card and marched inside. When she came out, she was jingling the keys in one hand with a grin on her face, saying, \"See? I can contribute!\" The Armstice was relatively close to town but still secluded, it was clean, and above all, it was nearly empty. Once inside, Clay sat on the edge of the bed, and as the rain started to come down again, the tension visibly released in his face. Ila conjured a delicious meal. As the night dragged on, the Armstice granted them the quiet they'd been searching for. Some time around one-forty, they heard a terrific boom a ways up the mountain to the north, and all was silent until the police drove past to investigate the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \"I was. I'm not now. Not sure why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep badly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. Suddenly I'm wide awake, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too. I'm blaming you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go outside?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Robyn climbed out of the bed and wrapped the complimentary robe around the both of them. They hugged each other and stepped outside. The weather wasn't nearly as cold as they would've thought. The rain had stopped, and they could see a few bright stars in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sunny.\" Marcelus was sitting just outside the door to the boys' room without a shirt, leaning against Clay while Simon applied a topical solution to his wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Azrael healed that for you.\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He couldn't heal it all the way because Mar wanted a scar,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls sat down in between their door and Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Eliza said. \"Someone promised to tell me what was going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay nodded. \"Well, it's the shadows. They're looking to come after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shrugged. \"Well, we're not sure, exactly. It seems to be related to an innate power within the two of you. It attracts them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are they?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMar groaned in discomfort and leaned more of his weight into Clay. Clay resituated a bit to Mar would be more comfortable and he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shadows are beings of dark energy. They've always been present in the cosmos. No one's sure exactly where they come from, but they're believed to have evolved from the chaos at the beginning of creation. They're essentially dark destruction manifest in a semi-corporeal form. They don't think in the sense that you or I think, but they calculate like a computer. There's no emotion at all, just cold facts and logistics and numbers. It's like telepathic hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls shivered and huddled a bit tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're coming back for us?\" Robyn asked. Her voice was starting to quiver. \"Will they track us <i>here?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're safe.\" Clay put his other arm around them. \"The sun will be up soon, and we can head out when Adonis gets here in a few hours with the van.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where will we go?\" Eliza asked. \"I mean, I'll go, but where?

As I bent to pick it up, he took the opportunity to drop a sedative into my coke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon frowned. \"Did you catch him doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shook his head. \"No, not exactly. What tipped me off were the very loud thoughts in his head while he watched me bend over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza grimaced. \"How old were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shrugged. \"Eleven or twelve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix wrinkled his nose. \"That's wrong on many levels of varying repugnance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Robyn and Simon spoke all at once. Their eyes met, darted away, and they both blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the sun was beginning to rise over the mountain. They could see smoke in the distance, but they pretended otherwise and looked elsewhere. Down in the parking lot, there were only three junkish cars and a white van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdonis rolled down the window and stuck his head out. \"Are you guys ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to the pub,\" Relix called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" Adonis said. \"It's daylight. We have to move as fast as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix sighed. \"I never get to do anything fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay rolled his eyes. \"Yes, your life is just tragic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped down the stairs. Robin ran over to the desk to check out. The gang climbed into the back of the van and took seats on the carpet along the sides. It had apparently been a steam cleaner's van before Adonis subdued the driver and left him in a ditch with a cellphone and ten thousand dollars cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza frowned. \"Who're these clowns?\" She gestured to the unconscious gents in trench coats. Marcellus turned in the seat. \"They're old warriors from my country. They're drunk right now, but when they're up, they'll be a great help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn climbed into the van. She spotted the elves and frowned. \"Are we going to a film noir convention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix and the angels had a good healthy laugh at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit back and relax,\" Adonis said. \"Is anybody hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a murmur of assent that was nearly overenthusiastic. Adonis started the ignition. \"We'll hit the Mickey Dees on the way out of town. We're meeting Azrael in Virginia.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sky above was a perfect blue, and the few clouds were white and immaculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdonis took another bite from his third burger. When stopping at the drive-thru, he ordered twenty-five double cheeseburgers that everyone seemed to agree with (except for Relix, who rather politely asked to be let out of the van so he could go to the Taco Bell next door; he came back with a back of tacos and a single response--\"I just wanted some tacos\"--for Robyn when she gave him a questioning look).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone dug into the food happily, and even a hundred and fifty miles down the road, there were still seven burgers and two tacos. The conversation was light and good-natured. As Adonis bit into the burger, Ila pulled a handful of heavy books from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza shook her head. \"How DO you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIla chuckled. \"All in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn fingered the book nearest to her with a growing light in her eyes. \"Can I see this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIla inspected the binding and handed it over before waving a hand over a book with a purple cover and skimming the pages with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn moved the book into her lap. On her other side, Clay glanced over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it backwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn looked up at him with a frown on her face. \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay picked it up and flipped it over so that the binding was on the right side. The golden script on the cover was a sort of pictographic alphabet that reminded her vaguely of the ancient Phoenician script she saw in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this language?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's written in the language of the Fae.\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this say?\" Robyn pointed at the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roughly, it means 'A List of the Sons of Heaven'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn opened the cover and flipped a few pages into it. She found pictures of unearthly beautiful youths in varied colors. \"Can you read this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can. I can also recognize those people. See this one?\" He pointed to a dark-skinned beauty of a man in a red cloak with a trumpet. \"That's Israfel. You know when people say 'so-and-so has the voice of an angel?' THAT'S the angel. He's Malak Ha-Zimarot, the Angel of Music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned another page. This angel had white hair and golden eyes, in a pale yellow cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Uriel. He's the Angel of Light. Odd guy, that one. That stint guarding Eden did a number on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned a few more pages ahead. She wasn't sure what she was seeing exactly. The figure on the page didn't seem to have a shape she could focus her eyes on, but he had one, most definately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shivered. \"That's Metatron. Malak Ha-Shem. The Angel of The Name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hallelujah, Abba Shaddai.\" Adonis blurted it quite by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Briefly. He's got his gig, I've got mine. Rarely do the two ever meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gig would that be?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay grinned a little. \"Keep flipping. I'm in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn turned another page. This one was red-headed, with bright green eyes and a beautiful bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malak Ahava. Cupid.\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn turned another page. It was Azrael, but there were two of him on the page. One, dressed in a hooded black cloak, bent his head in serene prayer, while the other, a figure dressed in fine black and red clothing, glared out at the world from the page with a pair of large black horns protruding from his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malakim Ha-Mavet,\" Clay said. \"The Angels of Death. Azrael and his brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His brother?\" Robyn looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the angels appeared on the earth, they were like embryos,\" Clay said. \"They swam around in the sea while they developed. One of them split in half. In humans, we call it monozygotic twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with his brother?\" Robyn asked. She'd lost the color in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been corrupted by his own power,\" Clay said solemnly. \"He sought to subject the mortals to angelic will, since they are weaker. The Lord was displeased with this, since his love for the mortals is greater even than his love for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound very upset about that.\" Relix eyed Clay from above one of the last two tacos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shrugged. \"What is there to be upset about? It's the way it is. He couldn't accept that. So he sought to make them submit or perish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as Death, that was fairly easy, I guess?\" Eliza scooted closer to Clay to get a look at this book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Clay said. \"On the one hand, yes, because he has tremendous power. On the other hand, no, because that sort of death isn't his strong suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one kind of death.\" Relix growled. \"The mortal kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdonis snickered and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think that.\" Clay said. \"The two of them together represent the two kinds of Death. There's the physical, like Relix said. That's Azrael. But there's also spiritual death, the death that comes to the soul when it is seperated eternally from God. That one's Lucifer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn flipped further ahead. She came to a section near the end of the book marked with a word in green, a word Clay read as \"bariim,\" and translated as \"sons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sons of who?\" Eliza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The angels.\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix frowned. \"Like adoption?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not like adoption,\" Clay said. \"Biologically. It's something they've been doing for millenia. Every century, a selected angel will pick a human woman on the earth to bear his child. When he's old enough, he goes to the Land of Nod on the planet Lucidum so that he may live among people who practice magic and face many great dangers. It's a rite of passage for us, a chance to face the kind of enemies that don't exist in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn flipped through it. She found a page with two pictures on it: one of Adonis holding a candle for an old lady and one of Clay consoling a crying boy while he led him away from his lifeless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this say?\" She pointed to the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sons of the Deaths,\" Clay said. \"That's my gig, right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the picture of himself with the boy. Robyn and Eliza studied it and felt their hearts drop when they realized its meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it hard?\" Eliza whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay shook his head. \"By the time I get there, the worst has already happened. I give them release and lead them to light. It's mainly about helping them accept what's happened to them and getting them safely to judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He judges children?\" Relix grew stiff and apprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All must face the Throne,\" Clay said. \"Very few children receive punishment. Almost all proceed directly to the appropriate sphere in Heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van was silent in thought. Robyn closed the book and handed it back to Ila. No one spoke. Eliza wiped the tears from her eyes with the heel of her hand. Relix looked out the window of the back door in grave contemplation. In the front seat, Adonis leaned up and turned the dial on the radio volume. \"Life is a Highway\" barrelled out of the speakers, and before long, the entire van was laughing and singing while Relix cringed and Marcellus snapped out of his doze with a loud \"WHA??\" that made everyone present laugh even harder.</span></div></div>",

The gang headed for a couple of booths in a corner of the bar that was away from the bulk of the patronage, gathered around the bar and pool tables, closer to the bathrooms. Relix approached the bar, fumbling for his wallet and withdrawing the credit card and false ID that he'd obtained from a skinny meth fiend who sold these items from a spot in an alley in a seedier part of Dallas, Texas, not far from where he'd found himself when he entered this world from his own. The barkeep, a plump redheaded man of clear Scots-Irish descent, handed him keys to a three-room suite, the largest accomodations then available, in the motel behind the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're being watched.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix glanced around. No one seemed to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't look.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spine stiffened. He frowned but quickly fixed his face so that the barkeep wouldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You shall meet with me soon enough. Just order drinks, go back to your group, and relax. Head for the back door and expect trouble when you make it outside. That you have a scuffle in your future is inevitable--don't dare try to avoid it. The best of all possible outcomes is beyond the back door, and nowhere else.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be all, Mr. Johnson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix glanced up at the barkeep. \"Round of shots. Tequila. Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeep nodded. \"You can rejoin your party. Maryann will bring you your drinks directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix thanked the man stiffly, reclaimed his cards, and stepped back over to the group. As he sat down, the group was trying to have a conversation over the partition seperating the booths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, what is it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was Clay's this time, in Relix's mind, not spoken aloud. He glanced up, met Clay's gaze and felt aggitation rise in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How do people keep doing that?</i> Relix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm an angel. We have our ways. But what do you mean?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix played through the incident in his head, hoping the telepathic SOB would pick up on it. The small, inperceptible nod Clay gave him told him he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Play it cool. We can handle anything that comes our way.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty girl with black hair in a white shirt that was a bit too small stepped over with eight tall shot glasses full of clear yellowish liquid on a tray, and a plate with sixteen sliced limes. She set the tray on Relix's table, smiled, and walked away. Clay took one of the glasses and eyed Relix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tequila? Really? Is this because I'm Mexican or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Play along.</i> Clay told Relix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix smirked. \"Oh, if only everything I did revolved around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group grabbed their shots and lime slices. Robyn handed Eliza hers, since Eliza was in the middle of the booth, and Eliza cooed, \"Oooo! How did you know the way to my heart, Relix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll just say it, what the Hell is this?\" Ila held her glass in front of her with a suspicious half smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tequila,\" Eliza said. \"It makes the world better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon leaned over. \"Alcoholic drink. Distilled from a flowering succulent desert plant found in Clay's native country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll show you how to do this shizz right.\" Eliza wet her index finger and dabbed it in the salt shaker. \"Do like so. Guys in the back, are you paying attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all followed suit. Eliza sucked the salt off her finger. When the rest did the same, she said, \"Now, this next part is tricky. You have to do it fast.\" She brought the shot to her mouth and downed it, and bit into her lime slice. The others tried to do the same, but half of them gagged on the tequila before they managed to get their lime. Ila's lime fell from her mouth, and with accusing eyes and ragged voice she turned to Eliza and croaked, \"You lying bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcellus and Adonis found this hilarious, and let loose a bray of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, did you get us a room?\" Robyn was addressing Relix. \"Because I can do it, it's not a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix pulled the keys out of his pocket. Robyn grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, can we head that way now? I'm tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix felt anxiety flare up inside. Clay patted his knee under the table, so no one would see. Relix met his eyes and they both agreed it was time. They rose and the group followed them to the back of the bar and out the back door wordlessly but wearing their confusion on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door shut, five creatures floated down out of the sky. They weren't shadows, but they were far uglier. They were winged creatures, averaging four to a beast, with seven beady eyes set in their bald heads, in between their twisted black horns. Their hands were claws, their feet cloven hooves, and they emanated an air of malice and blank hatred, and black shadow rimmed them like halos, horrific parodies of the unspeakable beauty of Clay or Adonis. Robyn, the third most psychic person in attendance, felt their evil and their madness and her bladder let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demons.\" Adonis muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked at Relix. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelix drew his sword slowly and nodded. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, Kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not keeping me out of this one.\" Marcellus stepped past the girls and pulled out his sword. The creatures screeched and moved forward with astonishing speed. Clay swiped at one of them and it exploded in a plume of flame and ash. Marcellus stepped out of another's path (danced, it looked like) and sliced its wings off as it passed. Ila took it out with a blue light from her hands that turned it to mud. Adonis waved another one out of existence, and Relix managed to decapitate the last one. This didn't kill it, however, and it clawed at him with more fury than before. Relix felt blinding terror for the first time in quite awhile, but a female voice, THE voice, called out in a strange language and a passing falling star changed course and vaporized it upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn tried to cover her accident with her hands. Hot furious tears spilled down her face. No one had noticed yet in all the action, save for Simon and, before anyone could see, he threw a spell that, rather than replacing the jeans (that would've been beyond his abilities), he switched them with his own, about the same size, and tried not to grimace at the warm wetness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay turned around and grimaced. \"Oo. Simon. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon turned a new shade of scarlet. \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I'll fix it.\" Ila waved her wand and the soiled pants were replaced with nice blue silk ones, not what he had in mind but better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Simon muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gorgeous blonde bombshell in a tight black dress stepped forward from the other side of the building. She wore a wide-brimmed black hat that rose in a lopsided cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Golden Hell.\" Ila gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza frowned. \"What's wrong? Who is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay stiffened. In another world, the blonde had kidnapped the boy king and led a revolt that cost thousands, even going to far as to attempt (if only once) to have her forces kill Clay himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anama,\" Ila said. \"My sister.\"</span></div></div>",

I don't have much time to explain, things are about to get really bad around here.\" Robyn opened the door and the boy walked in. \"My name is Malogany,\" he said as he took off the cloak and hung it on the hanger by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room turned their heads to look at him, he was fourteen, a little short for his age, and had snow-white hair and bright orange eyes that were complemented by his ghostly-pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may sound rediculous, but we need to block every window and door in this house now, no one gets into or leaves this house from now on unless they want to die,\" he said demandingly. After a moment of silence, most of the people in the house began to laugh at him. \"Have it your way, I'll do it myself,\" and at those words, he grabbed the back of the couch, throwing two people and a bear off of it, and tossing it against the two living room windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?!?\" Robyn yelled. A sudden bang at the door got her attention and she opened it just a little again. \"What now?,\" she yelled through the door. Moments later, a pale hand grabbed her face and she pressed the door against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, they found me faster than I thought they would,\" Malogany yelled. In a flash, he was across the room, biting the arm, taking a huge chunk out of it. There was a scream, then silence. \"That's a vampire, they're after me,\" Malogany sighed, \"we have to close this place up before any more get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were leaving,\" Azrael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't recommend it, when we vampires get on a hunt, we don't give up easy,\" Malogany said, showing one of his fangs, \"now that they have your scent, they'll just keep following you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster,\" Clay said as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I am, and I'd change myself if I could, but I can't. The fact that I am a monster is the only thing keeping those monsters out there from ripping the house apart right now. So, are we going to get these windows and doors blocked up or are we just going to stand here?\"</span></div></div>",

Kronous looked at Leon, who had already noticed it by now. <br>\r\n      \"K-4 decides rear its ugly head,\" Kronous said, recollecting himself,\"by the look of it, around 3,000,000 vampires.\"<br>\r\n       \"Two of us can't take em on alone...\" Leon ponderd.<br>\r\nKronous nodded. Surely they would get mauled to death. But wasn't that half the fun? To fight to the death? Kronous then snarled. He could get help. From the werewolves. The werewolve pack helped the shadowslayers on several occasions, and Kronous himself was in good graces with the pack leader, Faopaw. <br>\r\n         \"Forget it Kronous,\" Leon said ,\"its impossible to get help from them.\"<br>\r\nApparently Leon was also a mind reader.

He had some bread, and that seemed to pain him. Kronous shook his head. Leon raised an eyebrow. How do I get him to drink blood, Leon thought. With no answer to his question, Leon worried about other things that had more dire conscenquences. Kronous looked at the bottle with disgust. There is no damn way I am drinking that, he thought as he got up. He drew his sword, admiring the sleekness of it, then he sliced the bottle in half. Kronous then put his sword back in its sheath. I'd be damned to drink that, Kronous thought as he walked down the hallway. He bumped into Nikki, who Kronous can already tell that she had a question.<br>\r\n      \"Why don't you drink it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n      \"I want to be as human as possible.\" Kronous said,\"I never asked to be turned into a vampire.\"<br>\r\n      \"Your not human, anymore though.\"<br>\r\nNow Kronous knew he couldn't argue with that logic. But he shook his head, refusing to drink it. Nikki had strange idea pop in her head. She didn't know if it would work, but it would be worth a try.

She started to run again full speed, despite her weariness. She knew out running a dragon would be impossible, but she took her chances. The roar grew much more distant, and Odaxitar sighed in relief. She now knew what the dracolich and Darion were now after:Kronous. She bore no friendship or care for him, but something in her made her feel guilt. Odaxitar tried to shake that feeling off, and decided to keep running, trying to put much distance between her and that undead nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronous ran the opposite way Odaxiatr did, yelling insults at the dracolich to make it chase after him instead of Odaxitar. Kronous drew up his sword, and threw the sacred weapon at the dracolich, causing it much pain. Kronous knew that light blessed weapons were the dracolich's weakness, but that sword was the only thing he had that was infused with the Light. He watched it shatter underneath the dracolich's might paw. Kronous stopped, and turned around to face the undead dragon. Kronous has slain only a dracolich welp, but this...this is diffrent. THe dracolich stopped, confused on why the shadowslayer now turned to fight. Underneath his trenchcoat sleeves, were spirit claws. A weapon made out of the user's own spirit when in danger. But before he could charge the dracolich with the spirit claws, a huge, dark axe was thrown into his chest. Kronous, was shocked to see the weapon there, but he dropped to his knees, knowing that the axe was sucking his spirit dry. Darion stepped out of the darkness and pulled the axe out of Kronous who limply fell to the ground.<br>\r\n     \"One down, one to go.\" Darion said, looking in the direction Odaxitar went.<br>\r\nKronous was still alive, just barely though. He put his gloved hand to his chest, knowing that this was the same wound he recieved from the death knight. Kronous was fading fast, he needed help......</span></div></div>",

Kronous looked at the spirit looms on his arms, concentrating on the spirit claws forming. He knew Hell was afraid of two things: The Light, and bad commedians. But before he decided to battle this...thing, he wanted to ask it a couple questions. Kronous closed his eye, letting the amulet glow. He opened his eyes, and knew the languge.<br>\r\n    \"Do you speak, corpse?\" Kronous asked the shambling horror.<br>\r\n    \"So, you do know our speakings.\" It said, awed.<br>\r\n     \"Yaaaa....\", Kronous said,\" Can you tell me my way in to the city, and tell where i can find.....the Hellhound?\"<br>\r\nThe ghoul looked at Kronous then started slashing at him. Wrong thing to ask, he thought, Geeez. Kronous contiuned to be defensive until the ghoul got tired. When the ghoul eased up on the attacks, Kronous was in a whirlwind of attacks, striking every pressure point the ghoul had. The ghoul fell over, even more dead than it had been before. Kronous allowed his amulet to scan the city matrix's. Kronous felt the information in his head. <br>\r\n      \"Now lets see here...\" he said as he looked at the damned city of the dead,\" i'm guessing that the Hellhound is with its master in the chamber of Hellfire citadel.\"<br>\r\nKronous made his way, drawing as little attention as possible. He almost bumped into some Possed guards, but lucky managed to slip by silently. He saw the citadel close, but a lone warrior guarded the huge gate. When he got up to the top of the steps, the warrior looked at him intensly. Kronous couldn't help but feel the glare...and something darker. Kronous looked at the knight, realizing it was a doomknight. The doomknight took out a gruesome sword, which still had the blood of its last victim on it.<br>\r\n        \"If you wish to enter,\" the doomknight said,\"you will have to defeat me.\"<br>\r\nAh, crap, Kronous thought as he brought the spirit claws up, No way to leave now.

He concentrated on his spirit claws, trying to pour the rest of his energy into them, trying ot make them stronger. And he did manage to get at least most of the energy into the spirit claws, using the remaining energy he had to focus on the goal. Kronous ran towards the lava elemental. And right before the elemental hit him, he disappeared. This confused the elemental greatly, as it looked around for its prey. It found its' answer when it was cleaved in half by a spirit claw that had grown in size. Drakon gaped at the site of his prized elemental being destroyed. To make short, Drakon lost all of his courage to face the shadowslayer. Kronous knew that he had the Pyromancer right where he wanted him: Defenseless, and cowering. Instead of cleaving the pyromancer in half as he did to the elemental, he decided to take the pyromancer's very essence to use it for power and energy, so he can be ready for the next fight.

Nobunaga was far too much an experieced fighter for Kronous to handle. Nobunaga saw the tiredness and stopped attacking.<br>\r\n\"You won't last much longer under these conditions.\" Nobunaga said, reaching behind and grabbed a katana that was sheathed,\" Use this weapon. It should suit you well.\"<br>\r\nKronous grabbed the katana off the ground, eyeing it and putting the sheath on his belt. He slowly pulled the katana out of the sheath and held it, with the point of the blade at the ground. He suddenly felt a connection. This was Mitsuhide Akechi's blade, the samurai who killed Nobunaga. Kronous grinned and held it the way Mitsuhide did.<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, Nobunaga.\" Kronous said.<br>\r\n\"Haha. Very well then, 'Mitsuhide'. I shall savor this battle.\"<br>\r\nWith that, the two clashed several times, the clang of metal echoing the vast room.</span></div></div>",

But she stopped short. She looked back on Kronous's body. But something in her knew that Kronous was not dead. In fact, he slowly got up. He turned to face Sara, who gulped.<br>\r\n     \"Now, let me show you my real power,\" he said as he picked up his katana, and he seemed to fade in and out of darkness,\" Lve and die by the Shadow's blade.\"</span></div></div>",

Kronous, as some would call him, was an Astartes, or genetically born or altered. Kronous always denied that he was, because he wasn't. As he cotiuned to run through the raging wind, he heard something on his ear piece.<br>\r\n    \"Okay Kronous,\" Leon said,\"I got the Orb and a new weapon.\"<br>\r\n    \"The first Orb has been repaired,\" Mustang said, cutting in,\"it wasn't easy though.\"<br>\r\nKronous nodded to him self and realized it was up to him to get this Orb, by cutting people down or just sneaking in and taking it. Then Kronous found a very bad flaw. The Temple was protected by Wind elementists, and as well elementals and warriors. Kronous withdrew his katana, and increased his speed, not stopping for anyone. He saw the temple, and stopped, climbing up a tree to get a better view. The Elementals were outside guarding the entrance, and the warriors and elementalists were on the inside. Kronous waited until the Elementals disperesed, while the warriors came out and guarded the entrance. Kronous immediately jumped down, landing in front of them. The guards charged Kronous and they were cut down. Donning one of the warriors garb, Kronous went inside and saw that the elementists had gone to their rooms. Grabbing the Soul Orb, Kronous began to run, but a warrior carrying a huge axe stopped him. <br>\r\n     \"Were do you think your going,\" the warrior said,\" theif?\"<br>\r\nKronous did a quick slash with his katana, but he heard it strike metal instead of flesh.<br>\r\n      \"Quick guard,\" Kronous said, securing the Orb on his belt,\"This should be good match, since you have good skills and tha holy weapon, Blinding Light of Destiny.\"<br>\r\nThe axe began to glow, and the warrior swung the axe at Kronous who narrowly dodged it. Now the axe seemed to take on its own fighting skill, guiding the warrior. But Kronous did a stab, it peicing through the warriors heart. The axe fell to the ground, so did the warrior.<br>\r\n      \"Better luck next time,\" Kronous said, picking uo the axe,\" I have got the Orb and weapon!\"<br>\r\nHe ran out, running towards the direction of the Grassland of the dead.</span></div></div>",

His eyes quickly scanned the room, noticing a quick motion very near him. His hand slowly went to the handle, ready for the strike. Kronous only withdrew a small portion of the katana, dark energy emanating from the revealed portion. A blade swished by the back of Kronous's neck, causing him to swing the katana behind him, hearing it hit metal. His head turned to see a warrior in full armor, and the warrior charged, pushing Kronous back before he got a grip on the situation. All I have to do, Kronous thought as he parried a blow, is dodge. His idea was to wear the warrior down, then Kronous would strike. However, the warrior seemed to renew his strength with something. Kronous realized that he was fighting a Templar. Templars were like paladins, only stronger in using the light. Kronous charged the Templar, using mutiple slashes. The glow around the katana intesnified, and as did the light around the Templar's sword did. Kronous cotiuned until he was able to finally kill the Templar, but the Templar smacked down the katana and pointed the sword at Kronous.<br>\r\n   \"You would've been killed a couple times back there.\" The Templar said with humor in his voice.<br>\r\n   \"What? Who the hell are you?! AND why didn't you kill me when you had the chance to?!\" Kronous said with a snarl.<br>\r\n   \"Intresting. I thoguht you would've remembered me.\" The Templar said,\" Oh well, I suppose you meed help getting rid of the Hell commander, Tross.\"<br>\r\n   \"No. That's Leon's job. There's.....something else that's coming after me. I don't know what, but it feels Pure Evil.\" Kronous said, a chill running down his spine.<br>\r\n Kronous picked up the katana, sheathing it, and as he turned to Sev, he wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n  \"Huh, I guess this was a failed idea to come here.\" Kronous muttered as he walked away.</span></div></div>",

It was odd, Kronous thought, that someone would contact him for some work. But Kronous had a feeling in his gut that whatever this person was going to assign him, he would not do it willingly. His mind drifted off until he felt a familiar presence. What the, he thought as chill ran down his spine, why do I have this errie feeling?</span></div></div>",

Kronous wanted to make this quick, but with this situation, that won't be possible. After Leon and Nikki left, Kronous was going to pull one of his usual tricks out of his hat, but for some reason, he felt like his moves were being monitered. A solider who strikes fast strikes first, Toshiro had drilled that tactic into his head right when he joined the order. The one he was fighting conjured another spear, and began to start swinging it around, electricty in the air. Kronous heard a beeping sound on his spiritloom, and thats when the idea stuck him: Reactivating power suit \"Judgement\". Kronous had a engineer make this suit for him when he had nearly had his heart ripped out, and so that he can still fulfill his missions while recovering. <br>\r\n   \"I need a distraction,\" Kronous muttered to himself as he nimbly dodged the spear thrusts,\" Yes, that'll do quite nicely.\"<br>\r\nDrawing his katana, Kronous ran full speed towards the demon, and jumped overhead, a blinding light released once he reached the peak of his jump. As they shouted that they can't see, Kronous quickly began to use the release buttons so that the suit can fully be operatinal. He felt a spear tip at the back of his head, and slowly stood up with his hands up.<br>\r\n  \"Its over ki-\"he was interruppted by a huge werewolf running into him, toppling him over.<br>\r\n  \"Quickly!\" Faopaw yelled, gripping a huge sword,\"I'll deal with them.\"<br>\r\n  \"Your a life saver Faopaw!\" Kronous said before the suit covered him,\"You sure you got this?\"<br>\r\n  \"Just go you pesky child!\" Faopaw grinned \"The moon shines brightly.\"<br>\r\n Whtever you say, Kronous thought as he felt the suit system start to start up, I'll give him a bone next time I see him. The trio looked at the power suit, and slowly backed away, weapons dropped and they had their hands up. Kronous couldn't believe this, they're giving up?! Hikari had the same expression and thoughts as Kronous, but still kept her weapon ready.<br>\r\n   \"This is..impossible!\" one of them said,\"You said that the Judicator was destroyed!\"<br>\r\n   \"So you know of this suit,\" Kronous said, pulling the katana out, which began to glow,\"Tell me, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n   \"We are here to destroy everything here,\" the first one said, \"and our lord wishes to enslave the human race.\"<br>\r\n   \".....\" Kronous ponered,\" I'll just kill the two of you now, but tell me, where are your masters?\"<br>\r\n   \"H-how did you know?!\" one of them shouted.<br>\r\n   \"Simple. The only people who hate me and Leon enough would join together and try to elimnate us.\" Kronous said with a grin, a gun forming in his hand,\"Your dead.\"<br>\r\n A couple gun shots rang out.</span></div></div>",

Alive, Masamune thought, although she'll lop off Kronous's head now. <br>\r\n    \"You,\" he said pointing over to Kaneda, who stood at attention,\"give her bandages, and tell her that Kronous will come back later.\"<br>\r\n    \"Yessir.\" Kaneda said, wondrring why she was taking orders from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamune sat down, up in a tree watching to make sure the kunoichi didn't do anything stupid. Sighing, he twidled the rosary in between his fingers wondering what to do next. It'd be best, he thought, if Kronous heeds my advice in his head, stay low, and do not draw attantion to himself. <br>\r\n Reattaching the rosary, the swap happened again. Kronous now lay on the branch exhausted. Now his mind was set on one thing: Killing Ieyasu. That asshole made my life hell with that hit, Kronous thought growling, and it'd be best if my face was still intact to get rid of him. Kronous lept from tree to tree, finally landing in front of Leon who ran right into him.<br>\r\n   \"Tell Hikari,\" Kronous said, taking deep breaths,\" that I will not be coming back soon.\"<br>\r\n   \"Why, might I ask?\" Leon said, getting up.<br>\r\n   \"I'm getting rid of Ieyasu. And I have a gut feeling my past will ruin everythung about me to her.\"<br>\r\n    \"Sounds like a plan. Alright I'll tell her\" Leon said.<br>\r\nAnd with that. Kronous ran off, with this one last thoughts in mind: The one-eyed comes to bring you your destiny Ieyasu! And Hikari, please forgive me!</span></div></div>",

He looked behind and saw Kaneda slwoing down.<br>\r\n    \"You need a break?!\" He yelled back to her.<br>\r\n    \"No! I'm fine!

Running with new vigor, he felt a demonic presense, and surged forward.<br>\r\n     \"Take Hikari back to the safehouse!\" Kronous yelled behind him,\"and as much as I regret asking this, I ask you to accompany us!\"<br>\r\n    \"Alright!

The Holy Blade, Kronous pondered, how did he obtain it. Clicking the two buttons on his spiritlooms, he felt the power suit begin to cover his body. Tross was about to swing the sword to behead Leon, but Kronous rammed his plated shoulder into Tross's side, sending him flying. Aw hell, Kronous said, Leon's unconscience.

No.\" Kronous chuckled,\" I'm your worst nightmare!\"<br>\r\n Tross charged Kronous, who brought the katana up with a block. However, after a couple parries, Tross knocked the blade out of his hand and stabbed the torso of the armor. The helmet visor flashed red and started to beep. Crap, Kronous thought, pulling away,I'm trying something new. With a light blast, blinding Tross, Kronous rushed forward grabbing and lifting Tross up by the head.<br>\r\n    \"Tell me,\" Kronous said, preparing to incenrate Tross,\"Do you believe in a god?\"<br>\r\n    \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n    \"He cannot save you then! Be purged!\"<br>\r\nFire erupted from the palm of Kronous's hand, incenrating Tross from the top of his body to the very bottom.

The Ancient Dark Ones were fierce deities indeed, giving power to those who they saw fit. However, they weren't always evil. They had created the world with the long dead Titans of old, making sure everything was balanced. They, had, in fact, created the unique races that still exist today, hiding out where no one could find them: the elves, dwarfs, Lymari, and the dragon kind in fact. They were also the ones responisble for having Anderson set loose numberous creatures of the night who had been improved. No one else knew of the danger coming, and he wanted it to be kept that way.<br>\r\n    \"Anderson,\" it was Nightmare,\" something is coming for us, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n    \"Aye, and it'll be a bloody slaughter,\" Anderson muttered back to Nightmare.<br>\r\n    \"'Bout time,\" Niightmare responded,\"I've been wondering if I'd have to kill this false god myself.\"<br>\r\n     \"What? You wished to elimnate him?!\"<br>\r\n     \"Yes. I joined to fight Leon one on one, not to be used as a puppet. And I have to work with nutcases like Lady Midal and Lord Hydes.\"<br>\r\n Anderson smirked at the comment. So there was another who wanted this 'god' dead. But that would mean for a new conduit to be chosen for the Great Dark One, Cthuhlu. And only one name came to mind when he realized this: Kronous. If Kronous succumbed even a little to the callings of Cthulhu, he would be a puppet. Shaking that feeling off, Anderson turned and walked out, focused on saving his own hide than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group ran as fast as their legs would let them. Kaneda was leading them, her sense of direction never wrong. Although Kronous was still pent up with Leon, he needed his help. Kronous felt something in his gut that something was not right. Hearing the ever so familiar sound of marching, he stopped and looked throught a bush. Huge, mossy creatures were lumbering with unnaturual speed towards the same destination as the group was, the mountain.<br>\r\n     \"What the fuck are those things?\" Leon said, even he was disturbed by it.<br>\r\n     \"Loyal follwers of some great Ancient.\" Kronous muttered,\"So it is true after all....\"<br>\r\n     \"What is?\" Kaneda asked.<br>\r\n     \"The great detiy Cthulhu really does exist,\" Kronous said,\"Fuck, that's another problem now.\"</span></div></div>",

Kronous, however, had a grin on his face, his hand on the handle of the katana. He knew the inprovalne was about to wear off, but he did not care. He could rest when he is dead, or once he gets back to base. One of the creatures were lumbering towards his location, so Kronous decide to use a unique combo he had formulated. <br>\r\n  \"Moss face!\" Kronous shouted, the creature turning its ugly head,\" Yea! You! Come get some!\"<br>\r\n The creature charged forth, it roaring some insult at him. Just a split second from getting hit, he appeared behind the creature, severing the connection of heart and brain. Kronous laughed as the creature grew stiff, then just truned into a heap of moss, now assured of his abilties. However, he saw a huge...person...shape in the shadows. And then, Kronous knew he just fucked himself over. Emerging from the shadows, a armored warrior caring a axe about three times bigger then Kronous.<br>\r\n   \"Prepare to meet your end, slayer. I am Yog-soth!\" He roared, \"my brother tniks you are a candiate for his power, but I think you little more than a nuisance.\"<br>\r\n   \"Ah, but you still think something of me.\" Kronous said with a chuckle,\" let's make this quick, brother of Cthulhu, I need to get outta here.\"<br>\r\n Yog-Soth charged forward, the axe just barely missed Kronous, who gave laugh and cut straight through the armor. But, it was hollow on the inside. Oh fuck, Kronous thought, its one of these guys. Kronous looked for a blood sign on Yog-Soth, and he found in on the back of the helmet. Kronous ran forward, slicing his way through the armor, trying to make the sign more vunerable. Just as he was going to destroy it, he felt imself get impaled by part of guantlet of Yog-Soth.<br>\r\n   \"If I de, your coming with me!\" Kronous roared shoving the sword further, it reaching the sign,\"I have no regrets.\"<br>\r\nYog-Soth just fll in to seprate pieces of armor, the sign destroyed. Kronous magaed to pull out the spike, but the inprovline was close to being worn off, so he was in for hell once it wore off. Collapsing out of exhaustion, he fell unconscious before wondering if he was going to die here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That boy is strong,\" Yog-Soth said to Cthulhu,\"powerful enough to survive the impalement.\"<br>\r\n  \"Do you regret wasting your power to fight him?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yea. Deldarion, you should go keep an eye on him.\" Ctlhulhu said,\" Make sure he stays alive.\"<br>\r\n   \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turing to the younger brother, his mossy hands clenched into fists.<br>\r\n    \"You have failed me, Yog-soth,\" Ctlhulhu said angerly,\"and you shall pay dearly for this, but I have notime to worry myself with you.\"<br>\r\nYog-Soth gave a sarcastic-like bow and left, not worried with the consuquences he would receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several creatures slain, and the rest retreating to either orders or out of fear, Kronous finally met up with the warrior, who seemed to enjoy seeing Kronous again.<br>\r\n    \"Hey Riyu,\" he said, referring to Kronous's first name,\" how goes it?\"<br>\r\n    \"Didn't I say I was going to kill you if you called me by my first name, Braden?\" Kronous shot back, sheathing his sword,\" but your lucky I'm in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n     \"Heh. Still as foolhardy and crazy as ever. Oh, by the way, I have a message for you.\" Braden said, reaching into his pocket,\"somebody apprently wants to employ you.\"<br>\r\n     \"Fuck that!\" Kronous said,\" Last time I responded to one of those, the letter sent me to an abandon factory. So I'll never respond to those unless I know the person won't send me off to some god forsaken place.\"<br>\r\n Braden snickered, not at all surprised by Kronous's reaction. He looked behind Kronous and saw the swath of destruction he had layed out.<br>\r\n      \"Still putting the sword tactics to good use I see.\" Braden said, kinda awed,\"Anyway, I gotta get going. Tell your friends I said hi.\"<br>\r\nBraden ran off, and Kronous still despised him for using his first name. Now, how the hell am I going to clean up these piles of moss, Kronous thought, kicking a pile, this is going to take for ever!.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it put a strain on his army, but it was worth it. Yog-Soth had been sent to rally more followers, and Deldarion tried to rally the rest of his men. <br>\r\n     \"Heh heh heh. The slayer is slowly growing in power,\" Ctlhulhu said, switching his view to the lymari ruler,\"and that fool is slowly losing power. He and his ilk will fall for treating such a wonderfulk race as such as the elves, like dirt.\"<br>\r\nCtlhulhu closed his eyes and began to relax, chanting a small phrase which allowed him to slowly fall to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He had always said that the battleground was his home,\" Kaneda said,\" and that it'll be his grave.\"<br>\r\n Hikari nodded. It made sense if you looked it at from Kronous's perspective, and everyone knew that he'd always be the first one on the battle field, leading the charge. However, it sometimes worried Hikari when Kronous did something that reckless, but she couldn't change who Kronous was. After she had met him, Hikari knew of his bravery, and saw that as Kronous's pride. But Kaneda pointed out that only boosted his pride, and the source of his pride was the shadowslayer motto: \"We work for the people.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronous was to busy looking up at the sky, trying to think what to do now. In a time of peace, he would not know what to do. So either he died on the battlefield, or he put an end to the lymari, Ctlhulhu, and Anderson. Kronous refused to die before he'd be able to destroy the old man in a honorable battle. But, the only near impossible task was getting to Ctlhulhu and destroy him. The Lymari were to easy of a target, but the ones he wnated dead were Lord Hydes and Lady Hidal, and he wanted to kill the both of them when they came for help. Kronous knew he couldn't go off and kill them, he had to get his wounds treated first, and thanks to him getting injured all the time in fights when he was younger, Kaneda knew her medical studies. <br>\r\n    \"Well,\" he said, walking back to the group, \"thw battlefield is my home, and my grave.\"</span></div></div>",

A rustling of pushes signaled the arrival of Anderson, who stood tall and proud.<br>\r\n    \"Nice of you guys to join us,\" Kronous said with a grin, looking at Anderson,\" Don't get yourself killed old man.\"<br>\r\n     \"If I die here, I'll still be number one.\" Anderson said with a grizzly laugh,\"This shall be glorius.\"<br>\r\n      \"Kael!\" Darion yelled to the captin,\" Come!\"<br>\r\nKael broke from the battle, running towards the group. He then turned on his heel, and threw the spear. It hit Lord Hydes again, and this time nothing could save him. Kronous nodded, he aprroved of that throw, though he wanted to kill him. Oh well, Kronous said, unsheathing his sword, there is still Lady Midal. Kronous rushed forward, Kael, Darion and Anderson following his charge. Kronous took on Nightmare, Cervanres, and Lady Midal. Darion chrged Drift, who was now having second thoughts. Anderson went for Vetarni, and Raezael. Kael had sword in hand, and helped Darion take down Drift. Hikari and Kaneda joined blades and went for anyone who dared challenge them. Leon was beseiged by Mitsunari, Gro, and Hagtion, but pushed them back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCtlhulhu watched growing intrest, his pupil was indeed starting to feel the power.

If it doesn't, I'm dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronous heard sniper fire, but was to busy fighting Nightmare. Cervantes was dead, Lady Midal was fatally injured, so Kronous was going to let her die of wounds. Suddenly, searing pain entered his shoulder, shattering his shoulder blader.

Damn, he thoguht as he roladed, this kid is too lucky. To Shige's surprise, an explosion rocketed him forward, landing face first.

Kronous grit his teeth and finally realized what was happening, but this was out of consquece for removing his spiritloom, and they stopped the transformation from man to beast. Kronous fet his hand grow claws and grow bigger, however, he tried to stop it from spreading. Trying to reach into his pocket to grab the antidote, he felt his face grow caineish, it starting to spread faster after months of being contained by the spiritloom. <br>\r\n  \"So,\" Kotaro said,\" it is true. You have been affected by the Curse.\"<br>\r\n  \"You..might...want...to,\" Kronous said, still trying to grab the antidote,\" RUN!\"<br>\r\nFailing to grab it in time, Kronous fell down to one knee, holding his head. Damn, he thought, how could this happen to me?! He suddenly remembered the conversation he had with Faopaw after he learned Kronous was affected. You'll be driven by bloodlust, the pack leader said to him, so you need to control it if you want to ever have any hope of returning to humanity. Kronous lashed out towards Kotaro, who was raked in the chest due to the claws. Grabbing his blade, Kronous started to pick up where he left off with his blade. Kotaro was not at all ready for the new fury Kronous had aquired.<br>\r\n  \"I see that you really are driven by bloodlust,\" Kotaro said, trying to get Kronous into a frenzy,\"but that will not help you.\"<br>\r\n  \"Fool! I hope you haven't planned to return alive,\" Kronous said ina gruff voice,\" I'll end you here and now.\"<br>\r\n Kotaro made his move and struck Kronous square in the chest, but that didn't stagger the massive frame Kronous aquired. Picking Kotaro up by the throat, he gave a moment to relish this.<br>\r\n   \"Give my regards to hell,\" Kronous snarled,\"you scum.\"<br>\r\nKronous slammed Kotaro hard into the ground before he could answer, and that knocked Kotaro's breath out of him, but that did not stop Kotaro slicing into Kronous's torso. With a surprised roar, Kronous ripped Kotaro's throat out, and blood began to pool underneath the dead ninja.<br>\r\n   \"KOTARO IS DEAD!\" Kronous howled, reaching into his pocket and and grabbing the antidote,\"Thanks...for...the.anitdote, Faopaw.\"<br>\r\nWith that, Kronous stuck the sryinge part into where the bite wound was and felt the feral feeling leave him, causing him to collapse.

Everyone had gone off already, but Anderson and Darion stood besdie him.<br>\r\n   \"You've gotten more organized in your attacks,\" Darion muttered,\" I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n   \"When destiny calls,\" Kronous said, pointing the tip of his sword at the battle,\" you must always be organized, whether your going to die or not.\"<br>\r\n   \"I have an idea for you,\" Anderson said to Kronous,\" and its worth hearing.\"<br>\r\n   \"I'll listen to whatever you have to say,\" Kronous said, turning to Anderson,\"I'm all ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sev couldn't believe this many people would serve under an ancient deity. Most of them had most likely thought of getting a special reward for serving, but it was all lies, Sev thought. He swung his mace over his head, crushing one attackers' skull in while crushing three others' ribs. Sev had always admired Kronous, espically since the hardships he had been put through. But that alone will not really help in this battle. Sev had found werewolves attacking with templars quite odd, but this was nesscary, and Faopaw lead a relatively peaceful pack, who only raids against their nocturnal, blood sucking counterparts. But, something seemed....off in Ctlhulhu's army. It seemed as if the enemy had no fighting spirit, but fought against their will. Sev suddenly grinned, knowing that he could possibly influence them to join their side.<br>\r\n   \"We've got them on the run!\" Faopaw howled, cutting through countless merceniares in a matter of seconds,\" the fury of the pack knows no bounds!\"<br>\r\n   \"Don't celebrate just yet!\" Sev yelled, smashing another head in,\"we've got a long ways to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronous nodded. Faopaw and Sev had done well keeping the attention of the enemies left flank, allowing him to act for his second attack, a ambush that would annhilate their entire right flank.<br>\r\n  \"You still able to summon dracolichs, Darion?\" Kronous mused as he turned to Darion,\" if you are, that will greatly help destroy the enemies spirit.\"<br>\r\n  \"Of course! Just cuz I'm not summoning skeletons or throwing my axe at people doesn't mean I can summon multiple dracolichs!\" Darion said, delibrately making the phrase confusing.<br>\r\n  \"Good. Send at the very least a dozen dracolichs to aid Kaneda and her small group of ambushers. It shall prove intresting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaneda waited, sitting in a tree. She toyed with the idea of just immediaetly going out and attacking, but Kronous gave her specific instructions not to. She had to wiat for an unusual cue, but she waited.<br>\r\n  \" I grow bored of this,\" she heard a ninja groan,\" why can't we attack now?\"<br>\r\n  \"Paitence,\" Kaneda said with a soothing voice,\"we wait for a cue, then we can attack.\"<br>\r\nKaneda heard the very unfamiliar flapping of....bones? No, that couldn't be right. She climbed to the top of the tree, and saw dracolichs coming her way. Kaneda squinted and saw Darion riding a top the one leading the others. Kaneda jumped down and signaled the others. The time was now. As the small group ran, they heard a roar from one of the dracolichs, signaling it's attack. Portions of enemies disappeared without a trace, just to be found in re\u00a5ote places as stiffening corpes. And by the time Darion and Kaneda met up, the right flank was either in disarray or in a madden attempt to flee.<br>\r\n   \"Well, I gotta report back to Kronous,\" Darion said, climbing ounto the massive dracolich,\" he told me to tell you to meet up with Sev and the werewolf guy after you've finished up here.\"<br>\r\n   \"Tell him I will do whatever it takes to do so.\" Kaneda said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The ENTIRE right flank?\" Kronous asked, not believeing Darion.<br>\r\n  \"Aye. We did as you asked.\" Darion said with a grin,\" You gave us orders to.\"<br>\r\n  \"Wow. I did not know that attack would be very successful.\" Kronous said, pacing this threw him into his final phase: a strangling of the enemies army, and where he joined the fight himself. <br>\r\n   \"Leon and Sen-gie are doing well holding the front line with the templers and your furry warriors.\" Darion said, regarding the areas where Kronous had sen everybody,\" I am very impressed with how your doing this.\"<br>\r\n   \"I'm impressed with myself in fact,\" Kronous said proudly,\"This actually may be a very well-coordianted attack.\"<br>\r\n   \"Don't get to ahead of yourself,\" Darion muttered,\" we still have Anderson out there posing as you.\"<br>\r\n   \"Bah! The old man and I agreed to do this, and we shall do it, and it falls into place with my final attack!\" Kronous said, lifting his sword up,\" I'll not be defeated by some false god who thinks himself high and mighty! For honour!\"<br>\r\n   \"For honour!\" Darion yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute Kronous stepped out on to the battle field, he felt the bloodlust in his head begin to urge him on. Kronous would live and die by his blade, he wasn't afraid of death, although he certainly knew others were afraid for him. He rushed through his enemies not giving any time for either him or his foes for any rest. And by the time he did stop, he noticed the front line had surged forward, cutting down more and more enemies with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n   \"Your a good fighter!\" Leon yelled over to Kronous,\"... Wow, I'm surprised I admited that!\"<br>\r\n   \"Your pretty good yourself!\" Kronous yelled back.<br>\r\nKronous immediately caught sight of Sev and Faopaw on the left, while he caught Kaneda and her group on the right. His plan was actually working, which surprised the hell out of him. He suddenly broke from the lines and ran in the direction of where Ctlhulhu was commanding his now shattered army. Kronous caught up with Anderson, who was running in the same direction as he was.<br>\r\n  \"I take it you inspired fear into our enemies, old man?\" Kronous asked with a grin.<br>\r\n  \"Quite right, pup.\" Anderson shot back,\"Now we stick to our agreement.\"<br>\r\n  \"I can't believe that we agreed to this.\" Kronous muttered,\" and if you do die, who will I have as a rival?!\"<br>\r\n  \"You can fight Darion. He's young and can wrestle a bear to the ground.\"<br>\r\n  \"Heh heh heh. I remember that.\" Kronous snickered.<br>\r\nThey got to the main camp just in time to see Ctlhulhu outraged by the defeat of his army with such simple tactics.<br>\r\n   \"I will devour this world!\" Ctlhulhu howled oddly,\" and I'll begin with you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronous had panicked moment for a second. But he found him standing off with Anderson against Ctlhulhu, who contiuned to howl with anger. By the time he actually made an attack, both Anderson and Kronous were caught off guard and were thrown in diffrent directions. Damn, Kronous thought as he got up, how can something that big move that fast?! Kronous charged the creature for some reason, and in his mind he knew it was foolish, but it gave Anderson enough time to attack it's vunerable backside. Howling with pain, Ctlhulhu threw Anderson off of it and lumbered forward to crush the priest, but that gave Kronous enough time to deal damage of his own. Making multiple slashes on Ctlhulhu's back Kronous kept it going unitl he felt that he had angered the false god into attacking him now.<br>\r\n   \"You will fall, false god!\" Kronous roared,\" and if I fall, I'll take you with me!\"<br>\r\nKronous braced himself for the rampage that Ctlhulhu was about to hit him with, but Anderson intervened and took the blunt blow. Staggering, the priest threw bayonets into Ctlhulhu's eyes.<br>\r\n   \"Good....l-luck, lad,\" Anderson sputtered, falling to his knees,\" you'll n-need it...ugh..\"<br>\r\nKronous charged with renew fury, slicing into diffrent parts of the false god as quickly as possible. He saw Ctlhulhu just freeze up.<br>\r\n   \"What!? I am immortal! I..will..be back...for your...\" Ctlhulhu said, gutted like a fish.<br>\r\nA green glow and Ctlhulhu was gone, but Kronous had no clue of that since he hit the ground hard out of exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

Kronous, you'll have to use your spirit claws for  now, until your blade is ready for combat.\"<br>\r\nKronous nodded, and pulled back a trenchcoat sleeve, revealing a glove encased in a spiritloom, which gave him the ability to use spirit claws. Kronous said he had to go, and John and Zain went to the Shadowslayer HQ to turn in Gro's head. Kronous turned towards the direction of the Grassland, and started to walk. So far, he thought, no chaos. Suddenly somebody dropped down from the trees and started to attack Kronous, who activated the spirit claws and began to fight back. After 10 minutes of that, both fighters were tired. Kronous examined his foe. The fighter was female, wearing the uniform of an elite Shadowslayer, was using to small runeblades. Kronous's eyes widened, knowing this person, but something in his head told him to get to the grassland of the dead, ASAP.</span></div></div>",

Of the two, I'd prefer a nephilim attack. At least you die quickly.</i> The Mist grinned, though there was no mirth in it whatsoever. <i>The other way to find out a nephilim is to try to kill it. The faster you're killed, the more likely it is you're facing a fallen seraph.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another way,\" explained the seraph in question patiently, levitating gently overhead. \"Fallen seraphim, or, as you call them, nephilim, have no healing powers. Let me see the wound of the mage, and we shall decide for either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No. If you are a seraphim, you most desperately want to show me this. If you are telling the truth, that is. This could be a practiced act; none of us truly know for sure exactly what a nephilim can do. I've only met one, a rogue seraph who turned out to be a spy for our cause. The revelation was...unpleasant, in that he'd killed three members of the team at the time. He never displayed any hint of power besides telekinesis rivaling, and indeed perhaps surpassing your own. What are we supposed to believe that you say? Nephilim are no more powerful than seraphim -- I know this to be a fact. Exodus told me himself that a pitched battle against a seraphim would probably end in a slight margin to his favor. Nephilim are rather amoral creatures, prone to bragging. I've never seen them concede to an enemy before.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, a towering pillar of earth encased the floating angel. Following this immediately was most of the shack's wooden flooring. Various floorboards were ripped up and wrapped tightly around the trapped angel, preventing the use of his telekinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now, we watch and see what happens next,</i> said the Mist smoothly.</span></div></div>",

If we move fast we can get away before tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"How do I know I can trust you?\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\nJasper sent her an annoyed look, jumped off the boulder and continued walking. Robyn groaned and raced after him. They walked for a few miles before reaching a complete drop off cliff. Jasper looked up and down the overhang searching for a way over.<br>\r\n\"There's no way across, we'll have to go down,\" Jasper explained leaping onto a rock ten feet below them. Robyn looked down hesitantly. \"Come on princess,\" Jasper urged, \"We're only a glass slipper and pumpkin carriage away from being safe.\" Robyn cursed under her breath before reluctantly jumping down next to Jasper. As soon as she landed a crack of a rock splitting sounded. The ground beneath them began to tremble. Jasper looked around mournfully before reaching in his pocket and pulling out a zip lining device the size of a small cookie. \"I might be able to get the hook onto the cliff over there,\" Jasper shouted to Robyn pointing towards a large platform about fifty meters away. \"It's either that or we fall.\"</span></div></div>",

I never stopped loving you either. <br>\r\n\"Sorry to do this Chrissy, but we have to leave.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"But, but what about Axel?\" Christine asked.<br>\r\n\"We'll have to leave him. I'm sorry.\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"This guy's right, Chrissy. Go. Get away.

I chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Ean isn't gonna be too happy with you big man.... trying to chat up his girl.... I don't think He'll be very happy when he hears about it. The guys eyes widened, he looked at one of his buddies (or that's what I assumed he was) who was in mid-transformation. It's amazing to watch someone in their twenties go through it as opposed to when you are a baby, like I'm used to. When you are a baby it's not much different than usual except you don't eat as much, you're quieter, and you occasionally spit up fire (this was very important because it would show what color and type of dragon you would be). When you are older you cannot do anything, not even eat. Sometimes it can be deadly because the new organs you need to produce fire sometimes eat the other organs. The man was crying, like all the others did before their time. I smiled as I stood them both up. I pulled Eliza and the man to Ean's room and pushed them both through the door.<br>\r\n\"What's this,\" Ean said annoyed at the fact that I did not only bring the one he sent for. \"Why did you bring him?\" <br>\r\n\"well,\" I started....    </span></div></div>",

I only came because of that scent; the painstakingly alluring scent of... Kara. I watched her as she gazed at him. He of course gazed at Eliza, to me, it was disgusting.<br>\r\nSuddenly Ean cleared his throat and turned towards me.<br>\r\n\"Seth,\" He said glaring at the man, \"Will you please take this gentleman to the sacred grounds?\" I saw Kara smirk, she had always been unnecessarily vicious. I of course nodded, Ean smiled, \"and just in-case there is any problem with cooperation involving the eternal fire... I'll send Kara along too.\" I tried desperately to hold the unprofessional smile that was fighting to peek its way through my stone hard expression. Kara looked at Ean, and then Eliza and at that moment we realized what he really wanted. \"Whatever\" Kara siad walking towards the man. I turned to walk out the door and suddenly there was a \"thump\" I turned back to find the lying on the ground with eyes rolled to the back of his head. Kara bent over to pick the man up, \"No Kara\" Ean's voice echoed from his seat. Kara scoffed, \"What, you don't think I can carry this weak human?\" she siad sounding appalled and even irritated. \"No, but when there is a male with you take your place\" He siad patiently. I understood my cue and ran over to pick up the lump of a man. I set him on my shoulder and started walking. A few seconds later I realized Kara wasn't following, \" Come,\" I summoned her awkwardly, knowing she was only pretending to be submissive in front of Ean. She submitted to Ean and no one else. After we were outside of the building Kara began talking.<br>\r\n\"So Seth, what do you think of Ean and Eliza?\" she asked already expecting a certain answer. \" I think they're relationship is unorthodox on both sides.... sometimes I even think there may be something wrong with Ean, constantly chasing after a human that keeps running away than being content with the multiple females here. Kara smiled, \"That's exactly what I think!\" <br>\r\nThat's when I saw it. Her eyes, they were turning the lightest purple and I could see the faint flames flickering inside. She was jealous.<br>\r\nI mean, everyone knows that normally if a master ends up with a female apprentice he will stay with her till death, unless the master finds a female. If so, after training the apprentice must leave the master and become a master herself (which rarely happens and is most often prevented at all cost).<br>\r\nI wish I could be Her master, I have not yet received an apprentice because the priest says that I am already focusing on an apprentice and cannot have two... It is true I try very hard to get as much time with Kara as possible.... but that does not make her mine... she will never be mine... she is Ean's. <i>\"The law was written in blood, and no one shall defile it.\"</i> I remember the old saying of the priest when we were still be being taught the law... for a prince must know his own law is what my mother siad.<br>\r\nfinally I came out of my thoughts when we reached the sacred grounds...</span></div></div>",

Alexis go back to sleep.\" Andrea laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say boss.\" said Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's so cold, I need that beanie on the back seat,</i> thought Andrea. She took her eyes off the road. <i>Only for a sec,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" she cried. She took her hands off the wheel and put on the red beanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear G-d Andrea the wheel!\" shouted Alexis. Alexis leaned over, grabbed the wheel and yanked it towards herself. But not in enough time to stop the car from hitting the shadowy figure that had caught the attention of Alexis, who just so happened to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my...G-d. I think we hit someone Alexis.\" said a very frightened Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really?\" said Alexis. They both got out of the car. Andrea got the medical supplies from the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy named Gyan,\" said Alexis. \"Is that a shovel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes.\" Andrea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have it?\" asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bury the body so there's no evidence proving we killed it.\" said Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh it's a zombie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Andrea, NO!\" Alexis tried to stop her crazy friend but it was too late. Andrea had hit the guy on the head with her shovel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea are you crazy?! The guy wasn't dead, he was alive! How do you think I knew what his name is?\" Alexis screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he dead now?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not. Gosh you have a strong arm.\" Gyan said as he was rubbing his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, thanks. I'm Andrea.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Alexis. Do you need an ice pack?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No the rain and the cold will do. By the way Andrea my name is Gyan, in case you don't remember your friend telling you.\" Gyan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, before Andrea came along with that shovel you were telling me something about a girl and a cave.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this girl is really sick and she needs some help. Do you have some medical supplies?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do! Our boss will hate us for this but we have no choice right Alexis?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Hop in the car Gyan and tell us where the cave is. Oh and Andrea?\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm driving this time!\" she smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erian woke with a start, trying to remember where he was and how he had got there. Days and nights of panicked running and hiding seemed to melt together into a hazy blur, but he forced his tired mind to work. Automatically, he took note of his surroundings and his current condition. He was leaning against something hard, and he could feel that the ground was dry, though his clothes still clung to him damply. His memories came back slowly, reluctantly. He had been caught in the rain and had decided to take shelter in the cave for the night. It was pitch black, and the darkness was so complete that he could not even see his own hand in front of him. The only light came from the faint moonlight that entered from the cave entrance a good distance away. What had been his fire was now nothing more but another dark shadow in the darkness with no trace of heat or light remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErian felt  the bulge of the package in his inner coat pocket, reassuring himself that it was there, then shivered as the keening wind carried in the biting cold from the winter storm outside. Not for the first time, he wondered whether these days of being hunted were ever going to end. He would give almost anything to be warm and dry, and not hungry. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he hadn\u2019t been hungry. It felt as if his stomach was trying to eat a hole through to his spine, but it was still better than the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErian took out a flint and knife from his bag and stooped over the dim shadows of what remained of his firewood, planning to relight the fire. But just as he had managed to coax the beginning of a weak fire, he heard the splashing of someone wading through water and the sound of voices coming closer. His breath caught. He dropped the flint and knife from his hands, taking out the gun hidden inside his coat  as he jumped to his feet, quickly kicking dirt over the nascent fire. His eyes were fixed unblinkingly at the entrance of the cave. Fear twisted at his insides, and exhaustion seemed to weigh down on his shoulders, but he ignored it all with a grim determination as he crouched down, feeling his way along the wall as he backed up deeper into the cave as silently and quickly as he could. He stopped when he felt the rough wall give way suddenly into a sharp corner. After a moment of blind feeling at the wall, he realized that it was a nook in the wall at the end of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the voices come closer, Erian ducked inside without a second thought, undoing the safety of his gun with a muffled, decisive click. His eyes held a hard, cold light as he tensed, waiting. If they wanted to catch him, they were going to pay a steep price. He wasn't going to go down without a fight, and he had already killed his share of people. He would do anything he needed to survive. The hand holding the gun trembled just slightly, and he shivered as another cold draft entered the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of splashing and raised voices came closer. \"This is it,\" a male voice said. \"She's right in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Ugh, I'm soaked through!\" an obnoxiously high voice complained. \"I never thought that the road couldn't reach here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore footsteps. \"It's so dark. Hey, Andrea do you have the flashlight?\" another female voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't you have it, Alexis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? It should be in your bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErian could hear the clatter of something metallic being set down, and the rustling of cloth. \"It's not here. Are you sure you don't have it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence and more rustling of cloth and clattering of metal. \"Could it be,\" Alexis said, her tone somewhat abashed. \"that we left it in the car? Uh...Gyan, do you have an extra flashlight on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man named Gyan sighed in resignation. \"It's alright, you two wait here. I'll go in and bring her back out.\" The footsteps continued closer. Erian gripped the gun even tighter, and quieted his breathing as he waited, ready to kill if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if with each step closer his heart beat louder and faster, and when the man was only three paces away it felt as if his heart would beat right out of his chest. But Erian forced himself to keep his breathing quiet, ignoring the sweat that moistened his palms and the protests of his tired muscles. He didn't know who this man or those two women were. They did not sound like the type of people who were his pursuers, but he had been tricked plenty of times before. Trust was not something he was accustomed to having. Not anymore. He could only hope that they would turn back without noticing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a startled squeak came from behind him, and he spun around just as something--or rather, <i>someone</i>--screamed and lunged into his stomach, throwing him hard against the cave wall. His gun fired, the sound of the gunshot echoing through confined space, followed soon after by other yells and the sound of rapid footfalls coming in their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErian pushed his assailant off roughly, and the moment that she\u2014he realized now that it had been a woman from how light she had been\u2014fell onto the ground with a cry of pain, a man lunged into the small space yelling \u201cMelody! Are you alright?\u201d Blinding light filled the small cave. \u201cWho are you?!\u201d Erian yelled out, blinded from the sudden light. He raised his gun and tried to direct it in the direction the man had come in, but the gun was knocked out of his grip. Next was a hard punch to the stomach, and he crumpled to the ground, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea?! Did you get him?\u201d Alexis gasped. \u201cOh my god! He had a gun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch...I can\u2019t feel my fingers,\u201d Andrea complained. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I took self-defense! Is he unconscious now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Gyan said slowly. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably just incapacitated for the moment. Melody, how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d the woman named Melody said weakly. \u201cJust a bit scared. I woke up alone in the dark and saw someone nearby, but it was a stranger with a gun waiting by the entrance. Then I heard your voice and I\u2026 Who is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He looks familiar though\u2026\u201d there was a sharp intake of breath. \u201cAlexis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he look like that man we saw on the news a week ago? The wanted criminal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Alexis gasped. \u201cHe really does! It\u2019s not a joke! What are we going to do\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyan\u2019s cry of warning came too late. In what seemed like only an instant, Erian had lunged himself off the floor and had grabbed the woman closest to him by the hair. His nails had extended until they were like wickedly curved talons, and the cold moonlight reflected coldly from the burnished claws. A trickle of dark blood ran down the woman's neck where he had drawn the tip of a nail against it, after which his captive widened her eyes and stopped struggling, still as stone. The scent of fresh blood was intoxicating, and it took every fiber of his self control to control his hunger. <i>Meat. Fresh meat. Blood and muscle. Peel away the skin, crack the skull--No!</i> He gritted his teeth and forced his thoughts away from the scent, but it was like telling a starving a man to ignore the aromatic feast in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to hurt any of you,\" Erian growled. \"I was only here to take shelter from the rain. You're not involved. If you promise not to tell anyone--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this?\" another voice said from the entrance.</span></div></div>",

She had definitley... messed up at her old home. One of the many. Trouble seems to follow her everywhere resulting in her needing to run away from everything and anyone she loved. This time she decided to start somewhere remote. She would try and interact with no one. She had hurt too many people already. Taylor smiled triumphantly at the sight of the cave not too far from where she was walking. To get there she would have to scale the side of a steep rocky ridge and carefully walk along the edge of the skinny trail on the edge of the /extremely/ large hill or small mountain. 'Piece of cake.' She thought to herself. She climbed up the ridge with ease, for her many days of rock climbing finally came in handy. When she reached the mouth of the cave she heard voices. Hiding behind a large boulder she listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sick.\" said a weak, female voice. \"I've got a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second voice replied. A males this time. \"I'll go see if I can find some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor heard the CLUMP CLUMP CLUMP of his approaching footsteps. She stepped out from behind the boulder and the male jumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Taylor asked simply. She wasn't afraid. Her many encounters with the people who were constantly searching to kill her taught her that most frightening things really aren't all that frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Gyan.\" He stuttered. Taylor wasn't sure if it was the cold or the sight of a mysterious, dark stranger covered in bruises, scars, cuts, and blood in the middle of no where. \"Wh-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Taylor Shard. Who's the girl?\" Taylor replied, her voice echoing throughout the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl answered for herself. \"I'm Melody. Please help me...\" Her voice was weak and faint. Taylor was very experienced in first aid and nursing/ doctoring people. Not only did she go to school for it for about a year, but having to nurse herself and many other close friends back to health. Taylor walked over to her and felt her forehead. It was warm. It's for sure a fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you... do you have any sort of towel, cloth, handkerchief?\" Taylor asked them both. The male, Gyan, handed her a small handkerchief. Taylor whipped out her canteen and poured some water onto the center of the handkerchief. She laid it carefully onto her forehead. \"Apply new water to this every twenty minutes and keep this on your forehead. You need to find a doctor and he'll perscribe something for you for you.\" Taylor smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you..\" Melody whispered. Her eyes were closed and her breathing was becoming more regular. After a few moments, Melody was in deep sleep. Suddenly, a rock falls from near the cave mouth. They hear a rustling in the grass. Taylor whips around and strains her ears for any other noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" She asks softly.</span></div></div>",

Gyan and Melody both turned swiftly to see what.... or better yet who caused the commotion. Melody shivered cringing in fear in the cave; she had already been through enough for the day, seeing as she was the only one lying on the ground immobile and stricken with fever. If it had not been for the looming dark of the night,which quickly crept upon them, as well as the limp figure that was Melody, who lay lifelessly on the ground, Gyan wouldn't have thought to bring his rigid,well worn pocket dagger for protection. All the while outside of the stone walls, Anandie stood with Eliza just a stones throw from the cave. No matter how much Anandie pleaded with Eliza, Eliza still refused to stay hidden within the lodge. \"I know I heard voices\" hissed Anandie to Eliza through bloody red teeth. \"We should've gotten into the old sedan and rode east, where they wouldn't think to find us.\"  Eliza slowly inched her way closer to the torn cave tuning-out Anandie's angst, drawing out ol' Bessie, her shiny 45 caliber pistol that she had pulled out of her pocket quickly but with ease. Raising the 45 to eye level as sweat ran thick as ink down her face from her oily, matted hair. She would bring an end to her enemy and this cat-chase, after-all who was she fooling, she can't keep running forever .  No matter if she rode east, the last place that her enemies would expect, Trevor would find her somehow,someway he was determined to take her down. Taylor inched toward the blocked exit, Eliza inched toward the blocked exit.Neither, the party of three stuck inside the cave nor the two looming-spectators standing outside the cave could see who awaited them next.  Taylor still could hear footsteps thow, through the muddy,mushy grass. Eliza realized she was at a disadvantage. She knew whoever was in the cave would hear her first, whether it be friend or foe. She had not had many friends cross her path lately, so she was guessing more on the side of foe. Eliza quickly threw back the first big boulder while keeping a strong clutch on ol'bessie. Taylor moved forward to help whoever the strangers were on the other side; evidently someone must have heard them somehow, someway and had come to rescue them out of the cave. Only one more good push and they would all be freed. Taylor pushed the next chunk of thick rock as Anandie pulled that same chunk of rock. Neither party was expecting what they would see next as the last bit of rock came tumbling down, hearts thumping, eyes racing, hands quivering. \"howdy, stran-g-ers.\" escaped Taylors' badly chaped lips as she leaned forward to get a better look. \"Lets cut short the pleasantries shall we.\" The wild eyed woman with the pistol yelled as she inched closer revealing her shadow darkened face. Anandie stood stale looking around in the cave, two women, and one man, but they definitly didn't seem like any of Trevor's minions, albeit now wasn't the time to underestimate what could definently be enemies. Then the ground began to shake, not like the earthquake shake they had before, this was a different kind of shake. This kind of rumble seemed weird -- that not of this earth kind of wierd. And they were right to guess because he that would reveal himself was not of this world at all. He was a strong muscular built black man with eyes the color of coals. They would have said that he appeared out of nowhere, except he seemed to have formed from rocks right before their eyes. He had a strong high cheek bones with a long pointy nose, but it was his accent that seemed so striking an out-of-this-world kind of striking. It was unbelievable to them, could this be real. This dude just formed from rock.... right before their eyes! \" You must come with me quickly, for we have no time to loose.\"When he spoke it sounded like water seeping inbetween thick rock. Yet, his voice seemed so soothing, and his eyes seemed so calming that one could not help but to believe that he was on their side. \" Who the heck are you?\" said Eliza quivering. \"My name is Saith,I come from a sort of hidden society. I've been sent here to save you he said to all of them, although he seemed to stare into Eliza's eyes in particular. \"We've been watching all of you and knew you'd be here at exactly this place in time.\" \"Hugh\" Taylor said as she looked on in deep confusion. \"Eliza, Trevor and his minions are way stronger than you think, for  your enemies are not of this world but of the next\" \"You all have no choice but to abandon this location because Trevor and his cronies are near\" \"All, what do you mean all, I have no enemies\" Gyan said roughly, so I'm not going anywhere.\" \"You can choose to blindly take no heed to my warning and face a dreadful death by staying in this cave, or you can choose life by coming with me into the Neitherlands, a place where you will be hidden and trained to face the dangers that await you here on earth.\" \" But whichever you choose you must know that there is no alternative route.\" \"Wait a minute here, I didn't harm anyone\" Gyan said.\"So I have no part in this, I'm just gonna go home and take a nice warm bath and-- SSSSwwwiiiSSSH! Plow ! the sound of racing footsteps and shot guns began drawing nearer to the cave. \" It's your choice either you go into the Neitherlands or run back home, but I can asure you that they are aware of your presence here in the cave Gyan, and they already know where you live because these people are not of this world. They will certainly take you down\"   Footsteps were no longer in the distance they were almost at the door now and they each had a life changing decision to make quickly. Stay here and die a painful certain death, or proceed forward to the Neitherlands where they could have some protection.Then Saith waved and a dimension opened within the walls of the cave; it seemed like magic. Neither of the five could believe their eyes as first, Eliza, then Anandie, then Taylor, and Melody sprinted toward the opening. Gyan looked around quickly to search his surroundings for a quick solution......</span></div></div>",

Still, there is no reply. I turn around to go when the door opens just a crack, letting out a sliver of flickering firelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Shadowed in the light is a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Caden. My wife is in the car. It's broken down. She needs help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it somewhere else.\" The woman starts to close the door. I don't let her. \"I'm sorry--\" From her tone of voice I can tell she's anything but-- \"but I'm very busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat I can believe. \"It won't take a moment. Just loan me your keys. I really need to get her to the hospital. You don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" the woman muses acidly, taking a step away from the door,\" I don't want to.\" She pushes hard against my hand that is blocking the door. I don't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fire inside flares up, illuminating for a brief moment the woman at the door. On her hand there is a wet, scarlet stain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It looks like you need help, too.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's none of your business, mister. Go <i>away.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I can't wait any longer. Nice isn't working; it never does. I push the door open. \"Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I care?\" She shoots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a robbery recently. One man was dead and two more were injured. They won't ever walk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she makes the connection. \"<i>The</i> Caden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile at her, though from the look on her face I take it that it wasn't a very nice one. I don't care. \"Look, lady, the way I see it, I have two options: one, I can take your keys. Two, if I'm feeling especially mean--Like, say, now--I can kill you and take them from your corpse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a molten scowl, she tosses them away from me. \"Here,\" she mutters, \"take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffortlessly, I take them from the air. I turn away. As an afterthought, I add, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's face softens a bit. She closes the door. \"I hope you crash and die.\" She tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a smile, I walk over to the car and start it up. It's no wonder she was hesitant about handing over the keys. The car is a new Camaro, with an amazing custom paint job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sloshing around in the mud for a while, I finally get out. I pick up Elyse, And race down the slick highway to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Something in my headlights stops me.</span></div></div>",

The man in the car was waiting for my answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading...\" the man watches me, probably thinking I have no sweet clue where the hell I was actually going. Which was true. \"Um... that way...\" I point ahead of me to a little light far off down the road and in the woods. The man follows my gaze, his expression confused. \"To the cabin down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said, leaning over to open the passanger seat. \"Hop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was very short. It was helpful of him to take me the rest of the way, though it wouldn't have been that far a walk. The heater of the car blasted and warmed up my shaking hands and frozen toes, and I almost didn't want to leave. But soon we had pulled down the long dirt path leading farther into the woods and to the lodge's doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cars were parked in the driveway and one on the lawn. Deep tire tracks were dug into the muddy ground in front of the house behind the vehicle, and by the looks of it, it didn't seem as if the drive had cared much about the survival of the owner's lawn. Plus the car was still running. I didn't know why, but I had a sudden feeling of dread -- a certainty that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log cabin wasn't very small. but it wasn't large either. By the light spilling onto the leafy ground, I could tell someone was awake inside. I was a little nervous, because I've never been to this place before and was afraid I would be rejected if I asked to stay the night. I didn't know what these people were like, but I couldn't stay out in this storm and freeze. I needed shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is it,\" the man said. He looked a few years older than me, maybe 24, and had dark black hair and cold, hard eyes, as if something dark or troubling was on his mind. But then again his words seemed friendly enough throughout the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's for driving me this far man,\" I said, reaching for the handel and pushing the door open. I swung my legs out and stood up, sheilding myself with my arm from the powerful gusts of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Glad I could be of some help.\" The man then glanced at the entrance to the house, and his eyes narrowed as a look of caution came over him. Wondering what was wrong, I followed his gaze and stared. The door to the cabin was wide open, swinging back and forth on its hinges by the wind. The sight of it sent chills down my spine. Something was definately wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes unwavering, the man got out of his car and came to my side as I inched forward towards the open door, cautious. We cast each other a glance, and I nodded. Something serious was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were just reaching the door and about to peer in, our minds racing and senses on alert, when all of a sudden....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, deafening scream came from inside. Our hearts jumped, then plummeted as we saw the beaten body of a woman crumbled to the floor.</span></div></div>",

Anymore than she could be said to have a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had watched from the culvert, impervious to the rain and wind, and even fear, as the woman that the officer  stopped by the side of the road did her deed, and followed in the car as the murderer fled up the rain-drenched hill, towards the mansion at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beacon, hadn't she been Mariah's beacon? The north star to all this craziness? The single thing she'd woken up to see in the forest? Well? Wasn't she dead? And wasn't that woman her guiding light? The frozen apples, and then the guiding light? They had slipped easily past someone in the woods, then a couple by a broken down car, the man angrily gesticulating, even waving a gun, then even past another car with a bleeding woman inside and an infant in the back seat, weeping like an open wound, and then by another man, who seemed to see them, but who hadn't been able to catch up? Then to watch the light break and bleed and evil pour out, and directionless pour in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah got in. She continued to follow the woman. Who looked back, dumbfounded at first, until she saw the phantom behind the wheel with the long, uncombed hair, and not the poor, brainless cop. Then she picked up her pace, and darted off the road, back into the trees, towards a darkened cabin-like structure lurking back there in the gloom. But just when Mariah was turning off herself, ready to plunge into the forest, there she appeared again at the top of the hill, near the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she stood, still directionless, with the beacon most likely inside, and death in the car, and mysteriousness down on the road below. As she stood indecisive, blinking in the rain, a man lurched past (he who had been in the forest?!) with a gun. Seeing her, he suddenly stopped and hid his weapon. He seemed to want to turn, then seemed to think better of it. His feet stuttered in the wet gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess, thought Mariah, I really must look a fright. I mean, being buried for who knows how long. And again the image of the frozen apples surfaced in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" the man said, taking a firm step back. And his gun was out again. But it only wagged in the wet air, impotent. He quickly turned and went staggering back on towards the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all this time, Mariah had become aware of some sort of crawling sensation at the back of her neck, as though there were worms. She turned, and through the trees glimpsed that darker darkness, the cabin, or whatever it was, at the bottom of the hill. She felt watched, and felt angered by being watched, angry at being caught out, her dress in rags, her hair in such a state, and her poor grave beneath the ground with its perfect soil pillow how many miles away? By these strangers, these criminal strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if this road in the middle of nowhere in the middle of a storm wasn't a perfect highway now, she didn't know what. Because here came to her death-dulled ears the sound of yet another blurting, blatting, struggling car engine. And headlights splashed over her front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I felt terribly guilty, but there was no way I could take Alice with me. Of course, I would regret making that decision for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice continued to walk in the direction she was going, with the rain pouring down her back and soaking her jacket.  After several hours of walking in the rain, she sat down under a tree.  Just as she was making herself comfortable, thunder and lightning crashed down, nearly splitting the tree in half.

There was a lamp broken outside my room and there was dried up ketchup or something all over the floor. And why does my room have all this weird furniture in it? I ask my mom these questions when she comes up the stairs to where my room is. I don't know Bella. The movers and the landlord were supposed to completely clean the house out and remove all the furniture before we had a chance to move in. I will have to go use the neighbors phone and ask the landlord why everything was not removed. She walks out of my room as I go and look around the rest of the house. Something in the house just doesnt feel right. My aunt in law Alice dissapeared from here 20 years ago and hasnt been seen since. I complained about this house over and over agian. Yet. We still had to move in.. I walk around the room listening for any hollow noises anywhere in the walls. Its just a hunch I have but I believe that my aunt was murdered in this house with that lamp whenever somebody broke in. Her mom and dad went shopping together leaving her here alone and then when they got back there was a broken lamp on the floor and what looked like blood. Alice was just...GONE. This house just gives me the creeps. Wait wha wha what was that? I just heard a noise in the wall. MOM MOMMM MOMM I scream running out the door. A knife just flew over my head and into the wall and whenever I knocked on the wall it was hollow. Mom I want to get out of here its so fraking creppy!!!! Honey just go back. You can start tearing off the wall paper cause we have to replace it anyways. And you can check out that HOLLOW area if you want. Okay mom I say reluctantly and go back. I sigh and rip off the wallpaper. Wait what the heck? Theres something white. Is that a door? OMG yes it is. Ok moom time for me to give you a little scare by hiding in this little room since you dont seem to believe me. I go into the room and shut the door behind me . There is a little hatch door on the floor. I open it up slowly and go down the stairs into it. I switch on my flashlight and scream. </span></div></div>",

But you really do put characters in limbo when you cut a storyline short. Just saying.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now Author me is neutral. But, I must say, this is a pretty snazzy story we have here. Thank you Voxxylady! Ok, reader, make your decision please. This looping forest scene need to end soon, or I'm gonna freeze my ears off.\" I elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Her mother never worked, but what her father brought home was just enough to feed their nine children.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They had lived in a cramped apartment, two bedrooms, one bathroom. They were never well off, but it worked, and they were used to it; besides, six of the nine children were 9 and under at the time, so they were small enough to share beds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A year after the Clifford family lost their apartment and was forced to live on the streets, the youngest, Mary, age 4, was hit by a car. She made it to the hospital, but since Mr. Clifford lost his job, the family lost their insurance and they were unable to pay for a hospital room and treatment. Cruelly, the nurses and doctors let poor little Mary die.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The family was devastated, but it hit no one harder than it did Mrs. Clifford. She plummeted into a deep depression and was later found hanging from the rafters of this very building -- the abandoned bakery.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was six o'clock in the afternoon, and Sylvia's father and siblings should be at the shelter, eating a hot meal. Sylvia was never fond of the shelter; she never liked the feeling of being waited on and getting special treatment that she doesn't feel she deserves. She was one of those girls who felt like everything must be earned: Even food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sat quietly. Thinking. She did this every evening. Thinking about everything. Her life. Life in general. Her mother. Her baby sister. Her father. Her siblings -- an older brother, two younger brothers, and the rest sisters.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, disrupting her train of thought, the back doors of the bakery burst open. How could somebody get that open? They were locked. Always have been. Sylvia had always squeezed in through the side window that was half-open.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who--Who's there?\" she cries out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvia said nothing. She sat there, breathing laboriously, heart pounding. She couldn't see the man, but she felt like he might hurt her if he found her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not going to hurt you...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who--Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Business had been down for months, and it was a good day if the place saw but one visitor. Today was one of those days where the motel rented rooms to no one, and by this time of day, the place was vacant; the last resident checked out at noon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exhaustion setting in, Dorothy rested her elbows on the counter, carefully placing her chin in her palms. It wasn't the most comfortable position, but it was enough to cause her to doze off a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was nearly asleep when the over-the-door bell rang. She was now alert, prepared to serve her next client.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There, standing in the threshold, was a handsome man in a ravishing suit and tie. He held the door there, wide open, making eye contact with Dorothy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sir? You gonna come in or were ya jus' leavin'?\" Dorothy called out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes. Sorry. Got any rooms available?\" He remained, holding the door open seemingly wider.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dorothy cleared her throat. \"Well, if you're gonna stay, could ya please close the door? Looks like rain out there.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man did as requested and approached the desk. \"I need a room. Please.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We got plenty o' rooms. How many nights?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just this one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dorothy's shoulders slumped in disappointment. She knew that it was none of her business, but she always hoped that anyone checking in would stay longer than one night. The more money she can get, the longer the motel stays in business. She had to keep it running for her late beloved husband.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed. \"That'd be $30.99.\" As the man forked over the change, Dorothy watched his face. There was something strange about him, but she couldn't quite put a finger on it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dorothy usually had an excellent \"people instinct\", as she called it. She almost always knew what a person was like just by looking at his face, and she just <i>knew</i> that there was something off about this fellow. The way he held himself, the way he spoke, the hollow look to his eyes. Something was strange, and Dorothy wasn't so sure about lending him a motel room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, she pushed that thought aside; she needed all the money she could get.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I could just see your ID now, I'll get you your key and you'll be all set,\" she said a bit shakily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ma'am? Are you frightened?\" He feigned concern. Dorothy knew it was false. The man was just... he <i>was</i> frightening. She was <i>frightened</i>.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No sir. I-I just need ta see your ID!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I don't have one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry, but I can't let you have a room without an I--D---\" Her breath was caught off by a firm hand clenched to her throat. She grasped onto the man's cold, dead-feeling hand, trying to pry his fingers free.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He got close to Dorothy's face, gazing deeply into her eyes. She felt a pulling sensation on her mind as the man told her once again that he had no ID; he demanded to be allowed a room anyway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without hesitation, Dorothy gives him the key to the room, although she didn't want to, although she fought against his mysterious persuasive power. All she knew was that her instincts were correct and that this man was bad news. She was going to find out more about him, no matter how long it took her.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep or change perspective:</div></div>",

Their expressions told me nothing.<br>\r\nWhere was my sister? <br>\r\nSuddenly the automatic doors flew open and an ocean of rain poured in. Looking around the corner, I searched for my father's face. <br>\r\nHe said he'd be here soon. Is he hurt? Is he with the little kids? Where's Violet?<br>\r\nThe man who walked in wasn't my father. No, he had long hair that my mother would have attacked with the kitchen scissors upon first glance. It must have been brown at some point, but the hurricane whirling just outside had turned it a sinister shade of tar. He was holding a woman clumsily in his over-sized red hands. The woman appeared to be asleep, and she was very beautiful. Her sugar-spun hair was the color of Dad's corn on the cob and it curled in every direction. Her face was dotted with freckles which accentuated her ski-slope nose and full lips. Her lashes were like a fairy tale princess's and her eyes were shut tight so I was left to wonder the pigment of her irises. <br>\r\nThe man abruptly shook the woman. \"She needs help! Somebody help her!!\" The receptionist, D'Ann, placed a comforting chocolate hand on his shoulder in a genuine attempt to comfort and calm him but the lunatic shrugged her off. \"Don't help me! It's my wife!\" D'Ann signaled for several doctors equipped with a stretcher to help the woman to a room. <br>\r\nAs they wheeled her away, the man tried to follow and D'Ann stopped him. \"I'm sorry, you're going to have to wait out here.\" She gestured over to the area where I sat and they both looked past me as if I was invisible.<br>\r\nAfter years of wishing to be invisible, THIS is when my wish is granted?<br>\r\nMystery Man, quieter now that his companion was in professional care, slumped into a blue sofa across from me. I couldn't help it, I stared.<br>\r\n\"What are you lookin' at, kid?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not a kid,\" was my genius response.<br>\r\nHe seemed to crack a smirk at that. \"Oh yeah? How old are you now? Seven? Eight?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm thirteen,\" I answered seriously.<br>\r\n \"Oh,\" he seemed embarrassed. Good; did I really look seven or eight as a nervous wreck? <br>\r\nAwkward silence.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go...\" I started towards the bathroom uneasily. <br>\r\nIn one swift motion he'd hoisted me over his right shoulder while his left hand brandished a gun. I heard all commotion in the hospital cease. <br>\r\n\"Now nobody's gonna move or talk until I'm gone, you hear?\" He jerked from side to side looking each individual in the eye with a threatening look while I struggled in vain to squirm away. He frowned, \"Good. That's more like it.\"<br>\r\nWe exited through the automatic doors and out into the pouring rain. He stood me up on the rough sidewalk. Keeping a tight grip on my wrist, I silently regretted turning down Violet's offer for a free self-defense class. <br>\r\n\"What's your name, kid?\"<br>\r\nI'm no sucker. 'Taylor.\"<br>\r\n\"Good, now I'm Ryan,\" I couldn't tell if he was lying too, he matched my acting abilities, \"and you and I are going to get into that car over there and pretend like none of this ever happened.\" <br>\r\nI looked over to where he'd pointed. Sure enough there was a new green Camaro parked up against the curb. I couldn't help but think how much that car would've impressed my brother. <br>\r\nWould I ever see Tristan again? What about Dad? Or Violet, Xylina, Joy, Jade, Christopher, and Kainen? <br>\r\nWhere was Violet?<br>\r\nThen I noticed the woman leaning against the Camaro. She had sleek, straight blond hair that was chest-length and dazzling blue eyes hidden beneath sharp green eyeglasses. Her brown leather jacket protected her folded arms from the rain, and I was VERY impressed by the name brand of her jeans. And considering my current situation, she had a relatively calm expression. As a matter of fact, I could've sworn I saw a smile played at the corners of her lipstick-smeared mouth. <br>\r\nUh-oh.<br>\r\nThis guy had a partner in crime.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His skin was pale like an albino and the veins in his arms were black, running with evil blood. He was muscular and tall with a bulky frame. His sleek black hair was disorganized and disheveled. His eyes were black, like pits. When Peter looked into them, he saw his greatest fears.  Great fires burning down the world's greatest cities. Peter fell to his knees, the fear overwhelming him. Ebon smiled with sadistic pleasure. He reached down and wrapped his huge hand around Peter's neck. Peter winced and shivered at Ebon's touch.

I shook my head wearily. Ryan Watts wore me out 24/7. But I could not help myself from loving him. <br>\r\nAbruptly he glanced over at me and nodded subtly. Sighing theatrically, I whipped out my cigarette and lit up. Taking a long drag (that immediately went out in the pouring rain but still eased me for the moment) I flounced towards our latest victim. <br>\r\nI was used to Ryan's ransom projects. He somehow always convinced me to be a part of his scheme, and I went along like his puppy dog. I knew he was using me. I was ideal for any kidnapping situation. I could charm men, be a friend to women, and lure little kids into my clutches as if I was everybody's mother. But this time was different. He'd taken a girl whose age I wasn't accustomed to. She must have been at least a preteen if not an early teenager, and from the defiant look she was giving Ryan I decided on the latter. <br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie. My name's Megan. Megan McGuiness.\" I extended a hand which she regarded with unconcealed contempt. Then she looked me straight in the eye with an ultra-sweet smile.<br>\r\n\"Hi Megan. I'm Taylor. Taylor Maldonado. So, are taxi drivers using green Camaros now?\" She looked behind me and her eyes widened at the sight of the car.<br>\r\nI know, kid, I wish it was mine too. <br>\r\nI laughed, \"Haha, you're a funny one, Taylor. Actually, that's Ryan's car. Mine's across the lot.\" I nodded over my shoulder in the general direction of the racy red convertible. <br>\r\n\"Hey,  my sister has a nail polish in that color. It's called 'Rock the Vote Red'. She really likes it. I've used it a couple times but it never comes out that glossy and--\" Ryan cut her off. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's gorgeous, we all know, Taylor. Now just get in Megan's car.\" He gave her a tough shove and she fell on top of me. For a moment fear crossed her face, but then her smooth agitated expression returned and she folded her arms tightly across her breastless chest. <br>\r\n\"Fine. But I call shotgun.\"<br>\r\nWithout thinking I laughed. \"Sure, honey, let's go.\" <br>\r\nAs Taylor and I walked to the car, I didn't dare look back at Ryan, for fear he might see the guilt easily visible on my face. Taylor Maldonado was my only way out of the hell Ryan put me through. I helped her into my car, and then raced away. Ryan hadn't even gotten into the stolen Camaro yet, I could keep going. All I had to do is ask Taylor where she lived, dispose of her, and then I could run free. <br>\r\nThis idea was appealing to me more and more as we drove along Madison Avenue. I looked over to the gangly figure next to me. \"So Taylor, where--\"<br>\r\n\"Megan keep your eyes on the--\" She stopped at the same time as I slammed on the brakes and the car flew to the side of the road. The rain pelted down on the two of us (the convertible's top was broken) and I could just make out the silhouette of a person not three yards ahead of us. I stole a glance at Taylor, whose mouth fell open in either surprise, horror, or delight (I'm new at this \"kid\" thing). <br>\r\n\"What is it, Taylor?\"<br>\r\nShe grinned an evil grin that I've only ever seen on my sister's five-year-old daughter, Maddy, before saying, \"Megan, that's my brother!\" </span></div></div>",

It wasn't like Trevor had any idea what to do in a fight. He was an artist, not a boxer. She damn well wasn't worth messing up his hands and destroying his career!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement from behind caught his attention and he jerked around, catching glimpse of a tall, sturdy figure with dangerous-looking objects in each hand. His heart nearly stopped. Did she have bodyguards now? He knew her singing career was evolving, but she wasn't quite <i>that</i> famous yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the dark, it was hard to tell just how terrified he should be.

They'd already found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm grasped his. The shadow. \"Careful. I think I saw a gun flashing in there.\" The man's voice was low. \"I'm Mike, Nikki's brother.

He was a large man, well over six foot, with long coarse brown hair and blue eyes, who had been conditioned by many years living alone in the wilderness. A loner by nature, he had gone to live on his own after having been betrayed by those close to him. It would seem he did not fully escape the cruelty of man.<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\"<br>\r\nThen he remembered. A group of thugs had come to his cabin, and knocked him out. He saw the clothes hanging around him and surmised they had thrown him in the closet. Furious he stood up, grabbed his loaded shot gun from the top shelf of his closet, and burst down the door. It fell down to the ground with a resounding thud. The group that had been inside the cabin lie ducked on the ground after the limb has shattered the window. Glass shards were scattered all along the floor. Jeremy pumped the shot gun.<br>\r\n\"You folks have til the count of three to get the hell outta my cabin, before I start blowing some heads off.\"<br>\r\nNikki sat crouched in the corner, frozen in shock at all that had transpired.

James yelped in fright as the shotgun blast busted a gaping hole in the floor where his hand had been a moment before. It sent the gun he was going for far across the room. James' eyes widened as Jeremy stomped across the room. He quickly was bashed in the head by the butt of the gun, knocking him unconcious. Then Jeremy looked at Nikki cowering in the corner.<br>\r\n\"Please, please! I'm not with them! They kidnapped me and wanted to kill me, please!\" she yelled frantically<br>\r\n\"Well, its alright now, those thugs won't bother you or me any longer. ...dang thugs.

There's plenty of her to go around -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor, being the idiot he was, stormed up to him. The man just watched him as he neared. \"Who the hell are you?\" Trevor demanded. He was face to face with him now, his chest puffed out and his fists clenched. \"Oh, wait! Let me guess! You're another one of 'dear Vanessa's' toys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just smiled, obviously amused. \"You make it sound so dirty. No no, not a toy, my dear friend -- \" Trevor scoffed at the word friend, \" -- but a... blood mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood mate? What was this guy talking about? Trevor seemed to be infuriated by these words, even though Mike was certain he didn't know what he meant anymore than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay away from her, you hear? And tell those other scum bags too, back from where ever the hell you came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down at him, his smile still on his face. \"Oh, I'm not going anywhere,\" he said, his voice becoming deadly. \"And neither, I'm afraid, are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man suddenly grabbed Trevor's shoulders before he could react and, to Mike's utter horror, leaned down and bit his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the screaming started.</span></div></div>",

A million questions ran through his head, but only one thought stayed constant. Keep Moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew and Slosheey were camping out in the woods, the two were hiding from the storm under a shelter they had built. \"Its good to finally be able to take a break from saving the world, isn't it Slosheey?\"<br>\r\n\"If you say so, yes. Your world is safe for now. But keep in mind, the loss of contact with a capital ship won't go unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n\"You sir are the most effective downer ever.\"<br>\r\n\"What is a downer?\"<br>\r\n\"Its not even worth explaining. Let's have some fun, you throw some rocks I will shoot them.\"<br>\r\nAs the eleven year old boy stood up from his seat and reached for his Assault Rifle, he had flashbacks to his time with Operation School. The brain-washing, the battles, the death. Andrew realized if he hadn't had the brain-washing, however, Operation School would have likely driven him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlosheey tossed a couple of rocks and Andrew fired at them, hitting everyone. As he tossed, Slosheey sensed something.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Andrew said.<br>\r\n\"There, in the Bushes.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't see it.\"<br>\r\nSlosheey looked at Andrew bfore becoming invisible, \"Stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew waited for Slosheey to return. A lightning strike spooked Andrew, he found it funny how bullets flying passed his head didn't even matter to him, but lightning miles away scared him. After a little while longer, Slosheey came out of the Bushes holding a Man. \"Let go of me you freak!\" The Man demanded.<br>\r\n\"I'll have my friend put you down, if you promise not to run.\" Andrew said.<br>\r\nThe Man gave Andrew an angry stare, but nonetheless complied.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I won't run.\"<br>\r\nSlosheey placed the man on the ground. He dusted himself off and gave Slosheey a disgusted look.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Andrew asked.<br>\r\n\"Does it really matter?\"<br>\r\nAndrew drew his Assault Rifle, \"Who are you?\" He said.<br>\r\n\"You must be one of those new child soldiers I've heard so much about. Operation School right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes but what is your name?\" Andrew asked, getting annoyed.<br>\r\n\"My name is Mike.\" Mike said. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Andrew. That's Slosheey.\"<br>\r\n\"I can speak for myself.\" Slosheey said.<br>\r\n\"Lets not have this fight.\" Andrew said quickly. \"What are you doing here?\" Andrew then asked, returning to Mike.<br>\r\n\"I...\"</span></div></div>",

I guess that was it.\" Mike shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Oh, did it have wings? Did it have ugly claws?\" Slosheey asked excitingly.<br>\r\nMike then said truthfully: \"I had no time to look at it.\" Then, Slosheey disappointingly slouched down.<br>\r\nThe wind blew hard, sending the tent flapping. That was when they saw the head appear. And it went closer and closer, all the way until the head was inside the tent.<br>\r\n\"Aha! I have found you Mike. Your friend tasted delicious, but too bad you couldn't get your blood drank.\" The figure smiled a wry smile.<br>\r\nMike jumped back, but Slosheey bravely confronted the vampire with her Assault Rifle. \"Get away! Or else....\" But the figure cracked. \"Simple child, I am immortal. You cannot kill me!\" And then there was a bam, and the figure's head rolled onto the ground, and the figure's body landed on the ground with a soft thud. <br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!\" The head said. \"I am immortal.... this is impossible!\" Then there was silence. <br>\r\n\"Phew! Glad that's over!\" Andrew said, wiping the sweat from her face. Just then, the figure's body started to move, and the hand started to reach forward to it's head.<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Mike said, his face growing pale, his finger pointing toward the vampire.<br>\r\nSlosheey and Andrew then nodded, and said: \"Go! Go! We will take care of the vampire!\" And Mike runs as far as he can, away from the vampire. Suddenly, he bumps into his sister. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, my sister?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n\"There's a zombie in my house!

She stopped and backed up against a thick, leafy tree, trying to catch her breath. she thought for a moment, and closed her eyes, thinking. Did she have enough power left? Would she be able to cast one more spell? she knew what she would do, but could she reverse it later on? Say this was her last spell available. Could she find someone to help her?<br>\r\nAt last, Kira decided that she would risk it. She stepped away from the tree, and spoke quietly at first, but grew louder and louder. \"ANIMAL TRANSFORMATION! GRAY WOLF!\" <br>\r\nAs Kira finished, she immediately bean to feel the changes begin. She felt the fur begin to grow on her legs, and then spread down to her feet, which changed into paws, while her knees reversed to become her hind legs. Kira braced herself as her pelvis reshaped, forcing her down on all fours. Her spine extended and burst through the back of her pants as a furry tail. Kira watched as the fur spread up farther to her chest, and then down to her hands, which morphed into paws like her feet had. Finally, her face pushed out and her ears grew to points and shifted up to the top of her head. <br>\r\nKira was now a full wolf.

Hadn't he told her before, one of the first rules of living in the Transylvanian woods? \"Never ever socialize with, let alone bring home strangers to the area.\" She ruefully thought of how thrilled he would be when he found her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in a flash of lightning, she caught a glimpse of red. Could it be? Was it Mike? Was it Trevor or one of his friends? The guy was slightly cute, she had to admit. And she wouldn't completely turn him away at a time like this. But the glimpse was gone, and it was too fast for her to tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, there were footsteps on the hardwood floor behind her. Footsteps she recognized. Vanessa gritted her teeth. So it had all come down to this. </span></div></div>",

It seemed he was the only one finding any fun in the situation but he would try and change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will you entertain me with a good story or do you prefer playing some cards?\" he asked as he finished treating the unconscious one \" he'll be alright by the way\" he added with a smile. Then they heard some noises outside the cabin and he smiled some more \"Who knew this forest would be so full of people\". He was really liking how his night had turned out just when he was about to die of boredom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Usually he would just pass it by and forget all about it, bu the air around here smelt a bit different, so he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, analyzeing the scent, thats when he noticed it. A slight copper tang in the air, that is usually associated with, \"Blood..someone's hurt, seems to be comeing from the cabin.\" he mumbled to himself, debateing on whether or not if he should help. On one hand, it wasn't his problem but on the other hand someone might be dieing.\"What do you think?\" he asked up into the sky as if his dead sister could hear him.Suddenly a bolt of lighting struck down beside him, towards the cabin.\"Alright already, i'll help.\" he replied before strideing to the cabin and opening the door. Once he stepped through he found himself face to face with a girl holding a gun to his head. Behind her he noticed another girl crying, an Unconcious man, and finally, a guy smileing and shuffleing a deck of cards. For a momment an awkward silence filled the air until he finally spoke, \"So....to get out of hear i just run the other way ri-\" he was cut off by the sound of someone moveing outside and a flash of lightning illuminateing a figure out side the window across from him.

She grimaced by the pain, but she had other things to worry about. Jake was leaning against the fireplace mantel, watching her struggle with dark amused eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no use,\" he said, the corner of his mouth lifting into a mocking smile. It sent a shiver down her spine. \"There's no escaping now... besides, of course, you agreeing to tell us where he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa glared at him threateningly. \"Never!\" she growled. \"You will never find him! I'd rather die than tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's grin grew. \"That can be arranged,\" he crooned. Icy fear washed over her as she stared into his brown eyes. His words had been so matter-of-factly and simple that it seemed to slice through all the hopes she had of surviving. He was telling the outmost truth, and that terrified her. \"We can always ask you brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she practically shouted. Angry tears swam in her eyes. \"Michael has nothing to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake laughed scornfully. \"We'll see about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a knock came from the door. Her eyes widened in fear. 'This was it,' she thought, tears streaming down her ashen cheeks. 'There's no way out. I'm going to die... I'm going to die...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair she was tied in was faced away from the kitchen, where the front door was, so she has no possible way of seeing the person until he comes and stands next to her. The wait was agonizing. She was finally going to find out who her enemy was at last. All this time Jake had been stalking her, keeping an eye on her for him. Jake had betrayed their relationship for this man... if he had ever though of it as a relationship at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe she had gotten herself into this. Her brother Mike... her dear, dear brother Mike, had warned her to stay away from him -- that he was dangerous. Was he ever right. She had told him that she could be friends with whoever she liked. Turns out Jake had only been so nice to her for the past month because he was trying to obtain information about her cousin Blake, who was in the witness protection program. He had betrayed a large mafia group that was trying to get there hands on a lot of gold, one of them being a golden egg that apparently was worth millions of dollars. Blake worked as a spy, along with his good friend Trevor, and had corrupted the group, but since it was so large, not everyone was caught. It got a new leader, and that very man was entering my cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" She heard Jake's voice from where he was in the kitchen. \"Do you know how hard it was to bind her? It would have been nice if I had had some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man didn't say anything but strolled through the kitchen to the den, still behind her. He sounded close. Vanessa stifled back a cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader spoke quietly to Jake for a moment, her words almost too faint to hear. Vanessa caught a few words though, and they were \"Finnish it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her life, she had never been so scared. Her very existence rested on this moment, and this moment alone. She was either going to die or betray her cousin who she loved with all her heart and have him murdered. Never again would she see Blake's smiling face, or Mike's, or her mother and father. Never again would she play with her dog or spend time with her friends, Anne or Robyn or Trevor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy she loved with all her heart since she was twelve. Her high school sweetheart and loving boyfriend. He would die too, if she gave Blake away. They were working together when they were in the mafia, and had brought it down together. They would surely want revenge on him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's vison blurred again as a new wave of tears spilled. She didn't want her life to end. She loved the world and didn't want to leave. But she would have too. She could not betray them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for her vision to sharpen again and for the world around her to return. Her tears subsided and as she blinked the rest away she realized that the man was standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was Trevor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments earlier, a blue flash of light appears not to far from the cabin. From the light a strange figure appears, a figure that is not of this world. His name was Marlock Garison, and he was something known only as a tiefling, half human, half demon. He had pale skin, red eyes, a long devil's tail, and two small horns a petruded out of his short, white hair.  He wore a black vest over a white shirt and had black pants but wore no shoes, which even if he wanted to wear them, it was kind of difficult with clawed feet. Strapped to his belt was a black rapier and as the blue light disappeared around him, he quickly pulled it out and scanned his surroundings. It was cold, dark, and rainy, but none of that bothered really. He noticed a cabin not to far away with the lights on but didn't see much else but trees. When he felt the cost was clear he pulled a crystal from his vest pocket and spoke into it. \"Marlock to Niv, do hear me?\" He waited a few seconds then the crystal began to glow blue. <br>\r\n\"I hear you loud and clear Marlock, was the transport successful?\" Said a voice that came from the crystal. <br>\r\n\"Yep, now...what was my mission again, Niv?\" Marlock said as he looked around.<br>\r\n \"*sigh* don't you remeber? You are supposed to gather samples of organic plant life and bring it back to our dimension.\" Niv explained<br>\r\n\"Oh ok...Wait a minute...i think i see something.\" Through the rain Marlock could see a dark figure sneaking up to what looked like the front door of the cabin.  <br>\r\n\"What is it  Marlock?\" Niv asked, half concerned, half excited. Marlock strained his eyes to peer through the wind and rain and saw what looked like a red haired man holding an axe.<br>\r\n\"Looks like a male human...appears to be armed.\" Marlock explains.<br>\r\n\"A human...ok Marlock, i want you follow this human and observe his actions, but don't get involved in whatever happens.\" Niv ordered<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" With that Marlock casts a spell of invisibility and begins to follow the man up to the cabin. When they get up to the cabin, Marlock watches as the man kicks open after counting to three. The man falls on his back and Marlock sees a taller, much stronger looking man standing over him. This newcomer picks up the axe that was dropped and turns to say, \"You see what happens when you fon't coapporate, other people get hurt.\" Marlock peered inside and from where he was and saw a girl tied to a chair crying and ankther man standing next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlock begins to get an idea of what's happening and doesn't like it one bit. His sword begins to glow and a voice speaks to him.<br>\r\n\"Marlock i know what you're thinking, and mustn't engage.\" <br>\r\n\"But Vlad...they'll die...\" Marlock says as he grits his teeth.<br>\r\n\"We have orders to not get involved.\" Vlad, Marlock's rapier, says with no sense of empathy. Marlock see's the man raising the axe ready  to strike his victim and can't stand it any longer. <br>\r\n\"Screw orders...\" Marlock gets up from his hiding place and, while still under the affects of invisibility, charges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was just in the middle of swinging his axe when it recoiled back into his face,as if he had just hit some invisble force. He grunted and held his bleeding forhead where the axe had hit him. He looked to see what he had hit but what he saw nearly made him crap himself. Standing over Mike was something that looked like it had just come from hell and was pointing it's flaming sword right at him. Marlock smiled a very toothy grin as he saw fear in his enemies eyes. Clearly he had never seen a tiefling before. He took advantage of the moment and attempted to scare Jake and Trevor shittless. <br>\r\n\"Leave now and maybe i won't drag both your souls down to hell with me.\" Marlock said in the scariest voice he could come up with. Jake looked to see if Trevor was seeing this to but only saw him running right out back door. Jake looked at Marlock a second time and this time it looked like he was about to attack. Jake dropped the axe and ran after Trevor screaming his lungs out. When they were out of site, Marlock sheathed Vlad and turned to Vanessa who was now quivering in fear at the site of him.<br>\r\n\"It's ok I'm Marlock Garison and i'm here to...\" Marlock was cut short as Mike finally got up and punched Marlock in the back of the head. <br>\r\n\"Ow! Damn it, is this how you treat your savior?\" Marlock yelled rubbing the bav<br>\r\nOf his head.</span></div></div>",

The boys spent their nights hiding away inside the caf\u00e9, with the pile of rubble they had built the only thing keeping the wolves that hunted at that hour from walking through the giant hole in the window and eating some dinner. Both brothers were very athletic, and had been electronically modified for an environment not unlike the popular game Mirror's Edge. Or, at least, it was popular before Raling took over and the New World Order came into effect. That was also the time when all of such modification technology was destroyed by an airstrike and a few missiles, bombs, and grenades.

If the creature was able to land its front limbs, Srenti would be a goner. It chomped down, and Srenti rolled his head to the side, narrowly avoiding the snap of the canine's fangs. Before the giant dog had a chance to land another bite, Srenti saw Entrinkil sprinting toward him with half of a metal pole- the one that had been snapped. The wolf howled in pain, and rolled off of Srenti, falling back down the pile of rubble. Entrinkil, even with his horrendous aim, had jammed the pole directly into the wolf's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large canine whimpered in pain, but quickly stood again. Blood trickled from its right eye as it glared. Srenti and Entrinkil had the high ground, and knew it. The giant wolf growled, in a fruitless attempt to scare them off. That thing would fight until its dying day, however, and before the brothers knew it, it had jumped again. It still had enough energy to make another power leap! This time it knocked Srenti off of the rock pile, pushing him into the street. Entrinkil screamed as Srenti's back smacked against the ground. Cracking noises. The wolf bore down, tearing a chunk of flesh from the older boy's cheek and chomping it.

And his eyes.. red not green like Talon's, also they were cold eyes the type of eyes that showed no remores. The eyes of a killer. Talon quickly jmped back drawing his sword. He brought it just incase things went bad or Kren showed up. \"Now is that anyway to greet an old friend?\" Kren said sarcasticly. \"there are lots of things I would call you, but friend isnt one of them.\" Talon replied. \"I know your after her, but she doesnt any thing about the stones.\" Talon said. Kren laughed at this. \"Oh she knows about them.... even if shes unaware of it yet.\" Kren said grining. This made Talon look up in suprise.\"What do mean even if shes unaware of it yet!?\" Talon asked tighting his grip on his sword ready to rip this guy a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"you will see soon enough. why ruin the suprise?\" Kren said still grining at Talon. \"THIS ISNT A GAME KREN!\" Talon yelled. Due to the storm every one in the cabin didnt hear any if this. \"I can see that you are as stuborn as before Talon, but i need to get past you. so could you move?\" Kren said not really expecting Talon to move. Talon and Kren were standing in sielence. No one speaking just the sound of the rain and thunder. Kren sighed and drew his sword which also looked like Talon's sword. \"I see you not going to make this easy. Fine I will knock you out and then head inside since theres no point in killing you....yet.\" Kren said. Talon didnt see it comming. Kren vanished and the next thing Talon rembered before he blacked out was the last thing Kren said\"I guesse you dont remeber everything from your past life yet....pitty\" Talon then blacked out.

Kira sat obediantly on the ground in front of him, and tilted her head a little to the left. She tried to look warm, trying not to seem unfriendly to the man. <br>\r\nFortunately, Talon didn't seem all too worried. Rain had soaked Kira's silvery gray fur, and it dripped doen to the ground off of her face and paws.<br>\r\nThe rain had also made Talon's shirt and hair stick to him. He looked almost pathetic to Kira. No clean kempt appearence at all. <br>\r\nTalon's sword lie on the ground next to Kira. The wolf looked down at it, and then gently nudged the hilt towards the boy, who sat staring at her with what seemed to be a mix of thoughts. He seemed to wonder what Kira was doing, and why she hadn't run away from him at the first moveent. <br>\r\nWhen Talon took his sword in hand, Kira turned and picked up a stick on the ground under a nearby evergreen tree. She held the stick in her muzzle, and began to etch her name on the ground. <br>\r\nTalon stared at her. \"...Are...are you trying to talk to me?\" he asked, still seeming in shock and wonder. <br>\r\nKira took the stick and wrote in the ground. \"Yes. Kira. My name is Kira.\"<br>\r\nTalon could only stare at her. <br>\r\nKira etched more words into the ground. \"I am a mage, and i am currently locked in the form of a wolf. Do you think you could help me?\" <br>\r\nWhat does Talon say?... </span></div></div>",

Kira sat there listing wondering to herself what this has to do with helping her.<br>\r\nTalon saw this look in her eye that told him that he was rambleing.\"Sorry, anyway i know how to transfer a little magic to others, it could be a lot more if I was in my dragon Form but...\" Taloon cut himself off and looked away at the ground.\"I would rather not do that.\" Talon said still looking at the ground. Kira say a flickler of sadness and fear in Talon's eyes.She woundered what must have happened to him for him to be so afraid of himself.<br>\r\nTalon looked up from the ground feeling Kira's gaze upon him.\"Oh ya sorry, now for your magic\" Talon said while reach for somthing on his jacket. Talon  pulled out a red shinning orb that glowed like a fire.\"This is a dragon core, it is what remains of one the anictent Dragon lords that created my world, its what im going to use to help you\"Talon said.<br>\r\nTalon then begain to say the spell, but Kira didnt hearit because of the wind. Then somthing hit Kira not a physical hit, but more like a jolt. Kira begain to feel her magic reterning, but then ,because of the magic transfer, Kira saw somthing that she wished she haddint. She saw inside of Talons subconsenes and in there was an entirly differnt Talon sitting in a black room looking down at the ground. Just then it looked up at Kira and smilled, but just then the spell ened. Kira was in the storm once again. She thought back to what she saw. She saw talon sitting on the ground in a black room looking at the ground, but this felt differnt then when she first met Talon. When she met Talon the arua around him was friendly, but this arua felt unstable and had no resone. She also thought she saw a pair of wings on his back. Kira was pulled out of her train of thought by Talon. \"Hey are you alright?\" Talon asked looking kind of worryied.<br>\r\nKira nodded. \"ok good you were spaceing out there for a second and i thought somthing might be wrong.\" Talon said looking releived. \"Hey I can ask you a favor?

Liss let out a suppressed, evil laugh and Talon frightened when he heard that bit of her voice. He knew that, when he wouldn`t do anything, she wouldn`t do anything to him.

Once the knife was lowered he rushed over to where he was siting before and picked up his sword and went back over to Liss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as he got back someone came out of the trees. \"I knew it was you\" Talon said. \"well I was waiting for your little stalker to let you go I wouldnt want this to be a unfair fight.\" </span></div></div>",

The gems then flew up and back down and then shot into Talon. Then a huge burst of glowing energy souurouned Talon. Every one in the cabin say this and ran out side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone could feel a presure of power coming off of Talon. Kren was unphazed by this he merly drew his blade and was ready to fight.

Talon and Kren reappried both skidding across the ground in oposite drierctions. They both looked up at eachother and screamed the same thing. \"HELLFIRE\" both sent waves of fire at the other. When the flames collided they went up like a bomb, everyone was knocked back by this.<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared Kren was still standing and Talon on the ground.\"Hah even with the power of the stones you still couldnt beat me\" Kren said laghing.

I pick one up in panic, hurling it at Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't expect the pro-veggie projectile patty, and it hits him in the face. Good, he's knocked out and I can rest easy. Apparently the cold had got in or something, because it was <i>hard</i> and knocked him over. He's probably unconscious. Wait, unconscious? Oh no, what do I do? Mike moans for chicken, now now now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" I say to Mike, \"I don't have any chicken! I'm a vegetarian!\"<br>\r\nHe doesn't listen, of course, but I don't blame him. He's sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had come into my house a few minutes before Trevor. He had been out in the cold too long, under that tree and in the rain, and even though he knew he had a cold, that wouldn't stop him from rescuing whoever was in there. At least, that's what he mumbled to me. I tried to plead with him, to make a soup supplement with what I had, but he was adamant about chicken. If I left, he might have gotten worse, or something might have happened, so I stayed, but he was stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I say, \"there's no meat in the house! Best I can make for you is some celery with peanut butter for a sick snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caves. \"Okay, fine,\" he gasps, exasperated. Yeesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what do I do with Trevor? Should I lay him down? Yeah, but if he wakes up, he might attack me again. Geez, I don't know. My hands are shaking. I've only ever knocked out two people before, and they were trying to rape me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leap into the kitchen and attempt to make PB&amp;Celery while I think about what I should do with him. I can't call police. The nearest town is half an hour away, and the few people who took the job of officers are too lazy to come all the way out here, take a body, then go back. That's what you get after the New World Order. Maybe if I lay him down, then tie him up? No, he might get the wrong idea. Um... I don't know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's stomach audibly growls. I pick up the celery and serve it to him. He says he has a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, man. I take Trevor outside. Wait, yeah! I'll put him down outside my house, and lock my doors. That way, maybe I can explain everything's all right? I'm not sure. It seems like the best idea now.

He had been watching Adria carefully since Tommy had injected her with the trash he peddled. Barely ten minutes later and she was high as a kite. He hated seeing anyone this screwed up and he hated Tommy even more for doing this to her... but what was he going to do? He was one voice amongst many in his family and the majority rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that hadn't stopped him from ditching Tommy and doubling back to The Lodge to watch over her. She had been too far gone to even notice him when he returned so he had thrown a couple of logs on the open, stone fire and and lit a match, hoping to sweat it out of her system. She'd barely said more than a few incoherent words the whole time but when the door flew open and a male voice called out to her, she muttered the name 'Mike' and something about 'anti-vegetarians.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey leapt from the chair, his first instinct to leave before this new arrival could question him. Instead, he straightened his jacket and tie and then crossed the small room, exiting into the outer hall. He could see that the front door was swung open and a dark-haired man, a couple of years older than Joey and soaked to the bone, stood just inside. Taking him in with his eyes, Joey spotted the rock held in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my sister?\" Mike seethed at Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to try and calm Mike down when the sound of breaking glass interrupted them. The bedraggled mess of a man, still clutching his rock, followed as Joey darted back to the room he had just left. It was a shambles. A side-table had been toppled beside the armchair and the curtains blew wildly into the room as the wind and rain assailed them through the broken shards of glass that used to be a window. A dozen or more books lay scattered and strewn on the floor, having fallen from the table under the sill and several drops of blood marred its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the girl, there was no sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my sister?\" the Mike asked again, with more anger in his voice this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Joey a moment to recover his senses before replying dumbly as he pointed into the storm, \"Out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, what the hell?\" another voice spoke up behind them, \" I ask you to do one simple thing and you screw it up! What the hell, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded to the third man as he came up behind Mike, \"Relax, Trev. I'll bring her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully clutching the sides of the window frame so as not to cut himself on the glass, he pulled himself through the opening and into the dark night.</span></div></div>",

The combiniation lock code was damn difficult, He swore to himself. He moved down the number on the lock. 5,6,7, no, that wasn't it. 5, 6, 7, 6, ah yes! 5,6,7,6,9 He thought to himself. The vault gave a hissing noise releasing steam.Three layers of it moved away , disspearing into darkness. The silver lining of the vault became a stark brown. The door opened and in it were $150 million dollar gold plates, each with the sign of the C.S.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan whistled to himself, this money was worth a damn fortune and would keep him content for life and he would have done lots of stuff, had not the bell rang right now. He stuffed whatever he could take and placed them in a bag. He rose and exited from the room. Shouts could be heard from Guards with their dogs barking and growling. Ryan ran through the corridors and saw the window. He had two options. Either wait for the dogs to come or jump from this window. Ryan chose the latter. He ran as fast as he could and slammed into the window hard. It broke but scratched his arms. His shout was heard. He landed onto the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'' Well, well, well, if it isn't Mr Ryan. I thought you were away in the Bahamas, enjoying your vacation.'' A voice said behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned his head to look at Patrick O'l Leary. They had both been friends at High School , then going to University, Ryan had passed with a full degree in explosives and bombs, while Patrick got his application to join the New York Police academy. The only thing that had caused their friendship to deteriorate was when Patrick discovered his best friend was a theif , that stole not the small stuff, but the big stuff. He had been given a case to solve. The '' robin hood '' of New york. He stole from the rich and had generously funded small charities and orphanages. Finding Ryan to be the criminal had an emotional impact on him. He never believed that Ryan could be a thief. But Ryan admitted to being a thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blinked absently, her deep brown eyes unfocused as she drew herself back out of her work. The phone rang a for another two rings before she finally realized what the painful cacophony meant. Another call from Ryan. Alex glanced back at the half-completed prosthetic on the work table uncertainly, then sighed and reached for the iPhone that was buried beneath a pile of diagrams and tools. Even though she was extremely tempted to just ignore him and continue on with her project, if she ignored him he would keep on calling until she picked up. Better to just get it over with. She picked up and put him on speaker as she continued on with her soldering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she said brusquely, \"I'm very busy, so keep it short. What do you want now? That decryption device you wanted isn't going to be going for any less than what I told you before, and I ain't bargaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you said that you install prosthetics before,\" Ryan's familiar voice came over from the other line, but it sounded strained. \"Do you have a medical license?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldering iron froze over a neural processing connection. \"I do install prosthetics, but I don't have a medical license. I know all the material, so you think I have seven, ten years to waste?\" She rolled her eyes. \"Why?\" He was probably up to something again, though she didn't understand why he was suddenly asking about a medical license. He never cared about licenses and what not before, so why did he start now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard him sigh, and there seemed to be what sounded like <i>sirens</i> in the background. \"That's better than nothing,\" he said hastily. \"I'm coming over in 10 minutes. See you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He hung up on me.</i> She thought in disbelief. Alex glared at the phone for a moment before scowling down at the still-incomplete project she was working on. It sounded like he was stuck in some trouble again with his job as usual. But if he was coming over, then that meant that she probably wouldn't have the time to finish this today. She sighed then started to clear her things off her desk. She'd have to finish it next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clearing her desk by hurriedly throwing her tools back into their boxes and setting the prosthetic back on top of another pile of equipment next to her desk, she took a cursory glance around her room. Cabinet and desk drawers with tools and papers emptied out onto the ground reminded her suddenly that she was still in the middle of cleaning. <i>I got distracted again.</i> She sighed. Cleaning up always took so much time; it was already the fifth day in a row, but it looked no better. In fact, it looked even <i>worse</i> than it did before she ever cleaned it. Perhaps she should just give up. She really didn't mind it the way it is, and she always could find her things despite it not being the most organized. The only real reason she even attempted to clean up the place was because the rare visitor that came here always complained about how messy it is. But apart from Ryan, not many customers that knew about this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a portion of what seemed to be solid wall swung open silently.</span></div></div>",

His brown hair clung to his forehead and he brushed it away with his hand as a shiver crawled down his spine. The temperature was dropping and the wind was becoming stronger. It pelted his already soaked back, and he knew that he would have to get to the lodge soon, or freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had been watching him, and Trevor knew that as long as he was there, he would have no chance at getting to the cabin safely. Now that he was gone, it gave him room to breathe. He must have given up in trying to protect his sister, but that was alright. One last person for her to rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor turned back to the cabin and was about to head that way when somthing caught his eye\u2014a shadow moving through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe halted. 'What was that?' he thought. He stared at where the shadow disappeared through the rainy night. He remained like that for a moment longer, his eyes wavering and his mind reeling, but when nothing happened, he shook his head and started toward the lodge again. His mind must have been playing tricks on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a short distance from his hiding place and was pushing back a low branch when all of a sudden another shadow shot past him a few meters ahead. Trevor stopped, the branch still in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell?' he thought, suddenly scared. Not wanting to show it he yelled against the wind, \"Who's there? Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue and person strolled smoothly out, light on its feet. It was a woman wrapped in a wet cloak. Her long platinum hair was plastered around her face and rain dripped from the tip of her nose. Trevor thought that she should have been miserable, but instead she stood before him proudly. The storm seemed to do nothing to her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spoke. \"Come with me.\" Her voice was as soft as velvet and as beautiful too, but rang through the storm with such strength and confidence that he couldn't help but be a little nervous. Who was she and what did she want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout checking to see if he was following, the woman turned away and hurried into the rain and out of sight, away from the lodge and the road. She wanted him to go deeper into the woods!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor didn't know what to do. The woman was like nothing he had ever seen. She didn't seem... human, but something more. He had never been scared of the other gender, but now... he wasn't so sure. When she had strolled out, she was so light on her feet that they seemed not to hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his shoes and the trail of muddy prints he had left behind him. The ground was too soft. Any contact with it and your feet would sink in slightly. He looked back the way she went and couldn't find a single imprint. And something about her voice. It was too smooth, too powerful. Her presence was so reassuring yet unsettling . He didn't feel right when he saw her, yet he felt so right. He couldn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remained there, unsure of what to do or where to go. He could forget about her and go to the lodge. He needed to do something there. He had a duty. Yet, curiosity pricked at him. Maybe he should follow her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to glance back the way Mike went, towards the road. His car was waiting there. His warm car that would bring him back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another shadow fleeted away in the corner of her eye. Terror gripped him as he searched for it but it was gone again. He didn't know what to do. All he knew was that he couldn't stay here any longer\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing human could be so... he refused to continue his line of thought. Eliza waited and he had to get to the lodge or die in the process. Standing in the tree line, he thought how strange it was that there were so many people out in this unkind weather... and in the middle of nowhere. Even hunters didn\u2019t dally in weather like this. He looked over his shoulder back into the woods. People of all kinds lurked in that forest tonight. <br>\r\nIt had to be the moon. Trevor chuckled to himself. He\u2019d had this running joke with his friends about how things get crazy while the moon was full, but he had to admit, he always did his best work by the light of a full moon. He worried more about how the paint felt going onto the canvas, how pleasing it was to smooth the brush across the plain surface and not so much about form or technique. Eliza had been his inspiration; his desperation; his obsession for longer than he wanted to admit. His patrons had to have their paintings and if he didn't have Eliza, he didn't have anything, not even his life. His buyers had decided that he had to produce four more paintings by the end of the month and he knew they were not the kind of people you could say \u201cno\u201d to. It was impossible to disappear from a family of such influence unless you were taken into the witness relocation program. <br>\r\nTrevor shivered again in the cold as the rain turned to sleet once more. The gusting wind made it prick his skin but he started down into the clearing. If he was going to pay for his sins, tonight would be a good night. He was no more than one hundred feet from the cabin door, but now he wondered if he should go home instead. Though not totally innocent in their current predicament, Eliza was still a girl - barely 20. Trevor wasn't sure why she'd run from him earlier in the day, but he was about to find out. He wondered if she was in some kind of trouble \u2013 well, trouble that he\u2019d caused her by getting her image mixed up with his work. <br>\r\nJust as he reached the door of the cabin, lightning brightened the clearing and he jerked around. There standing in the rain was the platinum haired woman. Her damp hair whipped about her in the wind and her cloak swirled about her frame. Her face was expressionless, beautiful. He blinked, wondering at what he'd just seen as the darkness closed in about him again. He had to be seeing things. He turned to the lodge door and lifted a hand to rap on it, but paused. What if he'd brought them right to Eliza? What if all the people in the stormy night were sent by his powerful patrons? <br>\r\nHe frowned. It was too late for concern now. If he had brought danger, he'd stick around to fight it when it reared its ugly head, but he had to see her. He had to touch her hair, smell her perfume... his hand fell upon the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She brushed her short, ratty brown hair out of her face, and leaped from he tree. She landed lightly on the balls of her bare feet, using the storm as a cover for the crunching leaves. The waiting man was only about 10 feet in front of her. He turned his head slightly, and with a shock, Ky realized he must be Liza's brother. They had the same red hair and dark eyes. She crept silently around him, and trotted toward the back of the house. Staying out of the light and stepping silently, she thanked her Father for teaching her how to be a thief. It had saved her life a number of times. Her reflection in a puddle made her stop and study her face. Her stormy blue eyes flashed in annoyance at her stupidity. Hormones made her act like the 16-year-old she really was. How she wished she could speed past this stage and become smart again. Ky continued toward the back of the lodge, and reached the tiny window that was there. Easing it open, she slipped inside, head first. She ducked into a silent roll and stood up. She was exactly where Liza had told her she would be. In the mop closet. She peeked her head out of the door, and saw a hallway leading both left, and right. A sudden realization made her stop.

Pain shot up his leg but he didn't care. \"Now Vanessa could die and it'd be all my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shape in front of him materialized out of the shadows. Mike stumbled back in terror. Was it Trevor? Had he heard him when he was watching him? If he had, then he had surely come to kill him. He was, after all, a threat to him. Mike clenched his fists as he tried to stand his ground without shaking. If he was going to die, he wasn't going down without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person strolled swiftly out of the trees to stand mere feet from him. Mike almost sank in relief. It was the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Follow me and I will lead you to your sister. But hurry,\" she said, while handing him something heavy. Mike looked down in surprise. A knife lay in his hands. \"He is near,\" she warned gravely, her eyes serious. Without another word she turned around and hurried out into the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can I trust her?' Mike wondered. He gripped the knife in his right hand and was about to follow her when suddenly he heard something or someone closing in behind him in the darkness....</span></div></div>",

Every time that ended the arguement and Elena, a twenty-seven year old house wife went back to her original idea of acting like nothing happened. She'd wash the dishes, prepare the meals and act heavenly during the night all to protect herself from any heart ache she may later endure if she were to fight him. Michael at thirty years of age was still thriving for something. He wanted the perfect family and Elena knew that even her and Matthew weren't enough to stop him disappearing into the night to save his sister, to just sit or to find a family, a woman more suitable. With all these thoughts buzzing through her head Elena realised she'd washed the same plate seven times.<br>\r\n\"Matthew, time for bed.\" She smiled at her son on the floor playing with his cars, ramming them into the cupboard like it were a brick wall.

And her silver eyes were startling too. Elena wondered at the young woman's name. Even in the science fiction books she'd read, names like Odaxitar and Daichi had never entered into them. And... surely that tail was part of some Halloween costume. Those things got more elaborate each year. Even Matthew had wanted to be some gruesome monster this past Halloween. There must be some kind of convention in town, Elena mused. Last year the town had been over-run with Trekkies and that'd been disturbing enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Odaxitar still looking at her, waiting to find out if she knew where her brother \"Daichi\" was, Elena remembered her manners and was about to respond when two rough looking characters entered the tavern. Their appearance was rather disturbing. Perhaps they were going to the same convention Odaxitar was. Elena was just about to say something of the kind when she noticed that Odaxitar had disappeared from sight, leaving Elena to face yet another pair of difficult customers - for problems rarely started with just one. Well, she'd had her share of those and knew how to handle them. Avoiding eye contact as the two men glared here and there, she wiped down the bar and started setting a few glasses on it. Several patrons left without paying their bills, but she knew them and had their credit card numbers in her files. She sniffed and nodded her head to make a mental note of each person who left without payment. She was thinking how rude it was for them to desert their drinks like that when she realized these two characters were disturbing her customers. That angered her and soon her face was as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. What can I get you two gents?\" she asked, careful not to look directly at them. She turned to grasp a pair of round coasters and watched their outlines approach the bar using the mirror. Yep, they were Uug-ly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, a few of Matthew's toys lying on the floor, but that wasn't unusual. When she took my hand, hers was clammy, and it made me feel uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" she said. Her voice was low, and she led me to Matthew's room. Shoving into the doorway, she said, \"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing untoward. Matthew lay fast asleep on his bed, more toys lay on the floor. But nothing in any way odd. I turned to Elena and shrugged my shoulders. \"What?\" I mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena jumped in front of me and said, \"What the . . . ?\" After a moment, she added, \"Maybe they're in the living room now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her into the large, open plan living room/diner. It was empty. No sign of Mike or anyone else. \"Well, that's strange she said,\" with her rubbing her chin. She continued through the whole house in that manner, until finally slumping in on of the wooden kitchen chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, you're freaking me out now. What the hell is going on?\" My sister was generally the better of us three girls at keeping it together. She chose a decent husband who would never cheat on her (like my husband, Ben) and would never spend all their money on horse races (like Fi's husband, Hal). No, Mike was a good one. Elena chose well. She did everything well, but now some thing I didn't understand was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were here, Millie. The three of us spoke. Well, actually, they spoke and I listened. In Matthew's room and out into the hallway. Then you rang the bell, and now, where are they? They were here!\" Her voice became increasingly high-pitched. \"Here!\" Her red face steamed as she swung around in a 360.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, Leny?\" I prayed she would answer Mike and that no-good sister of his, but I knew she wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odaxitar and Mistfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy laugh was a reflex, and it was out before I could hold it in. \"Sorry. It's just, Odaxitar and Mistfire? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her hand on the pine dining table, making me jump. \"I know how crazy I sound!\" she hissed. \"I can hear me, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That's good. Then, what the hell are you talking about? Who is Odaxitar and Mistfire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in and speaking in hushed tones, she grabbed my wrist as she spoke. \"That's just it. I don't know. Odaxitar, I think she's human. But she's kind of purple, so I'm not really sure. And Mistfire, she's not human. But she speaks. She's a creature who speaks. Very wise, she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI search for the trace of a smile in my sister's face. I need to know she is joking. I need to know she doesn't believe all of this crazy.

He could not so much as think of a way to stall for the time he needed to make sense of things, so he just let the silence grow between them while the man stared.  The masked stranger maintained a confident posture in perfect stillness, and exuded an air of dreadful finality that said, \"So be it.\"  As the moments crept along, the acute feeling that he wasn't getting out of here without a violent confrontation increased, so that he scarcely dared to breath, lest the slightest indication of intention signal the man to attack.  It was like coming around a corner and surprising a viscious doberman.  Although he strove for words of peaceful assurance what finally passed his lips was a question he immediately knew was the wrong thing to ask, \"And what do you plan to do with her when you find her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer, although vague, carried a promise that Trevor knew was not given vainly.  \"Whatever I have to,\" he said.  Then the gun, an hefty piece with a large bore came out from beneath his black jacket.  \"Now get in here if you want to live.\"  When Trevor hesitated he added, \"Come on, there's no time for foolishness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying that Anne would keep still and get away unnoticed, he shut the door behind him carefully, never taking his eyes off of the gunman for fear of giving her away with even a moment's glance.  Once the door was closed, it took a mighty effort on Trevor's part not to sigh with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get down those stairs,\" he pointed with his pistol to a trap door in the floor, thrown open to reveal only an inky black aperture.  Beside it there was a kerosene lantern and a box of matches beside it.  \"I guess we're going after her together, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor did what he was told, telling himself to just play it cool until he had an opening to get the gun or escape.  He watched his hands trembled while he fumbled for a match, and he decided that escape was the better of the two options.  But then what about Nikki?  He had the feeling that this guy wanted a good deal more than her autograph.  He supposed that was one of the risks of putting one of your sexiest pictures on your book jacket; she had known better than that.  \"There's a reason that vanity is one of the Seven Deadly Sins,\" he'd told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" he asked while he tried a second match, the first having broken off in his nervous grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about what I want,\" he said cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled a little before he answered.  \"Well, I guess it won't do any harm to tell you, since you'll be meeting him ... if I don't have to kill you first.\"  He paused, waiting to see how Trevor would respond, once he had a moment to think about it.  When he said nothing, the man took his silence for ignorance.  \"Oh come one, Trevor, you should know, being Nikki's boyfriend and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sick feeling roiled around in his gut, as the man revealed intimate knowledge about them.  So they'd been watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Trevor got the wick to light and turned it up the man asked him with a note of derisive mirth in his voice, \"Do you mean to tell me that she didn't even have the courtesy to tell you why she-,\" now he laughed abruptly.  \"Oh that's so sad.  I'll bet you thought that she was the one too, didn't you?  Let me ask you, do you even know her real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor didn't dare to give him an answer.  Because he didn't want to hear such things, and because he had to check the rage that threatened to leap up in place of the fear.  It could get him killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" the man said, almost jovially.  \"Down the stairs now boy.  We find the girl and then you get to go meet the Wolf.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking she'd simply drop him off in the muddy driveway of the lodge, Anne put the little hatchback into reverse, held her foot on the brake and watched as Trevor hurried to the front door. He threw the door wide but stopped just outside of the doorway. That was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne watched for another few seconds, but he didn't move. The noise from the windshield wipers and the heater vents made it impossible to hear if he was calling for Nikki or not. Anne could imagine Nikki, lounging on some large rustic couch before the fire telling Trevor that she didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d come and that he needed to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because the lights were out that he didn't go in? His posture was such that Anne was unsettled. The feeling she had made her foot heavy on the brake. \"As soon as he goes into the lodge, I'll go on to find Jenna,\" Anne said, knowing she was talking just to calm the sudden jolt of nerves. It'd been years since she'd had been confronted with a situation that may be considered physically dangerous, but Anne knew, if anyone pushed her into a corner, her reflexes would take over and she'd be the only one to walk away unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting the wiper cycles as they swiped ice from the windshield, Anne placed her hand on the shifter, eyes still trained on Trevor's back. She had to find out what was going on. If Nikki was in trouble, Trevor would likely be a little more than just out of his element, he'd be in the way. The artsy fellow had likely never held a kitchen knife, let alone a hand gun or a switchblade. Tossing the shifter into park, Anne pulled the key from the ignition and reaching across the seat, she opened a small compartment in the dash where Paul said he kept his revolver. \"Don't point it unless you are going to pull the trigger,\" he'd always said. Well, if Nikki or Trevor were in trouble, Anne was going to catch the intruder unawares and she\u2019d need more than just a few choice words to convince him he was in the wrong line of work. She rarely let anyone know to what extent she could take care of herself, but her secret was about to be out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a black leather brass-buttoned jacket from the back seat. If she was going to go out tonight, she'd enjoy wearing her favorite jacket one last time. Anne checked the gun and shoved it into her back waistband. She sent up a prayer and then, putting the keys in her hip pocket, Anne exited the car, careful not to slam the door. Holding to the shadows, she slinked from one shadow to the other until her back lay flat against the damp side of the lodge. Quickly then, she ducked down and hurried along the side of the house and rounded to the back deck to look in a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior wasn't as dark as the night. It seemed Nikki had a fire burning in the fireplace. Anne saw a large flickering shadow cross the threshold of the room she was peering into and she froze, watching closely and listening to every sound, turning each one over in her mind and identifying them until she had focused in on the sound of two voices - both male. Trevor and some raspy spit-filled voice that made her skin crawl. She knew people who spoke like that - a mask often making their speech more difficult to understand, but she knew what he was saying and didn't like it. She didn't like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder didn't know where Nikki was? He had just showed his hand and Anne was about to take all of his cards for she saw movement across the room - it was a reflection of the firelight off something metallic that had shifted. Nikki had to be in that closet. Anne dropped down to squat below the window. She shook her head. Once the intruder started to look for her, he'd find her easily enough and then it\u2019d be on. She shook her head again and said under her breath, \u201cEveryone hides in the closet or under the bed. Come on Nikki. Couldn\u2019t you have found a better hiding place than that?\u201d Anne had to get inside, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering every angle before entering the back door, Anne realized the intruder would hear her. He'd not hear her enter the room of course, but once she was there, he'd hear her. She was dripping wet. Anne still didn't know exactly who she was up against, but she knew she'd risk being seen before she wanted to if she went in there dripping all over the floor and squeaking around in her squishy tennis shoes. She considered going back around the lodge and bursting in behind Trevor, acting innocent and like a blundering clumsy girl. That worked on occasion to keep the bad guy off balance, but only bad guys who Anne knew had no idea who she was. This intruder was a mystery. He could be anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne decided to chance getting caught. She got to the back door, which was surprisingly unlocked. She removed her shoes and socks and then, pausing to listen waited for her chance. It came not thirty seconds later. Trevor must have said something that angered the intruder because he\u2019d lost his cool and was yelling at Trevor about something he\u2019d come to get from Nikki. She turned the knob, keeping low, Anne slipped into the kitchen. She squeezed water from her pony tail, dried her feet on the rug and then paused to listen again. Slipping soundlessly to the door, Anne mentally touched the gun that rested cold against the skin of her back. She was determined to remove the threat without using the garish weapon, but felt secure knowing it was there if she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne pressed an ear against the door. Trevor was saying something about not knowing what Nikki had taken from the intruder, but if the man would tell him what it was, Trevor would get it back for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? The only reason you\u2019re still standing is because I\u2019m in a good mood tonight.\u201d The masked man drew in a long snotty breath through his congested nostrils. The sound made Anne cringe.  \u201cIf I tell you what it is, you\u2019ll keep it for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019d never do such a thing. It\u2019s yours. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want it for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou puttin\u2019 me down now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! I\u2019m just saying-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man interrupted Trevor with a bizarre laugh. Now was as good a time as any. Anne peeked out of the door and into the living area. There they stood. Trevor had taken a few steps into the room, but he didn\u2019t look like he was in distress, just upset. The intruder was a big man, probably eight inches or more taller than Anne. No biggie, she thought. The taller ones are easier to get off balance. The intruder cackled again and Anne took her chance. She scuttled into the room to rest behind the couch that flanked the intruder. Her back was to the fire and to the room she was sure Nikki was in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few of the other has some clothes in them, but not many. The summer season was still a month away and most people don't spend too much time in these mountains during the rainy spring times, a fact the storm outside attested to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich begged the question why there were so many people here in the first place? This was supposed to her MY job. I'd have to take care of the others once I secured the-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" I whispered as my fingers came into contact with the cool metal of a locked box. I quickly snatched it out, wiggling out my lock picks from the pocket of my pants. I brushed a stray lock of hair out of my face, glad that it's orange color was more concealed than usual under the hood of my waterproof jacket. Skin-tight too. Latest model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI played around with the lock for a moment, and smiled as the familiar click of the latch let me know the job was done. Pocketing my picks once more, I opened the small case and carefully removed the vial contained with it. I unzipped my coat, and slipped the vial safely between my natural cushions, and refastened the jacket carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to deal with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sneaked down the hall, careful not to make a sound. I came upon the other intruders in the front living room, though I remain in concealment for the moment to listen to their chatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! I'm being employed by one of the <i>sniff</i> biggest men in all of New York, and he <i>sniff</i> ain't employ no dullards!\" The masked mammoth was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. <i>Oh yes. so that's why you speak so eloquently! And if there's anyone bigger than you, tubby, I'll give up my commission And such a ...lovely....cold you seem to have.</i> I thought dryly to myself.  People didn't call me Queen Snarker for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Just tell me where Nicki is and what you want from her, and then you can get out of here and back to the city, no problems, no cops. But where. is. Nicki?\" The younger man's tone had gone serious and from my position in the hall, I could just barely see his eyes in the mirror. Dark eyes. Intense. And wet. This guy looked about as waterlogged as Niagara Falls. Oh? And what was that hiding behind the couch? I stretched my neck forward just a bit and smiled. Some crafty young girl was hiding behind the couch, looking ready to lunge at one of the men, though I wasn't sure which. I'd vote for the fatty. The other one was too close. She'd have taken her shot by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where your girl is!\" The fat one yelled, breaking into a coughing fit. I rolled my eyes again. He gave us professionals a bad name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you want? Maybe I can find it for you!\" The young one too another step closer, and the fatty fingered something in his wait. Probably a stun gun or some lame toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I ain't supposed to <i>sniff</i> tell no one.\" He shifted his immense weight uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I promise not tell a soul. All I want is Nicki's safety!\" He looked about as earnest as a puppy..... a drowned puppy. Man! Was this guys swimming before he came here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm lookin' for some sorta present she got from <i>sniff</i> her dad or something. It's in a metal box, and <i>sniff</i> it's supposed to be some sort of scientific <i>sniff</i> thing, and I had it, and I was <i>sniff</i> gonna turn it in for a reward, and she took it and <i>sniff</i> I gotta get it back or else the Boss ain't gonna be happy.\" The fatty was really nervous, now, and I could tell that it was time to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas I in the mood for some role-playing and a grand exit? Or perhaps a quite exit would be best considering... my luggage. </span></div></div>",

She heard his head slam onto the wood floor. She was certain he was unconscious. Slowly standing up, she exclaimed, \"Well, that was easier than I first thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was in a state of shock. Anne took him down in only seconds! His mind was racing. Their objective now was to find Nikki. <br>\r\nTrevor suggested they skimmed through the house. Anne rolled her eyes and muttered, \"Have you ever seen a scary movie? The victim always hides in a closet or under the bed. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two strolled into the dark bedroom. It was eerily quiet. The floorboard moaned along with every step. Anne spotted the antique closet that look as if it belonged in the 1800's. When they stopped moving, the could hear a faint breath, shaking. Anne said, \"Check under the bed. I'll get the closet.\"<br>\r\nTrevor bent down to peek under the four-poster. Seeing nothing, he got up and replied, \"Nothing but dust bunnies.\" Anne nodded, but was silent. She was certain her friend was now in the closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne whispered, \"Nikki, are you in there? It's me, Anne, and Trevor. You're safe. Everything's okay.\" Out of the blue, Nikki burst out of the closet and gave Anne a hug. With the commotion, the floor seemed unstable, as if it could collapse at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor noticed this, and started to tip-toe out of the room. He explained what he felt to the others, but Nikki responded, \"No duh! This cabin is really old. It's been like this since I started coming here. There's nothing to worry about, trust me.\" Trevor was still worried. After a minute of them calming down, Trevor knew this old room couldn't hold up for much longer. He had been studying architecture for a year, and knew this wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne saw a crack starting to form on the floor. She stated, \"Oh boy. That can't be good.

There was no way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne started to tremble as she took in the scene. Nicki was no where to be seen, but in the middle of the dark sparsely furnished room stood a man wearing some kind of dumb mask that had haunted her dreams for years. He wore a pair of black leather gloves too. The only reason Anne noticed was because he held a shiny silver six-shooter in one of those gloved hands and a rather mean looking Bowie knife in the other hand. The knife glinted in the light that shown from a flashlight that lay on the floor. All of these details, Anne noticed in a millisecond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor stood stock still in front of Anne. She couldn't tell what he was thinking, but Anne could tell he had instantly gone into combat mode. She figured he was assessing the situation just as she had been, but didn't know for sure what he'd do until his hand found her elbow. Paniced adrenaline laced her quickened pulse at the touch and she heard him speak slowly. \"Run. Don't look back. Run.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers let go of her arm and when she didn't instantly turn to go, he shoved her out of the doorway. Anne fell back off the porch and into the stinging rain. She scrambled up and ran, clumsy, falling, muddy. She finally got back to the car, fumbled with the keys a bit before getting them into the ignition and then threw the shifter into reverse. A second or so later, the hatchback was tearing down the muddy dirt road. She yanked her purse up into the passenger seat and felt around in it for her cell phone, praying all the while that she'd have at least one bar of service out here in the boonies. If the police knew the serial killer known as Mr. Predator was standing in the lodge at this moment, they'd be falling over themselves to get the first crack at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne flicked open her cell, not bothering to look to see if she had service, and held down the nine key. Click, click, click, click, ring, sssssssssss. Ok, so no service. Anne had mind to throw the phone out of her window, but she wondered if that one blip of a ring she'd heard would mean she'd be able to send a text message. She glanced at the phone for a second, but that was all it took. The hatchback started to skid in the loose gravel and began to slide in the curve of the road. With fingers already shaking, Anne tried to turn into the skid to right herself, but it was too late. Before she knew it, the car was in a rather deep ditch with fast running icy water.</span></div></div>",

Hmm.\" He rubbed his chin as he thought. \"Right. You're going to have to park up right here, and we'll walk the rest of the way. The lodge is only just around that bend up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the car onto the side of the road, Anne sighed. \"You want us to walk?

You know what Nicki is like. She gets involved with the wrong people, over and over again. And then, when she does, she cheats on them or steals from them, or does something stupid to make them want her dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated to admit it about her friend, but Trevor had a point. Nicki had always been the same, even in school. As she nodded, a feeling of trepidation settled in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well this time, it's a doozy. The guy she's been seeing for the last three months is some big time criminal. He has links to some very dangerous people. And my sister\u2014my stupid, little sister\u2014just happened to uncover the code to his safe. While he was in the shower, she put that knowledge to use. Inside, she found ten bundles of $5,000. She didn't just take one, which might not have been missed. Oh no, she took them all, and promptly left the apartment to go on a spending spree. But the money was marked. And she got caught. She told the police exactly where she got the money from, only she said it was a gift. Of course, her boyfriend found out. Now, there is a price on her head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story had to be fake. This kind of thing didn't to people she new. She was a first grade teacher in the suburbs. \"This is crazy, Trevor. Are you sure she hasn't been making up stories again? You know how wild her imagination is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, Anne. Trust me on that. Now, are you going to walk with me to get her? She's hiding, but I think her ex might have tracked her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear choked Anne's throat, squeezing the wind out of her. She wanted to shout at Nicki about how stupid and selfish she had been, and if they got out alive, she would! But, they had been friends forever. There was no way Anne could leave her to die at the hands of this crook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

Bennington staggered back and regained his balance, only to be knocked off-balance again by another smash kick to his side. Once again Bennington tried to regain his balance. This time Crystal launched herself at him with a flurry of light kicks and that stopped Bennington from becoming balanced again.

Damning god (or whoever rules this universe) with every curse word under the sky, I stopped to think.<br>\r\nWhat did i have with me? My hand crafted gun, a normal pistol by glance but actually more powerful then a shot gun. I also had a few throwing knives. But that was it, and I damned myself this time for being stupid enough to think that the weather might actually protect Nicki this time around. A whole hell of a lot it turned out to do.<br>\r\n\"Damn Nicki. Did you have to find the ugliest mug around? I ain't even that bad.\" I heard Trevor say. Fighting the urge to snort, I let the statement hang in the air for about half a second or so before I sprang into action.<br>\r\nKnowing i would hate myself for this later, I bashed my elbow into the window. Making the glass shatter and using the sound as a momentary distraction. Following the window break-in, i quickly threw some of my daggers and hopped up onto the window seal to push myself in. I noted happily that the tip of the blade actually managed to slip between the chamber of the bullet and the barrel.<br>\r\nI take it back, god is wonderful and merciful. I thought as i charged in, the thrill of a decent fight making my blood boil. Drawing my own weapon and some more knives, I moved in to slaughter the man before me while Nicki grabbed hold of the ever stupid and shocked Trevor and ran.<br>\r\nMaybe now she'd tell him the truth of what she really was.

I thought you were in Tokyo, turning all bad guys into good guys or something dumb like that.\" Taner's eyes widened, he put his hand to his heart and looked straight forward \"I am on a mission to transfer all evil in this world into good!\" An awkward silence filled the air... \"And?\" Aranov asked, wondering why Taner had to tell him that every time they met. \"... And my travels just happened to bring me here, to convert that now dead guy into a respectable human being who could help in the fight for evil.\" Thea, growing more and more worried decided to butt in the conversation \" Hellooo, Trevor and Jenna?\" Aranov cut off Taner's seemingly endless speech with a simple hand gesture. \"Oh, we better go and tell them that it's safe, huh?\" Thea nodded sarcastically, as if captain obvious was standing right in front of her. Taner perked up as if he had something important to say, but then retracted quickly, hoping they wouldn't notice. But Aranov did, looking suspicious, he questioned Taner \"What is it? Is there something you're hiding from us?\" Taner pulled his scarf over his mouth, \"I won't tell!\" he said, muffled by the scarf. Thea walked up and kicked him in the 'gonads' making him topple to the ground. Aranov looked at her surprised, \"Wow, that's the second time today!\", Anarov chuckled to himself. \"We don't have time for this Taner!\" Thea yelled at him. Taner's face lifted from the ground, with tears surrounding his eyes, \"S-Say sorry!\", he said with a croaky voice. \"NO!\" Aranov and Thea yelled simultaneously. Taner rose from the ground and wiped the tears from his eyes, attempting to look respectful again. \" I saw another man I was supposed to redeem from evil climb in the trunk of Anna's car and from what I heard, he had orders from someone to kill, or at least hurt Jenna. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would just kill him so I couldn't redeem him. Sorry.\" Without saying a word, Thea ran towards the direction of Trevor and Jenna, \"W-Wait!\" Aranov stumbled on his words as well as his feet as he ran after Thea, they both quickly disappeared from sight as Taner stood there, alone. \"Well, I guess I'll...</span></div></div>",

He was just identifying his fifth tree when he heard a gunshot. Not strange, he thought. Import punks roam around here. But when a bullet nearly hit him on his left arm, he sensed danger. He headed for the cabin, which was the place the bullet headed toward him, and busted in through the front door with a Desert Eagle in his hand. He saw some people in the cabin, frozen in their movements, one clutching his leg painfully, and another pointing a gun towards him.<br>\r\n\"Bennington!

Listening to the wipers swish, squish, smack the icy sludge away from the shield, Anne came to herself. Trevor could be thoughtless, but he wasn't cruel and leaving him in this weather was cruel - something Anne, though selfish, was not. She hooked her right arm about the passenger seat's headrest and looked through the back window for a second or two before really making up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily pushing the shifter into reverse, Anne backed the car around the bend in the road and then to where she'd left Trevor, but he seemed to have vanished. Leaving the engine running, Anne got out of the car. Hunkering into her coat, she looked around as best she could then started to call for him. She had wandered to the tree line on the right side of the road when she tripped over a log, or what she thought was a log. The log groaned and it took all within Anne to keep from yelping in terror. \"Trevor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was curled into a ball near one of the pine trees. He seemed to be dozing, but fitfully. Anne could not get over how strange it seemed for him to be asleep in this weather, lying on such soggy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was muttering a kind of sing-song-y poem that went something like: \"No. Go away. No. I can't stay. No. Let me alone. No. I must be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne's brow furrowed, but she couldn't determine if he was speaking to her in his strange little rhyme or if he was speaking to someone in his dream, so she grabbed his arm and pulled at it a bit to test his weight. In the sludge, it was reasonably easy to pull him, so that's what she did - Anne pulled Trevor to her car. Getting him into the car took considerably more strength, but she managed that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you,\" Anne said, having buckled him into his seat and rounded the car to get in herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still muttering, mostly nonsense about his cat being called Katty and not Kerianne, his eyes opening now and again, like he was suffering from some fairy tale enchantment or something. Anne leaned over and opened the glove box. From inside, she pulled a big stack of papers and tossed them into the back seat. Then she saw what she wanted - a bottle of caffeine pills. She had used them once or twice to get through an especially boring meeting, but she sure was glad she'd left them in her purse and then transferred them into the borrowed little hatchback. She fumbled around blindly in the back running board and finally pulled out a small travel sized bottle of water with an \"Ah-ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing twice the normal dose on the dozing fellow in her passenger seat proved a little more challenging than she'd expected, but eventually the pills had been swallowed and Anne settled back in her seat to wait for them to work. She turned the heater as far to the red as she could with hopes she'd dry out before having to see Paul later. He was going to kill her when he found out that not only had she gotten lost, she'd picked up Trevor. No, Paul wasn't going to be too happy about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor groaned but was still in his dream state. Anne put the car into drive and slowly started to make her way through the gloom and towards what she hoped was a main highway. She couldn't remember where he said he needed to go, but she hoped it would be on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I've gotta see her!\" Trevor sat up straight, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne's brow furrowed but she didn't give him more than a cursory glance. She had to focus on the road, otherwise they'd end up in a ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere important, just in my little car. Where'd ya think you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't be here. I've got to see her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless you wanna hop out of a moving vehicle, I suggest you calm down and wait until we find a decent highway.\" Anne did some of her own muttering about the state of the road way and how it was all Paul's fault that she was out so late and trying to take a \"short cut\" that had turned out to not be so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor rung his hands, ran fingers through his damp hair; his eyes darted from here to there, and his foot started to pat the floor boards. Anne wondered if she'd really done him a disservice by giving him so many caffeine pills, but it had gotten him out of whatever stupor he had been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the road ahead, she noticed a shadowy figure. A deer maybe? She slowed to an even more labored pace and squinted at the form. Trevor said again he had to see \u201cher\u201d whoever, she was and then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was running into the forest and then he was gone from sight. He really didn't want her help, but durn-it, Anne knew she couldn't just leave the boy out in this nasty weather. For a moment she considered her options... and those became less and less as she tarried. \"Awe, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne leaned over the console to grab a small handgun from the glove compartment. It'd been years since she'd felt she needed it, but tonight strange things were happening and she knew she'd feel better if she had it with her. She checked to make sure the safety was on in the dim dome light and then sticking it in the back of her waistband, she exited the car, leaving it running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran in the direction Trevor had disappeared, thinking all the while how stupid it was that she was running after someone who'd always been more an acquaintance than a friend. She stumbled a little at first as she got acclimated to the rough muddy terrain, but after a bit, she was running swiftly through the forest, scanning from side to side looking for any sign of Trevor. Her training was starting to return and her muscle memory seemed to take over. Anne paused to listen every fifty feet or so, hoping to notice danger before it found her. \"No use running into something unawares,\" her father had always said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a small rise ahead, there was a rather large sprawling oak tree. The air about it was unsettling, so Anne paused near, sheltering herself behind a tree to watch and listen. Sure enough, she heard that strange sing-song voice again. Thankfully, it wasn't calling to her, because she couldn't help but be affected by the power in it even from this distance. She peered around the rough pine tree and saw what she'd almost expected to see. A shadowy glowing figure of a woman hovered over Trevor, who had curled up in a snoozing ball amidst the large roots at the base of the old tree. It looked pretty dry under the tree from where Anne stood, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. \u201cWell, here goes nothin\u2019,\u201d she whispered to herself. She palmed the cold gun and snapped the safety off. She knew just how many shots she\u2019d have before she would be in trouble. It was enough. Specter or wood spirit or whatever that thing was had a weak spot, and Anne would find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne scoped out the trees about the large oak and then pointed the gun. She squeezed the trigger and then she was off. When she made it to the next tree, she aimed and shot another warning shot into the top of the oak. A medium sized branch snapped and fell with a horrific booming crash. Trevor was protected from the debris by the pronounced roots at the base of the tree, but the specter had vanished and Anne couldn\u2019t hear any more of her poisoned song. She wove her way around several times before approaching Trevor, but the shadowy whatever that had been was nowhere to be seen. Trevor still snored in happy slumber, but Anne couldn\u2019t be sure he was alone. She waited in the icy darkness shivering for as long as she thought she could before deciding how to get in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran. She ran into the dry undergrowth of the tree and slid to a stop beside Trevor. She slapped his cheek, pinched the back of his arm, anything she could think of to wake him, but he was out. Anne rolled her eyes. This guy had turned out to be more trouble than he was worth. She pulled at his arm, hoping she could drag him to the car, but this time, in the dry leaves under the oak tree, she couldn\u2019t manage to budge him more than a few yards before she realized there was no way she\u2019d be able to drag him all the way back to the car, almost a quarter mile away. As an afterthought, she pulled out the gun again, pointed into the ground a ways off and squeezed off a round. Then she pressed the gun barrel\u2019s tip to the back of his arm. That got the desired reaction. He was roused and was fully awake, swearing and rubbing the burn on the back of his arm. Anne just stood there, waiting for him to focus. When he did, she grabbed his hand and pulled him behind her into the forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had absolutely no idea who they were, and why they were out in such fiendish weather, but whatever their reason, it mattered absolutely nothing...starting now. By her side stood Jed, her mysterious aide. The two of them were more than a match for the woman--she had to be almost out of ammunition--and the unconscious man. \"Come on,\" she muttered, jumping off the rock and strolling casually towards the two people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJed followed, aware that Tessa was not going to pause to consider the consequences of her actions. Once again, she was merely concentrating on the instinct of hunting that her father, a bounty hunter, had taught her. She had in turn taught Jed, but Jed, coming from a more rule abiding background, practiced more caution. \"Tessa, please. Why are these people important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. They just are.\" Tessa knew to listen to her soul when it urged her to capture some seemingly random person and hold them hostage. \"Look at us. We're in the woods, lost without any way to call for help, weaponless except for our own martial training, and without any form of money.\" Her eyes coldly pointed out to Jed the truth--everything she said was only too true; there was no way that they could continue mucking around in the forest like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I concede, but he's awake, and might be a threat.\" Jed's voice was a whisper, blown away quickly by the wind, but he knew his face told the story clearly enough for Tessa. \"Where do you plan to keep them? And we've got to watch for these deceitful sprite-people that got the guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa shrugged, then walked up to the woman. \"Touche. Hand over the gun and keep your hands visible on that branch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we don't want to?\" The man demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor. Please. No more trouble.\" The woman seemed exasperated, and not too close to the man, Trevor. \"Here. My car is up on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A car? My God! Did you hear that?\" Jed was excited, as he picked up the gun, worried that if Tessa were to take it, she'd turn serial killer yet again. \"We can get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's probably blown away in this wind,\" The woman looked around warily. \"I don't like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't choose to be here either,\" Tessa purred. \"I'm Tessa Sherman. I know your companion is Trevor. You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anne.\" The one word answer clearly indicated the woman was unhappy with the situation and unwilling to say anything more. The defiant and harried attitude of Trevor indicated the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well than,\" Tessa smirked. \"Anne and Trevor. You are going to come with us up to this road and you'll lead us down it towards the nearest civilization, where we will either kill you or be treated royally with free accommodations and new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have other options?\" Trevor asked, not really wanting to be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come to our cave.\" Jed put in calmly. \"I'm Jed and Tessa didn't mean the first option. Coming to the cave as our hostages is your only option.\" Angrily, Tessa followed, as rearguard, while he led them towards the cave, gun pointed at them occasionally when he turned around and walked backwards to make sure Tessa didn't try anything dirty. She could get nasty when he forced her to be less murderous. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She glanced back at Trevor with guilt, \"sorry,\" she said apologetically, \"but you do not want to go near her.\"<br>\r\nThe other woman looked pissed and she tossed her umbrella to the wind. <br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are, getting in the way of me an my prey?\" she hissed. The blonde girl lifted her neck defiantly and said loudly, \"I'm an angel in waiting, hand picked by Michael himself.\" The silver haired woman looked worried for the briefest second before laughing, it was a beautiful sound though it was clearly made in scorn. <br>\r\n\"The angels must be desperate if their sending some little bitch with no experience in the field after me,\" she sneered.<br>\r\n\"Looks can be deceiving,\" the girl stated firmly. The golden eyed temptress glared, \"I know better than most the art of deception.\" Trevor realised that he should probably break these two crazy gals before a cat fight ensued.<br>\r\n\"Look how about we just calm down and...\" Trevor never managed to finish his sentance as the beautiful woman flicked her wrist and sent him flying. <br>\r\n\"Hey, your fights with me!\" the girl cried withdrawing a silver pistol and shooting at the woman. The woman moved with supernatural speed and the bullet completely missed. She was on top of the girl before the gunshot had even finished its echo. The two tussled whilst Trevor, who had soared a good ten feet regained his footing. He watched them fight not knowing what to do. The girl managed to kick the woman off of her and zipped open her jacket and withdrew a large, silver chain. She flicked the chain at the woman and it wrapped around her waist. The woman gave an inhuman hiss and Trevor saw her barbed tongue briefly flicker between her lips. Now Trevor was terrified but he didn't run, he decided that he should side with the lee ominous girl. The girl was looking wildly around whilst the woman struggled against the chain. Steam started to rise from where the chain was in contact with her. Trevor realised the girl was looking for her gun and he spotted it glistening in the mud. He went to grab it just as the woman freed herself from the chain with a screech. Trevor didn't hesitate and fired the gun. The woman screamed and fire began to flare around the gunshot hole Trevor had made. In seconds the woman was completely writhing in flames and it was only a few seonds before she had burned away to nothing. AThe smell of burnt flesh filled the air and Trevor dropped his gun in horror and repulsion.</span></div></div>",

She looked like a wild thing out of some comic book. Taken aback by her appearance, he didn't side step fast enough and before he knew it, she'd smacked into him and they both fell, soaked to the bone onto the muddy road. Trevor figured the snake, being a cold blooded animal, had other plans than to follow some crazy woman for very long. He didn't like snakes much, but knew how to deal with the creatures better than the red headed creature that was trying to scramble up from atop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Woman! Would ya wait a sec?\" was all he got out before her knee connected with the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry!\" the woman exclaimed. Standing near, shivering in the sleeting rain. She took a step back towards him, like she intended to help him up but he put out a hand to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know - look, what're ya doin' out here at this time of night? Don't ya know there's supposed to be a storm tonight?\" He stood then, rubbing the side of his head and taking in more of her appearance. She was muddy from head to foot and what he'd thought was a mini-skirt when she had first turned to run was a pair of rather decent length shorts, but she wore what looked like a pair of brightly colored tights like one would see in photos of fashion flops from the 80s. She'd lost one of her high heels in the grass and was not likely to fight the snake to get it back. Her makeup had been heavy before she'd gotten out into the rain. The woman's top was an oversized red button-up. Did she get dressed in the dark? Been at a party? \"Uh... you're not from here are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you couldn't'a picked a worse place for your car to stall. This here's a one horse town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get back to the city! Paul is waiting for me and if I don't get back I'm...\" Her panicked words all ran together before she stopped and looked squarely at him. \"What're you doing out in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm meeting someone at the lodge,\" Trevor said making his decision just then. He'd go back to the lodge and say what needed to be said no matter how much damage it may do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see a lodge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't've seen it. It's not exactly on the worn path. Look, I'm Trevor,\" he said, extending a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anne.\" She didn't smile. She looked wary and tense - and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anne, you can't be out here in that for much longer and keep all your fingers and toes. Let's see if we can get you going again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor moaned inwardly. He had nearly suggested she go with him to the lodge, but he didn't need any prying eyes or ears around when he got around to saying what he needed to.

He had to get to the lodge before it was too late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for your help,\" Anne said with a sense of insecurity. \"I'm sorry if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor interrupted by raising a hand.  \"Don't worry about it.  Be safe, Anne.\" He turned towards the hill and prepared himself for the inevitably miserable climb to the top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Anne shouted, with a sudden sense of urgency to her voice.  Did she really want to be out here by herself?  Trevor turned towards her, he was squinting slightly, a tenuous expression on his face.  \"Trevor, do you need a ride somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Anne, I appreciate your kindness, but you have to get off of this road,\" Trevor stated calmly as he leaned into the window, staring into Anne's beautiful blue eyes. \"And I have to stay here.\"  He leaned closer to Anne and pressed his wet lips against her forehead.  Anne reached up with her hand and gently caressed Paul's stubbled cheek.  \"Be safe,\" he whispered into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor quickly turned away, ran off the road and into the darkness.  Anne's eyes stared at the point where Trevor disappeared for several seconds before she shifted into drive and gently pressed the gas pedal.  The car's engine moaned as it labored down the isolated, muddy road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor stood silent for a moment, feeling the cold raindrops fall on his head and shoulders.  He watched as Anne's car ambled away.  She would be lucky if she made it down this hill unscathed.  He knew that when she left, but he had no time to help an attractive stranger.  He had to get to the lodge.  And it was going to be hell, in this rain and mud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor turned away from the road and looked at the hill that ascended into the darkness.  He knew the lodge was up there. He should be able to see some lights from here.  But everything above him was pitch black.  That was weird.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept staring at the hill, sizing it up, as he strode towards its base.  All he could hear was the constant pattering sound of the rain as it slapped the ground.  Trevor was in the middle of a thought of what he would do when he finally got to the lodge, when he felt a heavy thud to his back and felt strong arms wrapping around his waist and throwing him to the ground.   Trevor's face smeared through a patch of mud, some cold mud splattering onto his front teeth and under his bottom lip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor's assaulter grabbed his shoulder and whipped him around, slamming his back into the cold, wet ground.  As if Trevor wasn't uncomfortable enough before, now he had mud creeping down the back of his underwear.  The mysterious attacker straddled him, wrapping an exceedingly strong hand around Trevor's collar and pulling his torso upwards.   Trevor let out a painful yell as a large fist crashed into his face, just under his right eye.  The fist came down again, this time landing square on Trevor's bottom lip, sending hot blood down his chin.  Then his attacker froze one arm cocked back into a threatening punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was dark, unusually dark, but Trevor could make out a heavily stubbled chin, thin lips curled back, exposing slightly crooked teeth, and two eyes that bore the look of a trapped wild animal.  He had no idea who his attacker was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you,\" the man screamed, shaking Trevor as he spoke.  His voice carried the unmistakable trademark of panic.  \"Who the hell are you?  Tell me!  Tell me now!  The stranger kept violently shaking Trevor.  This guy was out his mind.  There was nothing Trevor could say to calm him down.  Nothing he could say, could make this better.  But he had to try something.  He may not have time for a fight.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whoever this man was, he was large and had the upper hand.  Maybe this guy was psychotic, maybe nothing Trevor said would make a difference.  But two things were for certain: He couldn't afford to be beaten to a pulp, and he couldn't afford to waste any time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trevor,\" he shouted trying to remain calm.  Trying to think on his feet. \"Trevor, that's all I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell does that mean,\" the stranger shouted in a paranoid voice.  His fist tightening around Trevor's collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I don't know.\" Trevor voive started to show his anger and confusion. \"I woke up this morning in the lodge at the top of this hill.  I have no idea how I got there.  And it sounds to me that you may be in the same situation.  There's someone in that lodge that may know what the hell is going on here, and if I can't get to her, then we're all screwed.\"  Trevor squirmed a bit, his backside was soaked now.  He could feel cold chunks of mud sliding down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you're a good guy, huh?  You expect me to believe that?\" The stranger seemed to be calming down a bit, although his hand was still pulled back, ready to pummel Trevor's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I am.  Good, bad, or in between.  And I don't care.  I just have to get to that lodge.  Now are you going to come with me and try to make a difference or just beat me into the dirt,\" Trevor was losing patience.  Time was running out.  \"We have to get up there before sunset.  It will be a hell of a lot easier with a tough guy like you helping me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul dropped his fist and let go of Trevor's collar.  He felt like crying.  He was in pain, tired, and confused.  He also had no idea who the hell he was.  He nothing other than his first name.  He had no idea who Trevor was.  He had no idea where the lodge was.  But what else could he possibly lose.  Sure, it was possible that Trevor could be lying to try to catch him off his guard.  But the risk of that, of anything, had to be better  than wandering around these woods like some crazed mad man, attacking strangers just to get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul stood up and extended a hand to help Trevor up.  Trevor took Paul's hand and struggled to stand up.  Trevor tried to brush some of the mud caked all over his body.  He wiped some of the mud smeared on his face and spit the mud from his mouth.  He gave Paul a weary look and attempted a smile.  He extended a hand towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a formal introduction,\" Trevor said with a hint of humor to his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Paul.  Sorry about the knocks to the face.\" Paul detected a smile making its way to his lips.  This was the first time since this morning he could remember feeling anything but scared, angry, and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Trevor pointed to the hill that stood about ten yards away.  \"We gotta climb that to get to the lodge.  I hope you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's smile faded.  He was on the verge of complete exhaustion.  Now he had to climb that muddy hill into what looked like complete darkness.  Great, maybe he should have just beat Trevor into the dirt afterall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trevor wiped some blood from his chin already soaked and soiled sleeve.  He was staring towards the base of the hill, with his back to Paul.  The surprise beating he took from Paul turned out to be a bit of a blessing. Making it up this hill and sorting through whatever chaos awaited him when he made it to the top would have been a daunting task by himself.  Paul seemed a bit of a loose cannon.  But Paul was desperate and determined, which could be useful on a night like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain was pounding down in the thick streams now.  The ground below Trevor's feet was starting to flood, causing thick streams of mud hurrying towards lower ground.  Which meant the earth would be much softer.  Which meant climbing this hill would be a true test of will.  Trevor looked up the hill, into the dark night sky.  Raindrops fell heavily on his face, washing it clean.  He could only see about twenty yards up the hill's steep grassy surface.  Several large rocks jutted out of the hill, forming a disordered makeshift staircase.  Following the rock path would be the easiest way up the hill, even though it would take longer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked over his shoulder to ready his new companion for the difficult climb.  When he looked back, he saw nothing but darkness.  He faced the hill again to see Paul's large silhouette lumbering towards the base of the hill.  Apparently, Paul was impatient along with being desperate and determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor ran to catch up with Paul.  He got to the base of the hill just as Paul reached up to grab a large tuft of grass with both hands.  Paul grunted as he pulled hard on the grass, attempting to heave himself up the hill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Paul,\" Trevor shouted.  Just then the tuft of grass in Paul's hands lost its grip in the ground and pulled free under the pressure of Paul's weight.  Gravity took over and Paul fell backwards with a thud and a splash into a muddy stream at the base of the hill.  Paul angrily pounded the muddy ground with a large fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ground's too wet to use the grass as a hold.  We have to follow these rocks as far up as they go.  Otherwise we'll just fall on our butts all night,\" Trevor said, extending a hand to help Paul up.  Paul looked up with a hint of a smirk on his stubbly face.  He grabbed Trevor's hand and struggled to his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should have waited for you,\" Paul said, his lips widening into a sardonic smile.  \"You first chief.\" Paul gestured his hands grandiosely towards the hill, as if he were a butler escorting a guest to a grand feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, follow me as best you can.  Stay close and try to keep your feet on the rocks.  If we lose each other, just make it up to the top.\" Trevor carefully stepped onto a large rock about a foot up from the hill's base, placing his hands on the hill's surface to steady himself.  He located a second rock and gingerly lifted his feet, one at a time, to stand on the next rock.  And he began slowly making his way up the hill in this fashion, carefully finding footholds in the rocks and pushing up the hill with his legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul stood at the base, watching Trevor climb up the hill.  When Trevor was about ten feet up, Paul followed suit, trying to place his feet and hands in the same places Trevor did.  He kept his eyes on Trevor, doing his best to follow the same path and keep close to him.  Unfortunately, Trevor seemed to be advancing up the hill much faster.  Within a few minutes, Trevor was at least thirty feet ahead of him and not slowing down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's muscles were sore, his lungs heavy with exhaustion.  Puffs of steam escaped his mouth as he panted heavily, exerting increasing  effort to maintain steady footing and maneuver up the steep hill.  He tried to call out to Trevor, to tell him to slow down.  But the words came out only as a weak, hoarse whisper.  He had no choice, but to keep up at his own pace.  Trevor would wait for him at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul looked up, searching the hillside for Trevor, but saw nothing except a dark, empty hill.  He reached up with a shaking left hand, grasping a small rock.  Paul pulled hard on the rock, attempting to heave himself up to another, flat stepping stone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the rock gripped in Paul's left hand seemed to give, tearing loose from the soft soil it was partially buried in.  The rock fell freely down the hill, tumbling and clacking against other rocks on its way down to the base.  Paul's balance shifted sharply backwards.  His left arm, without a hold began flailing wildly around in the cold air.  His right hand instinctively gripped a wad of grass in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paul's weight pulled backwards, the grass gave way, its roots pulling free from the earth.  Paul's eyes widened as his body gave in to gravity and he fell down the hill.  He let out a raspy whisper-scream as his back thudded against the rock that was formerly his foothold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's body slammed forcefully and repeatedly against the rocky surface of the hill.  He rolled down, sheltering his face and head with his arms, his elbows and forearms slamming into hard earth.  Sharp pain exploded in his back as several ribs snapped under the force of gravity and momentum.  His legs flew around wildly screaming in pain as they collided with rocks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's momentum slowed to a slide as he hit the soft mud near the base of the hill.  His body went limp as it slid down the last bit of the muddy embankment.  With gravity's final tug, Paul's body flipped over to his back in the cold mud.  He lay at an awkward angle, his feet aiming diagonally up the hill, his head lying in a puddle at the base.  Paul's arms were pointing straight out from his body, making him look like some beat up and disregarded scarecrow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul opened his eyes weakly.  His whole body was shaking in pain.  Warm blood secreted from abrasions and lacerations on his arms, legs, and torso.  A hot pain vibrated through his chest and stomach.  His lungs felt like stones.  It seemed like all the air had been forced from his body.  It felt as if at least two ribs were broken.  He had no voice.  His mind was overwhelmed with pain.  Paul stared silently at the sky as a constant stream of rain poured down to the ground.  He couldn't move, he couldn't think.  Soon he would be dead.  And all he could do was lay in pain and stare at the sky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two were running at him like dogs howling for some beef. It almost scared him. He stood his ground, and asked the two of them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you two following me?\"<br>\r\n\"I.. I... I wondered if you could help me..\" The awestruck young woman asked; she was a little shook up, seeing the other man just standing there. Who was he? Did they know each other? Why did this tall dark stranger run off so fast? <br>\r\n\"And you? What's your story?\" Sinclair motioned to the short stranger.<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nHere it was, this was my chance to make the perfect impression. And this time I could actually help him save ... uh ... oh god what was her name again? Oh well, doesn't matter. What does matter is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Zid, and ... I'm a time traveler..\" Hmm... I wonder if that came off a bit... well, a bit strange, seeing as how he's looking at me that way.<br>\r\n\"..What?\" Was the growl I got out of him. She, the woman, Anne wasn't it? She just chuckled a bit. I don't get why they have to laugh all the time at the truth. What am I saying something funny?<br>\r\n\"Ok, I don't think I have time for all of this...\" Sinclair began saying when a loud noise in the distance was heard. Or I should say, we heard a loud noise. (This tense thing always gets me messed up, I never know which way to write in. One time I even wrote an entry log in the future tense. The things it does to your head) Oh yeah, back to the story, I almost forgot about that, well, let's see...</span></div></div>",

There, far off in the distance, was a woman's scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellen!\" Sinclair yelled, forgetting the people with him, and tore off into the night, his eyes glazed with determination and fear. Fear for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Sinclair!\" Anne called in the fading darkness, but the man ignored her, and fought harder to reach Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to make it in time Sin! I've already seen the future! She's dead!\" Sinclair lashed out at a branch in his path, taking out his fury for the man who had the nerve to shout that out. If his sister wasn't in trouble, he would have probably gone back and hit that guy in the face. What the hell was wrong with that guy? He makes stupid jokes about how he's a time traveler, and now he's still making them, but instead meant to hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the man still ran -- ran as fast as he had ever ran before. It was a long distance. At one time Sin tripped over a tree root and skidded across the rough forest floor, scraping his arms and face. But still, he leapt back up and carried on, not even bothering to check his injuries. All that mattered in his mind was Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSin was reaching the clearing where his sister's lodge was when it happened. He was blinded by the urge to find the woman that he didn't check the forest surrounding him. There, behind a large oak, lay a man in waiting. And as Sin ran passed, he jumped out and tackled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aargh!\" Sinclair yelled as an enormous weight came crashing on him. They both tumbled to the ground and rolled, Sin punching and kicking in an attempt to throw of his attacker. The other man dodged them all, but didn't fight back. The only thing he did was grip his shoulders to restrain him, then his wrists. The lay there for a moment, panting. They glared at each other threateningly, and Sin opened his mouth to speak, but other man beat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay away from Ellen, okay?\" he growled, his eyes blazing. \"And tell who ever you work for to get the hell away from here, or he'll pay. Got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSin blinked. \"Stay away from Ellen? You better get off me now, or you'll be the one to pay. Ellen's my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired man looked confused for a moment, then he said gruffly, \"Ellen doesn't have a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do you know? Who the hell are you?\" He glared, not trusting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trevor, Ellen's boyfriend. And I'm hear to save her.\"</span></div></div>",

It was cold out here, and blinding flashes of lightning tore at the sky. A prong of lightning hit somewhere near. Gage could tell because the thunder--a deafening explosion--followed only seconds later. The light gave off his position. He swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see something?\" Sinclair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was afraid. \"What if it's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh.\" Sinclair walked forward, ready for anything, it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGage had just wanted to take a walk to clear his mind. Why oh why did he always have to get himself into trouble? \"I'm here.\" He said, not waiting for Sinclair to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man named Sinclair stopped, but was by no means calm. \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGage stepped out of the darkness. Sinclair relaxed when he saw him, seeing, Gage was sure, a slim, brown-haired, dark skinned guy in his twenties. Harmless. Average. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless, of course, one were to see the multitude of scars on his back where someone had shot him. Gage had been climbing up a rickety brick building at the time, and had fallen about twenty feet to the ground. He was not so innocent as he first seemed, but he'd never hurt anyone, and he hoped Sinclair saw that. Ellen was sizing him up, and she liked what she saw, apparently, since she extended her hand to shake. \"Ellen. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gage. There's an easier way to get where you want to go, you know. I can take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinclair looked suspicious. Ellen thought a while, and nodded. \"Anything will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Gage led them. Finally, he got them near the back of the little cottage. \"That window leads into a bathroom. The light's broken out. No one will hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't plan on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you help us? you seem to know your way around.\" Seeing the uncertainty in his eyes, Ellen hurried to say, \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGage finally nodded. <i>Sucker!</i> He thought derisively. <i>Gage, my friend, you are a sucker for a pretty lady.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped agilely into the window, opening and closing it silently as he stepped inside. If there was one gift nature had blessed him with, it was movement. The other two followed. A sound, a crack outside of the bathroom door startled them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGage flattened himself against the wall.</span></div></div>",

His eyes met the two gun barrels and he stopped in his tracks. <i>Caught off-guard, dammit!

So what's your reason?\"<br>\r\nGage remained calm, seeing right through Ford's threatening charade.<br>\r\n\"We're looking for someone.\"<br>\r\nFord put the gun down by his side. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty sure I'm the only one here.  You want in? Go ahead, but don't disturb me.\" He peered around the corner of the doorway, noticing the still faces of Ellen and Sinclair.<br>\r\nThey all exchanged gazes, before Ford turned around and headed into one of the bedrooms. Just before he'd fully closed the door, he spoke<br>\r\n\"I' gotta get some sleep. This is just crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three trespassers continued to search the rest of the lodge, but to no avail. <br>\r\n\"There's nothing here.\" said Gage.<br>\r\nEllen looked bewildered.<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, Sinclair spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Ellen, are you sure this is where he is?\"<br>\r\n\"I was sure of it...I can't think of anywhere more likely.

Before, they were annoyed, and now, they just seemed grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad.\"  She finally finished.  \"I guess I should introduce myself, my name's Kara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Anne.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rain pelted the roof of the car as the young woman stared in astonishment in front of her, her eyes wide with fear. She sat there, shaking, as she tried to make sense of what had just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man had appeared from the forest as she'd fought to get her broken down car running again and, spotting him, asked him if he was okay and if he needed a ride.... That's when it happened. He disappeared. Literally. Anne had seen every terrifying detail. He was standing in front of her car, her head lights shining brightly, as clear as day. She flicked them off for a moment, and then.... nothing. When she switched them back on a heartbeat later, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience shocked Anne beyond belief. All her life she had been skeptical, and when that suddenly changed and she'd, for the first time, been faced with a thing she has no way for explaining, she no longer felt safe. It was unnatural, and all of her previous beliefs and thoughts were screaming at her that it couldn't be true -- it mustn't be true. There were no such things as ghosts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to get out of here,' she thought. Her mind was reeling and her blood running cold, and as she tried to fidget out of the driver's seat, realized that her hands were shaking, and that her legs were weak with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed for the door handle, but stopped. 'No,' she thought. 'I can't go out there. It's not safe.' Anne sat there, shaking as she tried to figure out a plan, but her frightened mind couldn't conjore up anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaky brown haired woman, who was soaked by the rain and was pressed up against her seat, began to cry silently. She was lost, utterly lost, in the middle of the forest in a storm with nothing but her rapidly colding car, and possibly supernatural threats lurking in the shadows. She thought of every horror movie, every paranormal investigation she'd ever watched or read about, and her heart began to pound painfully and her eyes start to dart. Her senses were on high alert, and every little noise seemed to be magnified. Every little sound the dying car made would make her jump, and each little movement from the dark woods would make her whimper in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, when all was quiet once more, Anne let out a scream. A shadow darted across the road in front of her, quick but slow enough to send an icy wave of fear up her spine as she realized that it wasn't a trick of light or a movement made by the wind. It was in the form of a person, and darted across through the night, nothing more than a black shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears now streamed down her face as she clung to her seat, her hands gripping the sides till thay paled with blood-loss and shook terribly with the effort. \"This cannot be happening, this can not be -- \" she let out another shriek, but this time a powerful lungful that raised to a high pitched horror-movie scream. Through the reflection of her rear view mirror, was a man. And he was sitting in her back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he was gone, as soon as the girl caught sight of him, but that didn't stop her from catching hold of the handle and pushing the door open, the cold night air spilling in. Adrenaline pulsed through her veins and she was no longer shaking. She was blinded by the instinct for survival. The woman half leapt, half fell out of her car, and bolted away, to the side of the road. There she stopped, unsure of where to go. She glanced back to see if anything was pursuing her, and as she did, her eyes widened to almost impossible size and she stumbled backwards, tripping and hitting the ground hard. Her mouth opened in yet another pleading cry....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no noise came out. Along with the terrible fear came a calming sensation. Anne knew that the growing sense of awe and ease wasn't created by her. It came like a great force, like the pound of an ocean wave against rocks. She stared up ahead of her as many more shadows materialized from the trees and amongst them, strolled a figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anne, I have been waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker was the most beautiful woman Anne had ever seen. Her voice rang through the night as smooth and gentle as a sigh yet as powerful as a howling wind. Her long platinum hair whispered around her frame as her pale face lifted into a gentle smile. The shadows crowded around her, and as Anne looked closely, could see more clearly the details of them. She could just make out the form of people \u2013 men and woman and children, both old and young. Their faces were dark and menacing, and Anne quickly looked away, seeking out the lady\u2019s reassuring gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you?\u201d Anne asked, swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady ignored that. \u201cIf you wish to save the girl, you must follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne blinked. \u201cSa- Save the girl? What do you mean \u2013 ?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious woman\u2019s eyes gravened. \u201cThere is no time. You must come with me.\u201d And without another word, she turned away and disappeared into the darkened forest, the shadows de-materializing from the road as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne stared back wordlessly. A powerful current of icy rain pelted her side, and she glanced around. She was utterly alone now, and the storm was worsening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts and emotions were a mess as she shakily tried to stand. She did not know what to do\u2026 what to think. All she felt was confusion and foreboding, along with uncertainty. She still didn\u2019t know where the heck she was. And what was this about a girl in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne didn\u2019t know what to do, but as a sudden flash of lightening forked from the sky, and thunder clapped in the dark heavens above, she knew that she had to do something.</span></div></div>",

Rick Walters were from Delta team, they were all that was left of the 12 teams sent in to the compound of a cult to extract hostages.

Sanderson swung his P90 around and shot the Demon, killing it, Anderson was still amazed to see the creatures turn to ash once killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat still amazed him was that they were not in the compund anymore, the book had reacted to something when they started to close the portel and they had goten sucked in and droped in this field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSgt. Anderson was yanked out of his thoughts by Pvt. Walters' voice. \"BEHIND YOU SIR!\" he yelled rasing his Combat shotgun and aiming high, the shot was nearly ear spliting even in the wind as James spun around and saw the Demon fall to the ground turning to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work privat.\"He said taking aim with his CAR15 at another coming up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n he could hear the loud clater of PFC.

Time to go.<br>\r\nI had come here for HER, the woman sat cross-legged at the side of the road, her skin pale and her gauzy white dress soaked. Or it should have been, but instead it was dry as a bone, same as her black curls. She smiled at me as she gazed up, her eyes maddened and fangs glistening.<br>\r\n\"Mariasha,\" I said as a statement. She giggled in mirth.<br>\r\n\"You've come to feed me boy? But of course they never do!\" she cackled, her voice harsh on the ears. I took a step back, from wisdom more than fear.<br>\r\n\"You broke our treaty. The vamps are becoming feral, only you can do such a thing,\" I said, watching her closely. She could spring at me any second. In fact, I counted on it.<br>\r\n\"Ah, hunter. The unclean one comes to bargain. Not this time young one, I tire of order, the night screams for chaos and so I give. The wolves bay for blood so do not deign to lecture me,\" she glanced up at me, her eyes hostile and lips drawn back. <br>\r\n\"Apologies Mariasha, no insult was intended. I mean no harm to you or your kin,\" I reply, smiling and attempting to placate the old hag. I was merely waiting for the moment.<br>\r\n\"Foolish Tre Connor, did you forget of the moon? My teeth shall rip you to shreds, you of dead blood will scream for mercy and none will be had!\"<br>\r\nShe roared, as inhuman and frenzied as ever I had heard. Yet, her body was spasming, hair shooting up and muzzle elongating. I'd have to be quick, but that was no problem for me. Unsheathing the hidden sword on my back, I slashed at her neck, sawing through the skin and tendons until I gripped it in hand. Taking a lighter from my pocket, I burnt both the head and the half mutated body. I had just declared a war that I could never win.<br>\r\nMy brother would kill me.</span></div></div>",

The way they interact with each other tells the reader much about them and helps them to develop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interactive game for anyone interested in working on developing a character, either one already in development or just a thought you want to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please follow the following guidelines:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Add one or more of your characters to the story. Write from the POV of your own character(s), using the characters and situations from previous chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- If you have questions about POV, you can check out this brief article: \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/922888-Whos-in-Charge-Here-Anyway\" title=\"On POV in fiction\" target=\"_top\">Who's in Charge Here, Anyway?</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"On POV in fiction\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/922888-Whos-in-Charge-Here-Anyway\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Make sure to list your character's name as part of the chapter title.
