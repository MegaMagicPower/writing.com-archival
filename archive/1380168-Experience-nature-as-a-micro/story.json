You are sure of the fact that it probably considers you as its next meal so you desperately try to elude the incoming predator and run away.<br>\r\nYou know that it would take a miracle to save you now but everything makes more sense than just standing still.<br>\r\nNo miracle happens... running away does not help you and the fox quickly catches you and takes you into its maw. You see the sharp teeth around you and feel the fox's tongue moving over your body. Of course, the fox did never have the chance to taste a human before so it takes some time to analyze your flavour. Coming to the decision that something that delicious would make an excellent meal, the fox finally finishes the act and ends your struggles by swallowing you whole. Feeling you sliding down its throat, it licks its lips pleasurably and walks away.<br>\r\nYou're still awake inside the fox's stomach and squirm around, knowing that there is no escape from this hot, moist prison. Due to the fact that there's not much oxygen surrounding you, you lose consciousness after some minutes.<br>\r\nYour body is slowly worked through the fox's intestines and finally, at the end of the day, the fox has completely digested you and made good use of your body.<br>\r\nBad luck indeed but after all, you did something good by providing this beautiful animal with valuable nutrients.</span></div></div>",

It does not help you at all. The falcon tips its head back a couple of times to bring you entirely into its beak and then, with a quick gulp, it swallows you whole and alive.<br>\r\nYou quickly slide down its throat and land in its stomach where you keep on struggeling, not willing to accept your fate. Your screams are heard through the birds feathers but of course there is no one to hear them but the falcon itself.<br>\r\nYou are completely exhausted, your head is spinning and after some time, you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe falcon meanwhile has left the tower again and flies back to the forest.

The immense muzzle presses right against you and a flow of cool air almost sucks you into one of its nostrils as it attempts to identify what you are. Next a gust of warm breath washes over you as the equine satisfactorily stamps you as human. Still, what confuses it is your size. The humans it is used to were much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand you touch the great muzzle of the beast and stroke it. The horse responds by slightly pushing you with its leathery lips. Then it parts its jaws and attempts to give your arm a small nibble, but at your size it feels as if your arm was bitten off. You try to slap the horse back, but to it your hit resembles nothing more than when a fly lands on its body. Quite contrastingly, it thinks you want to play and further pushes you around with its lips. You decide it best to play along since having a friend, human or not is never a bad idea in difficult times. This horse-play continues until finally, the equine slips out its tongue and gives your entire body a wet lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a silent pause; you shocked at suddenly being covered in horse drool and it surprised at your taste. The horse had always liked the taste of human. With the little hair the creatures possessed, it was easy  to taste the salty flavour upon their skin. But even then, it was pretty much only arms the horse ever got to taste. This tiny human was - tiny. All the things the horse could do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are met by another much more passionate lick. A third one topples you over, but the tongue grants you no respite and continues to smother your body only to retract back into the maw to gather another batch of warm saliva. The horse does nothing to hide its pleasure and obviously does not doubt whether you are enjoying it which, despite it being utterly disgusting, you had to admit you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly,  the horse stops its full massage and parts its jaws to show off the inside of its mouth. The request is obvious. It wants you to climb in. At this point you believe it safest to just walk away. But the treatment the horse was providing you was quite nice.

With difficulty you clamber out of the trough which you find to be attached to the stall wall. Below is a steep fall, but the stable bedding has piled enough to secure a relatively soft landing. Alternatively, the wall which separated the next stall is sufficiently low to attempt a climb from the trough.

For some reason, you choose to sneak a glance between the legs, confirming that this beast is a female.

You're pushed back by the muscle, and fall over onto your behind, looking up with some fear at the enormous furred beast. She returns your gaze, pondering your taste. Suddenly, she leans in and sticks her tongue out again. The tongue pushes into you, forcing you to lie back on the ground, and slowly runs over you. You're coated in slobber, and splutter as some of it gets in your mouth.

As you look up, you see that the hippo's city-sized mouth was coming down in your direction. Being 1/4 of an inch tall, just one of those canine teeth was a monument to you. Then you remember something and gasp. You're in a forest of blades of grass that were <i>much</i> bigger than you. Hippos eat blades of grass. The hippopotamus was grazing... and you were caught up in her meal. You scream as the jaws come down and run through the jungle of tree-sized blades of grass as one by one a handful of this jungle is scooped up into the mouth of the giant and swallowed into the black hole leading to the hippo's stomach. You even see some roots that get slurped up. That hippo was hungry and she was sucking up everything she could into her titanically obese belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it looked like you were in the clear, you trip on a pebble and yell. You grunt and roll across the dirt and land in some tree-sized blades of grass. You try to get up but your foot is caught in a root. You grunt and try to pull yourself free but at this point it's too late as the hippo lowers her jaws to eat the next mouthful of grass. You scream as the jaws snap up the grass and you're sucked into the hippo's mouth. You look around and scream in panic a few times as you see the mouth closing. You try to run and reach it but keep tripping on blades of grass covered in hippo drool. \"This can't be!\" you thought to yourself. \"It can't end like this! First I get shrunk to 1/4 of an inch, find out I'm in Africa and now I'm being eaten by a female hippopotamus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell and scream as you slip on a root and land face first on the hippo's tongue. The hippopotamus titaness then grunts. She pauses chewing and moves her tongue around. You hold on tight and scream as the hippo presses you against her gums. You climb up as her teeth close, not wanting to be crushed into paste. Then, you feel the tongue moving forward and see a light appearing. YES! The hippo is opening her mouth. Maybe you can get out of here.\" The hippo indeed sticks her tongue out and you see the light and the plains and then turn around and... wait, why is the hippo staring her beady eyes down onto you? The hippo stares at you standing atop a mountain of chewed up and saliva covered grass and you look in fear as she grunts a few times and then suddenly, SLURP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see the hippo has sucked you back into her mouth. \"Huh!? Wait! No! You're supposed to spit me out!\" You then yell because you feel the mouth shifting and the tongue becoming a slope as you start to slide down. You desperately try to cling on. That's when it hit you. The hippo only opened her mouth to get a good look at you. She <i>enjoyed</i> your taste and wanted to know what she was eating so she could look for more. Upon that horrid realization, you scream and try to climb the tongue but slip on some grass and can only yell as you plummet down to the hippo's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hippo gulps, a tiny bulge no bigger than a grain of rice appears traveling down her neck. That bulge is you and you scream as you tumble and land with a splash in the hippo's stomach. Once you've reached your destination, the hippopotamus lets out a loud and satisfied burp that shakes her stomach up and then lets out an even louder and more satisfied fart that forces you to cover your ears to avoid going deaf. Then it hits you. You were trapped in the stomach of a giant hippopotamus. Outside, the hippo grunts happily and licks her lips. She didn't know exactly what creature she swallowed but she would be sure that if she saw a tiny creature like you ever again, it was going in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you...</span></div></div>",

Hope it won't be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe content is simple: The main character (you) has somehow shrunken and is now lost somewhere in our world where he might end up as food for several wild animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Animals only. No other humans, anthros,  fantasy creatures or whatever.<br>\r\n  I don't dislike those but they don't belong in this story which takes place in<br>\r\n  OUR world ^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- ONLY soft vore and no other violent, cruel or naughty things <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The protagonist in this story shrinks right in the beginning where his size is defined.<br>\r\n  Dont let him change his size somewhere in the middle of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Don't write too short chapters. Everybody loves some details and reading a<br>\r\n  story with only short and senseless parts is no fun at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There should not be any chapters where you reach the end of story as the only<br>\r\n  possibility. Always offer an alternative way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please watch your grammer. It does not have to be perfect at all but well... you    <br>\r\n  should know the basics :P</td>",
