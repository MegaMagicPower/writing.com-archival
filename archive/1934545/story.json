But it feels like you've been trapped for years. This prison was a living nightmare. For one, it was full of monsters that were all titanic, all of them were at least 300 feet tall and were all women. You couldn't stand monsters and this prison was unfair towards humans because eating humans wasn't considered a crime. Most humans that came here were either eaten by fellow inmates or by the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember how you got into this awful mess. A mummy giantess, harmless to humans was hired to play the monster in a kaiju film being shot in your town and she had accidentally stepped on your car. You had a reputation in your town for getting into scraps with your neighbors for even the most minor things and couldn't take the monster mummy's accidental damage to your car laying down, tracked her down and set her skirt on fire. You remember her screaming as she was forced to take off her clothes and bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the giantess mummy pressed charges and you were sent to a prison near her home town of Fearfield. Under Gloom was nearly escape proof but that didn't mean you weren't going to try. At this moment, it was early in the morning, around three o'clock and your cell mate was still asleep. Lockette was a Loch Ness monster girl who unlike you was willing to serve her time. But you could not take another day in this nightmare room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the same cell as Lockette because most other monsters would've eaten you. Most monsters in Under Gloom preyed on humans. As such, the bars on the cell were designed to be so small that no human could get out. Not that it was necessary considering the bloodthirsty guards, but warden Destiny, that gargoyle hag, she didn't like taking chances, especially since you have tried to escape so many times, she hates you the most of any inmate in this prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the overgrown lawn ornament didn't know was that you had managed to wear away one of the bars on your cell from the back with one of Lockette's shed scales and were able to break it. \"I told that hag I was going to get out of here.\" As you break down the bar, you realize you need a plan. You had to escape somehow. You needed a destination </span></div></div>",

Although you hate monsters, these ones might be of some use. \"Now which one of these giant freaks can I trick into helping me escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four monsters down this hall that looked interesting. First was Ariel the gremlin. She was arrested for stripping machines of their parts and was always tinkering with whatever she could find in the prison in order to escape. At 300ft tall she was one of the shortest monsters in Under Gloom but she was very smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was Bebe, a cheshire cat girl who was in for jewel theft. She used to have a small hourglass figure, but she's been working out a lot and had a figure that put a heavyweight wrestler's to shame, but still looked female. Bebe was fond of humans and found you attractive, but you thought the idea of a human monster couple was disgusting. But you could probably coerce her into breaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Priscilla, an orc sorceress who was arrested for impersonating a doctor. She was stilled in potions and elixirs but you didn't know where she'd get the material. But perhaps one of her spells could help you escape. They certainly didn't seem to be doing her much good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was Darcy the boggart, a green ghost that looked like she was made of gas with plants growing on her back. She did nothing but sit and zone out into space. You didn't even know what she was in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one monster you didn't want to see you. Cornelia the argus, a silver skinned giantess with eyes all over her body. That girl was a squealer who reported any would be escapees to Destiny and you were the only one to know it. Last time you tried to escape by going down the trash chute and Cornelia ratted you out for a freakin' pizza. Destiny put you on tray cleaning duty for one month straight and it was all that hundred eyed snitch's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find an inmate to help you but you had to do it without Cornelia seeing you.

Wade. How did you managed to get in here?\" Ariel asked nicely just as she comes to you. \"So, no luck escaping ha?\" you replied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guess crime doesn't pay out, but I shall be out of prison one day.\" the Germlin yells out with all of her determination to get out as fast as possible, and then she then tests her new invention to pick the lock of the door, but somehow the door is tight, and Ariel's invention broke. \"CRAP!!!!!!!\" Ariel yells in furstration. \"Maybe you can help me escape and I can help you in return?\" you asked her, and then for some crazy reason, she starts to laugh outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I am going to trust a human like you to escape?\" Ariel mocked for a second and you are scared for a moment as you have no idea what she would do to you.</span></div></div>",

She was sitting on the ground doing push-ups, her toned body rippling with each movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bebe!\" You whispered, but you doubted she heard you, the cheshire girl was in the zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bebe!\" You repeated, a little louder this time. Still, no reply from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEBE!!!\" This time you shouted, and her cat ears perked up.

That garbage chute over there is my ticket out of this horrible place.\" Bebe considers this and then wags her tail. \"But if I throw you down there I might not ever see you again, and you lasted a lot longer than all my other human friends in here. I don't want you to leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe presses you tight against her abs and you let out a grunt. This pussycat was too attached to you, like a cat that wouldn't go away. But you knew exactly what to say to get the cheshire cat giantess to go along with it. \"Don't worry Bebe,\" I said. \"Once the guards realize I've escaped, they'll be looking elsewhere, I'll sneak into leather lips' office and steal the key to get that collar off of you.\" Bebe tugged on the collar Destiny fitted on her, the one that prevented her from turning invisible like the rest of her species. Even with her enhanced strength she couldn't break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lets out a purr and rubs you against her cheek much to your disgust. \"Good luck,\" she says. \"I'll try my best.\" Bebe steps out and reached her hand out in between the bars of her cell and swings it around with you in her hand. You have to crouch down to avoid getting dizzy but you give a smug smile. You managed to trick that dumb muscle cat girl into helping you.

The smell of garbage began to be replaced with the smell of decay and something very, very old. It seemed to get darker, and the temperature took a significant drop, making you shiver.

You rolled out of it until you hit solid ground, the feeling of rock underneath your boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where am I?\" You ask yourself, your voice echoing all around. This place was new. Was it part of Under Gloom? It appeared to be a cave, massive in scope and size, the occasional sound of water dripping somewhere and the echo of your footsteps the only noise. Great, just great. You had somehow ended up even deeper underground! How would you ever get out now? You couldn't climb back up the chute, it was too slippery to even get a foothold. You guessed you would have to explore this cave for an exit. It has to lead somewhere, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking, each step taking you deeper and deeper into the seemingly bottomless pit, and you couldn't quite shake the feeling that you were being watched. The air was filled with a creeping terror, one that made your skin crawl and gave you a feeling that you were not safe, not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you ran into something. It was ridiculously huge, a giant wall that somewhat felt like skin, scales, and fur at the same time. At your touch, the wall moved, and you jumped back. It wasn't a wall, it was a massive fingertip, one that dwarfed even the tallest monster in Under Gloom. What had you stumbled upon?!</span></div></div>",

Dinner?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasped your ears in pain, reeling from the powerful feminine voice as it shook the cavern about you. Your ears still ringing, you slowly looked up the gargantuan fingertip and followed it to its source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDisrespectful insects. Do they really expect to fill me up on something so puny? I can barely see it.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears rang once again, but you continued to look up, wishing you hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting cross-legged before you was a\u2026. well giant didn\u2019t do respect. What term could apply to something that dwarfed Destiny herself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, and up, and up. The titan (no that still didn\u2019t do justice) had goat legs and hands covered in fur that spanned what must have been several football fields.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat is it anyway? Some kind of tick? Too small to be an insect. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip your ears yet again. Turn it down you colossal bitch, you scream in your head. However, you dare not say it out loud as you are awestruck by the face leaning down over you and filling your entire field of view and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower half of the colossus is doubtless goat. But the face is almost human. And stunning! A pale face with serene sapphire eyes that seemed to sparkle as they squinted at you. Her hair was long, messy and unkempt, like yours. However, her hair, like her eyes was blue in color. It was probably the most beautiful face you\u2019ve ever seen and had you seen her in a bar at your own size, you would be all over her in a heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn\u2019t your size. She wasn\u2019t human. And this wasn\u2019t a bar. You were miles under the most awful prison known to monsters and human alike, trapped with the single largest monster you had ever seen. Her fingernails and pupils dwarfed any monster in the prison. And if she could stand in the cavern, instead of forced to sit, she may very well be larger than Under Gloom itself. And from what you could make of her dialogue, she was expecting dinner. Which at the moment, meant you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat a strange little thing. It appears to walk on two legs like a monster, but it\u2019s much too small for that.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty beast sighed and reared back up to her cross-legged position. You could no longer see her face, hidden by the swell of her breasts under her ripped robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, beggars can\u2019t be choosers, I suppose. Even a demigoddess. Come here little morsel.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground under you shook as her vast hand literally went under the tiny portion of rock upon which you stood and rose into the sky with you in the center of her palm. You fell to the ground and were pressed down against her flesh from the speed at which you were being lifted. You gritted your teeth, and shut your eyes, trying not to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally stopped, you opened your eyes and found yourself staring into her eye, looking down on you cowering in her palm. The look in that eye appeared almost pitiful. She had you totally in her power and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBefore you become part of me little insect, I would know one thing.\u201d</b> At least she was whispering now, though that still hurt his lobes a little. <b>\u201cWhat are you? In all my time here, I have never received a meal so unfilling.\u201d<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThe hand lowered down in front of her cavernous mouth. To your horror, her teeth were pointed and sharp fangs, reminding you that for her beauty, she was not human. A massive tongue licked her lips, anticipating your insertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Shit. Shit. What could you do? You had no possible means to fight back. Hiding from Cree was bad enough, but you couldn\u2019t hide from this giant lady. All you could do was talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m Wade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at your size, your voice echoed throughout the cavern, allowing her to hear you. It came out as a frightened squeak. Understandable given your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWade? What is a Wade? I\u2019ve never heard of such a species. Are all Wades so small?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, no\u2026. ma\u2019am. My name is Wade. I\u2019m a human. And we\u2019re all this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA human?

Surely\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAh. Now I see. You are a new addition to the society those insects above have formed. Tell me, how do you fare amongst the rest of the rabble? Surely it is a constant struggle, forever on the run, forever hunted.

You look way too good to be that old!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly blushed as you realized what had come out of your mouth. But it was too late to take it back.

But I was seen as such by all, revered, and feared for my size, my strength, and my agelessness. I lived for centuries even before I was betrayed and eventually imprisoned here. This mountain and the prison of Under Gloom were built atop to imprison me. Every now and then, they\u2019ll throw down some poor soul who I can drain. But the nerve of them to send one so small and feeble to satisfy me! If I could see them face to face\u2026.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, woah. Hang on. They didn\u2019t send me. I\u2019m not food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTo me everything is food, micro man.

You gave up all attempts at acting brave and fell to your knees with tears, your hands clasped in prayer to the living goddess. \u201cPlease! Look, I wasn\u2019t sent down here. I just wanted to escape Under Gloom. Please! I\u2019m a prisoner, like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back her hand and raised you before her eye again. She looked down upon you as you sat down on your knees, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA prisoner? You? How does such a teeny tiny man end up in an all-female prison populated by such \u201clarge\u201d monsters?\u201d</b> She smirked when she said large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... I set a mummy on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for some time, before laughing, her voice shaking the entire cavern and causing rocks to fall from the ceiling. You stumbled about and actually fell off the side of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you fell through the air, eventually landing on top of a soft bouncy surface.

You land on the floor where an oblivious Icy comes by with a broom and pushes you down the hallway right before Cree comes walking by and unknowingly kicks you into the air. You yell before you bounce off of Clover's trunk as the grootslang bends over. While you're flying through the air, you are heading back to your own cell when you see Destiny walk by. The gargoyle giantess bends over to take a look into your cell and you bounce off of the gargoyle's rump before you land with a crash in another cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the floor and struggle to get up. You moan in pain because it was a rather nasty fall. You step a few feet forward and then you yell because you fall through a hole too small to matter much to a monster but big enough for you to fall through. You fall into a new jail cell on the next floor down and give a groan. \"Drat!\" you yell before wincing in pain. \"I can't believe it! I'm stuck in another jail cell! Thanks a lot Bebe!\" That's when you look around and realize that this cell is surprisingly dark. You give a deep gulp. \"Oh no.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust your luck that you happened to land in a Dark Side cell. Those were the cells that were used to hold the worst criminals that committed the most atrocious and terrifying crimes. They had no hope of ever getting out of Under Gloom and were generally destructive and nasty. Mariah, Ursula, Yuri, Arethusa and Persephone. All five of the Dark Siders you knew about were evil to the core and wouldn't hesitate to devour any human unlucky or stupid enough to stumble into their cell. However, this was a part of the Dark Side that was on a different level, which meant there were outlaws here you had never seen before. All you knew for sure is that you didn't want to be here for when whoever lives here wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as you run towards the cell door, you ache in pain because you hadn't fully healed from your fall.

Bebe let out a sigh as she held up the potion. \u201cI was waiting to use this potion until I got out, but oh well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The potion in question was a potion created by Priscilla using materials she had managed to smuggle into the prison under the guards\u2019 and Destiny\u2019s nose. It was a potion created that would make the drinker more desirable to members of the opposite sex by altering their body and coating them with a very powerful pheromone. Priscilla intended to use it in order to seduce one of the guards into allowing her to escape. However, she forgot that all the guards in the prison were female and the only one she knew was gay was already married and was forced to abandon the plan. Since Priscilla had no use for the potion, she sneaked it to Bebe in the prison cafeteria and the Cheshire giantess was saving it for when she finally had Wade in her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Bebe. \u201cTo remember what Priscilla told me about this potion. She said that it was extremely powerful and I should only take enough of it to... Oh heck. I finally have the man I want and there's no way that I'm letting him get away now.\" Bebe uncorks the vial and sniffs the pink smoke that comes out, causing her eyes to widen and dilate. \"Oh my,\" says Bebe. \"Pungent stuff. That must mean it will work. Bottoms up.\" Bebe put the vial to the mouth and begun to drink it as if it were soda pop. However, she had to stop and put the potion away when she heard footsteps. Destiny was walking by doing the rounds. Fortunately for Bebe, Destiny paid her no heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" thought Bebe to herself. \"Now for... whoa...\" Bebe grunted and held her chest as her prison uniform was starting to tear apart. She was growing bigger at a rapid rate and smiled as she saw her sleeves disintegrate. \"Oh yes. Ooh!\" Bebe's breasts begun to bounce and shake as they were getting bigger and rounder. The same could be said for her rear end that was growing so large that it pressed against the bars of the cell and started to bend them while at the same time pushing up her hair. Bebe was smiling from cheek to cheek as the cell bars bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound woke you up and before you could say a single word, you look up and see that Bebe's breasts and butt cheeks would weigh as much as anvils at this point and that Bebe herself was now...</span></div></div>",

Destiny raises you up to her enormous eye and looks at you in surprise. \"What the...?! That's has got to be....\" Suddenly Destiny's eyes widen and you notice she gets a dizzy look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your wings in an attempt to hide your face, hoping Destiny wouldn't recognize you. This was not a good day. First you got turned into the one critter you hate the most and now the person who hates you the the most and vice versa has you in her hands. What did you do to deserve this? Besides all the stuff you did that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly Destiny smiles lustfully at you and does the one thing that you never expected to see her do... she <i>smiled</i>. And what made it more frightening was that it wasn't a  malicious smile. The only thing scarier than mad Destiny is not-mad Destiny when she should be mad Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny instead lets out a lustful growl and you look down to see her tail shaking. \"Why, hello there,\" your nemesis says. \"I don't recall seeing you around Fearfield.\" That's when it hit you and your jaw drops as you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack. Was Destiny <i>in love with you</i>! Not possible. Even if you were a gargoyle now, Destiny HATES men. You heard after her previous boyfriend left her after impregnating her, she became a burning misandrist, which is probably why she has such an awful temper. That potion must've contained gargoyle pheromones. That settled it, you were in hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Destiny by the way,\" says Destiny as she smiles down at you. \"What's your name little man?\" Well, you could go with Thailog given that you look like him now, but you highly doubt that's a real name among monsters. You needed to think fast. \"Uh,\" you say nervously. \"I'm... I'm Lennox.\" Destiny smiles at that. \"How Shakespearian. I like it.\" You let out a sigh of relief. This was a nightmare. You'd rather be eaten by Cree or Clover than have to endure this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" says Destiny. \"You're rather small for a gargoyle. I have a niece whose undersized but at least she's the size of a monster. I've never seen a human-sized gargoyle before.\" You let out a gulp, but Destiny smiles and shrugs her shoulders. \"It doesn't matter. I like what I see.\" You're now very afraid. What if she kisses you? You'd take Belladonna's poison over that anyway. You're screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Belladonna's voice comes out. \"Destiny!\" she yells. \"There's something weird with this alarm.\" Destiny grits her teeth. \"Damn that Belladonna. She really knows how to ruin a moment. Sorry Lennox. I gotta check this out.\" Then she smiles lustfully that scares you. \"But I know where to keep you until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Destiny places you in her...</span></div></div>",

What's so funny, prisoner?\" she barked, her movements causing you much more trouble down below, as Priscilla began laughing even harder, covering her mouth in an attempt to stop but failing miserably. Destiny just shook her head and began walking away, the sounds of the laughter growing even more distant. What did that Orc find so hilarious? Whatever the case, Destiny couldn't bother trying to figure it out. She had much more important things to do than worry about the musings of a prisoner. Maybe she'd check on that spineless flea Wade?

Destiny was monstrously huge before...but now she was god like. From your vantage point, she expanded upwards for miles and miles, and that was only a small fraction of the rest of her body!

You just had to hope she'd carry you near an exit or something, and you'd be able to do the rest yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, as you finally stop gazing at the titaness and take in the gigantic, disorienting surroundings around you, you realize with trepidation that Destiny isn't going near any sort of exit.

You look up and see long dark red hair and then you realize that the \"ground\" below you is very fleshy and squishy, making it clear you were on a very obese monster. Horror comes to you as you realize that the monster you were on was Cree Macbeth-Nile, the most vicious and fiendish of the guards. Cree was an obese 800ft tall werehyena who unlike the other guards, preferred to go to work naked. You guess her fat ass was too big to fit in any of the guard uniforms. You hated Cree because she was the most sadistic of the guards and took way too much pleasure in manhandling the prisoners that got out of line. She was also a bloodthirsty man-eater who made it clear that she would devour you the first chance she got. It didn't help that she was always laughing insanely and that drove you nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not be anymore thankful that you were shrunk to 1 inch tall. Cree would never be able to find you for the next 24 hours. You just have to bide your time for the right opportunity. But as you sigh to yourself in relief, you notice something. Cree isn't laughing like she always does. Instead, she seems stressed out and is letting out a groan to herself. \"Huh?\" you ask. Cree then walks by Belladonna who is grumbling to herself. \"Plan,\" muttered Belladonna. \"I need a plan. I want to be warden instead of the warden.\" Cree let out a groan. \"Belladonna,\" she said. \"Quit your complaining. I've got enough headaches for one day.\" Belladonna gives an angry look. \"My, aren't we in a nasty mood today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree just growled before Icy flew overhead and noticed her in a bad mood. \"What's eating you, Cree?\" asked Icy. Cree let out a sigh. \"Aurelia and I were invited to the wedding of a friend of mine from high school,\" said the werehyena giantess. \"The problem is, it's in Dreadberry.\" You shiver as Cree mentioned Aurelia. Aurelia was Cree's wife. Aurelia was a teal-furred werejackal 200ft shorter than her mate with rose-colored hair. The most noticeable thing about the Egyptian jackal giantess was that she was blind in one eye that was colored pure red and disfigured. You had heard that Aurelia was just as much a nasty human chomping fiend as Cree. In contrast to Cree, Aurelia was very skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the problem?\" asked Icy. Cree let out a sigh. \"We'll have to stay with Summer.\" \"Summer?\" you ask to yourself. \"Oh,\" said Icy. \"You mean your younger sister.\" You gasp. Cree had a <i>sister</i>!? You imagine what a horrifying beast she must've been. Cree growled and nodded her head. \"Summer hates Aurelia and the feeling is mutual. Aurelia is outright vexed with me because when we go to Dreadberry, we'll have to stay in Summer's house. It's not my fault that my kid sister is a narrow-minded creep.\" You can't help but laugh. Looks like the sister-in-laws would kill each other if left alone too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree lets out a sigh and continues work. That's when you realize that Dreadberry is several areas far away from Fearfield and Under Gloom. If you tagged along, you might be able to get too far away for Destiny to find you. But then again, you had no idea what kind of monsters lived in Dreadberry. Maybe it would be a better idea to wait until Cree and Aurelia leave for their trip and lay low in their empty apartment until you figure out how to get out of Fearfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your best option?</span></div></div>",

Crud, you managed to end up inside a cell of a monster inmate. You would turn around and leave, but a minor draft of wind blew you even deeper into the cell, carrying your light body easily. As you looked around, you began to take stock. What cell had your microscopically shrunken self arrived in?</span></div></div>",

They appeared to be both pink and purple strands of fur and you realize who's cell you're in. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" You were in the cell of Bebe, the Cheshire Cat. She had a body that could put the most bulky human wrestler to shame and was crazy about you. Bebe loved humans, especially men and was very fond of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in your opinion, she was dumb muscle that could easily be manipulated, but now you were so small she was basically a planet to you. You look up to see the cat woman was asleep in her bed, scratching away at that collar Destiny fit on her. It was itching her and prevented her from turning invisible like her species could. Old blueberry buns cut no corners when it came to making sure escape was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You try to walk away but then you see that you're surround by strands of fur the size of trees and you're forced to climb over one of the hairs, but then Bebe's ears begin to twitch and she lets out a feline mew as she gets up and rubs her eyes. She scans the floor and before you know what hit you, the Cheshire giantess spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WADE!\" she yells in joy as she jumps to the ground, her large muscular body creating a loud shockwave that knocks you off your microscopic feet. Then you see Bebe's moon sized eye looking on on you and you hear her purr. \"Yay, you got out again. Oh, thank goodness. I thought Cree would've gotten you. She's been extra ravenous lately.\" You let out a groan. \"Good to see you too Bebe.\" You mutter sarcastically. Then Bebe realizes something. \"Hey? Wait a minute, I knew you humans are tiny compared to monsters, but you're smaller than I remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because Priscilla shrunk me so I could escape. It's going to wear off in twenty four hours so I've got to get out of here fast.\" But before you can do anything Bebe puts a claw in front of you. It's ten times larger than a skyscraper at your current height. \"Uh, uh, uh,\" says Bebe as she scoops you up in her finger claw and shows that grin her species is best known for. \"You're not going anywhere until we have a little fun.\" The cat giantess giggles and you're in utter horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" You moan quietly so she can't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Bebe do with your shrunken form?</span></div></div>",

Two massive globes strained against her prison uniform, outlining a line of cleavage that would make the grand canyon appear insignificant in size.

You tried to hold on, but eventually gravity had to take over, and you found yourself free-falling through the air towards the muscular chest of this dumb pussycat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed with an \"oomph!\" after falling what seemed like several miles or more, wedged tightly between two walls of purple fur that pressed in on you, smushing your whole body against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...don't you look nice, all snuggled in my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bebe...let me go.\"You shouted up, but your voice was muffled against the soft fur and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh don't worry Wade, I'll see to it right away.\" Bebe purred above and around you, reaching for her lower regions. You look up as the sky opens up again, only this time alot wider and you can see up....only for your light to be blocked off again as a huge object enters your prison. You feel Bebe's finger examine you. She was mashing you into her thumb as she continued checking out your body with her index finger. She pushed hard on your chest and the air is knocked out of you. You may not even survive this, you think. As she continues playing with you, Bebe wasted no time as she put you on her thumb and inserted you into her body. You try to grab on to stray hairs or the entrance of the vagina, but because of the sheer size diffrence and how much stronger the former-jewel thief is compaired to you, you can't get a hold of anything. You hear the Cheshire cat giantess moan as soon as you fully slip into her vagina. Its very tight and the heat is unbearable, even at the current size you were. Just the thought made you dread the end of the twenty-four hour period and returned to your normal size. That's when she starts contracting. Its almost like she was playing with you. Her muscles were contracting all around your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Bebe sighed in utter bliss. Finally! She finally had him! She finally got what she LET herself be caught by the police for! Wade was finally hers! Just feeling him thrash and squirm within her made how long it took to pay off! She licked her muzzle and let out another moan as Wade's flailng arms tickle her walls, giving her great pleasure! She moans and pants contently as he massaged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept thrashing, futially trying to escape the pulsing, wet chamber of Bebe's body, trying to keep from drownding as it filled with her juices from you arousing her, you feel your new tight, sweltering, prison start to move. You had no idea where Bebe was going, all you know is you're stuck inside her hot vagina as she kept molding her muscles all around your body. You felt the world suddenly shift as Bebe starts to walk. This causes you to bounce around inside her pussy, inadvertently stroking the walls, adding yo your thrashing and her contracting around you to  further pleasure the cat-giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that today she had a meeting at the parole hearing office to see if she was going to be released, so perhaps this was your chance to get out of this crappy, monster-infested prison....of course if THAT worked, Bebe woul likely keep you as her pet or something since you'd be in her \"debet\" for getting you out of  Under Gloom. And knowing Bebe, and how attracted to you she is, she'd NEVER let you go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she could just be heading for the prison's weight room to work out more. You didn't know how that would work, but the odds of her paying special attention to her lower-body right now was very heigh, so you'd HAVE to stay inside her to keep from getting crushed by the gym equipment...and if that happened, you'd likly either drownd or be crushed inside her by her aroused anatomy. And if that didn't happen and you were...squirted out...the odds of ending up found by someone like Warden Destiny when Bebe was made to change her clothes were higher, and if THAT happened, this whole escape attempt was for NOTHING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept up your struggles, Bebe arrived at... </span></div></div>",

You wonder if this counts as prison rape. You couldn't see it but outside Belladonna, the vice warden, that two faced manticore is waiting for her. Belladonna smiles showing her hundreds of razor sharp teeth. \"Right this way Bebe,\" she says. \"Let's see how lucky you are.\" Bebe ignores Belladonna's taunting and follows the manticore into another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally managed to crawl out of the hole you were in but all you could see was the black and white lining of the prison jumpsuit. \"Is she even wearing underwear?\" you ask to yourself. Outside, Bebe was meeting with the parole board. There were several monsters representing the parole board but the one in the center was a greenish skinned zombie woman who appeared to be wearing a tattered and dirt stained ballroom dress. In the corner was Warden Destiny with that same stern look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a reporter at the scene from the Daily Tombstone. This reporter was a girl, a yellow green skinned bunyip from Australia. She was chubby and resembled a kangaroo except she had no fur, no tail, clawed hangs and the face of a frog with sharp fangs. She had golden brown hair and was wearing a pair of sunglasses on her head along with a blue shirt and cargo shorts. The bunyip reporter was writing down notes as she pulled her glasses over her head. A fly buzzes over her head before she flicks out a frog tongue to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parole hearing was about to begin as the zombie parole officer leans forward to get a good look at Bebe. \"Bebe Laden,\" she says as she has to hold up her rotting jaw. \"Alias, Bebe the Mirage. Sixth months ago you were convicted of grand theft of millions worth of skulls in fine jewelry, including the Eye of the Legion.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" Says Bebe nervously. Inside Bebe's crevice you cross your fingers and hope that this turns out for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunyip reporter takes off her sunglasses slightly and bears her teeth to focus in as the parole officer zombie is about to give her judgement. \"Considering the charges against you weren't as serious as those of larger offenders such as Ursula Major or Yuri L, you were sentenced to six months. As of today you have paid your debt to society. You may walk out a free woman providing you intend to cease your criminal activities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe gives a Cheshire cat's grin her species is famous for and puts her hand over her heart. \"No, this is one kitty cat that's learned her lesson. You don't have to worry about me breaking the law anytime soon.\" The zombie nods her head. \"As of today,\" the undead parole officer says. \"You are free to go. \"Warden Destiny, please set her free.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny is reluctant to do so at first, but she walks up to Bebe and sticks out her tongue. At the end of her tongue Destiny is holding onto a ring of keys. She takes the key ring and holds up one key in particular as she walks up to Bebe. \"Don't make me regret this.\" Destiny turns the key on the collar built specifically to negate Bebe's invisibility and in seconds the collar is off and Bebe shakes hands with Destiny. In Bebe's crevice you heard every word. \"Yes!\" you yell. \"Stupid gargoyle. Whether you know it or not. I'm getting out too.\" This was it, you were finally sneaking out of this horrible prison. Bebe was smuggling you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Bebe has been changed into a maroon colored dress that shows off her well muscled figure as she walks out of Under Gloom. She's purring as she walks out. Destiny and the parole board think it's because she's happy to get out of prison but it's really because you're jumping up and down in her opening celebrating. And a whole day left for Priscilla's shrinking spell to wear off. \"Thanks for the help Priscilla. Enjoy the big house.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the prison, in your cell, your former cellmate Lockette wakes up with a yawn and looks around. She sees that you've escaped and lets out a sigh. \"Destiny's not going to like this.\" With that the Loch Ness Monster girl goes back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe has soon climbed down the mountain. \"Okay Bebe,\" you say. \"We're out. You can get me out now.\" Bebe lets out a purr and shakes her head. \"Not yet my little Wade,\" she says as she shakes her body and causes you to slip further down the tunnel. \"Oh not yet. I'll take you out when I feel like it. You owe me one little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. Looks like Bebe really intends on keeping you. You weren't completely out of the woods yet. \"So Bebe,\" you ask. \"What are you doing now that you're a free woman?\"</span></div></div>",

It's unbearably hot and you're sweating uncontrollably. \"Please,\" you mutter to yourself. \"Please let that stupid cat let me out.\" But you were in for a long bus trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know was the moment you left, Destiny inspected the cells and found you missing from your cell with the bar broken off from where you escaped. Destiny grits her teeth as her eyes glow bright red and she notices Lockette still asleep. Destiny pounds on the cell door and Lockette falls out of bed and stretches her long neck in the air. \"Great Scott,\" says Lockette. \"Warden Destiny.\" \"Where's that cellmate of yours Lockette?\" asks the warden angrily. \"I-I honestly don't know Warden Destiny. I really don't know!\" Destiny turns to the guards and they step back in fear. \"Did any of you see Wade leave the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover hisses and trumpets as she shakes her head. \"Like, I didn't see anything Warden.\" Icy scratches her head. \"The only humans I saw today were the ones I ate for breakfast before I came to work Warden.\" Simone shrieks and shrugs her shoulders. Cree actually rubs her own belly as she considers the situation. \"I think I would've remembered if I saw him today Warden. In fact, I would've distinctively remembered eating him.\" Suddenly there's banging on another cell door. It was that hundred eyed Argus snitch Cornelia. \"Warden Destiny!\" she yelled. \"Warden Destiny!\" Destiny and Belladonna both walk up to Cornelia's cell. \"Cornelia,\" says Destiny. \"My favorite fink. There's a box full of macarons in my office if you can tell us what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia gives an evil smirk as she blinks forty of her eyes at once. \"Well, I saw him enter Priscilla's cell and then there was a flash of light.\" \"Priscilla smuggled MAGIC into my prison! She'll get the pit for this! What did she do?\" \"Well,\" says Cornelia. \"I distinctively remembered hearing her say something about shrinking him. I doubt he's been eaten or stepped on though.\" Destiny clenches her hand into a fist. \"Bebe must've smuggled him out. I don't even want to know where she put him. Belladonna actually laughs at that and gives a smug look. \"Looks like you really dropped the ball chief. This sort of thing would never happen if <i>I</i> was warden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny shows her manticore second in command her claws as her eyes glow, but then turn back to normal. Destiny gives a smile. \"I'll let this one slide. Wade thinks he's escaped, but he's just traded one prison for another. Bebe will never let him go. He'll be begging to be back in Under Gloom in no time.\" Destiny lets out a laugh just thinking about your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the bus, Bebe is fingering your position as she giggles and purrs and presses her claw against you into those squishy walls as you groan. You can't wait for the shrinking spell to wear off and return to normal size. But then Bebe would still be much, much, much, much bigger than you. As hard as you try to get out of this cat lady's tunnel, you just slip further and further down and get farther away from the exit. It's gonna be a long ride back to Bebe's house and it looked like Bebe wasn't going to be letting you go anytime soon. She might even decide to keep you in your current location... FOREVER. You really hope that isn't the case.</span></div></div>",

If you knew Bebe's past, you would think this was a joke. Her home was a two story building, beautifully constructed and decorated. The grass around the home was a bit overgrown, but aside from that detail the place was almost perfect. She waited for a bit, letting the buss pass and checking to see if anyone was looking. The chesire cat then reached down to her nether regions and pulled you out. The cool fresh air was more than what you could have asked for as you took lots of deep breathes. She purred, \"Did you have fun down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panted, not really able to get a full sentence out. But you managed a word, \"Fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there will be more time for that later....\" Bebe smiled, \"But first, you are the guest of honor! And allow me to be your host.\" She started walking towards her home. After recovering, you finally managed to wrap your head around that the house in front of you was her home. You stared at it in disbelief. She reached for a key hidden in a fake rock before opening it. The open door revealed the shocking interior. A grand entranceway, painted in a beautiful shade of light purple, and a grand chandelier lit up the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is your home?!\" you shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you believe me if I told you that I earned this house without using the stolen jewels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe smiled, \"Well I have. Now, I do not know about you, but I'm feeling kind of hungry. That prison food doesn't exactly go well.\" Your stomach growled, causing your captor to giggle. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" She made a turn for the kitchen, an expert kitchen if you ask anyone. She set you down on the center counter as she got to work. This was a chance for you to escape, but even if the shrink spell wore off, you were still practically miles above the floor. A jump now would be suicide. \"What would you like Baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoffed, \"Look, just because we're together does not make us lovers. So don't call me Baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would \"Dear\" or \"Sweetie Pie\" be better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms and sighed in defeat, \"I could use a cup of coffee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up, Baby.\" Bebe giggled to herself as she prepared what you asked for. As you waited, your mind wandered on how you could escape. Bebe was not just any monster, she was a Chesire Cat, and she was pretty buff too. Escaping from her would be hard. Your only chance would be if you could somehow get yourself alone. You thought over the different scenarios, just as something was set behind you. \"Coffee's ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned, seeing a miniature cup. You looked to her, \"How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the coffee being done so fast, or the cup?\" You gestured to her both. \"Well I had a friend watch over this place while I was locked up. She made coffee this morning, and it was still nice and hot. As for the cup, I always wanted to have human company, so I kept my old doll house stuff. Its the perfect size too...\" That last remark made you frown; you're now drinking coffee from a cup meant as a girl's toy. Though, the almost hypnotic smell of the coffee made you pass that feeling. You pick the cup up and take a drink from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Bebe laced your coffee with a...</span></div></div>",

You sat there, completely dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Bebe was waiting for.

This love potion was special, because not only could it make anyone fall in love with anyone, but it had a bit of hypnotic powers as well. Bebe wasn't just going to have Wade love her, no, she was going to have him adore her. She kneels so you were at least eye level to her. \"You can hear me?\" The human nodded. \"Okay, listen closely, I will tell you about your life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...life...\" he nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe contained herself, trying not to possibly put in any wrong message. She was about to completely rewrite his past, so she did not want to leave out any details or make any mistakes. \"Alright, your name is....Xanthos\" she smiled. \"You are a human who loves monsters. The bigger they are, the more you love them. You met me during one of my past crimes as a jewel thief. When the cops were hot on my tail, you gave me a quick place to hide and even told the cops where you \"saw\" me going. After that, you always had a bit of a crush on me. When I was arrested and sent to Under Gloom, you sent me love letters every day. You commented on how you would visit, but was afraid that the monsters would end up killing or eating you. I did not mind this. But I always wrote that I would be back soon, getting bigger for you. And now, after all this time, here you are with me. Finally admitted that you love me like no other, and willing to live with me in my new home.\" Bebe had to smile that you had a smile on your face. Apparently you enjoyed this as much as she was; and Bebe was practically fingering herself at the thoughts of you loving her. Bebe stepped back, speaking quietly, \"Alright...and if I remember now, the next step is to pour a bit of water on him...\" Getting a handful of water, she splashed it over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough, your mind was returning. But old memories pf Wade were not there anymore. No, your new memories of Xanthos were present. Your past rewrote itself as you stare up to those beautiful cat eyes. \"Hello Bebe\" you spoke in a pleasant voice, \"How's my favorite big kitty since you've been out of prison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe could no longer contain herself. She grabbed you, quite gently, and embraced you against her face. She purred with tears in her eyes and her tail swishing. \"Its...its wonderful...Xanthos...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little human returned the hug. Bebe could not wish for anything different. \"I see you got bigger...\" Bebe looked to your face, seeing a glint of red. \"I like it...\" Despite the size different, Bebe brought you in for a kiss. And despite the massive size difference, you kissed her back. It was the start of a new day, or more likely, a new life for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke, resting beside your lovely Cheshire cat. Most would find that smile of hers creepy, but you found it to be lovely. You crawled over her large hand and went to her cheek, giving it a kiss. She smiled as a purr was let out. Her eye opened, \"Morning Baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Bebe...\" You smiled to her. \"We have all the days in the world now. But I was curious, what will you do now that you're out?\" The Cheshire cat thought this over. She smiled once she had an idea.</span></div></div>",

She gently scooped him up, gave him a quick kiss before placing him directly between her breasts. She climbed out of bed to head downstairs. Each step caused her chest to bounce, making the little human bounce with them. He did not mind though, but his face was still red. They got to the bottom before she spoke again, \"That reminds me...what about you? What will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...\" the human responded, \"Not sure what job a human can have in this part of the city.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over 2 months have past since that day, and things went off like a firework. Every day, most of the day, Bebe hit the gym. She lifted constantly to get her body into even more shape than what she was. Xanthos helped in any way he could; giving support during her sessions or finding good natural ways to improve muscle growth. All the while Xanthos finally got a job, a nice safe job, a nice safe well paying job. Xanthos maintains stocks and overlooks bank accounts and payments for the largest company in the city. The best part was that he could do this all from one computer in the safety of his home. And thanks to the pay, he could help support him and Bebe while she was finding a sponsor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Bebe, two months of weightlifting has done her body good. While Bebe before was no laughing matter to begin with, over about 500ft tall and muscle to put any human bodybuilder to shame, but now she could only be described as a goddess in Xanthos's eyes. The special protein shakes and diet didn't just make her muscles grow bigger, it made all of Bebe grow bigger. Bebe now stood at a height of about 850ft, surpassing that of the biggest guard in Under Gloom Cree. Her muscles put anyone who entered the same gym she was in to shame. But, the bigger muscles is not what Xanthos liked about Debe. Even from the massive muscle gain, Bebe kept her feminine body frame and charm. She still had a hourglass figure; slightly slim waist, wide hips and large breasts. The two lovebirds often stayed passionate to one another, as well as they could without Bebe accidentally injuring Xanthos. Aside from that, the two were living happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, fate could still decide something to happen to these two.</span></div></div>",

Her special protein shakes and workout programs benefitted her with a body that almost all would be jealous of. Standing at a height of 1100ft tall, her biceps easily bigger than a basketball, the rest of her body was just as toned. Sporting a solid ten pack of abs, her calves just as toned and large as her arms, she was possibly the definition of strength. And, much like she always had, her large plump rear and perky breasts stayed and grew with the rest of her body. She outfitted every weight in the gym, possibly more. She spends most of her workouts at home, lifting her card which has gotten too small for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXantos has been successful as well. His good job as the company's stock holder, the company issued him for a promotion and a high pay raise. Getting work done faster and easier allowed him to spend more time with Bebe. They went on lots of different dates, ranging from picnics in the park to movies and to dinner dates. Each day they got closer. Secretly, Xantos visited a jeweler in the city to make a special ring. Tonight, he was going to propose to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about the third month into staying at Bebe's home, Bebe had a transport system built into her home. Now, Xantos can go from the upstairs to anywhere downstairs in a few minutes. There were also elevators on some other places, for priority. He arrived in the kitchen, smelling the delicious food Bebe prepared. \"How's dinner my Buff Kitty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe smiled, \"A few more minutes in the oven and it should be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of ready...\" Bebe heard the uncertainty in his voice. She got closer, much to Xantos's liking. \"Bebe, we've been together for a while now...and I-I got to know you so well. So, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang, cutting Xantos off. Bebe grabbed her man, got up and opened the door. A large, buff minotaur in a custom tailored suit stood at the door. He was bigger than Bebe, probably about 2000ft tall or higher. A gold ring hung in his nose, as a few gold rings around his horns. \"Can I help you?\" Bebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes you can\" he spoke with a smile. \"My name is Fergus Strenald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strenald?\" Bebe asked. \"I've heard that name before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, \"I don't mean to brag, but if you go to any gym and lift any weight with any machine, you'll see my name on it. I'm the founder and president of the Strenald Corporation, dedicated to help all walks of life to stay fit and healthy. My scouts have informed me of you from your trips to the local gym in this part. And I have come to make an offer. In a few weeks the Monster Olympia Bodybuilder Competition will start. And I want you to be our company's sponsor for the female division.\" Both Bebe and Xantos were jawdropped by this. \"I can tell from your reactions that my offer has been confirmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Bebe shook Fergus's hand. \"YES! This is a HUGE honor! I would gladly be your sponsor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Me and my boys will drop by tomorrow to get all the paperwork filled out. See ya around miss.\" He tilted his hat before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe closed the door, then hugged Xantos as tightly as she could and purred. Her tail wagging behind her. \"This is amazing! My first sponsor! And its for one of the best ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXantos patted her, \"Yeah, great job honey.\" The proposal will have to wait, for now at least. Right now was a time to celebrate</span></div></div>",

While it was true Bebe came close to him during the first time she came, Silver was still much bigger then her at the time. Now that the two months have past, the werewolf was the smaller one. He tried to catch up with her, but he just couldn't keep up. Soon Bebe was the \"Big Dog\" of the weight room. This brought Silver's blood to a boil just thinking about it. He was supposed to be the biggest, not her. And he would never be outranked by a human loving monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he set his plan into motion. He lifted on a bench press, lifting lots of weight. After he racked it, he watched the Cheshire lift. Those rippling muscles should have been his and his alone, not hers. After Bebe completed a set, she went out to wipe herself down really quick. Now this was his moment. Silver got up and went to the small lockers in the weight room, opening Bebe's and finding her protein shake. He grabbed a vial of a red potion from his locker, and poured the entire contents of the vial in the drink. The shop he bought it from said to use only a small amount, but this is revenge. Silver couldn't help but smile as he shook her drink to let the potion do its work. \"Get ready Bebe...you're life is going to have a complete turn around...\" He ran back to the bench bar just as Bebe came back in. The potion Silver poured into her protein shake was...</span></div></div>",

Silver figured that if Bebe dared to challenge his status as the \"Big Dog\" on campus, he'd let the cat have it but not in a way that she expected. As Silver moved away from the bench, that strange potion mixed into the protein shake just as Bebe was walking back up to her shake. At this point, Bebe was clearly the most muscular monster in Fearfield. She still had her curvy feminine torso, but she also had twelve-pack abs with muscular legs and arms that were so thick that her veins were clearing visible on her purple and pink striped body. At this point, the heaviest weights were as heavy as toy dumbbells to the ginormous feline. Speaking of which, she had also gotten even bigger and stood at 1300ft tall, even bigger than Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was all the more reason for Silver to go through with his evil plan. He'd be damned if he let himself be bested by a female monster, and a cat at that. He watched as Bebe took the tainted protein shake and then drank it. She gave a look of disgust. \"Ugh,\" she says. \"This protein shake must have spoiled. It tastes worse than usual.\" But Bebe ignored it and downed the whole protein shake before she walked up to the treadmill to work on her leg muscles for a chain. To Silver's shock, the potion apparently didn't work and he was furious. He led out a growl. \"I paid six hundred skulls for that damn potion and it didn't work! I'm going to give that shopkeeper a piece of my mind.\" Bebe just ran on the treadmill, blissfully unaware of Silver's plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Bebe was in bed purring as she called to you. \"Oh Xantos,\" she said with a purr as she showed her teeth and stood stark naked in bed. \"Come and make me purr.\" Since you had forgotten everything about who you were before, you couldn't wake to get in bed with Bebe and you climbed her toes up to her knee right before the big and muscular kitty cat licked you. You had come to enjoy that sandpaper tongue of hers. \"Damn,\" you say. \"I'm ready for a trip on the nine lives express.\" Bebe let out a giggle and then let out a grunt as she held her stomach in pure pain. \"Bebe?!\" you yell. \"What's wrong?\" Bebe let out a grunt. \"Nothing is wrong, Wa... er... Xantos. My protein shake earlier just didn't  taste right.\" Bebe then grunted again and you were more worried than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe first felt her face and found that her face was more fleshy than she remembered and then heard a creaking noise to see her ass was swelling out. \"Oh my gosh!\" she yelled. Suddenly Bebe's body begun to expand as you yell and fall off her knee as her body begun to swell. Her muscles were rapidly being buried underneath tons of extreme fat. Bebe let out a growl as her thighs became more thunderous and her stomach expanded. The bed begun to creak more and more as Bebe continued to swell. Silver's potion had worked after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the potion was done with Bebe, she actually had gotten bigger than when she had muscles. For one, she was 1500ft tall and was just as wide, especially in her stomach and her hips, with her ass big enough to take up most of the bed and huge H-cup breasts. Bebe was shocked that she had become so morbidly obese but the only thing on her mind was to find you. \"Xantos!\" she yelled. \"Xantos! Where are you!?\" Fortunately for you, Bebe's newfound flab had prevented you from being crushed and as she got up to try find you, she found you stuck but alive to her massive...</span></div></div>",

But from Bebe's speed and the fact that she can still stand and move, means that she obviously still has her muscles, albeit completely buried by her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xantos!\" she yelled. \"Oh, thank goodness you're alright!\" You stand in Bebe's palm in confusion and the paw pad is way softer than you remembered, like a sea of gelatin and you poke one of her fingers to see that it is likewise squishy. You look down at you 1500tall cat girlfriend with her 1500ft wide belly, 1000ft wide ass and H-cup breasts and you couldn't believe what you saw. \"Bebe!\" you yell. \"Your muscles...\" However, Bebe stand on one leg and does a pirouette. \"They're still there,\" she said. \"But buried underneath all this lard. Oh my. If I showed up at the gym now... I'd be a laughing stock. A big fat laughing stock.\" \"But how did you get so fat?\" you ask. \"In two month I've never seen you eat anything other than health food and steak.\" Bebe grabs part of her massive behind before she continues to speak to you. \"My protein shake did taste a little off today. OMG! Somebody must've put some weird potion in it that created fat on my muscles! I'll bet it was Silver. That guy can't stand anyone with more muscles on their body than him.\" \"What a jerk,\" you say. \"I'd hate to meet somebody as hateful and rotten as that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe would laugh at the irony of the statement except for two things; One was that she didn't want to risk undoing the love spell she put on you and the other factor was her current situation. \"This is a travesty. How will anyone take me seriously as a body builder now. I'm hideous!\" However, you eye every last centimeter of Bebe's obese and ginormous body, from her gloriously large ass to her massive hips, her planetary belly, meteor sized boobs and triple chin and your nose starts to bleed slightly. \"Y-You look beautiful.\" Bebe blinks slightly at your statement. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub Bebe's thumb. \"Like you said,\" you say. \"I love big woman and this is the biggest I've seen you. Besides, you still have those gorgeous muscles under all this fat. I think it could work.\" Bebe purrs and smiles down at you before she gives you a nice large lick that coats you in cat saliva. \"Oh! Aren't you sweet!? I think this is a good look. But I will go to the gym to be able to carry this weigh.\" Bebe twirls again as graceful as a ballerina before she lays down on the bed, crunching it to the ground and holds one bloated leg up into the air and waves her tail. \"Alright, lover boy, let's finish what we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more than excited to get it on with Bebe even at this new weight of hers.

You're not gonna see much of anything for a really long time.\" Your gargoyle nemesis chuckles again--a sound like thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this moment that you think that setting that mummy chick on fire <i>might</i> have been a bad idea.

Oh, crap.<br>\r\n\"Time's up, see ya!\" And then she drops you. You go tumbling through the air, limbs flailing as you scream. Obscenities at Destiny, at Under Gloom, at all monsters.

Everything hurts like hell, and you can barely move. Even your hate of Destiny is forgotten for a moment as you choose to just lie there on the leather in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a minute, leather? But that meant--<br>\r\nA shadow covers you. Looking up, you find Destiny's planetary behind, clad in tight shorts. \"Hope you don't mind sharing a seat for a few hours, Wade. Oh, wait--I don't really care.\" She taunts you without even looking back, and then she bends her legs. Slowly, inescapable, her cheeks descend on you and pin you beneath their impossible weight, pressing you into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was worse than her stepping on you. Far worse! Under her feet, you could at least find purchase on the ground with your arms, or try and wiggle out from under them! But with Destiny sitting on you....there was nothing but the chair, her ass, and you between them. And there would be no wiggling free here. Destiny's ample behind had all but immobilized you, and twitches and struggles you tried only tickled the gargoyle. Add to this the pain of that much weight pressing down all over your body--the softness of the leather chair was probably the only reason you hadn't been instantly crushed into paste--and that Destiny would wiggle her butt down on you, bounce in her seat, or slowly grind you back and forth every so often....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was NOT a peasant time, to say the least. Lasting seven hours didn't do you any good, either. <br>\r\nYour only mercy was that she didn't fart on you, though you wouldn't put it past Destiny. Disgusting psycho monster bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny <i>finally</i> gets up, peeling you off her butt and pinching you in front of her face, smirking. \"Well, that was fun. For me. You made such a nice seat cushion, Wade. I think that should've been your career here in the monster world.\" She shrugs her shoulders. \"Well, the potion still has a few hours left, and my shift is over. I *could* just take you back to your cell, but even once that potion wears off, you'll still be nice and tiny. Maybe you still haven't learned your lesson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settles it.

There you remember who you were now and who you had been for the previous 23 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new name was Wanda Talbot and you were a werewolf working as a cop in Fearfield. You were injured in a police chase and it caused you amnesia. But fortunately it was temporary. Now, this was your new life.

Your partner is waiting outside.\" You nod your head and smile before putting your clothes back on. \"Thank you very much, Dr. Zenigame.\" You shake hands with the doctor and then you walk out of the hospital room to find another cop waiting for you.

She was reading the newspaper when she noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda,\" she says. \"Oh thank the heavens that you're alright.\" You give a laugh. \"I'm fine, Chance. It will take more than a car crash to kill me.\" Chance gave a scoff. \"You almost did a very good job of that yourself, partner. You nearly destroyed yourself chasing Fang Grunewald the other day.\" You shake your head and get in the car as Chance starts to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you reading anyway.\" Chance takes a sip of coffee before she answers. \"Well,\" she says. \"This will make you laugh. I was reading an article on past lives. They say that some people who do their best to be good are trying to make up for the bad deeds they committed in past lives. Do you ever think that maybe the reason why you became a cop was because you were a criminal in a past life.\" You give a scoff and laugh. \"No. I was raised much better than to be a criminal.\" Chance smiles but then gives a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my grandmother?\" You raise an eyebrow. \"You mean the one that used to be a prison warden. Oh. Every time this year she gets real depressed. Why is that?\" Chance lets out a sigh. \"You see, Wanda. Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the death of that criminal who was always driving her crazy. He made her so apoplectic that she finally snapped and sentenced him to death. However, I think part of her misses him. Heck, even my grandfather finally coming back to make amends didn't do anything for her.\" You nod your head. Chance's grandmother was a gargoyle named Destiny. You heard that she used to have a fiery temper but 23 years ago she mellowed out and then after 4 years, she decided she didn't want to be the warden anymore and retired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChance let out a sigh. \"And in a few weeks, it'll be her birthday. I'd like to do something to cheer her up.\" You give a smile. \"Well,\" you say. \"Wait'll she meets me.

Once I pour this potion on you, it will turn you into Warden Destiny for twenty minutes. You gag even louder. \"Me, turn into that gargoyle? I hate Destiny! That old bat is determined to make my life a living hell. I'd like to see someone take a hammer to her skull. Why don't you take that potion yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wouldn't make sense for Destiny to be locked in here. The warden can move through the prison without any suspicion. Now hold still.\" Priscilla reaches her hand outside of the bars and pours the potion onto you as you begin to twitch and turn bright blue. You scream as your fingers turn to claws and your feet turn to talons as you sprout a tail. Your body becomes more hourglass shaped and you grow a pair of breasts as horns sprout on your forehead. Then you start to grow bigger and bigger until you're even taller than Priscilla. Your hair becomes pinkish red, curly and then extends past your back as you sprout bat like wings and grow fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the transformation is complete, you look at your clawed hands and gasp before you grope your own new breasts and feel around your lower waist with a look of despair. \"I feel like I need to shower,\" you mumble in disgust. 'In acid!\" Priscilla gives a smile that shows her fangs. \"It worked. Now hurry. You only have twenty minutes to get out before the potion wears off. And don't forget our deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh I won't forget,\" you say as you walk away with a sly look on your face. \"Stupid orc.\" As much as you hate to admit it, temporarily turning into a clone of Warden Destiny was a blessing in disguise. Little does Priscilla know, you have no intention of coming back for her. This was your ticket out of this rot hole. Since you looked exactly like Destiny, the inmates and staff will never be able to tell that the sole human in the prison was escaping. Of course, you had to get out before the spell wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But as you're making your way down the halls, you hear somebody coming. You flinch slightly and then you remember that you're turned into a clone of Destiny and the guards will never know you're Wade. You decide to remain cool. You'll have to pretend to be Destiny because somebody is coming, but who...?</span></div></div>",

Another pair son grew, making a total of four. Destiny's hand stayed there, for your reach couldn't go past your breasts. She eventually let go, but your head felt heavy. The four horns on your head looked as thick as lightposts and about two feet long. \"Can I leave before this living nightmare becomes even more like hell?\" But the smile on Destiny's face said otherwise.

She had vines and leaves growing out of her body from her upper waist and back to the top of her head which had leaves in place of hair. Her face was somewhat ghoulish with sad eyes and a frowning face that gave her a grim and emotionless look. She had no nose and her face appeared to be painted on. While she had legs, she had no visible feet to stand on and because of this, she seemed to levitate off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy was a mystery.

Nobody even knows what Darcy did to be placed in Under Gloom and according to Lockette she hasn't said a word since she was convicted.

You couldn't stop. All the guards in this prison were carnivores and you knew on your level there were four guards that you weren't fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Cree, the werehyena. That bloated bitch was a borderline psychopath who got a kick out of brutalizing any prisoner that tries to escape. You think she took the job mainly to beat people up. But you definitely didn't want to run into her as she was especially dangerous to humans. They were her favorite snack and she always had her tongue sticking out as she looked for any opportunity to catch humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was Clover, a grootslang, a type of monster resembling a reptilian elephant with a snake for a trunk. She wasn't as psychotic as Cree but she and Cree were deadly rivals when it came to capturing and eating humans. You once saw her spew human bones out of her trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird wasn't so bad. Simone, the Nue the Nue. That giant monkey never spoke and only shrieked. However, she doesn't eat humans as much as the other guards and prefers fruit. But she will report you right to warden Destiny if she doesn't choose to eat you. But in that case, eating would be preferred<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth was the snow bird harpy Icy. She was a new guard and very clumsy and ditzy so you had a chance to get away from her. But she is not any nicer than Clover or Cree and her ice powers froze humans on contact into meaty popsicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes vice warden Belladonna herself came to patrol the halls. You couldn't worry about which one would show up, because you were almost home free. But then you feel tremors that knock you off your feet. You fall to the ground and a shadow falls over you. One of the guards knows you're trying to escape but which one.</span></div></div>",

Do I look like a cartoon villain to you!\" \"You really want me to answer that boulder breath?\" you ask. \"The only reason people are afraid of you is because you're so freakishly tall.

Ooh, I can't decide which would be more fun. Chew or swallow.

I wouldn't mind helping you...you know I hate her too, but how much use can I be to you in you eat me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thought seems to strike Belladonna and she sneers at you. \"Well then...we can't have that, now can we?\" the manticore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You might need to shut up Cornelia too, she's Destiny's personal prison snitch.\" you point out, you had a grudge against the Argus since your last three escape attempts failed because she ratted you out to Destiny. Needless to say, she was one of your least favorite monsters in the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna scowled, \"Thanks for the tip...if she's not shut up, I could loose this chance at becoming warden. But first...where to hide you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug \"Heck if I know, just keep me away from your tail. No one wants to be near that thing.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one ever...wants to be..near my...\" Belladonna said slowly, then she grinned deviously \"That'll do grand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she undid her pants and her free hand pushed her pants down to her thighs, unveiling her slender, smooth thighs and panties. She moaned softly as she brought that free hand along the skin of her inner thigh and brushed it against her swollen lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked in shock up at Belladonna, \"You're going to KEEP me in there?!\" she smiled, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, everyone avoids my tail. But since it'd get in the way if you were put there, you get the front row...now bye-bye!\" she said, letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you were dropped into the opening at the front of the panties. You hit the elastic of the panties face-first and bounced, flipping you around, filling your view with nothing but Belladonna's giant pussy. Before she could even respond, Belladonna let go, snapping the panties back into place and driving you straight up towards Belladonna's massive vagina which looms before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought between those massive slimy lips, causing a shudder to erupt from your hostess as you were plunged deeper and deeper into the manticore's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna almost had an orgasm as she felt Wade touch her, but she kept going, slowly sliding the tiny prisoner further and further into herself until her knuckles touched her thighs. Then she let go and pulled her fingers out. She smiled a smile of satisfaction, and sighed a gentle sigh as she pulled her pants back up and wiggled her hips slightly, feeling her prisoner deep inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out in alarm, and put your arms in front of you to break the fall. Your left arm disappears into her slit. You struggle to free it, but a muscular contraction pulls you in up to the forearm. You scream for help as the rest of your arm is engulfed. In a fit of panic, you push away from it with all of your adrenaline-powered strength. This gets the opposite reaction that you were hoping for, as it only results in another tug from inside of the prison's vice-warden. Your screams are muffled as your head is drawn in. The only light is blocked by your body and a strong smell of fish pervades what little air you have. As you squirm, more and more of your body is pulled into her body. Finally, even your feet are inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you're fighting for your life, punching, kicking, scratching and biting her pulsing, slimy walls as the cavern starts filling up, driving you into an utter panic as you try fighting to turn around and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho...say that actually...OooOOOoOOooooHHhh!\" The rest of her words trailed off into a pleasured moan as her legs buck. Her breathing picks up as her face flushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that's why..there are...human-lover...ugh!...I can see why!\" the manticore moaned again at your thrashing and felt herself heat up and bites her fingertip. \"Dear god...Why haven't I...\" she gasped and sucked in her breath \"D-d-done this...before?!\" Belladonna bites her lip and runs to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Demona...\" she sucked in air again \"Would've just put him...gah!...b-ba-back in his cell?! What a waste! And to think...Wade's the one to punch...gahhaa...my virginity card! Ohh...knew there was a reason I wasn't married yet!\" she said, stumbling into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, YOU IN THERE! KEEP THAT UP!\" Belladonna shouted once she gets into a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Belladonna, it was filling up fast. You cough and sputter as you spit out some of the 700-foot monsters juices and the living walls tighten around you and you feel things shift suddenly, getting a little wider, muct to your relief...at least until you look up and a tidal wave of gooey fluid rushed at you and hit you hard enough to knock you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you regain consciousness, you're out of  Belladonna's panties. Thank god. And you're NOT in Under Gloom any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you were in a tiny cage with a U-shaped handle on top and had bars as wide as matchsticks and were close together. It looked like a rat trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

On the wall, you see a photograph of Destiny, except that there was Belladonna's face glued over her own. There was a closet nearby that appeared to have a gaudy looking uniform one would expect from a military leader, complete with a commissar cap. Then you look and gasp because Belladonna's huge face is looming over you and smiling smugly, showing her three rows of fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my little pet.\" She says. \"Belladonna!\" you yell. \"What happened! We had a deal!\" Belladonna just lets out a laugh at that thought. \"Well, you felt so good in my tunnel of love, that it gave me an epiphany. Until now, I thought humans were only useful as food. But I think I'll keep you around.\" \"What?!\" you yell angrily. \"You mean to tell me...\" \"That's right,\" the vice warden says as she wiggles her scorpion tail. \"As long as you're my sexy little toy, I won't kill you.\" Belladonna laughs and turns around as she shakes her rump, giving you a front row seat to her deadly tail as you step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble and start to cry as you bang your head on the walls of the cage. \"You went from one prison to the next and now an even more sadistic warden had you in her power.\" Belladonna puts her feet near the table as she turns on her TV to watch a monster football game. Belladonna's feet are right next to your cage and they smell so bad you feel like you're gonna throw up. It doesn't help that she never wears shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna chuckles to herself. \"The governor really tore old blueberry buns a new one. If I play my cards right, I'll be able to be warden sooner than I thought. You should've seen old Destiny cringing in her office at the thought you were the first to escape under her watchful eye.\" I haven't laughed this month since I found Cree and Clover watching that old TV show from Disney. I decided to introduce Destiny to it for a laugh. She actually liked it until she found out about Demona. It was that funny that they made a cartoon character who looked just like our leather winged warden. You're not the first to call her Demona you know. I swear, she was so mad she couldn't speak coherently for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Belladonna laughs to herself, you have to plug your ears as her toes bang against your cage.

Being that she had a human-like head, a red lion's body, and a scorpion's tail with a stinger, and three rows of teeth like a shark, naturally, Belladonna had paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, then stare through the toes of her footpaw and the bars of your cage up at the 700-foot,yellow skinned manticore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" you shouted at the top of your lungs at her. That was disgusting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you lick my feet clean or I'll devour you.\" Belladonna said menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that I \"felt so good in your tunnel of love, that it gave you an epiphany.

You can't eat me if you want to keep using me that way!\" God...it felt GOOD to throw that in the Vice-Warden's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she looked at you thoughtfully through her toes, that's when you knew you screwed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know, Sweetie...you're right. And you just gave me an even BETTER idea!\" the giant female monster said deviously. \"Either you lick my feet clean or...I'll just have to 'excite' you again and make you cum as much as you can to completely moisten them and then I'll use your body as a washcloth to scrub them clean using your juices, Wade. Then I'LL put you inside my mouth and give you a tongue bath...literally!\" Belladonna paused and licked her lips, letting out a moan of arousal at the very idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked, horrified and disgusted at the idea of that. Just <b>HOW BADLY</b> did you get this manticore worked up earlier if she's that turned on and raunchy towards you?! Ho...you take it back, throwing that in Belladonna's face bit you in the ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...On second thought...\" you mutter, turning to face Belladonna's sole, she laughed, enjoying her victory and power over you. There was also a husky tone to it, showing she enjoyed it in terms of getting her hot and bothered...again, you have to wonder how badly you got this manticore worked up earlier if she's that turned on and raunchy towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to displease this giantess (but only since the alternative to licking is even worse), you walk up to the paws and stick your tongue out. You pressed into the pad surprised at how soft and warm it was. You felt degraded being forced to do this. The smell under her paws washes over you and you scrunch your face with disgust as you hear Belladonna laugh as she spreads her toes. You preceded with a grimace on your face. You stepped towards her paws again, bringing your face close to the rough leathery surface of her dark gray pawpad. A musky odor was detected. You couldn't describe it as anything you knew, just a heavy musky smell. Your height only came up to the ball of the footpaw some that's where you started. You lean forward the last bit and press your tongue to the warm surface. It was surprisingly soft, contradicting it's rougher appearance. You slowly dragged your tongue up a small distance on her paw. The taste of grime and sweat entered your mouth, but was fully intensified when you closed your mouth. Above her toes wiggle a bit, it probably tickled. You mustered up the courage to place your tongue back on the pungent surface. Again pulling your tongue over the wide expanse of her leathery, musky pawpad. You gag on the taste of her foot. It tastes of sweat and who knows what else. Several times, pieces of her fur come off in your mouth, and you quickly brush it off your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you had only been working on the ball of her right footpaw, you still had so much to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move down to the pads of her foot, licking the black, soft flesh. Belladonna stifles a giggle as you continue. She must be ticklish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move back up and begin licking her claws. They taste a little less unpleasant than the rest of her foot. You cut your tongue on the tip of one of them and put your hand over your mouth to keep from yelling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty straight minutes of licking one foot,  Belladonna tugged her foot out of the cage, and you try getting out as she does, only for her to quickly shove her other foot inside and pushed you back into the corner you were in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna laughed, seeing your  failed attempt. \"Uh, uh, uh, Wade.\" she cooed, wagging a finger at you, like a naughty child, \"Unlike Demona, <i>I</i> haven't forgotten who I'm dealing with, you have the record for the most escape attempts from Under Gloom for a reason! I'm NEVER letting you get even the slightest chance to get away from me...face it: From now on, right now, until you die naturally...YOU'RE MINE! ALL MINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing at that, as well as what you now had to repeat with her still-dirty foot, you move to her foot paw, and do the same. When you were finished, your mouth was as dry as a desert and the taste was foul as you tried vainly to spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna noticed this and giggled \"Aww...my sexy little pet toy want something to drink?\" she snicked before standing up and walking to the kitchen and came back a few moments later with an eyedropper full of something. Whatever it is, you don't care. you just want the taste of  Belladonna's paw pads out of your mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sticks the dropper through the bars and laughs as you wrap your mouth around the end and start chugging the dark red, fruity liquid. Finally you pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh...you were really thirsty, weren't you, my little Wade?\" the manticore said, impressed. Half the liquid in the dropper was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that stuff? It tastes...familiar, but there's something weird about it.\" you ask, whipping your mouth with the back of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna giggles \"Ho...nothing in particular. Just cranberry juice spiked with diuretic!\" she said, a triumphant, hungry, and smug smile on her huge face, showing her three rows of fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranberry juice and that diuretic drug used for encouraging...urine...flo...OH SHIT! You grabbed your crotch as you suddenly felt like an over-full water balloon. Damnit! Belladonna tricked you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe howled with laughter at your expense.  \"Awww...poor Wade! Don't you worry, my sexy little toy, I know JUST where to put all that!\" Belladonna said, then reached into your cage and grabbed you, bringing you to her still smirking face \"TO MY BEDROOM!\" she announced happily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>SERIOUSLY, JUST HOW BADLY  DID YOU TURN THIS MANTICORE ON BEFORE?!</b></font></span></div></div>",

All this time you were begging for Destiny to come and save you as you sat in your cage. You just keep moaning as lay with a sore crotch on one of the pairs of panties that Belladonna tossed onto your cage. You smell yourself and you positively wreak. You smell like a manticore's butt and for good reason, that was Belladonna's favorite way of torturing you. Your eyes are even watering because you're sure some of her venom leaked out and got into them. You actually wish Destiny were here to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're moaning in pain, you hear a banging on the cage and scream as you get up. You then see Belladonna's face smiling down on you. You had seen those three sets of teeth grinning down on you one too many times since you came here. \"Wakey-wakey Wadey,\" she' says. \"Today's the day.\" You wonder what she's talking about and then you realize that she meant the family reunion. \"Oh no.\" You say. \"Oh yes.\" Says Belladonna.\" You try to run but Belladonna snatches you up and then tosses you into her mouth before swishing you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell as she pushes her tongue all around you and tongue bathes you. Since she was a manticore and therefore a cat, her tongue is like sandpaper and you scream with every licking as she purrs and then spits you out into her hand shivering. \"Gotta make sure you're all squeaky clean to meet the family.\" You groan before Belladonna places you into her cleavage. You squirm to try and break free, but the crazy manticore pushes her breasts together to squeeze you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna laughs at her and then walks out before she gets into her car. You cry in her cleavage because now you're going to meet with her family. And from what Belladonna said, her mother was going to push her and you down the aisle. This was so not looking good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Belladonna reaches a residence where there are tons of manticores waiting for her. They were mostly female, which made sense given that manticores were basically lions. You were shaking in fear as Belladonna pulled her car into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna gets up and walks out as you stay in between her breasts and groan. \"Please Destiny,\" you mutter. \"Help me. If I get out of this, I swear I'll never call you Demona again.\" But your cries fall on deaf ears as Belladonna walks out, all around you see all kinds of manticores. Some of them even have wings while others have horns. There were some cubs even playing with each other in the way lion cubs do. You begin to shake. You really hope that Belladonna came keep her relatives from eating you alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the manticores walks forward, another female, slightly taller than Belladonna and somewhat obese. She was a crimson red skinned manticore with purple hair and for clothing she was wearing a red jacket with a black shirt and blue jeans. The red manticore looks at Belladonna and smiles. \"Belladonna!\" she yells as she squeezes the smaller manticore rather tightly, unknowingly causing you pain. \"I haven't seen you in weeks little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna lets out a grunt before her sister lets go of you. \"Astrid,\" says Belladonna. \"You're as emotional as ever. Is Mom already here?\" Astrid nods her head before she sees you panting in her sister's breasts. She bends over and you get a good look at her shark like teeth before she strokes her own head with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this Belladonna?\" she asks. Belladonna gives an evil smirk as you shiver. \"Wade, meet my older sister from Horrorville, Astrid Solanaceae. Astrid, this is my new boyfriend Wade.\" \"How did I get myself into this mess?\" you think to yourself. Predictably Astrid raises an eyebrow. \"You... dating a human?\" Well, it wasn't so much dating as it was sexual abuse, but you're too scared to speak. Belladonna just crosses her arms. \"You're one to talk, what about that human mate of yours? Where is Ashley anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid grits her teeth slightly. \"I left Ashley in Chel's care when I left for the reunion. It's way too dangerous for a human here.\" Oh no, Astrid had a human wife? Or husband, given that Ashley used to be a boy's name. This was not looking good for you. Belladonna just lets out a laugh.  \"Yeah. Kinda risky. I hear that bitch of a landlady of yours doesn't even know you're keeping a human behind her back.\" \"By the way Belladonna,\" says Astrid. \"Where did you meet Wade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're <i>really</i> nervous about Belladonna telling her sister something like that. \"Well,\" said Belladonna as she scratches your chin mockingly. \"I picked him up at work.\" Astrid is slightly confused but then she puts two and two together and gasped. \"He's an inmate?\" she asks. \"You snuck a criminal out of Under Gloom? Destiny is going to kill you.\" \"I won't tell if you won't,\" says Belladonna smugly. \"That ambition of yours is dangerous little sister,\" says Astrid. \"But at least you've found a use for humans other than food. I can hear wedding bells already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan and try to shake free, but you're stuck too tight. And you've only met one of Belladonna's relatives. Not good. You'd rather be taking your chances with Cree right now.</span></div></div>",

My mom is a little...\" Belladonna said. The way she left it hanging didn't make you feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirrors and candles filled every available space. You couldn't look anywhere without seeing your own reflection. Above the mantel, a little bronze scorpion flew around the second hand of a ticking clock.  Stacked on the nightstand were hundreds-and you mean hundreds-of Tupperware boxes with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches inside. The ones on the bottom were green and fuzzy, like they'd been there for a long time. On top of the dresser was a stack of cookie sheets. Each one had a dozen burned cookies on it. In the corners of the room was a mountain of empty plastic Kool-Aid pitchers. Taped all around the window, were dozens of little pictures cut from magazines and newspaper ads-pictures of Hermes from the FTD Flowers logo and Quickie Cleaners, pictures of the caduceus from medical ads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the middle of the room, in a rocking chair, sat another member of Belladonna's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis manticore was as thin as a scarecrow and looked like someone who enjoyed sticking her fingers in electrical sockets. Her white hair stuck out in tufts all over her head. Her pink housedress was covered in scorch marks and smears of ash. When she smiled, her face looked unnaturally stretched, and the high-voltage light in her eyes and the way her gaze seemed fractured-like she was trying to focus through a kaleidoscope-made you wonder if she was blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belladonna!\"  the woman cried, bolting upright and zooming over to her, she squeezed the smaller manticore rather tightly, unknowingly causing you pain as she crushed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mom.\" Belladonna said and the other manticore released her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom? This was Belladonna's mon?! Looking at her, you swallow any comments you had, no wonder you captoress was so nervous. But looking at her, you seemed to be able to sense that it wasn't her fault.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...I met someone that I like. It was part of why I came here.\" Belladonna said, trying to avoid looking at her mother, her voice cracking. As if it would shatter her will to live if she met her mother's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Ms. Solanaceae cried in delight, clapping her hands in front of herself and beaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, would you like to meet them? I brought him with me so he could meet you and the rest of the family.\" Belladonna said, plucking you from her breasts. Holding you up to her mother's face \"Mom...meet Wade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother beamed and you saw a third of her teeth were broken. You plaster an awkward smile on your face and wave at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Human? Well, to each their own, right, Bell! I'm happy for you! Ho, he's lovely! Now off you go to mengal! I'll get a church on the phone in the meantime! No later than tomorrow!\" Ms. Solanaceae cries happily, a spark seems to come back to her and she even looks slightly less crazy. She ushered Belladonna out of her room and grabs a phone and starts hammering numbers to make a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWha..?! No later than tomorrow?! Sheesh! Belladonna and her sister Astrid really weren't kidding about being rushed down the alter! You didn't want to marry a monster! Why'd you try escaping jail again?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're snapped out of your thoughts as Belladonna runs a clawed finger down your back, stroking you.  You turn to see  Belladonna's face frowning down on you with a troubled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking Wade. Suggest you don't. My mom wasn't always that way.\" Belladonna said sadly \"She was a good person, but she was mugged. Nightmare. Beast who can alter appearance to their will and shatter minds. Broke something in her and she's been a bit...off, ever since. She only seems to get her old self back when she gets news like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you became a cop and got a job at Under Gloom to keep it from happening to anyone else?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she brightened. \"I'm glad she likes you. And trust me, you're safer that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafer?! If that was the case, you didn't want to know if she disapproved of you! Especially here! As Belladonna carried you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe other members of her family all caught your scent or something, because they all looked at you...some of them licking their chops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Belladonna, brought a snack huh?\" one of the males, you didn't know if he was a cousin, uncle or what, said, eyeing you. Fortunately Astrid smacked him upside the head with her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason! He's NOT food! Belladonna had him meet your aunt!\" Astrid snapped, she looked downright murderous at the idea of a human being eaten. Ok, a human-lover...those kinds of monsters you could stand. They left you alone if you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nat the bomb dropped by Belladonna's sister, the other manticores in the room all stared at you, eyes wide and started muttering among themselves, the females giggling occasionally.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wait...but that means...\" Jason said, then turned to Astrid \"You got her to convert?!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"As if!\" Belladonna snapped at him \"This one's a unique case, is all! No way am I giving up meat...Wade here's an exception to that is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other members of her family nodded, and you paled. Belladonna was still gonna be a human-eater!? But she wasn't going to eat you?! Then again...between being married to or being eaten by her, you were beginning to wish she'd just eat you! </span></div></div>",

Ms. Solanaceae was <i>very</i> insistent you marry Belladonna and hear you were in a tux in a waiting room with Ms. Solanaceae who seemed to be twitching. You take a good look at her broken teeth and are utterly terrified. \"Don't be afraid,\" says the elder manticore as one of her eyes spins around. \"I know you're joining a family of predators but I have experience with a human in-laws. Take Ashley, Astrid's husband... or wife... I can never remember the gender... but you'll meet him or her... pity Astrid had to leave him... or her... in Horrorville. Guess that's the trouble with being from a family of giant poisonous lions.\" That didn't make you feel any better. \"How did I get into this mess?\" you ask yourself. Ms. Solanaceae leaves the room to check on the bride as you groan. Astrid looks at you nervously but then shrugs her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish the best of luck to you.\" \"Bite me!\" you yell in response. Astrid lets out a sarcastic laugh. \"That's the last thing you should ask a manticore to do.\" You slap yourself in the face and then shake your head. \"You know,\" says Astrid. \"Something tells me you're not going to be a very good brother-in-law, so I'm just gonna let the best lady escort you to the alter.\" You roll your eyes. \"Best lady?\" you ask to yourself. \"I wonder who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't this a surprise?\" asks a familiar voice. You gasp and turn around to see Destiny in a red dress looking down at you with a smirk. \"Destiny!\" you yell in surprise. \"So that's how you managed to escape,\" says Destiny. \"I should'e known. That double-crosser. But remarkably, I'm not mad. Sure the governor chewed me out and one more slight like that will more than likely cost me my job, but I can live with that if it means watching you squirm. You two deserve each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny,\" you beg. \"Please take me back to Under Gloom. I'll serve my sentence without complaint. I'll even stop calling you 'Demona'. Please! Get me out of this!\" Destiny just smiles wickedly and shows her fangs. \"Oh no. This is much better punishment than prison. If anyone deserves to be saddled with Belladonna, it's definitely you.\" As Destiny is laughing, you begin to break down and cry. This was really it, you were going to be married to a monster. Being eaten would've been preferable to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could run, Destiny snatches you up. \"Well,\" she says. \"No point in delaying the inevitable.\" \"Cree!\" you shout. \"Help me! Clover!\" You were so desperate now that you were calling for a predator to chomp you. But soon, Destiny has you waiting for Belladonna and organ music plays as Belladonna walks forward in a white bridal outfit, her mother smiling, though the other manticores are all staring at you. This was not looking good as Belladonna finally reached you and smiled. You mentally scream as you look up at the dark elf preacher. \"Dearly beloved,\" he says. \"We gather here to unite this manticore and this... human... in holy matrimony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the preacher is speaking, you look for any way out but there's no way you're getting out of this. On your side of the church, you see Destiny brought guests as well. Cree was there in a black dress with her were jackal wife Aurelia with her. Like Destiny, Cree seemed to find your predicament hilarious. Clover was there and half asleep as she held the chain holding your roommate Lockette and Bebe, the Cheshire cat girl. Bebe was crying uncontrollably given that she was the one who wanted you and now somebody else was marrying you. You have to wonder why Destiny brought those two in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's you hear \"I do\" from Belladonna and gasp. Oh no. The preacher turns to you. \"And do you Wade Wilson, take Belladonna to be your wife.\" This was bad. If you backed out now you'd have a mob on your back. You turn to see Destiny with an evil smirk right before she waves at you and realize you have no choice. \"I do.\" The preacher nods his head. \"I now pronounce you... man and wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were definitely better off in Under Gloom.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't believe it. Three years ago in a botched escape attempt from Under Gloom, you wound up being married to the vice warden. To say Belladonna had henpecked you since then would be a gross understatement. You were practically her slave. Your sense of smell has been numbed from years of massaging your manticore wife's feet and your stomach was burning from years of monster food. It didn't help that Belladonna wasn't exactly the best cook. But the worst part would be her raping you every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you could get a way out of this but unfortunately, Mrs. Solanaceae, that is to say, Buttercup, now your mother-in-law, informed you that manticores mate for life and females don't have more than one mate in their entire lifetime. You were screwed both metaphorically and literally. What's worse is that whenever you even tried to get in line, you are reminded that Belladonna still has that iron cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. Going back to Under Gloom would be better than this. You wonder how that old bat Destiny was doing. No matter how she was doing, Belladonna was still the vice-warden. One day she'd becoming the main warden and when that day came, you'd really be in for some bossing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, you heard the front door open and your... ugh... your wife walked in as chipper as can be. \"Wadey,\" she calls out. \"I'm ho-ome.\" \"Thanks for the warning.\" You think to yourself. You look up from atop the coffee table just as Belladonna smiles down on you and shows you her hundreds of sharp teeth. You're utterly terrified. Every time she smiled like that it meant there would be painful consequences for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some wonderful news, Wade,\" says your manticore wife. \"Very wonderful news.\" \"Y-You f-finally b-became warden?\" you ask. Normally you'd be shooting your mouth off but after years of violent domestic discipline have destroyed whatever backbone you had towards the titanesses that you now realized ruled over your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna just lets out a giggle that freezes you to the core. \"Even better.\" She says. Belladonna grabs you screaming and then she pushes you to her belly when you realize just what she was talking about and gasp. \"Y-y-you don't mean...\" You say in fear. Belladonna nods her head and flashes her teeth. \"That's right, sugar. I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally screamed. If there was one thing you hated as much as monsters it was children and now you were expecting both of them at the same time. It was official. The moment you were press-ganged into marrying Belladonna, you walked barefoot into hell.</span></div></div>",

How is that even possible! Why didn't any of the guards see him! I was so ashamed I was tempted to resign then and there. The only thing stopping me is that Governor Liza threatened to fire me if this happened again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny is so angry that she scratches the top of her desk with her sharp claws and grits her fangs as her eyes glow red. \"Well played Wade,\" she says. \"Looks like you finally got the drop on 'Demona'. But if you think you're enjoying your freedom, well WHOOP DEE DOO! You're not out of the woods yet. I know your kind, you CAN'T stay out of prison long. Especially when I'm in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny reaches for her phone and begins to dial as she lets out a hiss. \"I can't believe I'm doing this. Me, reduced to hiring a lowly bounty hunter to deal with the most loudmouthed, obnoxious, insignificant little bug that society has cast out. And they don't come any lower than Bona Fete.\" Destiny dials the phone and elsewhere there is a rundown looking house that looked like it was the home of a thug. There was even a skull shaped doorknob and jagged metal littering the lawn. There was also a motorcycle in the driveway that had screaming souls painted on it with a grim reaper shaped hood ornament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house was Bona Fete, a 950ft gray skinned gargoyle chick with bulging muscles bearing tattoos of all the monster criminals she's ever killed. She had black hair and wore a shirt bearing the Punisher logo on it. She was busy drinking a beer as her pet Fenrir, a giant carnivorous feral wolf, was chewing on what looked like a large dinosaur bone. The phone rings and the Fenrir growls. \"Easy Ripper,\" says Bona as she reaches for the phone. \"Hello. Bona Fete, who do you want me to slaughter.\" Bona belches slightly into the phone before Destiny speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father may have been worthless,\" Destiny says. \"But at least your mother could've sent you to charm school.\" Bona cracks a smirk and shows her fangs. \"Well, well, if it isn't Ms. High and Mighty Warden of Under Gloom. What's shaking Demona? And how's my half-sister doing.\" Destiny is annoyed as she continues speaking. \"Don't you dare call me that horrible word and don't you dare compare yourself to my Fate. Listen Bona, I hate you and you don't really like me much, so I'll cut right to the chase. As much as I hate to admit it...\" Destiny bites her lips before she continues but Bona laughs as she gets the gist of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean somebody finally snuck out from under your big blue nose? Man Destiny, you're slipping in your old age.\" Destiny slams her fist on her desk and makes it crack slightly before continuing. \"Do NOT patronize me bounty hunter! Your target is a human escapee called Wade Wilson. He's been the bane of my existence since he came to Under Gloom and tried to escape even more times than any of the Dark Siders. He finally got out and I want you to get him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona Fete finishes her beer and scoffs. \"You're sending <i>me</i> after a <i>human</i>? Overkill much.\" \"This is no mere human. Whatever you do, bring him back alive. If anyone is going to clobber him, it will be me.\" Bona nods her head and tosses her beer bottle into the air before shooting it with a handgun and blowing it to bits. Ripper even catches one of the pieces to chew it up as he growls. \"I love this job.\" Says Bona with a smirk as she sharpens a knife with a claw.</span></div></div>",

I'm neutral when it comes to humans, though I have stepped on them before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipper growls right as Bona opens the front door of her house. There is an overgrown pterodactyl flying in the air and as Bona notices her fenrir drooling, she gives a smirk and then shoots down the pterodactyl before Ripper growls and catches the flying reptile in the air before greedily devouring it. \"Ripper just loves fresh cooked pterodactyl.\" Says Bona as she puts her gun away and lets out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle giantess then heads to Under Gloom to speak with Destiny who is giving her a sour look. Destiny gives Bona a glare as Bona looks up and smirks at her. \"I loathe you,\" says Destiny. \"Of all bounty hunters, you are the absolutely most primeval proof against evolution that has ever poisoned my eyes. Your father was complete and utter SCUM! If he were here right now, I'd wring his neck and make him eat his own liver.\" \"Yummy,\" says Bona sarcastically. \"Listen here, Demona, I'm not the one the governor chewed out earlier for letting this pest get out from under your nose, that pest that might I add, you hired me to exterminate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny makes her eyes glow red as she looks down at Bona and this provokes Ripper to growl at your gargoyle nemesis and even try to bite her. \"There's an amazing new invention called a leash, Bona,\" says Destiny. \"You and that improperly trained fenrir. Why do you even keep that stupid mutt around!\" Ripper just gives a growl before Bona strokes him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Ripper is good at two things; killing and tracking. Now, all he needs is one of Wade's personal belongings.\" Destiny grunts and tosses one of your prison jumpsuits for Bona to catch. Bona holds the jumpsuit right in front of Ripper's nose as he growled. \"You have the scent?\" asks Destiny. \"Oh,\" says Bona. \"Don't worry. You'll get Wade back. As long as I get my two thousand skulls.\" \"Two thousand skulls!?\" yells Destiny. \"That's outrageous!\" Bona lets out a laugh. \"Outrageous? I'm giving you a discount since the prey is human.

Hiring me, or knowing that you let this lowlife get away?\" Destiny lets out a growl and soon Bona and Ripper are off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Belladonna's place, you're screaming and Belladonna is laughing mercilessly as she teabags your body in bed. \"Come on, Wade, scream until I get tired.\" Belladonna laughs and you scream as she rubs you against her armpit. She moans in pure pleasure right before she uses you on the other armpit. It was official, all you did was trade one prison for the other and Belladonna then started to pull her underwear down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her oversized ass underneath her scorpion tail and it's clear what she's going to do to you. \"No!\" you yell. \"Please, don't!\" Belladonna is about to shove you up her ass when there's a knock at the door.\" Belladonna grunts and holds you down as you sigh in relief. \"Thank goodness.\" You say.

She then looks up and sees Bona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belladonna,\" says Bona. \"It's been a month since I saw you.\" \"Bona,\" says Belladonna. \"I... I wasn't expecting company.\" That's when you freeze in fear as Belladonna holds you. \"Bona Fete?\" you ask yourself. \"Destiny hired a bounty hunter? Oh crap.\" Bona and her pet walk in as Ripper sniffs around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mind me, Belladonna,\" says the gargoyle bounty hunter as her tail swings back and forth and you look at her muscles. \"I'm here on business.\" You look up at Bona's tattoos and see that the monsters she killed included among others, a gorgon, a bahamut, a sphinx, an argus, a minotaur and even a bandersnatch. \"In fact, there's somebody I'm looking for.\" \"Uh-oh.\" mutter both you and Belladonna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipper sniffs around Belladonna and growls. He would've bitten the manticore but Bona stopped him. \"Ripper, no, Belladonna's a friend.\" You're gasping in fear and then Bona looks down and sees you. \"Ooh, but he isn't.\" You let out a scream as Bona takes out a gun. But then Bona realizes something and smirks at Belladonna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you sneaky cat.

At one point, Belladonna's tail tip even cuts off most of your hair as you scream. Bona laughs wickedly and then slams her tail in front of her butt cheeks as you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's make it interesting, Belladonna.\" Says Bona as she shows her gargoyle fangs.\" Belladonna lets out a purr. \"What exactly did you have in mind?\" she asks. Bona gives an evil laugh as she holds her wings up in the air. \"Tail tug of war. Winner gets to shove Wade up her ass for two whole hours.\" You mentally gulp. What did you ever do to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" says Belladonna as she shows her three sets of hundreds of teeth. \"Sounds good.\" Belladonna then wraps her tail around you and you scream as both she and Belladonna pull on you. If it's not the manticore vice warden, it's the gargoyle bounty hunter. No matter who wins, you'll be seeing a monster's behind from the inside. To make matters worse, Belladonna's poisonous tail is dangerously close to your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who wins the tail tug of war?</span></div></div>",

The girl just lets out a laugh. \"My, aren't we a grumpy puss.\" \"Of course I'm grumpy you painted bitch,\" you say. \"I'm in freakin' jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah,\" says the girl. \"Is that any way to treat the woman who is going to break you out of here. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Kltpzyxm.\" \"Kwiplethim?\" asks Lockette. Then Kltpzyxm appears in a puff on Lockette's face. \"No. Kill...\" As she said that she turned her outfit into a Kill Bill style outfit. \"Tip.\" She then flicked a quarter into Lockette's forehead. \"See!\" She turned her eye into a giant eyeball. \"Zim!\" Finally she made her face look like that of Invader Zim and then finally Kltpzyxm turned back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you want?\" you ask. Kltpzyxm let out a laugh. \"I'm from the tenth dimension and I've been watching your quarrels with that Destiny woman. I love it when you make her all mad. She's funny.\" \"Oh,\" you say sarcastically. \"She's real funny alright.\" \"Which brings me to a proposition,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"I have power to control reality itself. I can gaslight her for you, make her see what nobody else does and the governor will think she's flipped her tiara and gone bananas and then Big Mama Smurf will find herself committed. They wouldn't let somebody with mental problems run this place would they? I can make your big problem disappear, just like that. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to think about it, if Kltpzyxm was able to drive Destiny insane, you'd be rid of her for good.

Not enough to kill you, but just enough to leave you completely paralyzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Destiny lays you out on your cot, and you scream a string of curses at her that would make a sailor blush inside your head, Destiny says to herself \"Ah, silence. Maybe I'll have him poisoned everyday for the rest of his sentence. That should keep him from escaping again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visit from the governor goes off without a hitch, and you spend all night staring at the ceiling, unable to move, imagining ways to get back at that blue bitch, and her freak vice warden. It's not until the next morning that you regain the feeling in your limbs and torso, and can move again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, just as you're getting up off your cot, Aria, one of the guards, approaches your cell and announces \"Wade Wilson , your bail has been paid. You're free to go.\" Needless to say, this left you in a mix of joy and confusion. Joy, because you were finally getting out of this godforsaken place, and confusion because who the hell would pay your bail? You have no living family, and your criminal buddies certainly don't have that kind of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you are escorted to the reception area of the prison, where a human man dressed in a black suit and glasses is waiting for you.

You are lead to a black van waiting out front and are seated in the back with the man sitting  across from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes you endure the silent ride down the mountain before finally asking \"So, just who the hell are you guys anyway?\" \" The man In the suit smirks \"You may call me Mr. Black.

Tell me, Mr. Wilson, did you ever read comic books as a kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f*** does that have to do with anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just kind of ironic that your name is Wade Wilson, the same name as a certain comic book character. You see, the character in question gained his superhuman abilities through scientific experiments. Which is exactly what we're offering you. A little bit of surgery, and we can make you indestructible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, you got me out of jail just to be your lab rat!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We prefer to see it as giving you new lease on life. We've seen your record, Mr. Wilson. Burglary, grand theft auto, assault, and most recently, arson. This is your chance to do something better with your life, to do something for not just your country, but for your whole species.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really. Our organization sees all of monster-kind as a threat to humanity's very existence. What we need is a subject who despises them on such a level, he would have no problems with wiping them off the planet. Judging by what we know of you, I'd say you fit the bill perfectly. Accept our offer, and not only will you be doing the human race a great service, but you will gain abilities beyond the dreams of mortals.

No human that ventured into their territory had ever come out because the creatures here were all predatory beasts that wouldn't think twice about eating tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you reach Dark Side, you feel tremors from footsteps but they're unusually strong even for a monster's vibrations.

But they didn't call this place the 'dark side' for no reason. It was <i>really</i> dark...the windows were so heavily locked up that tiny streams of light about your size flowed into the cells, not nearly enough light to really see the place. You shudder as you imagine what it's like here at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that leaving is probably the best option, you start making your way towards the giant cell bars when a sudden \"CLACK\" sound fills your ears, and you freeze. You hear a yawn, followed by even more clacking sounds. You didn't dare move. You didn't know anything about this inmate. What if they had hyper sensitive hearing, and would hear you making a break for it? Or if they'd see your small form running amidst the darkness? The only movement you dared to make was to turn around and get a good look at the inmate, and can't help but gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding far too close for comfort were the gigantic hooves of Mariah, the Quagga rapist who you really wished you weren't going to see today. Her entire lower body was identical to a zebra's, from the patterns on its fur to the tail swishing back and forth. Peering upwards even higher, at around neck level for an ordinary quagga, stood the upper body of a woman...and an unpleasant sight at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no modesty of any kind, wearing no prison uniform to speak of, although that could be attributed to her lower body making it difficult to fit into the single-piece prison uniforms. Her body was...graciously endowed, so to speak, but that really didn't matter, since you really didn't want to be near her either way. Her face was unpleasant and garish looking, but you couldn't tell if it was always like that or the scars on her face attributed to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you were done looking, you'd seen more than enough. Slowly, so as to not get her attention, you begin to tip toe away from her, towards the cell doors...before screaming as her giant, pudgy fingers wrapped around you, easily snatching you up before you ever had a chance. She brings you up to her face, and a toothy grin crawls across it, making you shudder. \"Awfully brave for a human, aren'tchu, little guy?\" she says in a mocking tone. Gulping, you try to speak. \"This is all a big mistake, miss... Mariah, ma'am. I was just walking down this hallway, and I wandered in by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? You <i>accidentally</i> walked into jail cell of Fearville's most feared rapist? Sounds to me like you came here for a reason...\" she said, her voice trailing off. She clearly had the wrong idea. \"...okay, fine, I didn't wander in. I was hiding from Destiny because I'm kind of breaking out of prison right now, so I really need to get going, so if you could just put me down...\" \"Ha! Oh, please, if only it were that easy, pipsqueak. No, I don't want you to leave... I've been alone for so long. You're the first male human to wander in here on his own in a long, long time, and you really think I'm just going to just... let you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Mariah clearly wasn't going to let you go just because you asked her to. And considering the reason she was imprisoned, you still need to get out of there. Mariah looks at you expectantly, like she's expecting you to say something before she does...whatever she's going to do with you. Thinking for a few moments, you suddenly get an idea. \"Mariah, what would you say if I told you that I could get you out of here? Open your cell, so you can escape?\" \"You? You think you can get me out?\" she said, her voice full of uncertainty. \"I know it sounds crazy, but I know people. If you let me go, I can escape, get them, and we'll come back for. What do you say? An arm for an arm?\" Of course, you weren't really going to come back for a terrifying rapist, that was just a ploy to get her to let you go. But you weren't going to tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Centauress actually stopped for a moment, considering your offer. As much as she probably wanted to...well, use you, being set free is probably a much stronger desire in her. That is, if you're to be believed.

She drops you as she leaps at the stranger. You hit the ground and sit there trying to ease your aching body. You hear the sounds of snarling and biting and look over at Perspehone. The scene in front of you shocks you, and you find yourself simply staring as the werewolf devours her prey. She silenced the other monster before she could even make a sound, and now she was going to town on her. You don't know what kind of monster it was, but you see some feathers floating to the ground. Must have been a harpy or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember your situation and decide to get the hell out of here while this giant cannibal is busy. Unfortunately you waited too long and Persephone notices you trying to escape. She picks you up as you're making your getaway. \"Well that was unexpected.\" she says with a smirk. \"Didn't think I'd get a good meal so soon. I like cooked food better but raw is good too.\" She picks her teeth and brings you to her mouth. \"Luckily for you I'm pretty full right now. Don't worry though, I'll save you for later.\" Persephone knows you have no reason to stick around so she slips you into her jumpsuit to make sure you stay put. You tumble down to her breasts as she begins to move. She's headed somewhere to lay low, but where?</span></div></div>",

Thats what you assume, since she stopped and you heard an engine. You somehow manage to stay alive, as Persephone attacks and eats some monsters on the way, which sates her hunger You have to admit that it wasn't uncomfortable, although the softness of her fur and breasts is overshadowed by the fact that she's a monster. You need to get out of here and get far away. Suddenly you feel your new prison stop. \"Ahhh, Horrorville. Its been a while.\" Persephone says after taking a breath of the night air. She brought you all the way out to Horrorville?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone moves once again and you hear various doors opening.You hear her walk into a room and switch on a light. She reaches into the jumpsuit and pulls you out. When your eyes adjust to the sudden light you find yourself face to face with the white wolfess. You give an involuntary jump and she laughs. \"Scared, human?\" You glare at her. \"Not of some overgrown mutt!\" you reply. Persephone brings you closer so you can see her deadly teeth. \"I'd watch it if I were you. You're still on the menu.\" She then walks over to a small cage on a shelf and throws you inside. You pick yourself and see that this cage is small enough for someone like you. Guess you're not the first human this beast decided to save for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and take in your surroundings. There are bones littered around, which makes sense considering who lives here. On the walls you see various paintings, which doesn't seem right. Persephone didn't seem an art thief, that was more Bebe's thing. Thats when you spot an easel and various painting supplies. This monster is an artist? Go figure. On another shelf you can see a picture of a pair of werewolf cubs. One was white, who you assume is Persephone, and the other is black. They look pretty happy. Just goes to show that even the innocent looking ones become vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by your captor. \"Well this is my humble home. Well, its more of a safe house really.\" she says to you.\"You're in luck human, I've decided not to eat you.\" you find this hard to believe. \"Instead I'm going to give you to my cousin Lupa. Its been a while since I've seen her, so I'll give her a tasty human as a gift. I don't mind sharing, I like monsters better anyway.\" Great. She's going to give you to another werewolf. What happens next?    </span></div></div>",

You finally escaped Under Gloom, but are now being held prisoner by a murderous cannibal monster. Whats more, she plans to give you to another monster as a snack. As much as you hate to admit it, your stuck. This cage was built for humans, so there's no way you can slip out like you did in prison. All you can do is get some sleep and wait for a chance to escape later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone awakes later and gives a satisfied yawn. \"That was the best night's sleep I've had in ages!\" She gets up and walks over to your cage. She's grins as she watches you sleep and gives the cage a shake. You are woken up up and thrown around by the werewolf's wake up call. Persephone removes you from the cage and smiles at you fiendishly. \"Sleep well?\" You just look away. She is clearly amused at your plight. \"Well get ready to meet my cousin, or more accurately, her stomach.\" You look into her red eyes. \"So what? You're going to give her a snack before you make her your meal?\" Persephone brings you in close and growls. \"Watch your mouth! I may eat other monsters but I would never eat a member of my own family!\" So she's got a conscience now? Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone heads outside with you once again between her breasts. She swapped her jumpsuit for some clothes she had at the safe house. Now she's wearing a pair of black jeans and a black shirt. In addition she's got a black jacket, as well as a hat and a pair of sunglasses. She doesn't want anyone to recognize her, so she's trying to keep herself covered. You're also tightly under wraps, and all you can do is climb up for a peek before you're forced back down. She heads to a corner and stakes out an apartment building for what seems like twenty minutes. Eventually a brown furred werewolf girl comes out and Persephone quickly approaches her from behind. When she's close enough she puts her arm around her. \"Hey cuz. Been a while huh?\" she says. The other girl jumps and looks over. She squints her eyes before they go wide. \"Persephone?!\" she exclaims. Persephone hushes her. \"Watch the volume. I don't exactly want to get noticed. I just want to spend some time with you Lupa, its been too long.\" Lupa looks kind of nervous and she bites her lip. Then she spots you crawling up from the shirt. \"Is that a human?\" Persephone smiles and pushes you back down. \"Yup, its just a little gift. I really want to hang out a little. We're family ya know?\" Lupa still hesitates. What does she do? </span></div></div>",

You hold on tight to Persephone's shirt as both werewolf cousins walk into the building. \"Get in quick.\" She says. Persephone smiles and follows her cousin. Inside the lobby, a giantess gorgon with black cobras for hair was reading the newspaper that already mentioned Persephone's escape while a purple skinned gremlin giantess was barricading all the windows. Apparently Persephone's infamy reached all the way to Horrorville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lupa walks towards her apartment, a banshee giantess flies down the hall and Persephone pulls her hat over her head. \"Lupa?\" asks the banshee. \"Who is that woman?\" \"Uh,\" says Lupa. \"She's my cousin. I have so many you know. She's come all the way from, uh... Panicburg and she's real tired. Can't talk right now. Bye, bye Mavis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banshee giantess flies through the door to her own apartment as the wolf cousins walk away with you clinging to Persephone. \"I never did like banshees,\" says Persephone. \"You can't even eat 'em.\" Lupa unlocks the door to her apartment and then she grabs Persephone and both of them rush inside. Lupa's apartment is pink as far as the eye can see, with photographs of monster supermodels on the wall. It absolutely disgusted you. There was even an open closet filled with all sorts of flashy clothes. Guess the fatty was a fashionista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Persephone hands you to Lupa and Lupa puts you in her pocket. \"Nice place you have here cuz. You must've been promoted. Mind if I take a look at your wardrobe? It's been ages since I've worn something other than a prison jumpsuit.\" \"Make yourself at home.\" Says Lupa. \"Just don't eat any of my neighbors. Well, maybe you can eat Patsy. I hate her.\" Lupa nervously pulls you out and the fat werewolf scratches your head nervously making you grunt from her claws. You're really starting to hate this family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Says Persephone as she tries on a green jacket. \"By the way, you still friends with that dummy mummy?\" Another mummy? If there's anything you hate more than werewolves it's mummies. Especially that mummy that got you into prison. It's as if that species lived to make people miserable. Lupa then places you in a jar with airholes in and seals it tight. \"Not again!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you eating Wade yet?\" asks Persephone. \"I'm not hungry.\" Says Lupa nervously. You find that hard to believe given her massive girth. Then again, Lupa actually looked afraid of her cousin. Persephone lets out a laugh. \"YOU not hungry. Lupa, you can't walk past a human without eating it. Remember that time you won that human eating contest 30 years ago?\" Lupa gives a nervous laugh. 30 years ago? Well, apparently monsters age slower than humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had to get away from both these wolves. But how? It would take a miracle to save you.</span></div></div>",

Oh please don't be Petra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Who the hell is Petra?\" you wonder to yourself. That's when you realize something. That sounds like the name of an Earth element monster. It could be a gargoyle like Destiny. For obvious reasons, gargoyles were not your favorite species of monster. But why is Lupa so afraid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone cracks the closet door open and stares slightly as Lupa walks up to the front door and starts to nervously open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is... who's at the door?</span></div></div>",

Outside the front door is what appears to be an orange skinned gargoyle woman, hourglass shaped body wise and with long white hair reaching down to her tail. She appeared to be wearing a blue unitard and a red jacket. From her height, she was as big as Destiny given that she utterly dwarfed Lupa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa's eyes pop and she impulsively slams the door. \"Hey!\" yells the gargoyle chick on the other side. \"What was that for Lupa?\" Lupa gulps and realizes how stupid she was back there. You stick out your tongue. There's no way this girl would last in the mob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa realizes her mistake and opens the door again before nodding her head. \"I'm s-sorry Officer Maza, er I mean Petra... I mean!\" Petra looks down at Lupa in concern. \"Lupa, are you feeling okay?\" \"Uh, I'm feeling fine Petra. Thanks for asking, now go, on, out the door.\" Lupa lets out a nervous laugh. That's when your eyes pop. Lupa called that gargoyle \"officer\". There was a cop right in the building! Of all the rotten luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa is about to shove Petra out the door, but Petra walks inside. \"Lupa,\" says Petra. \"I hope you're not trying to hide anything. I may be off work but I won't tolerate any illegal activity in this building.\" \"Me?\" asked Lupa with a non-convincing laugh. \"Oh, nothing here. I'm just working on...\" Lupa spots a spider web print jacket on a nearby mannequin and holds it up in front of Petra. \"Like it?\" asks Lupa. \"Free of charge for gargoyles.\" In the closet, Persephone groans and rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a wolf, you're a terrible liar Lupa,\" mumbles the albino cannibal to herself. \"It had to be a gargoyle. Even I can't make a meal out of them. I'd break my teeth.\" You then realize that this might be your ticket out of here and bang your hands on the sides of the jar. Petra looks up and then spots you in your jar before she shakes her head. \"Poor little thing,\" she says. \"Lupa. You should be ashamed of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" says Lupa. \"It's not as if it's illegal for us monsters to eat humans. Get off my case. And preferably, get out of my apartment.\" But Petra walks up towards you in the jar. \"I'm a gargoyle Lupa,\" says Petra. \"Protecting helpless humans is in my instincts. Don't worry little guy, I'm gonna... wait a minute. Is that a prison jumpsuit? What the hell is going on here Lupa?\" Lupa is so scared, she can't say a word. It looks as though she doesn't have the nerve to rat out her cousin. Well, it looks like Petra might take you back to jail, but then you get a smirk and point to the closet. Persephone slams the door shut before Petra can see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Petra is now suspicious and rubs her chin. \"What are you hiding Lupa?\" she asks as she walks up to the closet. \"Crap!\" yells Lupa as she bites her nails. Lupa knows that Petra won't hesitate to arrest Persephone and it looks like that white wolf is going back to jail. Now hopefully you won't be in a room with two wolves who want to eat you.</span></div></div>",

She was wrapped up to her neck in gold covered gauze that looked tight on her huge ass and had black hair with gold highlights arranged in dreadlocks. The mummy girl was wearing gold earrings and appeared to have a sapphire anti-eyebrow under her left eye. \"Hello Lupa.\" The mummy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Lupa. \"Nefernina, what a pleasant surprise.\" \"Nefernina?\" you ask to yourself in your jar prison. \"That's the dumbest name I've ever heard. Looks more like a Cleofatra to me.\" Lupa gives a nervous smile that her mummy friend notices. \"Lupa?\" she asks. \"Is something wrong?\" Lupa looks back to see Persephone looking out of the closet door. \"Oh,\" says Lupa. \"Everything's fine. I mean, it's a wonderful day to be a monster.\" Lupa laughs nervously and you shake your head. She obviously didn't deal well with pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Nefernina noticed you. \"Well,\" says the mummy giantess. \"At least you're doing a good job with pest control.\" From the tone in her voice you could tell that Nefernina hated humans as much as you hated monsters. You stick out your tongue at Nefernina and she walks forward and looks in your jar when she notices something and turns to face Lupa who was nervously twisting her tail. \"Lupa?\" she asks. \"Why is this human wearing a prison uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" says Lupa stammering as Persephone moves further into the closet to avoid detection. \"Oh, that. I'm designing a new line of doll clothes and using my prey as mannequins. That's it.\" Nefernina actually believes that lie, but she looks down at you and rubs her chin with one hand and uses the other hand to rub her large butt. \"This human looks familiar,\" she says. \"If I didn't know better I'd say he looked like that Wade Wilson bug who set my goody two-shoes sister on fire.\" Your eyes popped. That mummy you burned was Nefernina's sister? What terrible luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly give Nefernina the bird to hide your face and she gives an angry glare before turning back to Lupa. \"Lupa,\" she says. \"Do me a favor and make sure you take your time eating this particular human. Make him suffer.\" Lupa nodded her head and Persephone gives her a thumbs up from the closet. \"Just out of curiosity,\" says Nefernina. \"Why haven't you eaten that human yet Lupa? You're not the type to save your prey for later.\" Lupa looks around and realizes she has to think of an excuse. \"Uh, I'm on a diet.\" You know that's an obvious lie. From the looks of her girth, Lupa obviously doesn't care about diets. Nefernina isn't fooled either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a fertilizer store, Lupa, so don't try selling me 15 hundred pounds of crap. No she-wolf in your family even knows what diet means. Lupa are you feeling okay?\" Lupa moved her eyes around and twitched her knees. \"She wouldn't last a day in the mob.\" You think to yourself. \"Uh,\" says Lupa changing the subject. \"What are you doing here anyway Nefernina? I already paid my rent.\" To Lupa's horror, Nefernina walks towards the closet where Persephone is hiding. \"I forgot my coat here the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you never had a coat to begin with?\" asked Lupa trying desperately to hide her criminal cousin. \"Coats are just a myth!\" Nefernina gives a confused look. \"Lupa?\" she asks. \"Have you been eating hippies again? I told you, there's bad stuff in them. You're acting like you're harboring a murderer.\" Nefernina reaches into the closet and in an attempt to avoid being detected, Persephone hands the mummy girl a light blue coat with gold highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Nefernina notice Persephone hiding in the closet?</span></div></div>",

Hopefully you can stay alive that long. You're definitely going to look for any chance to escape. You don't know how long it takes, as being stuffed down Persephone's shirt kind of messes with your sense of time. From your furry white prison you hear walking, running, panting, and engines. Not only that, but you also hear the sound of your werewolf companion eating. You can only guess what it is considering she's a cannibal. It disgusts you but at least these meals are keeping her from eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Persephone seems to settle down and the smell of the sea hits you. You just be somewhere near the ocean. You hear Persephone walking and then you hear her knocking on a door. The door opens and whoever is there gasps. \"Persephone?!\" she whispers. \"Yup, mind if I come in?\" Persephone asks. The other monster must have obliged because you hear the door close behind you. \"So how have you been cuz?\" Persephone asks. Cuz? That means whoever else is here must be another werewolf. \"Oh, I'm doing fine.\" the other girl says. \"Fine? Come on, you have your own business! You're your own boss! Give yourself more credit April!\" As Persephone says this she sits down and pulls you out of her shirt. \"Oh its nothing really, I just-\" April begins, but stops when she sees you. \"Who is that?\" The white wolfess responds. \"Oh him? He's just some human I got to help me break out of Under Gloom.\" April smiles awkwardly. \"Oh, I thought for a minute he might be a friend of yours. That would've been nice.\" Persephone just scoffs. \"Yeah right, I'm basically saving him for a snack, unless you want him?\" She offers you to the other wolf. April shakes her head. \"You know I don't eat humans.\" Persephone sighs. \"I don't get you, but I guess I don't have any room to talk about eating habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to the two women jabber on until you can stay silent no longer. \"Hey! I'm not some snack, now let me go!\" You turn to April and continue. \"Why are you helping her anyway? She's a criminal!\" April just lowers her head slightly. \"But she's family. I can't just abandon her.\" You point at Persephone. \"What are you talking about? She's a cannibal! She's probably going to eat you!\" Suddenly you are staring at a pair of red eyes. \"Watch it, I would never hurt my family!\" As she growls at you April lowers her hand. \"Now now, don't get upset. He's probably just scared.\" You struggle in the wolfs grip and start shouting again. \"I'm not scared, I'm pissed off! I get out of jail just to be brought to some fat wolf's house!\" Persephone starts growling again but April silences her. \"So what if I'm heavy? I happen to know that my hubby likes his women that way.\" Persephone looks at her. \"Hubby? Don't tell me you still have a thing for that human.\" April just smiles. A human and a monster? That's just wrong. \"As if any human would go for some fur ridden beast.\" You mutter. April hears this and it actually gets to her. She grabs you and carries you to the kitchen where you are swiftly dropped into a jar. \"I've heard enough from you. You can stay there until my cousin decides to do something with you.\" You sit there with your arms crossed as wolves continue to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really though, in love with a human? You're pretty strange.\" Persephone says. April shrugs. \"I guess it runs in the family. Some people even think Hecate's a little weird.\" When she says this she quickly shuts up. Persephone just waves it off. \"Relax, I know she hates me. Maybe one day we'll make up, but I doubt it. Speaking of which, how's mom? She works at that crazy house right?\" April nods her head slowly. \"Yes, she's an orderly there.\" Persephone leans back. \"Hope she's doing okay.\" April tries to lighten the mood. \"Why don't I make us something to eat?\" Persephone brightens up. \"Sure, I prefer monster, but you're food is always good.\" This little reunion is making you sick. Monsters acting all lovey is just unnatural. Eventually the wolves go to bed, leaving you to fall asleep in this jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next day look up to see a white paw grabbing you. \"You're pretty lucky human. You keep avoiding getting eaten because I'm being well fed. Don't forget though, I'll need a snack eventually.\" You see April clearing plates. They must have had breakfast. April's about to head to her shop, which is right next door. She rented the building and turned half of it into a shop and the other half into her apartment. What does Persephone do? </span></div></div>",

I rent the whole building so I just decided to move in.\" Persephone pats her cousin on the back. \"Man your shop must be doing well for you to be able to do that.\" April blushes. \"Its only a small building.\" As she heads out Persephone decides to join her. They go through a door that leads directly to the back of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty nice place.\" Persephone says. \"Thanks.\" April says. \"I've still got about a half an hour before I open up, so I'm gonna get some work done.\" She then heads further into the back into a workshop. Persephone follows and watches as April begins pasting and sewing and the like. While this goes on you find yourself bored out of your skull. If this albino wolf doesn't eat you, then you might end up dying of boredom instead.\"Do I have to listen to you two blabber on all day?\" you say. All this time you've been in Persephone's pocket. April had given her some clothes so she could get rid of her jumpsuit. You find yourself being lifted out of the pocket up to Persephone's face. Before she can threaten you however, April grabs you. \"Here, this should take care of him.\" she says, and places you inside a clear ball attached to a necklace. As Persephone puts on the necklace you yell at her, but the material of the ball muffles your voice. \"Much better.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you sulk in your new jail April resumes her crafting. \"Hey, do you need any help?\" Persephone asks. April thanks her for the offer and points her to some things that still need to be finished. Persephone walks over to some figurines that need to be colored. She picks up the paints and starts. For being a stupid monster you have to admit she knows how to work a paintbrush. The way she paints the little figures is like an expert. \"I see you haven't lost your touch.\" April says. \"You're the best painter I know.\" Persephone finishes up and walks over to her cousin. \"I still occasionally paint when I get the chance. Its what I'm good at. Well, that and eating people.\" You roll your eyes from the prison around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen its time for the store to open April unlocks the door.Persephone stays in the back to avoid being seen but still peeks out every once in a while. Hopefully she doesn't get hungry or you're done for. Suddenly the door opens and someone walks in. Who is it? </span></div></div>",

It's been a long time since I've seen her.\" \"What for?\" you ask. \"So you can eat her?\" You then gag before Persephone squeezes her breasts together angrily. \"Watch your mouth human! One more word and I'll eat you right now.\" Persephone's lips drip with harpy blood and you shiver. That's when Persephone sees the corpse of the harpy she just ate and gets the idea to pick the clothes off the body as she takes off her jump suit and changes out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" says the wolf woman as she walks away from the forest. \"It's good to get out of that old jumpsuit. Now, how to get to Dreadberry.\" Persephone runs off on all fours and you gulp. You're heading to Dreadberry, the boondocks of the monster world. This was just great, now you're gonna be stuck around hillbilly monster hicks. But wait, what is Persephone thinking. An albino werewolf, especially a wanted criminal, would stick out like a sore thumb in Dreadberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Persephone reaches a gas station where a large centaur trucker is busy refilling the gas tank. Persephone smirks as she comes forward, just as the centaur is finishing up. Persephone lets out a whistle to get his attention and then centaur walks forward to get a closer look at the werewolf woman smiling at him and waving her tail. The centaur man smiles and chuckles slightly to approach Persephone with a lustful look. However, once the centaur gets close enough, Persephone lets out a growl and tackles him to the ground, biting him in the neck as he lets out a scream. The centaur struggles to break free but Persephone slashes him with her claws before digging in. You have to cover your eyes as Persephone claims another victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Persephone finishes, she wipes the blood off her mouth and lets out a thunderous belch before rubbing her stomach. She notices a set of keys near the remains of the centaur trucker and then picks them up before she enters his truck dragging the leftovers inside. You're glad she does it too, no matter how disgusting it is, because then she'd have something to eat besides you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone drives down the road for hours, picking away at the centaur and tossing the bones out the window as you look in terror. She even finds some cigarettes and lights one up before she blows smoke in your face and you gag. \"We're almost there, Wade,\" she says. \"You better hope that this centaur tides me over until then.\" Persephone smiles wickedly and you let out a groan. By the time Persephone arrives in Dreadberry, it's dawn and she parks the truck outside the town limits before walking out. As you're wedged between Persephone's breasts, you wonder exactly what this cousin of hers is like. You hope she's nothing like this cannibalistic psycho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone soon reaches a small house that looked like it had been painted several times. There was a mailbox on it that read \"HOWLER\". \"This must be the place.\" Says Persephone. Persephone walks right up to the door and taps on it.</span></div></div>",

Turns out it was unlocked and she walks right in. \"Must be nice living in the middle of no where. You don't even have to lock your door.\" Persephone says. \"Yeah, so any old freak can walk in.\" you add. Persephone gives her breasts another squeeze to silence you. She walks through the house and goes to the fridge. Looking through its contents she finds a pitcher of iced tea and pours herself a glass. She wanders around the house sipping her drink while you remain trapped in her boobs. If this mutt doesn't eat you you may just die of boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Persephone comes across a room thats a lot bigger than the rest. Its definitely the biggest room in the house. It looks different from the others, so it must have been an addition. You gotta say, whoever built it did a good job. From top to bottom it looks expertly done. Inside you see a plaque with \"Au\" on it above the entrance. Walking through the room you see various other pieces of art with plaques as well. There's all kinds of stuff in here. One of the things Persephone walks past is a nice looking vase on a stand with an \"M\" underneath. Whoever made that is good with pottery. Your captor stops and stares up a wall. There are lots of things up there but she's looking at a painting of a black wolf with a \"P\" under it. \"Some of my best work.\" she mutters with a proud smile. This freak can paint? Go figure. Then she looks over to a pencil drawing of a white wolf with an \"H\" under it. Between the two is a portrait of a two wolf cubs, one black and one white, with their mother. This one is half painted and half pencil drawn with a \"D\" under it. Persephone looks at those two with a fond smile, as if she's feeling nostalgic. After what you've seen her do you find it hard to believe this psycho has a sentimental bone in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone heads to the living room and lays on the sofa. You grow even more bored until someone comes in the front door. They walk in the room and almost jumps at seeing Persephone. This monster is a fat werewolf that looks like a collie with red and white fur. \"I thought that scent was familiar!\" she says. She looks shocked but also a bit happy. \"Thanks for leaving the door unlocked Colleen. Nice gallery, I take it Autumn made that little addition?\" Persephone says. Colleen walks over and sits next to Persephone. \"Well, yes but how did you get here?\" she asks. \"Oh I just found my way here after leaving Under Gloom.\" Persephone tells her. Colleen gasps but also sees you in her cousin's boobs. \"Why do you have a human?\" she asks. Persephone pulls you out. \"I'm just saving him for later.\" she says. \"Whatever. I think you've eaten enough today you freak.\" you say. She shakes you and shuts you up. \"Is he okay?\" Colleen asks. \"Yeah, but this little guy has a habit of rubbing people the wrong way.\" her cousin answers. \"Whatever you mutts.\" you say. Persephone shakes you again and holds you out to Colleen. \"Want a snack?\" she asks. \"Blech. No thanks. He probably tastes as bad as his attitude.\" she says. \"Still hate the taste of humans huh? But I'm in no position to comment on anyone's eating habits am I?\" You are returned to her breasts as the two wolves talk some more. Persephone sleeps over with you just glad you've survived this long. The next morning... </span></div></div>",

The white wolfess gets up and heads for the bathroom, but stops as she reaches the door. \"Almost forgot.\" she says and pulls you out of her boobs. \"Watch him for me cuz.\" she says and tosses you across the room. \"What the?!\" you shout as you fly through the air. Colleen barely catches you and holds you in her paws. \"Are you okay?\" she asks. \"I'd be better if you could catch!\" you say rudely. \"Sorry.\" she says. \"If you want to help then why don't you let me go while the psycho is gone.\" you tell her. She shakes her head slightly. \"I don't think thats a good idea. If you get caught then they'll know you escaped prison and Persephone would be found out too.\" she says. \"Thanks a lot fatty.\" you grumble. She sighs and clasps her paws together, trapping you inside. \"Whatever, fleabag!\" you shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone comes back and sits down. \"Where's the human?\" she asks. \"Here.\" Colleen says opening her paws. \"This guys got one hell of a chip on his shoulder.\" Persephone picks you back up and puts you back in her cleavage. \"Yeah, but he'll come in handy as emergency food.\" she says. Later that night Colleen goes to bed and Persephone lays down on the couch. \"Almost forgot.\" she says and gets back up. She rummages around and finds a glass jar, then puts you inside. \"Stay put buddy.\" she says with a chuckle. Without any choice you try to get some shut eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up to see a huge furry ass in your face. At first you think it looks pretty nice but then remember it belongs to a werewolf. \"Monsters shouldn't be allowed to be hot.\" you grumble. Colleen moves from in front of you and grabs a pair of keys. \"Where ya headed?\" Persephone asks. \"I'm off to work.\" she answers. \"If you're sticking around, try to lay low.\" Persephone smirks as Colleen walks out. \"Hmm, maybe I'll check out where she works. I'm pretty sure she's a teacher.\" she says and gets up. Before she leaves she put you back in her boobs. \"Come on little guy.\" she says and walks out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her cousin's scent Persephone makes her way on foot. Eventually she reaches a large high school. \"Wow, this place is big.' she marvels. Then she makes her way around the building until she reaches a window and peers inside. She sees Colleen teaching a class and smiles at her cousin. \"Good going cuz.\" she says quietly. \"Look appetizing?\" you say snarkily. \"As tempting as it is I wouldn't want to cause a fuss at my cousin's job.\" she says. The class appears to be ending and Persephone decides its time to head out as well. Looking down you see your chance. You've managed to wriggle partway free and see that the window is slightly open. You force yourself free and make a lunge for the window. Do you make it?</span></div></div>",

You were free. For now anyway. As long as Persephone was loose this escape was compromised. But you can't think about that now because you have to dodge monster feet from Colleen's students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt as a kappa jock nearly flattens you and then you yell as a nerdy looking succubus with glasses and braces accidentally kicks you into the hallway. You grunt and feel your head before you look out and see six students in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of them was a green skinned patchwork girl who looked like a living rag doll with mittens for hands and a zipper where her mouth should be. She was wearing a dress you'd expect from an old fashioned felt doll and comically oversized shoes. Then there was gray furred orthrus girl with bright red eyes. Her left head had black hair while the right head had white. Next was a silver furred carbuncle; a monster girl resembling a mountain lioness with star shaped gem in her forehead who was wearing a black and white checkered jacket and a daisy in her hair. Next to her was a yellow scaled Chinese dragon girl with a long neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two that stood out most to you were a black skinned gargoyle girl with rose hair, like a female version of Thailog. Surprisingly she was extremely short for a monster. Gargoyles were usually the largest monster species there are. Destiny herself was the biggest monster you knew. The other one that stood out was a mer-lion; a gat blue lioness with scaly skin and the gills of a fish. Surprisingly she had the eyes of a human instead of a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sapphire,\" says the carbuncle to the mer-lioness. \"Did you hear about that breakout in Under Gloom last night.\" \"Mom told me this morning, Onyx,\" says the blue mer-lion. \"There were two criminals that manages to escape. Pearl, isn't your aunt the warden there?\" The gargoyle girl nods her head and you gasp. Destiny's <i>niece</i> attended this school?! This wasn't good. \"Auntie D is having a conniption about it. One of those crooks was Wade Wilson. He's a human who set a mummy on fire for stepping on his car by accident.\" \"What a...\" \"Hothead.\" Says the orthrus girl's two heads. \"Anger is a dangerous ally,\" says the dragoness. \"Wrath is one of the deadly sins for precisely that reason.\" \"Isn't he the one your aunt is always complaining about?\" asks Onyx. \"It's a wonder she hasn't killed him by now. I would if he's <i>that</i> annoying.\" \"Yeah, Auntie D is just about ready to tear her own hair out with him,\" says Pearl with a laugh. \"But she's not the one I'm worried about. Persephone got loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Pearl's friends gasp. \"That cannibal is free?!\" yells Onyx grabbing her hair. The rag doll girl twitches in fear. \"Don't worry Emerald,\" says the Orthrus girl. \"I don't think,\" \"Felt would be too appetizing.\" \"Persephone is Ms. Howler's cousin right?\" asks Onyx. \"You don't think she'd come here do you?\" \"It would be most unwise,\" says Topaz. \"An albino werewolf would be too easy to spot in a small town like Dreadberry.\" \"You're right,\" says Sapphire. \"Mom wouldn't let some cannibal just waltz into town.\" From the sounds of it, Sapphire's mother was the sheriff. You wonder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if Persephone eats her?\" asks Onyx. \"I don't want to be eaten next.\" \"Onyx,\" says Pearl. \"Sheriff Reaver is a Nemean lion. Persephone would break all her teeth if she tried eating her. Well, see you. I've got gym class.\" \"Science.\" Says Sapphire. \"Come on Ruby. Emerald.\" Now's your chance. You hated finks but if you ratted Persephone out to Sapphire or Pearl, you'd be rid of her. Just as long as you don't reveal who <i>you</i> are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Persephone snatches you back up and brings you to her face. \"Nice try.\" she says with a growl. \"But try that again and you're lunch.\" She stuffs you back in her boobs and sneaks away from the school. The whole time you have a scowl on your face as you sit in her cleavage. When she stops you see that she's back at Colleen's house. She enters and plops down on the couch. She sort of lounges there for a while and you start to get really bored. \"Comfortable?\" you ask sarcastically. Persephone glances down. \"I don't have many opportunities to relax like this so I'm going to enjoy it.\" She lays back again and smirks. \"Besides I bet you're comfy.\" she says. Even though you just did it hearing her be sarcastic gets on your nerves. Also you don't want to admit that it is kind of comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the boredom starts to get to you. You don't know whats worse, this or Under Gloom. Against your better judgment you ask your captor a question. \"So whats up with your cousin? Why would she just let a criminal in her house?\" you ask. Persephone looks at you. \"Our family is loyal to one another.\" she says annoyed. \"I love them and every member of the pack is accepting of each other.\" Then she looks away for a second. \"Well, almost everybody.\" she mumbles. Then she yawns and continues. \"So what about you? How'd you end up in a women's prison for monsters?\" You don't really feel like telling this psycho your life story. \"None of your business.\" you tell her. She picks you up and opens her mouth, lowering you onto her tongue. \"I'm kinda bored, so be thankful I'm talking and not eating.\" she says. \"Alright alright!\" you say angrily and she puts you back. \"Damn fleabag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got thrown in there for lighting a mummy on fire.\" you say. \"I guess they thought a female prison would be safer for a human.\" Persephone laughs. \"You got something against mummies?\" she asks. You glare at her before answering. \"No, the giant wad of toilet paper crushed my car! I just hate all you giant freaks. And you know who the worst ones are?\" Persephone rolls her eyes as you start to rant. \"Gargoyles!\" you both say at once. \"Those big jerks think they can just tell everyone what to do because they're a little tougher than most.\" you say. \"And they're not even edible! That skin tastes like rock and leather at the same time.\" Persephone adds. \"I bet old blue butt is throwing a fit.\" you say with a laugh. Persephone laughs as well. \"So do you have any friends besides your family? Can't be easy with you being a criminal psychopath and all.\" you say. She frowns as she responds. \"What about you? I'll bet someone with your personality has lots of friends.\" she says sarcastically. \"When's the last time you even had a woman?\" At this point you just want to get the last word in. \"Well how about you? When's the last time you got any? I bet guys just love a girl that will eat them after wards! Are you a wolf or a black widow?\" After a couple more back and forths the two of you grow silent again.

This is true enough. Whenever she meets a guy she usually lures him to a private place, but thats only to eat him. She's been on the run so long she hasn't even thought about men. She does pleasure herself every so often but thats about it. As her mind wanders so do her eyes and she realizes she has a male literally in the palm of her hand. She looks you over while you stare off grumpily in the other direction. \"He may not be much to look at, but...\" Persephone thinks to herself as she studies you. You finally feel her eyes on you and turn around. \"Whats with you?\" you ask rudely. Maybe she's finally decided to eat you. Her paw comes down and picks you up before she lies down on her back, spread out on the couch. \"Nothing really. I just decided that I needed something.\" she says, giving you a lick. Oh god, here it comes! \"Put me down you bitch! Go find another snack!\" you yell as you flail around. \"Oh you're not feeding \"that\" hunger.\" she says and moves you downward. You see her pulling the waistband of her pants and you know what she means. \"What!? No way! I'll never do that with a monster freak, let alone a psycho one like you!\" you cry as you struggle even more. \"Oh shut up and get in there.\" she says and tosses you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble across her furry body inside her pants and land in front of her underwear. Her pure white thighs tower over you on either side, and right in the middle, behind the underwear, is her pussy. You cover you nose, as the smell down here is crazy. Suddenly you feel movement and something pushes you from outside the fabric. \"Get to it.\" Persephone's voice rumbles. You refuse to move so she pushes you into her panties and rubs you around. The smell gets more intense and you feel her juice seeping through the fabric from the cave behind. Above you Persephone has begun to moan slightly. Her paw ends up smashing your face against her panties and she moans a little louder. This feels pretty good, but it still feels like she's just doing all the work herself. Time to take it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure on your back leaves and you fall to your butt. Before you can react a huge white paw enters and pulls back the underwear to reveal the giant monster pussy. You begin back away butt another paws comes and pushes you forward. \"This is happening human.\" Persephone says from outside. You try to run but she grabs you between two fingers. Just as you reach the opening to her womanhood she none too gently shoves you inside. You turn around to try and escape but she's already fixed her panties, blocking the way. You try to break through but all you do is slip on some juice and land on your ass. Outside Persephone feels you and smiles. \"Thats it.\" she says. Meanwhile inside you're starting to lose it. There are juices flowing from everywhere,  and every time you walk or touch a wall it causes your captor to shudder, which feels like a small earthquake. Not to mention the smell is overpowering here. As much as you hate it the aroma begins to get you aroused and you get an erection. Another quake knocks you down and you get a face full of her cum. Soon your already weakened senses fail you and you give into lust. You begin to lick and bite and even hump the floors and walls. Outside Persephone is shocked by the sudden change and starts to buck wildly. \"Whoa!! Thats more like it!\" she shouts in ecstasy. \"Well it has been a while.\" you tell yourself in your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like forever you finally climax, but Persephone isn't done. \"Come on! Just a little more1\" she says and sticks her fingers inside to grab you. She works you around her vagina until she finally finishes and pulls you out. As she does she lies back with a satisfied sigh. She drops you onto her chest and drifts off to sleep. You're even more worn out and pass out right there. You have a small smile on your face, despite the fact that you just had sex with a criminal monster. When you wake up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up on what feels like a soft bed and stretch your arms. When you rub your eyes you are caught off guard by what you see. You seem to be on Persephone's breast and her giant sleeping face is right above you. She's got her tongue hanging out slightly and she's snoring. Suddenly the memories of what you did hit you and you fall back onto your butt. \"What the hell did I do?!\" you say to yourself. \"I did it with a monster! A monster for God's sake!\" As you lament your life choices the giant werewolf is roused from her sleep by your cries. \"Huh? \" she's says groggily as she yawns. She sits up and inadvertently knocks you off of her chest, sending you tumbling down her body. When she finishes stretching Persephone looks down and sees you between her legs. \"Whoa little guy, trying to get some more so soon?\" she asks playfully. The thought of it makes you want to gag, but for some reason you can't. Even looking at her clothed crotch gives you a strange wanting. You shake your head to get rid of these thoughts and look up at your captor. \"As if! I knew you were a cannibal but I didn't peg your for a rapist!\" you shout. \"Rape? Really? You seemed pretty into it yourself.\" she counters as she picks you up. You fold your arms and look away angrily as she puts you in her cleavage. \"Just stay quiet shrimp. I'm in a good mood and I don't need you ruining it.\" she says threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear rumbling and Colleen walks into the room. \"Oh you're up!\" she says to Persephone. \"You two looked so comfortable I couldn't disturb you!\" Persephone walks to the kitchen and gets herself a drink. \"When did you get home?\" she asks her cousin. \"Oh school ended an hour ago. I got home and found you asleep on the couch. Did you two become friends while I was gone? He looked pretty happy on your boob!\" Colleen says a little amused. \"Yeah right, as if I'd be friends with a little jerk like him.\" Persephone answers. \"Although I guess you could say we did become a little closer.\" You groan at her joke and make yourself heard. \"Why would I be friends with a psycho like her?! You better get it straight you fat furball!\" you shout. Colleen frowns at you and Persephone bops you on the head with her finger. \"Watch it you! I won't have you insulting my family!\" she snaps. You rub your head and shut your mouth, but continue to glare at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enduring another couple of hours with the two wolves its pretty late. Colleen gets up and starts to head for her bedroom. \"Well I'm gonna hit the sack. Gotta get up for school!\" she says. \"Good night cuz.\" Persephone says as she enters her room. Persephone then falls back on the couch and pulls you out of her boobs. \"Sorry to take you from your spot, it must be comfy in there!\" she jokes. You narrow your eyes but think that she's right. For some reason you've really started to notice how soft her fur is. \"Whatever. What do want fleabag?\" you ask. \"Well I was thinking that earlier felt really good, so I want some more before bed!\" she answers with a grin. \"What! No way!\" you protest. Unfortunately she goes along with it anyway with no effort. You figure you don't have much of a choice and don't fight it as much this time. At least thats what you tell yourself. When she finishes you both fall asleep again until morning. Then...</span></div></div>",

Must have taken you out some time last night. And for some reason, you feel sullied by the fact that you almost...<u><i><b>ALMOST</b></i></u>...feel, of all things, disappointed about that! Out of a desire to distract yourself, you look up to see what was rubbing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone's clawtip, she was petting you. Seeing you awake, the curvaceous albino werewolf girl grinned \"Hey, Wade. Enjoy your trip?\" she snickered, \"Gotta say, little guy, the way you passed out in there I was afraid you were a goner, but when I tried taking you out, you actually struggled while you were unconscious! I almost wanted to let you stay in there if you liked it so much you subconsciously hate the idea of leaving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou WHAT?! Ho man! That....that couldn't be! You hated monsters! And yet based off what this cannibal snow wolf was telling you, you were actually...! You feel so unclean at the sheer notion that its not even funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone laughed \"Gotta say, you're cute when you're blushing like that, Wade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?! You were...?! You shake your head, vehemently denying it, even as you felt your face return to normal as the heat left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figure we could tour this place, with how backwards and unsophisticated this out of the way town is, the hicks might not even know who we are.\" she said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Considering who we are and how loud Demona is, they probably heard of us just from the fit she threw when she was screaming once she realized we were gone.\" you point out. Persephone laughed again, \"Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and stretched before sniffing her prison uniform and looking it over. \"At the very least, we should get some new outfits. The prison look is a dead giveaway, even without the name of the prison on the backs of the shirts and our names and serial numbers on the fronts of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you had to nod \"Why didn't we do that before?\" you ask, then stop yourself as a huge, wet, chanine nose was suddenly right in your face. \"'We', huh?\" Persephone said with a grin. \"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're beginning to warm up to me, Wade.\" she says, winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGah...! This could not be happening! You couldn't get attracted to a monster! Especially one that would devour you without a second thought as soon as the whim to do so struck her! Yet to your mortification, you felt a certain part of you between your waist and knees protest your denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, your captor picks you up and you find yourself back between Persephone's breasts again. Why didn't that bother you?! And why did you want to feel more of how soft her fur is?! You shake your head, trying to rid it of the foreign thoughts. You had to admit one thing though, the two of you needed to ditch the jailbird look or you wouldn't stay free too much longer. And you had utterly no intention of going back to Under Gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're we going to...?\" you start to say, but then you realized what kind of stupid question that would be to ask an escaped crook as your werewolf captoress (you REALLY didn't want to use the word \"partner\" to describe her) made her way outside. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Persephone makes her way outside, she runs on all fours while you're forced to hold onto her breasts. Unfortunately, you two didn't know it, but you were being watched. There were two monsters nearby. Both were as big as Destiny but unlike Destiny both of them looked quite obese. The first one was a white furred Nemean lioness with light blonde hair and bright green eyes. She was wearing a green leotard with a sheriff's badge pinned over her left breast. The other giantess was a blue furred weretiger with navy hair and light purple stripes, making her resemble a morbidly obese Navi from Avatar. The tigress was wearing a black vest, shirt pants and a hat like a cowgirl would wear, except her hat had a blue rose to the side that looked big enough to land a plane on. On the tigress's left breast was another badge except this one looked like the kind a U.S. marshal would wear, though this obviously wasn't the U.S. From the looks of it, those cats were the law around Dreadberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them spotted Persephone and realized what danger was in their town. \"Looks like Taleela wasn't kidding,\" said the tigress in a Texan accent as she scratched her fat belly. \"So that's Persephone Howler?\" The lioness nodded her head. \"I never thought such a deadly villain would come to Dreadberry,\" she said. \"But then again, she is Colleen's cousin.\" The tigress just let out a growl. \"First we'll get rid of the white varmint and then it's the stoney lonesome for Colleen for harboring that ornery rascal.\" \"Prussia,\" says the lioness sheriff. \"I know Colleen. She's one of my daughter's teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia, the marshal, just lets out a scoff. \"You don't know nothing, Maggie. I ain't sticking around to watch that beast eat half the town alive. It's a good thing I came prepared.\" The were tigress reached into her pocket and takes out a glove that she puts on before she reaches into her cleavage and takes out a box. She takes out a gun from her holster and opens the box revealing several silver bullets.\" Prussia loads the gun before Maggie leans in. \"Silver bullets?\" she asked. \"Where did you get silver bullets? Those things could kill a werewolf in one shot.\" \"Yup,\" said Prussia as she clicked the gun. \"That thar's the point. That ain't no bank robber we're used to. We've got to get rid of her before she gets rid of us.\" Maggie shakes her head before she takes out her own gun and loads the silver bullets in it. \"I heard that there was another escapee with her,\" said the titanic lioness. \"Wade Wilson, a human imprisoned for arson, assault, GTA, etc.\" Prussia just licked her mouth. \"Good. I skipped breakfast.\" Maggie actually gives a look of horror and disgust at that comment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone at the time is running down the street by some bushes and sniffs the air. \"Find a clothing store?\" you ask sarcastically. \"No,\" says Persephone. \"But I smell a saloon, no a salon... actually both. It smells of shampoo and bourbon. I'm not even gonna ask how that... wait, there's several smells coming from that salon, or saloon or whatever.\" Persephone smells the air and you look up in fear as she begins to drool. Mammoth, leviathan, human, I'd say nearly twice your age, also traces of tanuki and baku. Mmmm.\" Then she growls because you pull on her fur. \"You can eat later,\" you say. \"We need to ditch these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Persephone freezes in her tracks and sniffs the air. She gives a look of horror. \"What is it?\" you ask. \"Monsters,\" she says. \"Two of them. From the smell, a weretiger and a... Nemean lioness. Both of them are carrying.... silver bullets!\" Instinctively Persephone ducks into bushes, jerking you and nearly making you fall off before you grab her hair and climb up to her ear. You both feel tremors and sure enough, Maggie and Prussia are nearby holding out their guns. \"They've got to be around here somewhere,\" says Maggie. \"An albino werewolf would stick out like a sore thumb. Persephone really dropped the ball this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch the two feline giantesses walk by, you almost expect to see a bear following them. \"What are you worried about?\" you ask Persephone. \"Why don't you just eat them. There's enough bloat on them to keep you from starving for months.\" \"If it was just the weretiger, I would,\" says Persephone. \"But that sheriff is a Nemean lion. If I took one bite into her, I'd break every tooth in my mouth. Nemean lions are indestructible. A nuke wouldn't hurt one. Plus they're packing silver bullets. These two are out for the kill. But how did they know we were in Dreadberry.\" You grit your teeth. \"I'll bet that cousin of yours finked us out. There's nothing I hate more than a stool pigeon.\" Persephone growls at that and glares at you. \"Watch your mouth, Colleen would never do that.\" Then Persephone is forced to hold her breath because Maggie and Prussia are just walking by the bushes. Will you two be able to evade the lioness sheriff and the tigress marshal?</span></div></div>",

Sure there's a chance she could be harboring Persephone, but we don't have any proof. I won't do anything unless we catch her in the act.\" Maggie argues. Looks like Colleen is getting off. The sheriff seems to like her. Guess in a small town like this you build relations. The two of them keep arguing until they decide to move on. \"Lets go, this trail's cold.\" Prussia says. They head off and as their stomping gets farther away Persephone lets out a sigh. \"That was close.\" you say and lie back in her fur. You enjoy the feeling and smile without thinking. Persephone sees you smiling and grins as well. \"It looks like Colleen's gonna be fine too. I have to admit I'm thankful to that lion.\" she says. \"I guess I'm glad for you.\" you say absentmindedly. The wolfess smiles and you turn your head. \"You're my ride, so its better if your head's in the game.\" you say quickly. \"I don't need my taxi getting sloppy, okay you fur ball?\" She rolls her eyes. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure not to draw any more attention Persephone sneaks around, looking for that clothing store. When she finds one she enters and thankfully no one is at the counter. She sneaks around and ducks behind a clothing rack when someone comes from the back. \"Hello?\" she asks, then heads back. \"I guess it was nothing.\" You both sigh in relief and Persephone grabs some clothes quickly. She starts to leave but something catches her eye. Tucked away in the corner is small section for human clothes. Its definitely not much but you guess there's gotta be some humans in this town. She grabs a set of human clothes and then makes for the exit. \"Why did you bother getting those?\" you ask. She didn't have to get you clothes too, but for some reason she did. \"Hey we're in this together.\" she snaps. \"If I'm changing I don't want some little orange guy sticking out.\" She smirks as she says this and runs on all fours toward the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the forest Persephone heads into the deeper parts. She sets you down on a log and starts stripping. Halfway through you realize you could make a break for it, but decide its not worth it. You wouldn't survive in some monster woods, and they're already looking for you in the town. At least thats what you tell yourself, but some part of you doesn't want to leave the white wolf. You grapple with this feeling and snap back to attention when her jumpsuit lands in font of you. She saunters over and stands above you with her hands on her hips. Her pussy is right above you and your eyes switch between it and her face. \"You know, since I'm already naked, why don't we go a round?\" she asks with a grin. \"Are you serious you horny mutt?\" you say, but your member starts to harden when she says this. Her paw comes down and rips your jumpsuit off, revealing your erection. \"Look who's not being honest.\" she says. With that she grabs you and the two of you have sex on the forest floor. You resist a little, but give in and go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all is said and done Persephone licks you clean and hands you your new clothes. Its a pair of jeans, some black boots and a black t-shirt. After you're dressed you look up and are taken aback by what you see. Persephone is wearing a pair of tight jeans that accentuate her figure and a low cut black shirt that shows of her boobs. \" This is nice. I would have gotten some clothes from Colleen but our figures are too different. You like it?\" she asks. You blush and look away. \"Whatever, lets just go.\" you say. She puts you between her breasts and starts to head for the edge of the woods, away from Dreadberry. \"Where to next?\" you ask. \"I've got cousins all over, so we're heading to another one.\" she answers. Where is she going?</span></div></div>",

Not a lot of people to see us.\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...made sense. Only problem is the weather. Wait...there was Persephone's fur for that. As soon as that thought hits you, you blush and look up at Persephone from in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you heading there just to have an excuse to keep me close?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Persephone laughs, \"Well, Well, Wade...making jokes, now? But I gotta confess it will make a nice reason to smother you with my body!\" she grinned, \"I can only imagine how cozy your \"bedroom\" with me will be with it being cold outside it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?! What in the world did Persephone mean by...ho, man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked how you were in there so much that she was calling it yours and even saying it was where you were gonna sleep! And with how she seemed to enjoy it so much that she turned a change in clothes into an excuse to have sex on a forest floor with you, odds were that was actually gonna be the truth sooner rather than later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to shake the thought, as well as the diamond-hard erection that sprang up in response to it, from your mind, you look for a new topic and find it in the subject of the wolfess's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who lives there that you're related to?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone shrugs, \"Selene. Lives in a cabin near the mountainside. She's an ice sculptor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was made easier when Persephone jumped a cyclops and, after a struggle and quick meal, took the keys to their silver Lexus convertible as well as their wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she laughed. \"I like this one!\" Climbing into the driver's seat, and buckling up, Persephone plucked you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Wade, but this seems a safer while we drive,\" she apologized to you, and plopped toy into the cup holder before she started up the ignition and hit the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were instantly propelled to the back of the cup holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns and hills at high speeds. You were helplessly thrown around the cup holder. With every blow, you yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped, you collapsed, sore and panting. A huge mass of white descended and you were picked up before you were held in front of Persephone's face. Was that....concern she was aiming at you? No way. The cannibal wolf-girl who was becoming increasingly horny towards you is actually capable of feeling that? No a chance...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, Wade?\" Persephone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never...again...\"you groan, you body sore and trembling. \"Never drive that way again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone winced and gently picked you up, planting a light peck on you that covers your whole body then places you back in her cleavage again. \"Sorry Wade.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt in acknowledgment of her apology and reclined into her warm, soft fur. Why did you feel so relaxed in this position now? You chalk it up to being preferable to the hell-on-wheels that is Persephone's driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold temperature of the snow doesn't bother you much. Like you thought, Persephone's fur kept you warm too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carried you in her cleavage, your wolfess companion made her trek up to to an old-fashioned wooden cabin What was shocking was that there were at least 1748 ice sculptures around it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...this is Selene's place.\" Persephone chuckled, then went up and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 700-too-tall, fat, gray-furred werewolf girl with a reddish tint in her fur answered it. What surprised you was that she wore a tight sweater that hugged her entire body. Why did she need that? Between how much meat she had on her bones and her fur, she couldn't possibly get cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Persephone?!\" she shouts, nearly causing you to go deaf. Clearly she knew that the white wolf was imprisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone smiled and hugged her cousin \"Hello Selene, great to see you again.\"   You groan as she squeezes the other werewolf rather tightly, unknowingly causing you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulls away, Selene stares at her. \"You got let out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her shoulders in a shrug, Persephone smiled, \"I'm here, aren't I? All thanks to my friend here.\" she said, pointing you out to her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene bent down and squinted. As she looked at you, Selene looked like she was fighting the urge to drool, but Persephone quickly covered you with a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade here isn't for eating, Selene!\" she snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, another human-eater! This just got better and better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...with a human? Not eating it?\" Selene said, then put her hands on her hips. \"Who are you and what have you done to my cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Very funny.\" Persephone said, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene smirked, \"Gotta say, if you went as far as marking what's yours, aunt Diana'll be thrilled. Means you've shaped up a bit enough to get parole, next you'll stop eating monsters. but I gotta say, a human that's not food...I'm hearing it, and it makes me wanna join her at the Kaijuu Disarming Plant in Terrordale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. Marking what's her's?! You knew about canines and doing that but...Persephone wouldn't go THAT far, would she?! You mean, sure...there were those times she made love with you at Colleen's house and again in the forest, but that didn't count, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone winced like she'd been stabbed. \"Mama...seeing her is gonna be hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene nodded gravely. \"Never was the same after you were muzzled.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?! Persephone's mom?! And what the hell was this \"Kaijuu Disarming Plant\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene beckoned you both to come inside and Persephone did so. The cabin was surprisingly cozy. Selene shut the cabin door and held out a hand to her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I keep an eye on your little friend while you get settled in before you head out? Seems you're out to meet everyone in the family and let them know the good news about you starting to reform. Don't worry, I won't hurt your truancy officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh...truancy officer. Not a bad cover story. You mentally make a note to use that to excuse you and Persephone being together on the loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone hesitated. Then set you down on the table. \"Nothing happens to Wade, got it?!\" she ordered. To which he cousin nodded. Persephone looked at you, \"I'll be back.\" she promised, then left. As she left the cabin, a massive hand suddenly grabbed you and  you were brought to Selene's face and she grinned, licking her chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never would've thought my cousin would have a human with her that she didn't want to eat. Glad she din't go as far as marking you with her scent, or I'd never be allowed by the nature of werewolves to crunch you down, morsel! Ho well...more for me then! Chow time!\" Selene says, then opens her mouth wide, danging you over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT!</span></div></div>",

Her giant nose sniffs you some more and she places you in her paw. \"Wow, she actually did it!\" she says a little shocked. \"I gotta say I never would have thought Persephone would go all the way with a human.\" You blush a little but try to regain your composure. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" you say rudely. Selene smirks and flicks you onto your butt. \"Don't try to hide it. I can smell it all over you. You guys have been busy.\" she says. You look away with no comment as Persephone walks back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a pretty good lay of the land. This place is pretty much like I remember.\" the white wolfess says. \"You're lucky to have such a comfy little cabin.\" Selene walks over and pats her on the shoulder. \"Well Autumn does good work. You should go see her too eventually.\" she says. Persephone takes you from her cousin and pats your head. \"I plan on meeting up with everyone.\" she tells her. Is she really going to take you to meet her whole family? This annoys you but for some reason you kind of like the idea of traveling more with her. You try to shake these thoughts out of your head but are finding it harder. You can't deny how soft and nice her fur is and, even though it pains you to say it, the sex is great. Just what is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for now the two of us are just going to stay here for a bit if thats okay.\" Persephone says. \"Sure I don't mind. How long are you staying?\" Selene asks. The wolves have entered the living room and Selene has started the fireplace. The warmth hits you and you sit back in Persephone's palm with a contented sigh. She picks up on this and gives you a little kiss before sitting you on her shoulder. \"Where'd you go before you came here?\" Selene asks. \"We stopped by Colleen's place for a while.\" Persephone says. Selene sits down. \"Really? Way out in Dreadberry? How's she doing?\" she asks. \"Pretty good. Still loves being a teacher. We headed there after we...got out of prison.\" Persephone answers. Selene raises an eyebrow at this comment. You get the feeling she knows you broke out but isn't saying anything. Oh well, she doesn't seem to care really. These wolves seem to really stick together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation goes on your eyes drift down to Persephone's cleavage. Before you know it your thoughts are filled with her boobs. Selene laughs and point you out. \"I think someone's zoning out cuz.\" she says. Persephone scratches your head and chuckles. \"Well he's seen a lot of them lately.\" she responds. \"Yeah, I can smell it on him.\" Selene tells her. \"I guess you'll be keeping him around huh?\" Instead of answering Persephone just smirks. while you try to look uninterested. \"By the way. while I was out I saw the lodge you have there.\" Persephone says suddenly. \"Yeah, its pretty nice. I sell my sculptures and stuff to them. Plus its never too crowded so I don't mind hanging around and grabbing a bite to eat every now and then.\" Selene tells her. \"Maybe we'll stop in for a visit tomorrow.\" You don't know if thats a good idea. You're on the lam after all. Although you are in the mountains so maybe news of the breakout hasn't reached them yet. Oh well, you'll deal with things as they come. What next?</span></div></div>",

Not that it matters to you. You're always in her boobs, which are softer than any bed you've ever slept in. As she lies there she turns onto her side and growls a little. You're in her cleavage so you get squished but you don't mind. You continue to sleep until the morning when Persephone pulls you out. \"Wakey wakey Wade.\" she says and gives you a lick. The first thing you see upon opening your eyes is her face. This startles you a little since you were having a dream about her. You're starting to think you're going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating some breakfast Persephone heads for the door. \"Well in case we don't come back I'll see you next time.\" she says to her cousin. Selene gives her a hug. \"If you cause any trouble just don't bring it here.\" she says with a grin. Before Persephone walks out of the door Selene pats you on the head. \"Have fun.\" she says. Then you are assaulted by the cold air as the white wolf steps outside. You snuggle further into her boobs and find that you are plenty warm enough. \"I think we'll see what the lodge is like.\" she says and starts walking. When the lodge comes into view you begin to see more monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you enter the lodge and walk through the lobby. Eventually she comes across a little cafe and steps inside. \"This must be the cafe Selene mentioned.\" she says. You see several waitresses and notice they're all wearing maid outfits. This would seem gross to you before but for some reason it doesn't bother you as much. A vision of Persephone dressed as a maid pops into your head and you get lost in thought. You shake the daydreams out of your head and try to focus. There sure is a variety in here. There's a black werejaguar who seems a bit chubby, and then there's an hourglass shaped blue werecrocodile. You also see a Frankestein monster who's left side is completely mechanical and a huge loxodon girl. There's also a weregiraffe whose neck is so long it makes her taller than anyone in here! Does Persephone have a seat?</span></div></div>",

She reads over the options and thinks over her order. \"Bet you'd rather have one of the waitresses, huh?\" you ask. \"Yeah, but I can't exactly grab one in the open.\" she responds. Eventually the weregiraffe comes over to take her order. \"What can I get you?\" she asks with a smile. \"I'll have the dinosaur sandwich.\" she says. Dinosaur  sandwich? Sounds gross. The waitress leaves and Persephone watches her walk away. \"Look at the size of her though! That neck could feed me for a while!\" she says with her mouth practically watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weregiraffe returns with a plate holding a big sandwich. \"Here you are. One dinosaur sandwich.\" she says with a bow. Then she goes to help another customer. Persephone picks up the giant sandwich and takes a bite. You look up at her and see her huge teeth gnashing and chewing the meat. Looking at the sandwich itself you see that the meat doesn't look all that weird. There's some cheese and some kind of sauce on it as well. \"Want some?\" she asks with a smile. \"Eat some gross monster food? No thanks!\" you respond. \"Well its not like there's a lot of options for you.\" she says. You can't help but be frustrated that she's right. \"Fine.\" you say begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white wolfess tears a piece of meat off the sandwich and drops it into her cleavage for you. Its a pretty big piece to you and you have to hold it with two hands. Hesitantly you take a bite and find it doesn't taste too bad.

Persephone let out another belch as she was eyeing the weregiraffe waitress hungrily. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to stay and sample the local cuisine,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to stay here. We better get moving.\u201d You nod your head as Persephone gets up and leaves money behind for her meal. It looked like you were both on the move again. \u201cSo where too next?\u201d you ask. Persephone gives a smug grin. \u201cI might decide to visit a few cousins in Horrorville. Unfortunately, two of them live in the same building as a cop, so we need to be careful.\u201d You nod your head. You hated cops and monster cops were worse than normal cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you and Persephone were walking into the lobby, you both hear sirens. \u201cGood grief!\u201d you say. Persephone turns her head and you both see a police car driving up the hill and decide to hide in a hallway. \u201cThe owner of the lodge then walked up to the front door. From the looks of it, she was a BBW silver furred werecoyote and had a crescent moon birthmark in the center of her face. She had a middle-aged male human with a lumberjack\u2019s shirt on riding on her right ear. Why, you didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote woman opened the door and showed several monsters dressed in police uniforms, mainly animal-based monsters. There were two leading them. First was the police commissioner. She appeared to be a wererhinoceros who was 975ft tall and very fat and had grayish lavender skin and short red hair but thick golden brown fur covering her body like a woolly rhino from the ice age. From the looks of it, the larger of her two big black horns was 300ft long. The monster beside her was the police chief and he resembled a blue and white feathered phoenix who looked like his back was currently on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes there appear to be any trouble, Comimssioner Chavez?\u201d the coyote woman asks the rhino woman. \u201cTrouble is an understatement, Mrs. Skinwalker,\u201d said the rhino giantess. \u201cHave you read the paper.\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d says the lodge owner. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. That awful Persephone Howler is on the loose. I\u2019ve heard of that murderous cannibal. She\u2019s related to a hermit that lives in this area. Why hasn\u2019t she been executed yet?\u201d Commissioner Chavez, the rhino giantess lets out a snort. \u201cPersephone is the reason we\u2019re here.\u201d \u201cOne of your employees claims to have seen Persephone in the lodge and she might me in the building right now.\u201d Said the phoenix chief \u201cGood grief!\u201d yells the coyote woman\u2019s human husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were outraged. \u201cSomebody squealed.\u201d you grunt. \u201cBut who?\u201d asks Persephone. \u201cNobody even heard us speaking.\u201d Then Persephone realized something. \u201cThe weregiraffe!\u201d \u201cSay what?\u201d \u201cWeregiraffes have psychic powers. I forgot about that. That longneck must\u2019ve read our minds.\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe it. That giraffe finked you out. \u201cI am going to wring her long neck before I kick her fat ass!\u201d Persephone puts her finger in your mouth. \u201cEasy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe might be able to escape. Just keep quiet.\" Persephone then takes you and runs down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says the rhino police commissioner. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need to search the premises and question all guests and staff if they\u2019ve seen a werewolf in this building.\u201d While Azure and her husband were talking with the cops, you and Persephone come to a dead end. \u201cDammit!\u201d you yell. \u201cA dead end.\u201d Persephone tries to open a door but growls. \u201cThis one\u2019s locked.\u201d \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d you ask.

You hear voices approaching she hops outside just as they enter the room. The white wolfess run through the snow on all fours, staying low to the ground to avoid being seen. You hear the voices fade as you get farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone makes her way to the front of the lodge but stops when she sees the cruisers parked there. There are a couple of officers waiting so she doubles back the way she came. Steering clear of the lodge she heads into the mountains. \"Where are we going?\" you call up to her. \"Just somewhere we can lay low.\" she says.

She pats your head with a smirk. \"Oh, I've got a big family, so get ready for a lot of traveling.\" she says. \"So I'm just supposed to go along with this?\" you say. \"Well, I'm the boss so yes.\" she tells you. \"Besides, its not like you have anything better to do.\" You jump at that remark. \"Hey!

You feel strangely compelled to watch her as she puffs away on her cigarette, Imagine that; years of loneliness and the first companion to come your way is a <i><b>giant cannibalistic werewolfess</b></i>\u2026fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone eventually glances over your way and catches you staring. Her eyes shift between you and her cigarette. \u201cWanna smoke?\u201d She asks, almost politely. \u201cHow am I going to smoke <i>that?</i> Your cigarettes are bigger than me\u201d You quiz back defensively. \u201cC\u2019mere\u201d Persephone commands in a soft tone as she reaches over and picks you up by the collar. You\u2019re hoisted up into the air and eventually placed in the palm of her paw-like hand. \u201cGet ready, I\u2019ll go slow\u201d she says as she moves you closer to her mouth and drawing in smoke from her cigarette. Her fingers arch over you a little as she begins to release the smoke gently into her cupped paw. You inhale some smoke and by sheer volume you being to cough. Persephone giggles as she moves you a little away from her mouth to catch your breath. \u201cWell <i>that\u2019s</i> an improvement I guess. The first time I blew smoke in your face you <i>gagged</i>\u201d She recalls. \u201cYeah that might have had something to do with you <i><b>chowing down on a monster</b></i> not long before! There was still blood on your mouth!\u201d You quip back, still slightly defensive. Persephone doesn\u2019t respond but the deep sigh that escaped her and the smile she let fade once again was a response enough. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with <i>you</i>?\u201d You ask, trying to act none the wiser. <i><b>\u201cNothing\u201d</b></i> she answers back, clearly not done sighing. \u201cWill you just tell me damn it!\u201d You yell exasperatedly, tired of the silent victim act. \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to like me?\u201d Persephone finally responds, not even looking at you. \u201c<b>Stop being a monster</b>\u201d you answer back directly. You thought this was the truth until you felt a spike in your heart. A tear had quickly begun to travel down Persephone\u2019s cheek. Regret started to swell up in your chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d you stutter. \u201c<b>Yes</b>\u2026 Yes you did\u2026  <i>Admit it</i>; you\u2019ll leave as soon as you get the chance\u2026\u201d she simpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Persephone stubbed out her cigarette, placed you on the pillow and rolled over facing away from you. A few moments and sniffles later she brakes the silence. \u201cIf you want to leave Wade, I won\u2019t stop you\u2026I <b>can</b> force you to stay but I <i>can\u2019t</i> make you love me\u201d Persephone exclaims. This is intense you begin to silently tell yourself. Who would have thought this <i><b>killing machine</b></i> was capable of loving something she once considered <i>food</i>? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to her and begin to scale the giant wolfess, clinging on to her fur as you make your way up her back. After quite a bit of effort you reach the top and are now standing on Persephone\u2019s hip. On one side below you was a massive white cliff that a great, long fluffy tail sprouted from. On the other side was Persephone\u2019s stomach; Resting, titanic and quietly rumbling as it gently inflates and deflates. Many a human and a monster have perished in there, you quietly contemplate. You\u2019re probably the only human to ever get this close to Persephone and not have suffered the same fate. She must really have fallen for you. The wolfess was still gazing ahead of her as she laid there\u2026 The fur on her cheek still wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to journey along Persephone\u2019s side, climbing up her arm and walking towards her neck. She turns her head towards you and her ears prick up suddenly, as well as her giant red eyes widen just as you reach her shoulder. \u201c<i>Hey</i>\u201d you say casually. Persephone\u2019s mouth draws open for a few seconds before she is able to speak. \u201cI-I thought you\u2026 - \u201c<b>I\u2019m not going anywhere Persephone</b>\u201d you interrupt her. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together. I wouldn\u2019t have even made it a <i>tenth</i> of how far I\u2019ve made it without you and I won\u2019t lie, It kinda\u2026<i><b>really</b></i> sucked to see you cry\u201d your speech ends. \u201c<i>Wade\u2026</i>\u201d Persephone whimpers. Almost right after she begins to reach out to you and clasps you in her paw. She moves you closer to her and affectionately starts to lick and kiss you. After a few minutes Persephone stops to make eye contact with you. \u201cI care about you <i>a lot</i> Wade\u201d she whispers delicately, another tear making it\u2019s way down her cheek. This time a happy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care about you too Perse, its just\u2026<b>difficult</b> for me\u201d you admit to her, fighting the moral friction in your mind. Persephone\u2019s eyes very gently blink as she starts nuzzling you. \u201c<i>I know\u2026</i>\u201d she whispers softly. \u201cIt was <b>weird</b> for me at first too, I mean I did almost <i>snack</i> on you a few times but the more time I spent with you, the more I <i>realised</i>; you were becoming my friend and then after that night we spent\u2026<b>I knew</b>\u201d she finishes, letting her gaze fall into your eyes. Persephone stays quiet, just holding eye contact with you. You didn\u2019t want to look away. Those big red eyes once threw sharp spears into your heart every time you saw them, <b>now</b>; the same thing was happening but for an entirely different reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes begin to fall ever so slightly. It was getting late. \u201cWe should probably get some shut-eye\u2026\u201d you announce, breaking the blissful silence. \u201cWant your <i>usual</i> spot?\u201d Persephone asks through a sleepy smile. Usually this question would have made you feel a bit awkward and left you struggling for an answer but through sheer tiredness, you can\u2019t help it. \u201c<i>Please</i>\u201d you say through a lengthy yawn. Persephone tucks you in her chest and after you both settle\u2019 it isn\u2019t long before the two of you are sound asleep, waiting for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud rumbling noise abruptly wakes you up. You\u2019re still nestled in with Persephone and she was still fast asleep. You decide to try and drift back into sleep until the noise happens <i>again</i>. Startling you upon realising what it was; the noise that woke you up was Persephone\u2019s <i><b>stomach</b></i> and it was growling louder each time, sending vibrations throughout her body that even <i><b>you</b></i> could feel. Unsettling thoughts started to construct themselves in your mind. <i><b>What if she was hungry enough to eat you?</b></i> <i><b>Should you run while you can?</b></i> <i><b>Are you wasting your chance to escape?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of terrifying doubt, a different noise suddenly grabs your attention. It was Persephone stirring in her sleep and what you just heard was a snore. You look up from where you\u2019re perched and see her calm and serene expression as she remains in a deep sleep. In that moment, a wave of admiration drifted over you. She looked so...<i>peaceful,</i> and you just couldn\u2019t help but stare at the giant wolfess. These fears were old habits you decide. It was time to face them down. Slowly and steadily, you begin to make your way out of Persephone\u2019s cleavage. She was lying on her back so you had to climb up towards her neck first and find the best way from there. Once you reach her upper chest, you begin scaling her titanic fur-coated bosoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a considerable amount of time to reach the top. Standing for a moment to catch your breath, you look to see the source of the rumbling. Persephone had <b>really</b> put on the pounds over the years eating all of those <i>carnivorous</i> meals\u2026her stomach really was <b>colossal</b> in comparison to you\u2026<br>\r\nJourneying onward towards it doesn\u2019t take very long after you tumble off of Persephone\u2019s breast trying to climb down safely. You hoist yourself up from the crevice between her breast and her stomach and begin clambering up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short but strenuous time later, you eventually find yourself atop Persephone\u2019s <i>gigantic</i> mid-section; still rumbling and gently shaking the surface beneath you. It proved quite difficult to maintain your balance while her stomach kept rising and falling ever so slightly as she breathed, but with every step; you proceeded with casual caution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone had slept only in her underwear so you were granted a privileged view of her titanic form. Walking around the edges where the sides began to curve was <i>awe-inspiring</i>\u2026 You were really high up and couldn\u2019t seem to move your attention from the fact. The sun began shining in through the window; lighting up the guest bedroom further as you ventured towards the centre of her, where the naval began to seep into what seemed like a bottomless pit. Gazing deep into it left you in a trance\u2026it <i>did</i> look comfy. \u201cWant to go <i>in</i>?\u201d You hear a voice from behind you suddenly announce, almost sending you into cardiac arrest. Spinning round to find Persephone had woken up and was admiring you exploring her. This left you feeling slightly embarrassed, you could feel your cheeks burning as the silence after the question continued. \u201cI..uh. I was just stretching my legs, y\u2019know,<i><b> early bird and all that\u2026</b></i>\u201d you stumble out. \u201c<i><b>C\u2019mon</b></i> now Wade, I\u2019ve been watching you check me out for like.. <i>five</i> minutes. You have a <i>thing</i> for bigger girls, don\u2019t you?\u201d She asks with a naughty smile. \u201cI have a thing for you\u2026\u201d you reply on instinct. Persephone\u2019s face lights up even more and her eyes widen with it. \u201cLet\u2019s have some <i>fun</i>\u201d you say, trying your best to sound seductive. It seemed to work. <br>\r\nPersephone reaches over to you and pushes you gently backwards, sending you tumbling down into her naval. The grumbling was so much louder in here. You could actually hear the gurgling and even some splashes\u2026it was actually quite relaxing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached out your hands and ran them across the furry walls, you could hear Persephone whimpering in delight. \u201cThat feels <i><b>amazing</b></i> Wade\u2026\u201d she informs you. \u201cKeep going\u201d she adds through a breathy whisper. You pick up the pace as you continue massaging her. At one point, you even let your face fall against the wall of her naval. Suddenly, the vague amount of light you had began to fade. Looking up to see the walls <i>closing</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re going to enjoy this\u2026\u201d Persephone tells you before the light is <b>completely</b> sealed off and the walls clamp together, smushing you between them. Glimpses of light would blink in for less than moments at a time as Persephone squished her large stomach together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pleasurable turmoil ends and not long after you see Persephone\u2019s nail reaching in to claw you out. \u201cGrab on tiny\u201d she commands you endearingly. You lodge yourself on and she lifts you out into the daylight again.<br>\r\n\u201cHow was <i>that</i>?\u201d She asks, bringing you close to her face as she sat up. \u201c<i>That</i> was <b>something</b> else\u2026\u201d you mutter, still winding down. \u201cDid you <i>enjoy</i> it?\u2026\u201d Persephone asks slightly unsure. \u201cI think I <b>did</b>, yeah\u2026\u201d you answer her. She giggles before leaning in to kiss you, in response you just let yourself fall against her lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for today my little man?\u201d she queries with a content smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can come up with <i>something</i>\u201d you respond, returning the same smile with just as much contentment. </span></div></div>",

The governor is afraid of me. She knows that she is a cruel, mischievous creature that needs to be eradicated. Fairies, leprechauns, carbuncles, kelpies, all the fair folk exist to spread misery and pain.

You will free each one of them.\" Ursula then reached into her jumpsuit and pulled something out of her love tunnel that made you look in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to be a bottle with a parchment inside. Ursula smashes the bottle at the side of the cell wall and then hands the paper to you. \"This is a list with pictures of every member of my gang.

Double cross me and you will perish in my intestines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula roars at you before placing you on the ground outside of her cell. This was just great. Now you had to bring along not just one, but four criminals out with you. But you had to act fast. If you betrayed Ursula, she'd devour you. You unroll the parchment to see that there was a large array of monster faces from different species. Some had Xs draw over them, implying that they had been killed. But three faces had numbers written on them; 6, 7 and 8 to indicate which floor of the prison they were on.

Lockette held up her head and let out a yawn as she stretched her long neck. The first thing your cellmate does is look all around to see you missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette lets out a sigh and looks at that gap you made to escape the bars. \"So he went through with it,\" she said. \"He's going to end up in Clover or Cree's belly. I just know it. Not all monsters are as friendly to humans as me. Couldn't he just pay his debt to society like I'm doing?\" You let out a huff. That was easy for her to say. She didn't have to spend years in a prison for monsters the size of skyscrapers and besides, she was getting out in a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there there was a loud banging on the cell door, nearly deafening you. A guard was doing it. The guard in question was that Nue Simone. That darn monkey was chattering loudly and let out a monkey like screech as Lockette got up. \"I'm coming Simone,\" moaned Lockette. \"Keep your snake tail on.\" Simone jumps up and makes more monkey noises as Lockette walks out of the cell. Simone holds onto Lockette's shoulder to make sure Lockette didn't try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she wouldn't. In your opinion she was too stupid to put up a fight. \"That stupid monkey hasn't realized I've escaped,\" you thought to yourself. \"Now I can blow this join.\" Soon Lockette reaches the laundry room where she's taking the dirtied up jumpsuits to put into the machine as a guard you don't know watches her. This guard was a saber toothed weretiger woman that was half-asleep but still keeping an eye on Lockette. It would only make sense there were a few guards on each floor. There were just four you knew on your own floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make your move now while Lockette was loading the washing machine. You had to think fast about how you were going to escape.

It was a familiar tall shadow with leathery bat like wings. There was only one monster that it could possibly be, Warden Destiny herself. Destiny walks into the room and the sabertooth immediately springs out of her seat. \"Eyes awake,\" says Destiny. \"Fearfield isn't paying you to loaf off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny walks forward and one troll inmate has the gall to give her the finger. Destiny turns around and then grabs the troll girl by the neck as she yells. \"I'd watch myself if I were you,\" says Destiny. \"You've got a long ways to go to get out of here. Don't make it any harder for yourself.\" The troll woman nods her head in fear before Destiny drops her into a pile of dirty jumpsuits and gestures to her that she's watching her. \"Bitch.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Destiny turns to a shaking Lockette, she just gives a smile. \"Lockette,\" says Destiny. \"Congratulations are in order.\" \"Th-They are?\" asks Lockette scared and confused. Destiny smiles again at Lockette. \"You're a model prisoner, Lockette. Which is more than I can say about that vermin roommate of yours.\" Since Destiny couldn't see you, you give her both fingers. \"What I mean to say,\" says Destiny to Lockette. \"You're a free girl, Lockette. You've been released for good behavior.\" Lockette is surprised to hear that and Destiny extends her hand. \"Th-Thank you, Warden.\" Says Lockette as she shakes hands with the gargoyle woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sucked. Destiny was letting Lockette go while you were left here to rot. Well, you weren't sticking around. You decide that while Destiny is distracted, you'd skeedaddle. But before you could get any farther, Destiny brings her foot down and traps you between her talons. \"No use, Wade,\" says Destiny with a voice full of venom. \"I knew you were going to try to escape somehow.\" \"You anus!\" you yell up to Destiny. Destiny squeezes her toes and makes you scream before picking you up. She gives you a glare and shows you her fangs. \"You know,\" says Destiny. \"You're getting predictable, Wade.\" \"Then why not release me too? I don't belong in this freak hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gives a glare as Lockette looks on in worry. \"Please, don't hurt him.\" Destiny lets out a sigh. \"Why should you care what happens to this piece of garbage?\" Destiny asks Lockette. \"He's been nothing but verbally abusive to you since you became cellmates and he never listened to you. Your kindness was wasted on him. You're a free woman, Lockette, you don't have to concern yourself with scum like Wade any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Destiny stomps out. \"You know, Wade,\" says Destiny. \"This is too convenient. With Lockette out of Under Gloom, I'm going to have to relocate you. You'll have a new cellmate by the time the day is over.\" Destiny then gives an evil laugh that would make Demona herself blush.

Quickly, you hide behind Elaine/Destiny's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny? What happened?\" Icy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elaine managed to trick me and locked me in here. I don't know where she is right now. You need to get me out of here.\" Elaine told Icy. Normally, a guard would not believe this, but Icy was new, so she wasn't used to the place yet. Which meant she was tricked rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy opened the cell door and let Elaine/Destiny out. \"There you go. Are you alright?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now.\" Elaine replied, before headbutting Icy, knocking her out. She then dragged Icy into the cell and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. We're out of the cell and now we just need to get out of the prison.\" Elaine told you. As much as you hated to admit it, that was impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine starts walking down the hall to the elevator.

Belladonna Solanacaea was the vice warden of Under Gloom which made her as hazardous as Destiny. You quickly hide behind Elaine (still in the form of Destiny)'s hair as Elaine looks at Belladonna in surprise. Belladonna appears to be equally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny?\" asks Belladonna. \"How the heck did you get to the 5th floor so quickly from the 8th floor?\" \"Uh,\" mutters Elaine still in Destiny's voice. \"I took the stairs.\" You cross your fingers and hope Belladonna falls for the lie, which against all odds, she does. \"Makes sense.\" She said. Elaine entered the elevator and you breathe a sigh of relief only to cover your mouth. You weren't out of the woods yet. Belladonna seems skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say you relocated Wade to level five after releasing Lockette?\" asks Belladonna. Elaine clears her throat and gives a snarl as she tries to fake Destiny's anger. Though she can't quite make her eyes turn bright red like Destiny's. \"That little bastard,\" says Elaine through fake anger. \"I don't know why I don't feed him to the Wendigo on floor three.\" You almost get mad but you have to remind yourself that Elaine is only pretending to be Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Belladonna raises an eyebrow and begins to think to herself. \"Wendigo on floor three?\" asks Belladonna. \"There isn't a wendigo on the third floor. Hell, there isn't a wendigo in the entire prison. What the flying f...? Wait a minute? Isn't there a shapeshifting kitsune on the fifth floor? I wonder.\" Belladonna stares at \"Destiny\" and you begin to sweat as you hide behind your accomplice's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a surprisingly good mood today.\" Says Belladonna to Elaine. \"Well,\" says Elaine nervously. \"Doctor's orders. Stress is a poison you know.\" This didn't sound good, Belladonna wasn't 100% sure that it wasn't Destiny she was talking to, but she was already suspicious. \"You know, Destiny, a new restaurant opened down the street from the Daily Tombstone where Fate works.\" \"Oh,\" says Elaine. \"How nice.\" \"Yeah,\" says Belladonna. \"Latin cuisine. I hear they make a pretty good jalape\u00f1o salad.\" Elaine gives a face of disgust and sticks out her tongue. \"Jalape\u00f1os? Gross. Belladonna, you know gargoyles and jalape\u00f1os don't mix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna's eyes pop and you let out a gulp. The jig was up, Belladonna knew that Elaine wasn't Destiny. While it's true that gargoyles as a species usually don't like jalape\u00f1os, Destiny and her daughter <i>do</i>. You know for a fact that jalape\u00f1os are Destiny's favorite food. Belladonna knows that Elaine is an imposter and then the elevator stops at the ground floor as Elaine walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only pray that Belladonna choses this as an opportunity to get Destiny in trouble and usurp her, or you and Elaine are toast.</span></div></div>",

But that was not what caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caught your attention was her face. It reminded you of that comic book villain, Two-Face. The right half of her face was normal, with her snow white skin, a green eye, long, straight black hair, and half of her lips covered in black liptstick. The left half, however, was a nightmare. It was horrifically burned, red and ashy black and looking like hamburger meat, to the point where you could see part of her jaw. Her left eye was milky white, and the left half of her hair was short and white. Looking down, you saw that her left arm was burned as well. What the hell happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, her inmate uniform was split too. The right half was a typical uniform, but the left half was torn and burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I get stuck with Lady Two-Face here, huh?\" You say, trying not to look at the left half of Janice's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you. \"So you're Wade?\" She asks in a smooth Italian accent. She turned her head so you could only see the right half. \"I've heard a lot about you.

What was this girls problem? \"Why don't you just let me escape, melty-face?\" You ask smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at you, Janice pulls out something. You see that it's a coin.

Only, it was so dark it, was hard to tell what it was. It felt quite soft, though, and as you pulled yourself up somewhat, your eyes adjusting to the darkness, you realized what you'd grabbed onto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...\"Where is he?!\" barks Destiny, pulling at the pocket furiously, trying to get a better look inside. \"Where is who? Wade?\" asks Lockette, in an attempt to act innocent. \"Don't bullshit me, sea-lizard. I <i>just saw him</i> in your pocket. Where could he have gone?!\" Lockette, herself, was a bit curious as to how Wade managed to sneak his way out of this one, but went with it. Destiny let out a huff of anger, and gave Lockette a soul-piercing stare that would've made any self respecting human wet themselves. \"You listen to me, Lockette. I'll be keeping my eye on you. I <i>know</i> what I saw, and if I find that you've been collaborating with Wade...well, let's just say that I'll be making your stay here a living hell, on TOP of ruining your perfect prisoner record!\" And with that, Destiny stomped off, clearly angry that she lost sight of Wade. Lockette let out a sigh of relief. She wasn't sure how, but Wade managed to not screw this up. Actually...where was Wade? She found herself checking her own pockets; Wade really wasn't there. As she ignored an itching sensation on her breasts, she began to look around the room, trying to see where Wade had ran off to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...were you really doing this right now? I mean, you didn't care either way, Lockette was a means to an end. But it almost felt like you were invading her privacy, climbing up on her cleavage and all from the inside of her suit. But clinging to her bra until she was in the clear wasn't an option, so you were going to have to make due. Resting on top of her purple mammaries, now you had to play the waiting game. Only, as Lockette's body moved around to search for you (unbeknownst to you), your ride began to jiggle around far more then you'd like, forcing you to grab onto her flesh to avoid falling down. You didn't want to do it, but with her sudden movements, it was the only way to avoid falling off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...above, Lockette was trying to act unsuspicous as she looked around the room for you, trying to appear like she was acting normally around the guards. \"Wade, where are you?\" she whispered, looking around the room concernedly. Lockette didn't really know why she was looking out for you. You were a troublemaker, and routinely came close to getting her in trouble. And this time she'd actually helped you! You weren't worth looking out for, but she did it anyway. She was too nice of a person. As she moved around, however, she felt a sudden, sharp itch on her chest, and began to scratch at it to relieve it, trying to ignore it as she searched for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the itch was you, and you were unexpectedly attacked by Lockette's fingers through the suit. What was Lockette doing?! Didn't she know you were in here?! Suddenly, she sharply jabbed at you, this time dislodging you from your resting position and sending you tumbling down through her prison uniform once more. Lockette...</span></div></div>",

Clover was a monstrously large and obese monster resembling a green reptilian elephant with a snake for a trunk. She was a monster called a grootslang. Legend has it the African gods created them but saw them as a mistake and split them into the first elephants and snakes. But some grootslangs got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover came forward into the laundry room and you got a good look at her before she could notice you. Clover's name was all too appropriate for two reasons. 1) She was green. 2) She had blonde hair that made her resemble the character of the same name from Totally Spies. Kinda fitting since you remember an episode where she was turned into an elephant. In fact, it didn't help that the grootslang dressed like a teenager most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever <i>this</i> Clover stuck her trunk in the air and let out a trumpet and a hiss. \"Hello,\" says Clover. \"Lockette. So, I was like, at your cell earlier and I noticed that Wade got out... <i>again</i>. Do you know anything about it? I'd like to eat him before that cackling slob gets to him first. You wouldn't like, know where Wade could be hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no.\" Says Lockette as she hides you between her back. \"Nothing to hide here.\" Clover just gives a glare as her trunk hisses and sticks out its forked tongue. Despite being an elephant based monster, Clover was no vegetarian. You saw her inhale human prisons up her trunk and spit their bones out her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover comes forward and Lockette clenches her fist to hide you as the grootslang sniffs at Lockette to inspect her. She even circles the Loch Ness monster. You don't want to take any chances that Clover might find you so you squeeze out of Lockette's hand, but slip and fall. You grunt and fall for hundreds of feet before you grab hold of something and let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you then realize that you grabbed on Clover's skirt. You gasp and look down to see two huge green pillars as thick as mountains and above is a sky covered by white panties covered in blue polka dots. Lockette notices and you and is about to say something but covers her mouth as not to alert Clover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover finishes inspecting Lockette and trumpets. \"I know Wade is totally hiding somewhere,\" says the grootslang. \"And when I find he, he had better get in my belly. It had better not take long. I'm visiting with my mom as soon as I get out of work and believe me, I am not looking forward to it. She has the worst taste in men. I'm serious. She's always dating some weirdo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get an idea, it's risky, but it's still an idea. While Clover is distracted you climb up her skirt and duck inside her panties to ride her out of the place. But which side did you hide in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holding onto the bottom of Clover's skirt was no easy task. Although living in a world where surviving day in and day out among titaness's has helpfully shaped your muscle mass, you were still no match for gravity as the skirt dangled precariously above the ground, as your shaky hold threatens to either send you flying off, or slam you into the grootslang's legs. Looking up towards Lockette, you see her glance in your direction before looking back towards Clover and continuing the conversation with her, probably to buy you some time to figure out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your options boiled down to \"Fall\", \"Yell\" or \"Hide\", and there weren't many places to hide on the underside of a grootslang's skirt...unless...no, you couldn't...but...maybe you could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much deliberation, you decide that, much to your chagrin, you were going to have to hide in the underwear of the grootslang, and groan. It wasn't pretty, for sure, but it was so large you could probably hide in there without her knowing...then again, she was a grootslang, and the elephant part of her really did show in the weight department. Looking up at her panties, they seem to be a little too thin for her...but too late to turn back now, as you're already climbing up the skirt. You'll work out how exactly you'll get in once you get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while you're still about 20 feet away from your hideaway, Clover wraps up the conversation, and she's suddenly moving, setting her skirt and legs into motion. Grasping the fabric as tightly as possible, you continue to climb, nearly losing your grasp and falling before grabbing on again, and continuing upwards. The mere movement of the skirt itself was threatening to give you whiplash as you scaled it, but finally, you found yourself hovering near...the grootslang's titanic rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it wasn't pretty, but it was a hell of a lot better then crawling in the front end...imagine being caught <i>there</i>...you shudder with the thought. Although really, hiding in what is essentially her gigantic crack isn't a prettier option, but it's too late to change your mind anyway. Although you realize now that her panties are...really, ridiculously tight on her. The way they dug into her crack, leaving her cheeks totally exposed, made you begin to regret your decision, but there was no time to find an alternative as your arms felt like they were at their limit, so with a sigh, you let go of the skirt and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the side of her cheek with a thud, you slide in between them and towards the lip of her panties, and grasp it, feeling accomplished for having managed to grab onto it. From there, you adjust yourself and stick your legs between her body and the underwear, and try to slip inside. This is...easier said than done. The apparent tightness of the underwear wasn't an exaggeration, you were actually struggling to separate it from her body enough to slip inside. But with a bit of work, you manage, and with a cartoonish pop they snap back to her body as your head finally goes through, and you begin to slide down the green, clover-patterned fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you knew that this ride was gonna be unpleasant, you weren't entirely prepared for <i>how</i> unpleasant. As it turns out, not very pleasant. You were afforded some room to stand near the \"base\" of the panties, but the ride was still quite tight, with you constantly bumping your head into the roof of Clover's bum as the underwear moved around in line with her legs. Even as you sat down to avoid that, you were attacked with quite the musky stench that made you nearly throw up. The distinctly male part of your brain hoped getting in a monster girls pants would be a more pleasant experience, but as it were, it was unbearably hot, smelly, and uncomfortable. Honestly, you weren't entirely sure why you thought this was a good idea in the first place, but at the very least, Clover doesn't seem to have noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down and closing your eyes, you try and wait until the opportunity to get out of there presents itself, but it's unsurprisingly difficult to tell where you were from within the cotton prison, and it was just as easy to lose track of time. As minutes turned into hours, you eventually pass out, either from being exhausted or from the smell managing to incapacitate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you begin to wake up, as fresh air manages to find your lungs, and you look around, dazed and confused. You could see the gigantic grootslang's undergarments being slid off her body, sliding down her legs with her massive, elephant fingers. Looking around, you wonder just where you managed to find yourself?</span></div></div>",

You really don't want that thing to find you.

CRAP! Spotted! Clover loomed over you and you saw her licking her lips, recognizing <i>what </i>you are, but not <i>who</i>. You get up, but as you're about to run, the grootslang women's massive stomping knocks you off your feet and you have to roll out of the way as her flat foot is about to step on you, as soon as you stop, however, she bends down and prepares to suck you up her trunk like a vacuum, but then her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-WADE?!\" she shouted, standing. \"I don't believe you managed to escape! And hiding in my underwear, no less! I thought I felt something scratching my bum earlier...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I enjoyed it either!\" You snap back. \"I hated it/feel violated! Stop agreeing with me, you man-eating bitch/stupid bug! I said quit that!\" you both shout at one another, speaking at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Clover shakes her head in disgust, grumbling. \"Ugh, after you've been that close to my butt there's no way I'm eating you. Yuck...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, what'cha gonna do to me then? Send me back where I came from? There's NOTHING Demona could do to me that's worse than the ride over here with you, and since you're not gonna add me to your body fat, not like you'll ever NEED to, what's the worst you can do to me?\" you sneer, feeling pretty bold in spite of what you'd just gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little...!\" Clover snarled, then stopped and her eyes lit up with a sudden idea and her snake trunk zooms towards you and wraps around you and you're lifted to her eye-level. You thrash around like a madman, trying to slip out, but the serpentine trunk holds strong and the Grootslang just laughs as she picks up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret telling me that Wade!\" she cackles, switching it to speaker and dialing Destiny's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss!\" Clover said, setting the phone down, \"Got a situation here...turns out I picked up a stowaway at work, didn't find him til I got home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WADE!\" Destiny's voice screamed furiously. \"HOW THE HELL DID  HE DO IT THIS TIME!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...The fact is he...\" Clover blushes, her snake-trunk drooping. \"He, um...hid in my panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat started a outraged rant from the warden, you caught a few words like \"pig\", \"disgusting bastard\", and \"pervert\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up Boss! This is something you'll wanna hear: He said noting in Under Gloom could be worse than that...er...ride. And since he was there, I'm not gonna eat him. So I was thinking: If he's been rendered inedible and he finds being around me worse than prison....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny's voice goes quiet and you could swear you could feel the thoughts piecing themselves together into a picture you nemesis is going to love.  \"Three...two...one..\"   you mutter with a wince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! THAT'S BRILLIANT! OH, I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! HOLD ON JUST A SECOND CLOVER! I'LL SET THINGS UP SO HE'S ALL YOURS! WAHAHAHAHAH! I LOVE KARMA!

Only rule is he can't be allowed to die, eaten or otherwise.\" Destiny said after a few moments. \"So long Wade! Enjoy that you're out of Under Gloom!\" Destiny's voice laughs before the life goes dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Demona...you BITCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're brought out of  your thoughts as the green grootslang has her trunk squeeze you, bring your attention back to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that settles that!

Now...since I need to clean off because of how you snuck out, I'll be taking a shower...and since you owe me for feeling that way, YOU get to be my soap and washcloth!\" the  guard said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale as she walks through her house towards the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Clover's snake nose drips poison from its fangs. \"I'd totally watch what you say to me, bug,\" says the grootslang giantess. \"I own you for the rest of your sentence and you will treat me with respect.\" You then stick your tongue out at Clover and then Clover gave an angry glare. \"Like,\" she said. \"That's totally fine with me. I'm going to enjoy every second of this. Clover then removes her belt and pulls down her pants and underwear before unbuckling her work uniform revealing her very obese and name body. Her breasts even jiggle, as does her belly, to say nothing of the reptilian pachyderm's huge booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you can hear Clover laughing somewhat evilly. \"What are you doing, you scaly green elephant?\" asked Clover. Clover let out another evil laugh and then she steps into the shower before turning it on. The water pours down before Clover tosses you into the air. You yell and then you grab hold of her hair and are forced to hold on for your life as Clover shampoos her hair and drives her large clawed fingers through her hair, assaulting you in the process as you yell. The more you struggle, the more you get caught up in Clover's blonde hair. Clover then shakes her hair as you're buffeted by shampoo and even yell as you swallow some and cough. Then Clover uses her trunk to pull you out of her hair before she takes out the soap. \"Oh no!\" you yell. \"Oh no! Don't even think about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you yell as Clover viciously rubs you against the soap, all while humming to herself right before you're covered in suds. And then you are pushed right into Clover's love tunnel. You scream as the hole sucks you in and Clover's trunk shakes you about against the walls as she moans in ecstasy and shakes her hips. You start to slip further down into the tunnel and scream as it looks like it will eat you but then Clover shifts position and you slide out, shivering. Then Clover's trunk uses you to scrub the rolls all over the snake/elephant hybrid girl's large belly and you scream as you even swallow some elephant sweat. Then Clover gives a laugh and then slams up into her armpit. The stench is otherworldly and you are pressed into the fleshy green wall and rubbed on like a stick of deodorant as she violently rubs you all about. Just when you think it's over, Clover then takes you to rub you into the other armpit, the exact same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feels Clover pressing you into the shower walls and grinding you with her massive breasts as you try to bite her, only for the elephant girl's skin to be too thick. \"And now,\" says Clover viciously. \"Here comes the really fun part.\" You really don't like the sound of that and Clover proceeds to turn around, her planetary ass in full view. \"Oh no!\" you yell. \"Oh no! Please don't!\" But Clover then shoves you up her massive green booty as you yell and starts to scrub you all around as she pushes her ass cheeks together, causing you to slip into her buttonhole as she scrubs soap inside, causing you to slip and slip as you yell. This was utter hell. You admit you were a violent criminal and have done many terrible things, but what did you ever do to deserve THIS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Clover lets out a loud world breaking fart that nearly makes you go deaf and blind and buffets you with soap as you scream. You would've been blown out if not for the soap. Then Clover holds her butt up right in the direction of the shower head and you scream as a large and powerful rain of water comes down and assaults you. The shower ends as Clover walks out and pulls you out of her butt as you gasp. \"You sadistic elephant bitch!\" you yell. \"I'm going to tear you apart!\" \"Uh-uh-uh,\" said Clover. \"I wouldn't be nasty if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you smile smugly. \"Oh yeah?\" you ask. \"You heard Demona. You can't kill me.\" Clover just gives a smirk. \"You'd be surprised what you could live through.\" Clover holds you in her trunk and shakes you as you scream. \"One more thing,\" says the elephant. \"For your remainder of your stay, you will address me as <i>Queen</i> Clover.

You feel tremors and fall until you're wedged between Clover's huge toes. The door opens up and you see another grootslang with hot pink skin. From the looks of this, this grootslang was even fatter than clover as her cloths looked like they were coming apart at the seams. She also had paler hair than Clover's but it was still in the same shape. The older grootslang held up her snake trunk as it flickered its tongue. \"Clover!\" yelled the older grootslang as she hugged Clover. \"Good to see you, come on in.\" That's when you remember something. Clover said she was visiting her mom after work and it looked like this pink elephantine titaness was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover follows her mother into the house and you practically gag as you're stuck in her toe jam. \"So, how is work sweetie?\" asks Clover's mom. \"Don't get me started on work,\" says Clover. \"Wade got out of his cell and Destiny's having a conniption over it. She's totally wound a bit too tight. But that's like, beside the point, who are you dating this time?\" Clover's mom smiles smugly and shakes her pachydermic/reptilian rear as she lifts up her trunk. \"Whatever do you mean? I'm not seeing anyone right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover just gives the older grootslang a glare as you finally slide out of her toes and have to jump out of the way as her flat foot is about to step on you. \"Don't give me that. Ever since you and Daddy broke up, you've been all over the place. I can totally remember one time you were seeing <i>12</i> guys at once.

I need a drink after talking to you.\" You stick out your tongue. And you called Destiny a disgusting ***** beast. Clover's mom was the queen of them. Clover's mom then gives a sly smile. \"You know, Clover.

How'd he end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover blushes, her snake-trunk drooping. \"He, um...hid in my panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her mother bursts out laughing, neither you or Clover take it well. \"It's not funny, dammit!\" You both say at once. \"I hated it/feel violated! Stop agreeing with me, you man-eating bitch/stupid bug! I said quit that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink titaness chortles, looking at you more lustfully than ever. \"Well, a crook AND a pervert.

I <i>thought</i> I felt something scratching my bum earlier...\" Clover grumbles. \"Ugh, after he's been that close to my butt there's no way I'm eating him.

Clover, would you mind leaving me alone with my new BF.\" Clover lets out a trumpeting laugh. \"Knock yourself out, Mom.\" Both Grootslangs' trunks kiss before Clover starts walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big green bitchhole!\" you shout at Clover. \"You're leaving me around with your combat boot wearing mother. I hope you run into ivory dealers on your way home!\" Clover just lets out a hiss and smiles at your predicament before she opens the door and walks away. Her mother shakes her fat hips and smiles down on you as her trunk winks at you and extends its frills. \"You know,\" she says. \"A gal can have a lot of fun with a man as small as you. F.Y.I., since you're my boyfriend, I'll let you know, my name is Ivy.\" \"As in poison.\" You mutter under your breath. Then you scream before Ivy picks you up by the leg with the mouth of her trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're scrappy,\" she says. \"I like scrappy, but just as a warning, try to keep the nasty down. Like my daughter, I eat humans too, but not through my mouth if you know what I mean.\" Ivy smirks and then slaps her butt to make it shake even more, just before she holds you in the air and gives you a good look at it. \"You are disgusting. What do you do for a living? Poledance.\" Ivy then lowers you to her eye and starts to unbutton her shirt and take off her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do it just for you if you like.\" You mentally gag. \"Clover is going to pay for this,\" you mumble. \"I hate that elephant snake. I think I hate her even more than that hothead Demona.\" \"Demona?\" asks Ivy. \"Is that your nickname for the warden. I think I want one. How about Mystique?\" Ivy jiggles her breasts as you grit your test. You were in for a world of torture at the hands, breasts, ass and very other body parts of this reptilian elephant giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ivy put you through first?</span></div></div>",

You mentally gag but then Ivy's trunk snaps you up into its mouth and makes you yell before it shoots you into the cushion of a very small chair in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and rub your head only to find yourself looking at Ivy's planetary pink buttcheeks right in front of you. The reptilian elephant blows a kiss as she sticks her trunk in the air. \"No way you stupid elephant bitch! I'm not...\" \"Ah, ah, ah,\" says Ivy as she waves her booty. \"If you get nasty, my big old booty won't crush you. She'll eat you! Yum, yum, eat you up!\" You feel mentally sick. Being eaten through the mouth was one thing but there was no way you'd go through it the other way. You let out a groan. \"I'd rather be crushed.\" Ivy lets out a laugh. \"Oh, goody. Now brace yourself little guy, here comes Mystique!\" Ivy slowly lowers her butt down and you crouch down when it looks like it will hit you. Surprisingly though, the literally elephantine booty just freezes before it crushes you. You look up to see Ivy's butt moving upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if she changed her mind when <b>THUD!</b>. Ivy slams her booty down on you like two meteors of armageddon and starts wiggling her rump and causing you pain. You try to bite her but that only makes the grootslang goddess giggle. \"Bite me Wade,\" she says. \"Mystique loves it.\" Ivy lets out a hissing trumpet and you groan. You definitely were better off in Under Gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes and your body is numb. You'd curse out Ivy but your face is stuffed with Grootslang butt. As if to add insult to injury, Ivy lets out a world shattering fart directly on you and you gag and scream. Ivy giggles slightly and lets out another blast that actually makes you grip her tight. Ivy lets out another laugh. \"So you're still alive after that. How wonderful. Most humans who breath in my gas drop dead. You're really fun Wade. I love it.\" After one more hour of crushing and gas torture, you wish you were dead. Even Cree would be better than this.

The massive pink Grootslang brings her hands around, feeling all over her rump and searching for you. You shudder as her fingers brush against you, then pause before they move over you completely and start drumming against you, each one feeling like being pummeled with a 2x4 as if you were a xylophone. Finally, it was only a few seconds later when you can't take anymore that you bit her buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ha! So my widdle Wadey's alive after all! How wonderful! You're a durable little guy! Durable and small enough to fit wherever I want to put you...absolutely perfect!\" Ivy cooed to you with a laugh. She pressed you a little into the flesh of her huge, hot pink-colored asscheek, which was completely unnecessary as far as you were concerned, seeing as you would have be able to move better in a concrete-filled coffin with how pinned you were to her buttcheek. You felt the world shake as Ivy a.k.a Mystique walks through her house, giving you a tour of sorts. The monstrous mama snicked as she opened a door and went inside the room, kicking the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Lord, where were you? You were stuck facing the ass of Clover's mother, so you couldn't see anything, but she takes care of that for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you're not facing outwards, Little Wade! We're gonna be spending a LOT of time with Mystique here in our love nest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight down a moan. Wonderful...her bedroom! This was WAY worse than Under Gloom! You didn't want to think about what Clover's sex-addict mother was planning for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something pinch your waist and you were piled off Ivy's butt like a bandaid, it was actually relieving that you were no longer trapped against the massive, hot pink-colored butt...until you saw that you were being held by a pair of  massive, hot pink-colored fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy giggled as she brought you to her face. \"Now, my little lover...I figured since we're here in our room together for the first time, why not enjoy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to recoil in utter disgust. Ivy wanted to...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\"  you shout at the top of your lungs. \"I'd rather go back to where I got out from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, far from disappointed, laughed at that as her trunk wrapped around you like a python and lifted you up. \"You're caught and wanna run?! You're playing hard to get, Wadey! Ooh...I like that!\" Ivy purred, then she turns to a nearby desk and grabs a necklaces with a small glass bulb, no bigger than a grape attached to it. With a simple twist of her wrist she unscrews the bulb from the necklace and moves her fingers towards you, grasping you between two of them, where you're trapped between her gentle grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to keep you in here for a while until you're ready to come out. Hopefully by then you'll finally want to cooperate and get inside me.\" She gives you a playful wink and drops you inside the glass bulb, and then screws it back on the necklace, and finally puts the necklace around her neck. You tumble into your glass container and scramble onto your knees as soon as possible. The only exit you notice is the top of the bulb, which has to be unscrewed by someone monster-sized, and several small holes about a quarter of your size near the base of the glass prison, most likely for air flow, so the bulb doesn't crack or explode in certain conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy then strips down to where she's completely nude. You cover your eyes, this was the last thing you <b>EVER </b>wanted to imagine, much less see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy snickered as she flicked the bulb, sending you tumbling and spinning. \"Hopefully, you learn that's it's safer inside me than your new travel home, honey. I'm a rough sleeper, so after a few nights, you'll be BEGGING to be where I want to keep you!\" the pink, reptilian elephant tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale. She was so determined to have you go through with doing it with her that she was going to torture you until you agreed?!  This was why you hated monsters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sashayed over to her bed and grinned as she got in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty-night, lover-boy! You're in for a wild ride!

You bang on the bulb of the necklace and try to scream, but it would appear that the crystal is soundproof. You grit your teeth and try to think of a way out of here, but you're forced to grab your ears as Ivy snores loud enough to wake the proverbial dead. Apparently the bulb is only soundproof to sounds coming out of the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ivy's loud snoring is the least of your worries as her serpentine trunk moves back and forth in her sleep and lets out a sound that sounds like a combination of a hiss and a whistle. Then you feel the necklace moving and grunt as Ivy's head and neck go back and forth. The necklace moves about and causes you to be tossed about inside right before Ivy turns on her stomach, leaving the necklace and you inside of it to be pinned between her enormous naked breasts. All around, all you could see was reptilian elephant flesh. Ivy wasn't kidding when she said she was a rough sleeper. You might not even survive the night. Ivy then snores loudly into the crystal as her breath fogs up the interior and assaults you with the foul stench. You gag. It smells like rotten meat and peanut butter. And you thought it smelled bad enough from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolls in her sleep again and even causes the necklace to come off and tangle around one of her tusks. You shake your head in your prison. \"I'm going to kill Clover when I get out of this.\" You think to yourself. Then things get much much worse as the necklace begins to slip. You yell and then the necklace slips further as Ivy snores deeply and opens her mouth wide. Despite being a carnivorous monster, she still had the flat teeth of an elephant. You scream as the necklace lowers until the bauble you're trapped in is inside Ivy's mouth as she shuts it. The fact that the chain was incredibly strong and still wrapped around one of Ivy's tusks was the only reason you weren't swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around Ivy's mouth and see that even in her main mouth she has a forked tongue and from the looks of it, it had several piercings. Then you gag because you see her back molars and they were stained with a bizarre green substance, presumably some kind of vegetation. At the sides of her mouth were the roots of her tusks. You groan and then Ivy's tongue begins to assault the bauble and cover your view in grootslang spit, all while her thunderous snoring is rocking the mouth and threatening to make you go deaf. \"I'll make that Clover into a snakeskin wallet,\" you mumble to yourself. \"And then I'll sell her tusks on the black market, I'll....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish, Ivy belches in her sleep and spits the bauble you're inside out, in turn, further tangling you up in the necklace wrapped around her tusk. This mammoth mama was going to be the death of you. What did you do to deserve this torture? Besides the stuff you did of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get any sleep that night, because Ivy spent it tossing and turning and by dawn your ears hurt from her snoring. They are struck with even more pain as Ivy's alarm clock goes off and she uses her trunk to stop it. The elephantine giantess wakes up with a loud yawn and stands up in bed before seeing the necklace with you inside tangled to her tusk. She let out a giggle. \"Somebody had a rough night.\" She said. You stick out your tongue right before Clover uses her snake trunk to unscrew the bauble before it grabs you in its mouth and wraps its tongue around you, making you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy holds you in front of her eye with her serpentine trunk while shaking her big naked body. \"So little man, are we gonna do it my way or do I have to get rough? Ready for a little hanky lanky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your answer?</span></div></div>",

However, you are as usual, blinded by anger and hate towards monsters and your every dark thought is directed squarely at Ivy. \u201cNo way, you fat, ugly, sadistic elephant bitch! I would not touch your filthy groin area with a pole twice as long as Demona back at Under Gloom, you disgusting slag!\u201d You even give Ivy a very obscene gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this does not faze Ivy or even make her upset. Instead Clover\u2019s much more obese mom laughs as he fat naked body is jiggling, her breasts bouncing up and down as the rolls on her fat ass are rippling. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ivy. \u201cYou are a tough nut to crack, but that\u2019s the way I like them.\u201d Ivy\u2019s snake trunk hisses in your face and then coils you as you grunt and even drools on you. But then Ivy smirks. \u201cHowever,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a surefire way to make you mine. If you\u2019re going to be tough, I\u2019m gonna have to get rough.\u201d Ivy puts away her bauble that she had kept you in before she waddles her big and obese elephantine rear right out her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy then makes her way into the bathroom and then she shoves you into her naked armpit and you get bombarded with a wave of stench and sweat as you cough a few times. \u201cThe faster I get cleaned,\u201d said Ivy as she walked her naked and fat body into the shower, the faster we can get dirty.\u201d Ivy then pats her groin and then holds you up to shake her booty in your face. She even lets out a loud fart that nearly makes you go deaf as you gag. You could not believe how disgusting this woman was. As soon as you got out of her, you were going to murder Clover for sticking you with her fat and vulgar mother.<br>\r\n\u2028Then you hear Ivy humming as the snake/elephant hybrid giantess gets into her shower. Her obese form looks almost two big for her to fit and then she turns the shower on, making you yell in pain because the water was hot. Ivy then squeezes you tight as you gag and then she places you on a bar of soap before placing the soap on her shoulder and pushing it down her back. You yell and hang on tight to the soap as it sleds down the fat obese rolls of Ivy\u2019s back and then it starts to slip down Ivy\u2019s butt crack just as Ivy slams her butt into the wall, sandwiching you and the soap between her butt cheeks as she grinds her butt into the wall. You have to hold on tight to the soap but then you scream as you\u2019re slipping into the blackhole that is Ivy\u2019s rump. When it looks like her butt is about to eat you, Ivy holds it up and bends over, causing you and the soap to slide down Ivy\u2019s back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to run but you keep slipping before the big fat pink reptilian elephant lady grabs you again. Ivy then ferociously scrubs her private area with the soap and you try to run up the soap and climb away but you can\u2019t maintain a grip on Ivy\u2019s immense belly. \u201cNo! No! No! No! No!\u201d \u201cYes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!\u201d Ivy then takes the soap and then scrubs you into each armpit as you scream muffled screams and some of the soap even gets in your eyes. Before you can even recover, Ivy shoves you into one of her big and huge elephant ears and uses you as a q-tip. This was utter hell and it was official; Ivy was WAY worse than Destiny could ever hope to be. When Ivy yanks you out of her ear, you\u2019re covered in wax right before she holds you in front of the shower head. You gag as you\u2019re force fed an entire stream of water that washes the earwax away but at the same time, causing some of it to slide down your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy then places you on her head and puts shampoo through her pale blonde hair. You\u2019re slipping through the elephant lady\u2019s hair and you see her huge man-eating ass right down below and force yourself to try and climb the forest of hair in front of you to avoid yet another assault by Ivy\u2019s butt. However, the elephant woman\u2019s huge and fat grootslang fingers try to grab you and after a few times rooting around, succeeds and then the grootslang lowers her snake trunk to blow on you like a handkerchief. You\u2019re in complete disgust and shiver in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy then walks out of the shower and shakes her fat body before she takes a towel and some tape. You grunt as she tapes you to the towel and then uses it to dry her body, pushing you into her scaly pink skin, not the least of all, she grinds you into her butt before pulling you off and then giggling. \u201cNow for the real fun.\u201d Ivy hold you up with her trunk and you look down in fear at her open mouth. \u201cOh no! Don\u2019t you dare do it, you crazy elephant bitch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Ivy drops you down into her awaiting mouth as you yell and then she tilts her head as you land on her tongue. You hold your chest as your heart is racing. You actually thought that she was going to devour you. But then you hear a squirt and see a toothbrush coming and you scream as Ivy\u2019s mouth closes and you\u2019re buffeted by the toothbrush pushing you into her house-sized teeth. You keep on screaming as you slip on the waves of toothpaste and some of the toothpaste gets in your eyes as you keep slipping. You try to maintain your footing on the already slippery tongue just as Ivy\u2019s toothbrush pushes you into her molars. It goes on like this for five minutes until....</span></div></div>",

It looked like the monster version of the Karma Sutra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like what you see, Wade!\" Ivy said through a mouthful of toothpaste. Her booming voice was so loud it was almost deafening. \"I've had this book for decades, and it's brought me limitless enjoyment! I've been waiting a long time to get to the chapter on human intercourse. I'm going to show you things that'll rock your world, my little boytoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the need to throw up and not just from being assaulted by this colossal, elephantine bitch's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's never going to happen you gross slag!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy merely giggled knowingly. You let out a tirade of curses as she slammed her toothbrush into you. Your anger turned into screams of pain and disgust as she brushed you against her tongue. She moaned in pleasure as she savored the taste of human and mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she worked your way to her back teeth. The grotesque vegetation you saw before was back there. Ivy prodded it with her tongue but it didn't come loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lend me a hand, won't you baby?\" she asked. You didn't answer. At least, not in anything other than two words beginning with \"F\" and \"U.\" Ivy tutted. \"No, no, this won't do. You need to learn to do something nice for momma if you want her to do nice things to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you be any more of a disgusting pervert?\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out the answer to that when I get to Chapter 10,\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could hurl another insult she jabbed you with the toothbrush again, forcing your face into the days old vegetable piece stuck in her teeth. You fought the urge to vomit and spit out pieces that got into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ick, ock,\" Ivy said, warning you to hurry. As much as you didn't want to give an inch to your tormentor, the stink of her breath and the toothpaste and the food you were ground into was an unholy combination. You decided this was a small price to pay for getting out of this new hellhole. You grabbed fistfuls of vegetation and began tearing them away. You were close to the back of her throat. A threatening abyss worse than anything in the Under Gloom. You began throwing the pieces you gathered down the throat, where they disappeared to never be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two minutes of work you heard a gurgling sound from her throat. You had just enough time to realize what would happen before a disgusting belch erupted from her throat. The wave of stink washed over you and you wretched. It wasn't as bad as the gas she'd subjected you to from her backend, but it was still bad enough to make your eyes water. Ivy giggled as she heard you gagging on her burp. Promptly she closed her mouth completely around her toothbrush, plunging you into darkness and forcing you to keep breathing in the foul air from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't take it anymore! You needed to get out of this mouth right now! Ivy's grip on the toothbrush had slackened and you seized the opportunity to wiggle free. You fell on her tongue and for one terrifying instant, you remembered the gaping throat right next to you, which would lead you too your doom as surely as it did from pieces of last night's dinner you tossed down there. Carefully you crawled away on your hands and knees, acutely aware of how slippery her tongue was, and started making your way to the front of her mouth. You moved carefully, her awful breath as present as a fog. You'd only gotten a few feet away when Ivy spoke, and the wild movements of her tongue caused you to bounce up and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E erful 'Ade,\" Ivy said. \"E ouldn't ant u to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movements of her tongue caused you to slide backwards. \"No, no, no, no, no, no, noooooooooooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, a small, screaming lump worked its way down Ivy's throat. Her jaw dropped as she realized what happened, and her toothbrush fell from her mouth to the sink with a clatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie,\" she said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your screaming, flailing form fell down the fleshy tube to the eagerly waiting stomach below. You squeezed through the sphincter into Ivy's stomach and landed in a pool of stinging acid. You swam to the closest refuge nearby, a floating peanut shell twice as big as your body, and plopped into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the pulsing sounds of Ivy's inner workings all around you, the cougar grootslang let out a belch even bigger than the one you'd been forced to breath in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Ivy smack her lips. \"Mmm. Tastes like hatred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IVY!\" you screamed. \"YOU FAT, STUPID BITCH! YOU ATE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ivy said with a sigh. \"Oh Wade, why couldn't you just behave yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're blaming me for this?!\" you screamed, outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dear, I did warn you to be careful.\" Leave it to a monster to spin it so the human was to blame for being eaten. \"It's such a shame,\" she said sadly. \"There were so many new tricks I wanted to try out and now I'm going to have to find a new human to test them out on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"find a new human?!\"\" you cried out, anger giving way to fear. \"Puke me up you titanic twit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey,\" Ivy said pityingly. \"I'm a dirty girl. I love dirty things. But there's one dirty thing that I find completely unsexy and that's throwing up. The mere thought of it makes me shudder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one thing that disgusts you? You spent two hours last night farting on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we did have some good times,\" she said fondly, completely missing the point. \"Actually, if you thought I was gassy before, just wait until you see how I react as I digest you. Humans are delicious but really do a number on my insides. I envy my daughter for her strong stomach, if not for her love life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour peanut shell boat began to sneak beneath the surface of the grootslang's stomach acid. You began climbing frantically to the top of the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS ISN'T FUNNY! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry baby, it looks like we just weren't meant to be,\" Ivy said apologetically. \"I really wish things could've ended better. You have spunk. That's rare for a human. If it's any consolation, <i>this</i> elephant will never forget you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peanut shell sank completely and you fell into the tingling liquid and began swimming to the nearest food item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Ivy, if you don't let me out of here, you'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy patted her stomach. \"Oh believe me, baby, by this time tomorrow, I'm going to be feeling very sorry. Actually, I should go and get some antacids from the drugstore now before I forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ivy seemed to give no more thought to her former \"boyfriend\" and started getting ready to go out. You screamed threats as the waves of stomach acid smashed around you but Ivy ignored you. Despite what she said about not forgetting him, without any more fun to be had with her little beau, she'd rather just let him digest. No use dwelling on a bad breakup. Besides, she thought, perking up, that new cashier at the drugstore was a human, and he was really cute too. Maybe love wasn't off the table for this divorcee just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Wade...</span></div></div>",

The tingling sensation spread over your body and with a jolt you realized your clothes were beginning to disintegrate. Despite your earlier vow not to break, at this point, the fear of encroaching death was enough to make you negotiate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, you win! I'll do whatever you want, just let me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stifled a burp into her hand. \"Aw, Wade, that's awfully sweet of you to offer, but it's too late for that. Still, I appreciate you finally showing some concern for my womanly needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anger was so overwhelming that the only thing you could articulate was a series of hate-filled screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Ivy said comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much you continued to beg and threaten, Ivy remained silent. You were forced to endure the pain as the stomach acids ate away at you as Ivy made her way to the drugstore. She hummed absentmindedly to herself as she browsed the indigestion medicine. The human cashier seemed to be on break, so Ivy lurked patiently until he reappeared/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you, mam?\" he asked nervously as Ivy approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I certainly hope so cutie. May you please ring these up for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her sweltering gut, you were forced to listen to the sickening display of Ivy fawning over the cashier. You raged, alternating between insults to Ivy and warnings to the cashier. Luckily for Ivy, the cashier couldn't hear the sounds of her ex digesting through her layers of flab. Her large grootslang ears picked up every word you were saying. She was actually impressed at how filthy your mouth was and depressed that she'd never get to hear it in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sank more and more beneath the stomach acid, your struggles caused Ivy's stomach to gurgle audibly. She blushed as she felt gas build up inside her and she clenched her cheeks shut to keep it in. She ignored it as she continued flirting with the cashier. The little man was so awkward and nervous, she found him just about the cutest thing alive. She doubted he was used to being pursued so aggressively. When she asked him to dinner, he was completely flustered and before he could say no, she took the opportunity to tell him she'd pick him up after work. The little man hung his head in resignation as she paid for her goods and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy walked out awkwardly, doing her best to keep her gas contained. No matter how nasty she acted in private, she preferred to reveal that side of herself with her lovers only. If all went well, she'd get her chance to indulge in that with the human cashier later. Once she was safely alone in the car, she relaxed and let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so loud that Ivy was grateful it didn't shatter her windows. The smell was so foul that her snake trunk gagged on the stench. Ivy broke open the pack of her pills and swallowed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Wade,\" Ivy said playfully, trying to dispel the smell with a wave of her hand. \"I know your jealous, but spare a lady a little dignity, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response from her stomach. She couldn't hear your screams anymore or feel you splashing around. It seemed her stomach had done its job. Ivy shrugged and patted her belly. It was a shame you were gone, but Ivy didn't want to dwell on it. There was no use crying over yesterday's lunch. She continued humming as she drove off, brainstorming what to wear on her date tonight.</span></div></div>",

The massive pink Grootslang brings her hands around, feeling all over her rump and searching for you. You shudder as her fingers brush against you, then pause before they move over you completely and start drumming against you, each one feeling like being pummeled with a 2x4 as if you were a xylophone. Finally, it was only a few seconds later when you can't take anymore that you bit her buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ha! So my widdle Wadey's alive after all! How wonderful! You're a durable little guy! Durable and small enough to fit wherever I want to put you...absolutely perfect!\" Ivy cooed to you with a laugh. She pressed you a little into the flesh of her huge, hot pink-colored ass, which was completely unnecessary as far as you were concerned, seeing as you would have be able to move better in a concrete coffin with how pinned you were to her buttcheek. You felt the world shake as Ivy a.k.a Mystique walks through her house. giving you a tour of sorts. The monstrous mama snicked as she opened a door and went inside the room, kicking the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Lord, where were you? You were stuck facing the ass of Clover's mother, so you couldn't see anything, but she takes care of that for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you're not facing outwards, Little Wade! We're gonna be spending a LOT of time with Mystique here in our love nest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight down a moan. Wonderful...her bedroom! This was WAY worse than Under Gloom! You didn't want to think about what Clover's sex-addict mother was planning for you! You hear a grinding sound like wood on wood, and your heart sinks. What was she up to?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grinned as she opened her underwear drawer and pulls out a pair of rainbow-colored panties. They look far too small for her, and even SHE wondered how they would ever fit on her massive booty...absolutely PERFECT! These were just what she needed to give her new BF some more up-close-and-personal time with her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to struggle enough to where you could turn your head to look over your shoulder as this lustful hybrid starts bending down and moving her legs as if she were stepping into some...thi..ng...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT THAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to look down and your worst fears are confirmed: a pair of panties! You gulp as she pulls them up, but you start feeling smug as they abruptly stop just under her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHA! Take that, you bloated piano component! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour victory was short-lived, however, as with a grunt, Ivy manages to pull them up and they somehow stretch to accommodate her without ripping apart and you're facing the inside of the fabric as she holds the back open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy, my little man! I know I will!\" Ivy cooed huskily before she lets go and the fabric zooms at you and you're pinned even tighter to her huge booty! You try struggling and biting as much as you can, but all that does is make the grootslang goddess giggle. \"Bite me Wade,\" she says. \"Mystique loves it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp as something huge slams into you and once your head stops wringing, you realize that Ivy spanked herself because you got her feeling so turned on with your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sighed blissfully as Wade kept fighting his fate against her butt. Not a single male monster had ever felt this way. Then again, none of them had been a scrappy little speck like this, either. She shook her hips as she felt him against her and she was tempted to smack her butt where he was again. Scratching her butt where Wade was, Ivy smiled as she got an idea of how to enjoy her new human being up against her massive booty even more. </span></div></div>",

As you're trying to ponder a way out of this hell that is an elephant's butt, the grootslang grunts loudly and you gasp in fear. You try to crawl out of the space you're trapped in but all this succeeds in is making you slip further into her bloated body just as she pulls her shorts and snaps them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't see it, but on the outside her shorts actually appear to be smaller than Ivy's panties and her tank top only hides the upper halves of the grootslang's boobs. The elephant/snake hybrid looks at herself in the mirror as her nose gives a lustful hiss and she turns around to shake her planetary booty. \"Comfy in there, babe? she asks you with a giggle. \"Screw you!\" you yell. But it's pointless because the thick pink flesh around you muffles your sounds. Ivy lets out a laugh before walking out the door, grabbing the doorknob with her butt cheeks and then closing it before locking the door with her trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, lover boy,\" she says. \"Mystique has something special planned for the two of us. Today just happens to be the same day as the 276th annual Fearfield triathlon and lucky you, Mama Ivy Mystique is signing her moneymaker up.\" You're now afraid beyond belief at that thought. Ivy was going to partake in a triathlon with you trapped so deep in her can. All that movement and sweat... oh hell no. You'd rather take your chances with Destiny, but by now Clover has probably told Destiny what happened to you and that gargoyle is laughing her own ass off at this fact. You're confined to your fate inside Ivy's rear. If you ever get out of this, the first thing you're going to do is put a contract out on a certain green skinned Valley Girl bitch for putting you in this mess to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your ears are assault by sounds of Ivy's stomping, your pachyderm captor walks into the center of the town where there is a stand to sign up for the triathlon. At the stand, there is a red behemoth woman, a monster resembling a hippopotamus with the skin of a dinosaur and an elongated tale. She had a spade tattoo on one of her boobs and long orange red hair. From the look on her face, she knew Ivy. \"Mrs. Heffle?\" asks the behemoth woman. \"You're in the triathlon?\" \"Hello there Marilyn,\" says Ivy as she writes down her name. \"How is the responsible one of my daughter's roommates? Don't mind me, I'm just on a date with my new B.F.?\" Marilyn just looks around in confusion. \"Where is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Marilyn's phone begun to ring loudly. She took it out and saw a text from Clover that read \"Don't ask!\". Marilyn shrugged her shoulders and soon Ivy was signed up. Inside the monster giantess's crack, you let out a groan. \"This is gonna be hell.\" You say. Soon, the triathlon was about to begin. There was even a reporter dispatched to cover the entire thing; a were bear giantess resembling a cross between a polar bear and Emma Frost was ready with a notebook and a human young man was on her shoulders carrying a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy lined up with several other athletes including a cyclops, a jabberwock, a hydra, a Frankenstein's monster, a manticore, a hippogriff and a Jersey devil just to name a few. You couldn't see, but there had to be at least thirty monsters from the stomping you hear from within Ivy's body. Before long there was a landshark ready with a gun ready to start the race. \"Monsters of all ages! The 276th annual Fearfield triathlon begins now! Ladies and gentlemen! Get ready!\" With that the bullet is shot and you know that the course will be nothing more than grootslang butt hell for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the first event?</span></div></div>",

As if the surroundings weren't convincing enough, you hear her laughing maniacally as she moved across the hallway on all fours and sticks out that long gapping tongue of hers, showing teeth as sharp as knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree was the monster you feared the most. Not only was that hyena the largest of the guards but she was a total maniac who belonged in an asylum and as an inmate rather than a guard. Whenever somebody tried to escape, Cree was all too willing to beat the crap out of them in the worst ways. If she didn't pulverize their bones underneath her large weight, she was mauling them with her sharp fangs \"Maybe someone will feel lucky,\" the werehyena says in that dark pitched voice of hers that sounds somewhat like that of that actress Cree Summer. \"I hope one of the inmates tries to break out today, it's been weeks since I broke someone's bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. You're convinced Cree took this job mainly to cause pain to others. Of all the guards, she was the most sadistic and there was a rumor that on her first day in Under Gloom, Cree attacked an attempted escapee and left her paralyzed for life. But as dangerous she was to other monsters, the hyena was even more dangerous to humans. They were her favorite food and you had seen her down a handful of human inmates who tried to escape and chewed them to bits as they screamed. Then she decided to be really mean that time and stuck out her tongue to show you their chewed up bodies. Most of the human inmates that weren't eaten by other prisoners or the other guards wound up meeting their final resting place in Cree's fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from the looks of it, Cree was waiting for the opportunity to devour any human fool enough to escape. \"Maybe I'll see Wade wondering on his own this morning,\" says the hyena as she begins to drool uncontrollable. \"I overslept and had to skip breakfast today. I think I'll be nice to him when I see him and just swallow him whole.\" You were sweating in fear as you climbed onto Cree's back across the forest of fur and then hide in her long reddish brown hair. This was bad, the most dangerous guard in the entire prison and you were on her like a flea. You had to be very careful if you want to survive, let alone escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you be able to hide from the titanic werehyena in her own fur?</span></div></div>",

You eagerly watched as she passed everything in the prison until she finally exited. This was it! You were out of the prison!  You release your hold on her fur and push away...but you remain on her due to a knot in her fur had wrapped around you, making you stuck to her. This was the worst thing that could've happened at this point, you were being forced to stay with a complete psychopath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Cree returned to her home which happened to be a moderately sized apartment. You spent the entire trip trying to untie yourself from the thick fur of the guard, and you almost have it done. You didn't even notice you were in the lair of the beast because you were so focused on freeing yourself. Cree swung her large body over to her couch just as you finish the knot and drop.

Not surprising given how early the guards have to wake up and how long the trek down the mountain is. You breath a sigh of relief and cover your mouth before you hear Cree snoring away. \"That was too close for comfort,\" you think to yourself. \"Way too close. I can't believe it. This must be Cree's house. Just my luck. From one prison to another. If that fleabag finds out I'm here, I'm dead meat. Literally. But she's asleep. I'll be out before the devil knows I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree lets out a slight snore and swings one of her jaws in her sleep, knocking you off the couch and making you hit the floor. You grunt in pain as you get up. That fall bruised your knees. But you had to get out of here. You can't think of the pain right now. As you walk around looking for an opening to get out, you spot a picture of Clover on a dartboard, not surprising given how much the two guards dislike each other. Oddly, next to it was a photograph of a bespectacled werecheetah girl you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice a photograph that depicted Cree in a wedding dress with another monster in a tux. From the picture, you see that Cree's mate was a rose haired and indigo furred werejackal with one red eye and one blue eye. Surprisingly to you, the werejackal was a woman with an hourglass figure that contrasted with Cree's huge body figure. You had no idea Cree was married let alone lesbian and you gag in disgust. \"There goes the neighborhood.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize something. Anyone who would be married to Cree was most likely just as maniacal. You have to get out of here fast. You then spot an air vent and rub your hands. If you could make your way to the vent, you could get out of the apartment without Cree or her mate knowing you were even there to begin with. Of course, you'd wind up in another apartment most likely with another monster, but anything's better than that guard who filled your life with nightmares during your time in the joint.</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, that red eye of hers was blind given how disfigured it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia walks forward and you have to roll out of the way as the giantess nearly steps on you. She sees Cree zonked out on the couch and smiles. \"Huh, for once you got home first. Looks like someone worked hard today.\" Aurelia walks up to her sleeping mate and scratches at Cree's large belly, causing the werehyena to grunt in ecstasy in her sleep. Cree gets up and smiles at her wife. \"Oh, Aurelia. I didn't hear you open the...\" Cree interrupts herself with a slight yawn. Aurelia cracks an evil smirk and you shiver in place. \"So, who did you maim today? Tell me it was that shishi girl in C-Block. I heard she was the college roommate of that stupid werecheetah Grace.\" \"Oh I beat her good. That'll teach her a thing or two about plagiarism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses laugh maniacally and you bite your fingers. It was definitely a match made in hell. Then you gag and hold your mouth so neither of them could hear you because Cree and Aurelia are tongue kissing each other and Aurelia even licks the side of Cree's nose. You feel like you're gonna be sick. \"So,\" says Cree. \"Did you catch him yet?\" Aurelia clenches her hand into a fist. \"That human Tim got lucky. I had him halfway down my throat and then I sneezed.\" Oh no. Just as you thought. Cree's wife was as much of a predator as Cree. You don't know whether the jackal or the hyena was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bad break honey,\" says Cree. \"I didn't have much success with Wade either today. I didn't even see the little morsel. If Clover ate him before me, she'll be wearing her trunk as a necktie.\" Aurelia takes off what you see as a tool belt and lays it on the coffee table. She must've been a carpenter or handy woman. That implied she was smarter than Cree and that made you shiver. \"Well,\" says Aurelia. \"Why don't I get dinner ready. We both could use a good meal after today.\" Cree nods her head and then goes to set the table. You then realize you have to get out of here. If either of those giantesses saw you, you were dog meat, literally. You have to run right towards the vent while you can, but Aurelia walks by and you stop in your tracks. You really hope you can get out unnoticed.</span></div></div>",

You hold your breath and step away from her, hoping she won't find you. She turns her head and sniffs in another direction, giving you a view of her messed up eye. Just as you think she won't find you she turns her head and her good eye zeroes in on you. \"Ah ha!\" she says. You immediately take off running to try and escape. The booming steps of Aurelia behind you spur you on. As you near the vent you feel that you're going to make it. Those overgrown mutts won't get you! Unfortunately fate intervenes. Something slams down in your path and you crash into it. Rubbing your head you see that its Cree's foot. \"What's wrong babe?\" she asks Aurelia from above. That stupid hyena just ruined everything! \"I just found a human in our home. Just check your feet.\" Aurelia tells her. Cree looks down and her eyes lock onto you. \"Wade!\" she shouts, and in a flash her paw tries to grab you. You narrowly avoid her and run away, but soon Aurelia is upon you. You might be able to get away from one of them, but two monster giantesses isn't so easy. Just as you get away from Cree you run into the pad of Aurelia's paw. Soon you are hoisted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is Wade huh?\" the werejackal says as she inspects you. With a couple of booms Cree walks over to you. \"Yup thats him.\" she says, and gives your head a poke. You yank an arm free and attempt to punch her finger. \"Whoa there little guy!\" Aurelia says with a laugh. \"Quite a temper on him huh? He's a lot more feisty than the human from my work!\" You turn and stare up at your captor. \"I'll show you a temper you freak!\" you shout. Aurelia just flicks your head. \"Thats big talk coming from the little man who got caught.\" she says. \"Yeah, and it took two of you to catch me one-eye.\" you retort. Cree leans in closer and bares her fangs. \"Watch what you say Wade! Thats my wife!\" she snarls. Aurelia puts a paw on her shoulder. \"Relax, soon he'll be our little snack.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia then licks your body, tasting you. You wipe off the disgusting saliva and prepare to curse her out, but are assaulted by another tongue. Cree starts licking you as well, mixing her saliva with her wife's. Soon both of them are tasting you, running their gross slimy appendages all over your body. Just when you think it can't get any worse Aurelia scoops you up with her tongue and pulls you into her mouth. You look around at her teeth and think she's going to eat you. However the mouth opens and Cree's tongue enters, knocking you around in the process. You watch in horror as the two giant tongues wrestle around, saliva dripping from the ceiling. As if remembering you one of the tongues snatches you up and brings you into the mix. You find yourself in the middle of their tongue wrestling match, and are passed back and forth between the two mouths. The experience almost makes you throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight appears as the mouth you are currently in opens and the tongues separate. As they pull apart you find yourself stuck in a strand of saliva and are pulled outside as well. Once you're out you see that you were inside Cree's mouth. When the strand breaks you fall down, but her cleavage breaks your fall. You cling to the fur of her breast while simultaneously cursing them out loud. \"Looks like he made it out okay.\" Cree says with a smirk. Her and Aurelia are looking down on you.\"Guess we should finally get to dinner.\" Aurelia steps closer and wraps her arms around Cree's waist, pushing their breasts together. \"We could have dinner....or we could head to the bedroom instead.\" she suggests. \"That little game of tongue twister just now really put me in the mood.\" As she holds her lover closer you are squeezed by the four gigantic boobs. Cree thinks for a second before responding.</span></div></div>",

I think instead of eating you we're going to do something a bit different.\" You scowl at her and Aurelia pokes her face into view. \"But don't worry human, We'll still be satisfying our hunger.\" she says coyly. Realization dawns on you and you look from Aurelia to Cree. \"No way! You're not using me as some sex toy!\" you yell as you struggle. You've never been against a little girl on girl action but between monsters? Thats just wrong! You don't have a choice however as Cree begins to walk away with you in hand. You feel her jump a little as her wife slaps her playfully on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple enters their bedroom and shuts the door. You of course are still struggling. Suddenly you find yourself hurtling through the air when Cree tosses you to the bed. When you land you bounce a few times until you end up on your stomach. With a groan you pick yourself up and look upwards. Cree and Aurelia are making out again. The sounds of their sloppy kisses are making you nauseous and you don't feel like being in the middle again. You run toward the edge of the bed as fast as you can in an attempt to escape. A shadow looms over you and you look back in time to see a wall of fur descending on you as Cree flops down onto the bed with Aurelia on top of her. They're still in the middle of kissing and begin moving around. Eventually they roll off of you and you try to crawl away. You don't get very far before a claw grabs you and whisks you away. \"Ah ah ah, you're not getting away little guy.\" Aurelia says as she holds you up. \"Me and my wife here are gonna have some fun, and you're helping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia places you on the tip of Cree's breast, right on the nipple. You don't have much time before her gigantic muzzle comes down and latches on, covering you in darkness. She begins licking and sucking Cree's boob, swirling you around inside her mouth in the process.In a blind attempt to stop you grab onto whatever you can. Turns out you've grabbed onto Cree's nipple, which arouses her even more. When Aurelia pulls back you are once again brought along by a strand of saliva. She  picks you up and moves you toward Cree's crotch. You manage to come to your senses in time to see where you're headed. \"No way!\" you shout. \"Put me down you over sized lesbian mutt!\" Aurelia smiles lustfully. \"Oh you're going down all right.\" she says. You are then pressed against Cree's crotch and and massaged by two fingers. The were hyena moans and twists about in pleasure. When the torment stops you are momentarily relieved. Suddenly though your view is filled by Aurelia's face. She begins using her tongue to pleasure her wife, taking you along for the ride. After a while of this you are laying on the bed in a puddle of saliva and Cree's juices.</span></div></div>",

Looking forward to this afternoon?\" It was Clover, that grootslang guard that was also out to eat you. She and Cree had made a bet with each other on which of them will eat you first. Ignoring Clover's \"lardball\" comment, Cree replied \"Not that it's any of your business, hose nose, but yes, I am looking forward to this afternoon. There are only two things I love more than the taste of humans, and that's beating the inmates to a pulp, and scaring the shit out of the little punks that come through here every month.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many prisons, Under Gloom has a program that exposes young monsters who are at risk of becoming criminals to the realites of life in prison. Every month a group of such monsters is given a tour of the facility, and shown where they'll end up if they don't change their ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gives you an idea. Perhaps you can jump ship from Cree to one of the kids. It might be safer than your current situation, or it might not. But anything's got to be better than risking this sadistic hyena bitch finding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Cree and Clover are both in the prison lobby, standing in front of a group of teenage monster girls of various species. You had been hiding in Cree's hair this whole time, waiting to get your chance. Just then, Destiny enters the room and stands before the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Under Gloom, or as it's known to our inmates, Hell. Each of you had better listen to what I'm about to say, because I'm only saying it once. You are here because you chose to make the wrong decisions in life, and so your parents have given us custody of you all for the day. So for the next six hours, I'm your new mommy. And guess what? I'm a mother who believes in the tough love policy. Ask any inmate here, and they'll tell you that you do not want to mess with this mama, or the punishment will be severe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that one of the girls, a weretiger, let out an unimpressed \"Pfft\". In an instant, Destiny stormed over toher and got right in her face. \"What the hell was that? Do you think this is funny? That I'm joking when I say none of us will hesitate to put you in your place?\" The tigress just rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, you're not taking the situation seriously.\" Said Destiny with a sneer \"Well, we''ll soon fix that. Clover, take this one to the Dark Side and put her in an empty cell. We'll see how serious she is then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover grabs the tiger's wrist and takes her away. Meanwhile Destiny turns things over to Cree, who cackles evilly and she stares down at the group, slapping her nightstick against her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, fresh meat. You little pukes know what my job is? To tenderize new meat. My favorite sound in the world is the sound of bones shattering after I give them a good beating with this.\" She brandished her nightstick, pointing it in a dragon girl's face as she was shaking with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree orders the group to follow her, where are they going?</span></div></div>",

A grootslang is a creature said to be a cross between a snake and an elephant. While Clover had the body of an anthro African elephant, she had green skin with the hood of a cobra around her head just underneath her blonde hair and her trunk ended in a snake's head and let out a hiss. Clover was the second most dangerous of the guards after Cree. Despite being part elephant, she was a hardcore carnivore who loved to fill her belly with humans. The snake head at the end of her trunk gave her a second mouth. You've seen her even use it to snatch up some human inmates that tried to escape before she spat the bones out of her other mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made Clover dangerous to you was that she had a rivalry with Cree and would like nothing better than to eat you before the werehyena giantess got the chance. To avoid detection, you quickly climb up Clover's leg and hide in her shorts. At that moment outside, Clover held her trunk up to sniff around before she let out a trumpet and a hiss at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Clover lets out a groan. \"I am starving,\" she says. \"Those last few humans that tried to escape were almost mine. Stupid furball Cree. Well, Wade better be like, totally prepared to die, because when I see him...\" Cree makes the snake head at the end of her trunk hiss and lick its lips as you shiver in place.

That lousy carbuncle! I'll bet it was her! When I get my hands on her...\" But you didn't care, you were free. Clover was unintentionally taking you to freedom. But then you look down to see how high you were, stuck in Clover's underwear. A fall from there would be enough to kill you. You have to stay here for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Clover reaches her home, which surprisingly is a large manor house that looked big enough for four people and you even let out a whistle before you stop yourself.

Did you like, change the locks again. That is totally lame.\" The door then opens up and Clover is facing a giantess the same height as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis giantess is a red skinned behemoth, a type of monster resembling a hippopotamus with a dragon's skin. The behemoth girl has long orange hair and a spade tattoo over her right breast and she doesn't appear happy to see Clover. \"You're late again.\" \"Hello! What do you expect? I'm a guard, it's not like I can get out of the library at three like you Marilyn.\" Clover walks in and there's another monster on the couch, a giant kappa woman resembling a massive Galapagos tortoise with a purple shell with one heart shape in the back. The kappa girl is occupied watching TV on the couch as she turns her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh, someone's in the doghouse.\" \"Shut up Shinzo,\" says Clover. \"Marilyn, why did you, like lock me out. We're supposed to be roommates.\" As Clover is speaking to the behemoth woman, you slide down Clover's leg and roll under the coffee table before Marilyn can step on you. \"Don't give me that lip,\" says Marilyn. \"You deserve it for eating the humans I was saving for dinner.\" You then gulp because Clover wasn't the only predator under this roof. \"What are you talking about? I didn't touch them.\" \"But Diamond said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at this point you hear annoying laughter and a bright orange-yellow furred monster resembling an overweight mountain lioness with a crystal in her forehead walks down from upstairs on all fours. \"You are so gullible Marilyn.\" \"Diamond!\" yells Clover. \"You dirty Carbuncle! I was almost fired today thanks to you.\" Diamond just gives a smug look. \"That would be doing you a favor hose face.\" Clover's trunk hisses as the Grootslang giantess gets all worked up. Shinzo the kappa shakes her head and starts to eat some kind of snack food from a bag. She drops a piece and it lands by you and you gasp in horror to see that it was a candied human skull. You definitely picked the wrong place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilyn lets out a sigh and then taps herself on the forehead. \"This happens every single day! How am I going to make my famous human stock when I run out of humans before dinner?\" \"Well Marilyn,\" says Diamond. \"What do you like expect?

Simone was chattering about as she walked down the hallway and looked around, pausing only to eat at a banana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and try to hide beneath the fur.

That doesn't necessarily make it a safe ride for you, because Simone is leaping across the prison and swinging through the bars as she makes her rounds. She just had to be a monkey based monster. At the end of the day, the nue woman punches out and you smile because it wouldn't be long before you're out of this hellhole prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Simone leaves the prison, you expect her to take the road that leads down the mountain. Unfortunately, instead Simone rapidly climbs down the mountainside, almost making you scream before you cover your mouth. Simone chatters as she climbs down the mountain. You don't dare look down, so you look up, but all you can see is the giant nue's scarlet red booty. You're disgusted. She just had to be a baboon with tiger limbs and a snake for a tail. It takes twenty minutes before Simone reaches the bottom of the mountain and heads for the forest, jumping through the trees, all while you hold onto her finger-like toes. Simone leaps through several more trees and you almost throw up before she lands at what looks like a verandah atop a treehouse like one you'd see in a Donkey Kong game. You're guessing that this is Simone's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the nue giantess just opens the door, apparently it was unlocked. Why would she leave her door unlocked. You soon learn the answer because as Simone walks into the house, you hear more chittering but a higher pitch than Simone's. Then to your surprise, three nue children run up to Simone. One of them looked like a child version of Simone, another one had stripes over their monkey body but no stripes on their tiger limbs and the third one had black fur in contrast with Simone's white fur and white tiger limbs rather than the usual yellow orange. Because of their age you couldn't tell their gender. The nue children jump into Simone's arms as she hugs them. You're guessing that those smaller monkeys are Simone's children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Simone's children hop away to the side, you jump off of Simone's foot and then see another nue coming, this time an adult male the same size as Simone that appeared to have longer fur than Simone as well as a slight mustache and thick eyebrows. This nue lets out a deeper chitter and Simone chitters back before walking up to the male hue as their tails wrap together in the shape of a heart. You're guessing that this was Simone's husband. From the sound of it, they didn't need actual words to communicate. Not that you understood monkey or cared. Your only thought was getting out of here, so you make a rush to the door. Sure you had to climb a tree in order to escape but at least you were out of prison.</span></div></div>",

Then you see that this foot ended in talons like that of a bird and several blue feathers as big as you come down. You look up and see that you had hitched a ride on Icy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy was a snowbird harpy, similar in appearance to an Articuno, but with an hourglass figure and a beaked face. She was still relatively new here, Icy recently graduated from high school and was hired by Destiny to work as a guard, that was just last week. As such Icy was still a little green and was easily the least competent of Destiny's guards. Not that it wasn't expected, the rest of the guards had to be at least ten years older than the harpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you quickly climb the foot the hide in the feathers above Icy's knees. Icy may still be a newbie, but she was as dangerous as Cree and Clover. You didn't think a skinny thing like her could put away the humans, but you were wrong. What's worse was that Icy could generate extremely cold breezes by flapping her wings and could freeze humans solid. You once even saw her pick up a frozen human and lick him like a popsicle. You couldn't let your guard down around this giant bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy flaps around as she holds her keys in one of her clawed feet and was humming to herself before she hit her head on the ceiling and had to shake it off. \"Ouch,' she says. \"Okay, better be more careful about flying indoors. I can't believe this. I still can't believe I managed to hold a job for one whole week and such a sweet one. I wonder how Cousin Elle's doing in Horrorville. Oh, I hope I get to catch some humans trying to escape. Gee, I wonder if Cree and Clover like me. Simone's kinda cool, but those other two are scary. Wait, maybe I need to find out the names of the guards on the other levels. Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh and continue to climb the feathered titaness. It was going to be a long day with her. Hopefully that bird won't find you, or you're sunk.</span></div></div>",

Of course, you had to climb up the inside of Icy's pant leg because in the same room was Destiny, no doubt checking up on Icy as Icy was punching out. \"You're in a good mood, Icy.\" Said Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Icy. \"Hi warden. I'm just very happy that it's been exactly one week since I started work at Under Gloom.\" Destiny just gives a stare Icy's way. \"Don't get cocky just because you lasted a week. That just means you've proven yourself able to live that long. Remember, this is the most dangerous work environment possible. Too many things can go horribly wrong. In this job, your first mistake could be your last. You never know what the bastards could be up to, which is why you must be ready for everything.\" Icy nodded her head all while you were secretly moving your mouth to mock Destiny. She had to be the most uptight bitch you've ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Icy shook hands with Destiny and was walking away. \"I'll keep that in mind, Warden. See you tomorrow night.\" Once Icy was out of the prison, she spread her wings and flew over it, giving you a good view of below. You see all the inmates in the prison recreational yard and you even see a weremole guard overseeing Darcy as she's pulling weeds in the prison garden. \"Sayonara suckers!\" you call down from above, making sure that Icy didn't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the ice harpy was flying over Fearfield when she reached a small house in the suburbs.It looked like a dump but it was apparently good enough for that bird. Icy flies down and lifts up a lawn gnome, revealing the key to the front door underneath, which she uses to open the door. As she walks in, you see a mat that reads \"Bless the Nest\". Kinda tacky. Inside the house, you see several boxes that haven't even been opened yet. From the looks of it, Icy hadn't finished moving in. Unsurprising, she seemed like the kind of person who had just moved out of her parents' basement after coming out of college. You even see a cap and gown on the couch. The girl was more green than you thought. No wonder Destiny lectured her as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now the rookie made the mistake of bringing you out of prison into her house. You let out a laugh and survey your surroundings. You see a poster on the wall of a harpy resembling a thunderbird who was dressed like a DJ and working a turntable. Below it was a photograph of Icy with the exact same thunderbird, implying they were related. \"I think I deserve a treat for making it this far on my first job.\" Said Icy as she picked up the phone and was dialing a number for the pizza place. While Icy is busy ordering the pizza, you try to survey any potential way to get out of here before the harpy knows your here and you see the only immediate way is out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Icy is finished ordering her pizza, you make a run for the door. This was it, you were finally going to be free. But it would seem that destiny (the concept, not the gargoyle) isn't on your side because at that moment...</span></div></div>",

Bona Fete is a 950 ft tall gargoyle with grey skin and black hair with a muscular figure. The woman wore all black with combat boots, kevlard pants and a chestplate with a Punisher style skull on it. Bona was infamous throughout the monster world for being the world's most dangerous bounty hunter. She's captured and killed all kinds of criminals from graffiti artists to terrorists and half the cells in Under Gloom itself were filled up thanks to her. Bona was a loose cannon willing to kill any of her targets no matter what they've done and has had many run ins with the police due to her harsh methods. What made her really scary was that her arms were covered with tattoos and she adds a new one for everyone she manages to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny knew Bona well because Bona's father was the same man who sired Destiny's own daughter. While Destiny didn't think much of Bona Fete, she knew the perfect way to punish you for trying to escape.

As Destiny walks in, her ears twitch and she gives a scowl. You step back to be extra careful and Destiny looks up at the vent. Fortunately you get out of the way before she sees you. Destiny grits her teeth as she walks up to her desk. \"That had better be a vermin problem,\" she says to herself. \"Because I'd really hate to hear you tried to escape again Wade.

Nobody is getting out of Under Gloom until they've paid their debt to society, if they can pay it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver in place and begin to sweat. Destiny didn't know you were right above her but was talking as if she did and even threatening you. This woman does not like you at all. Down below Destiny lets out a sigh as she takes a seat at her desk and begins to pour herself a cup of coffee as she resumes that stone faced look of hers. \"Any minute now, Wade will try to escape, Belladonna will try to usurp me again. Man, I hate mornings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here. It was way too risky to be above Destiny, but you see that you're on the other side of the vent and have to go back to find a different root. You run through the vent opening, but then you trip and start to fall. \"Oh no,\" you think to yourself. \"Not now. Please not now.\" But it was too late, you fall and slip through one of the holes in the vent opening and you were falling down. You hold your fingers as you plummet and hope that wherever you land Destiny doesn't notice you because if she does, you're dead meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate isn't on your side because as you plummet towards Destiny's desk you land...</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't last ten seconds with your stomach acids lizard hips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really tempted fate back there.

So, Priscilla, do you want to tell me, or would you rather spend your Pit sentence with leeches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! Me and Wade made a potion that gave you LOS!\" Priscilla said. You sigh. Apparently someone has a fear of leeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, Priscilla, congratulations. You get to spend a full YEAR in the Pit. Icy, take her back, but leave Wade.\" Destiny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy dumps you in Destiny's hand and leads Priscilla away. Destiny eyes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, asshole, what should I do with you? Eating you is too good for you, so what to do...\" Destiny thinks for a minute, drumming her fingers on her massive left tit. \"Got it! I'm going to...\"</span></div></div>",

She had gained more than a little weight since you last saw her. Heck, she looked even fatter than Cree. For one thing, her face was so puffy that it looked like she had multiple chins. For another thing, her belly was bulging out and looked like it was as wide as she was tall, which was really saying something as a pair of now oversized breasts resting on the rolls. Finally, her ass had to be at least 1300ft wide and her wings looked too small to get all that weight off the ground. Destiny was clearly so mad that her eyes were already glowing bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief!\" yelled Lockette. \"What happened to you?\" Destiny looks down on you and pushes down her massive stomach in order to get a good look as she bore her fangs. \"That vial your parasite tried to buy from that kappa woman was filled with nebutori! Wade, I oughta skewer you alive. This is worse than high school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say. \"If you ask me, it's an improvement, Demona!\" Destiny lets out a snarl. \"Correct,\" you say. \"Make that Demon<i>ass</i>!\" Destiny's eyes glowed even brighter with rage. \"Nebutori?\" asks Lockette. \"Wade, you have no idea what you just did? Nebutori is a virus that effects women of all species and makes them morbidly obese and lethargic.\" Destiny nods her head as she growls right through her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a smug smile. \"Oh really? So that's what turned old Blueberry face into a blue whale.\" \"Don't get fresh, Wade.\" Says Destiny. \"What are you going to do, Demona?\" you ask mockingly. \"Sit on me?! I'll bet your ass could smash Japan!\" Destiny is so mad she turns a shade of purple. \"I wouldn't laugh if I were you, you little cockroach,\" mumbles the gargoyle giantess. \"The effects of nebutori are...\"</span></div></div>",

Except for you, ALL of them!\" \"And how may I ask is that <i>my</i> problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear grunting and look behind yourself to see Lockette was on her knees and appeared to be getting taller as well as fatter. Her neck was becoming as thick as a watermelon while her jumpsuit was tearing apart as she tried to grab her bulging belly. Destiny wasn't kidding about the nebutori spreading fast but you're still unintimidated. \"Whoop de doo,\" you say. \"Now there's even less room in the cell thanks to Lockette's fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up, Wade,\" says Destiny. \"Because pretty soon, the entire prison is going to be against you.\" You stick out your tongue and can  see Destiny's veins even through all her newly acquired fat. This provokes the gargoyle into giving you the finger as she waddled away, her loincloth tearing up with every step.\" Lockette herself was on the ground in pain as her stomach continued to bulge and you even moan as you're pushed into the bars by Loch Ness Monster flesh. From across your cell, you see Ariel and from the looks of it, she was so obese that her prison jumpsuit had been reduced to a thong. She glares at you as her cheeks puff up. \"Thanks a lot, Wade,\" the gremlin giantess says. \"You really did it this time.\" \"Bite me, Ariel.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel shows her claws as some of her bulk seems to seep out through the bars on the jail cell. \"I'll do more than that if I get my hands on you, you bad and mean human.\" You just blow out your tongue. All over the prison, the nebutori had spread to guards and inmates. The inmates were on the floor from broken prison beds and the hallways shook as the fattened guards walked through. Some take it better than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone is looking back at her rear in despair. Being a nue and therefore a baboon based creature, Simone already had quite a butt on her, but now it was even wider than she was and she was shrieking in panic. \"Easy, Simone,\" says Cree as she waddles in more bloated than usual, her stomach sliding across the floor. \"Chill.\" Clover walks to the side of Cree and being a grootslang she was already obese before, but now her thighs were so thick that her feet were padding and her face was buried in her boobs as her snake nose was even thicker than Lockette's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't like the thinnest monster before, but this is ridiculous.\" \"At least your roommates took it well,\" says Cree as she pressed against the side of her stomach. \"I had to sleep on the couch last night. Aurelia is still sore with me for infecting her.\" Then there's a crash on the ground. The other three guards look back to see Icy. Her belly and butt had gotten so big that the harpy could barely fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover let out a sigh. \"Wade really did it this time. Destiny's even more pissed than she usually is.\" \"Can't blame her,\" says Cree. \"I heard she was fat in high school. It would be frustrating to gain back all that weight and more. I just hope the inmates don't get to him first. I have dibs on Wade.\" Clover then bumps Cree with her rear to knock the hyena grumbling on her back and waving her feet in the air. \"Like, in your dreams.\" Says Clover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you will find out just how sore the prisoners are...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before we start in the cafeteria, we'll start in Destiny's office where Destiny is ferociously stress eating donuts, shoving the pastries into her enlarged cheeks as her eyes glowed red. She had gotten so much bloated that her ass completely engulfed her chair. Belladonna was there as well and she had gotten extremely bloated with a titanic stomach that was twice as wide as she was tall and a pair of E-cup breasts, huge hips and a bloated tail that was occasionally dripping out poisonous ooze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that Wade,\" mutters Destiny as she shoves a jelly donut into her mouth. \"Every guard and inmate in this prison is now a walking blimp because he ****ed around with that damned nebutori. Fate laughed her ass off when she saw what that junk did to me. For once, <i>she's</i> the skinnier gargoyle in the family.\" \"I don't like this any better than you do, boss,\" says Belladonna as she tries to lift her stomach. \"Look at me. I look like one of those stripper for <i>FatCat</i> Magazine. So, what are you going to do with Wade?\" Belladonna snatches up a cruller to stuff into her greedy mouth as Destiny chugs an entire gallon of coffee milk before letting out a thunderous belch. \"I don't know,\" says the gargoyle warden. \"I can't think of a punishment severe enough.\" Destiny lays her massive belly on her chest and then scratches it. \"This really is a pickle. Nebutori has the all too annoying side-effect of amplifying the victim's appetite. It's gonna take the whole government's budget to feed the prisoners.\" \"Destiny,\" says Belladonna as she scratches her ass with her stinger tail. \"You know the food in the cafeteria is barely edible. Some of it is even mildly poisonous.\" Destiny plays with her rolls on her stomach before responding. \"It ain't cheap, Belladonna,\" the gargoyle says with a belch. \"And the antidote for nebutori takes a while to make.\" Suddenly Destiny makes a face as if a lightbulb was appearing over her head. Belladonna gives a smile at her boss and shows her hundreds of fangs. \"It looks like to me you have an idea Destiny. Destiny smiles evilly and then she nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you and Lockette were in line for chow in the cafeteria. Lockette was so bloated that her head looked like a zit on her enlarged neck, her stomach was being held up by her knees and her prison jumpsuit had been reduced to a loincloth to hold in her massive lower body. You were on Lockette\u2019s shoulder as the Loch Ness giantess bends her neck to glare at you. She wasn\u2019t the only one though. Several of the guards were there. Cree, Clover, Icy and Simone were there and very bloated as well as the onryo, Aria Tazel. She had massive breasts before but now they were touching the ground. She also now had a large ass and multiple chins that were barely hidden by her long hair. She was glaring at you and let out a snarl. You just give her the finger but she shows her scary teeth. \u201cWade,\u201d mutters Lockette. \u201cYou might want to reconsider your candor.\u201d You flip Lockette off but then you see that she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, there were several guards from other levels that looked just as miffed as the other guards, to say nothing of the numerous prisoners that were bloated as well. Five of them in particular stood out to you. There was a bloated light blue skinned sawshark-type landshark woman with long blonde hair and red flower tattoos on one side of her body. Her name was Hack and she was a guard from level 3. Her biggest parts of her body were her belly and thighs. Another of the guards was named Mona and came from level 1. She was a pale grayish green werelizard with light bluish green hair worn in dreadlocks. She had an enormous belly and E-cup breasts and four chins that rested on it as she flickered her forked komodo dragon-like tongue at you. The next of the guards came from level 7. She was a palish pink skinned pegasus girl with blonde and crimson hair worn in a beehive and glasses. Unusual for a horse, she had fangs. She had a rather large butt and F-Cup breasts. Her name was Crescent and she had once stuffed you in her armpit during one of your failed escape attempts. All three of the guards glared at you as much as Cree and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lockette currently had three of the inmates right in front of you in line for chow. First of them was Arethusa, the mad bomber dragoness. Arethusa's hips and ass were so big at this point that each cheek had to be 1000ft wide, to saw nothing of her bloated looking neck, slight paunch and larger breasts. The dragon's leather wings looked like they were chicken wings on her bloated body. Arethusa turns and snorts fire at you and Lockette. Next was Mariah, the centaur rapist. Her legs were so thick they looked like chicken legs. Her quagga belly was dragging across the ground, making her hooves barely able to touch the ground while her human torso looked like it belonged to a 600lbs woman. Each of her naked breasts looked like an E-cup. Darcy was reduced to a gaseous green ethereal blob who looked like a ghostly plant version of Jabba the Hutt. This said nothing of the dozens of inmates that were already seated who were glaring at you like a you were a child rapist. \"This is a fine mess.\" Says Lockette as Darcy is given her food. \"Don't blame me. It's all that stupid Kappa's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette just lowers her head and glares at you just as Mariah is next in line. \u201cI am really getting fed up with you and the way you treat me. There are going to be changes around here and not very pleasant ones for you, buster.\u201d You just give Lockette the finger and Lockette does something that really shocks you. She tries to bite your finger off. You didn\u2019t know she had it in her. But then you see Arethusa walking away with her tray of food and then its yours and Lockette\u2019s turn. The prison cook was a black barked and possibly undead mandrake woman resembling a dead tree. She was as bloated as the others and her skull like face was extremely puffy. The cook laid a ton of unidentifiable prison food onto Lockette\u2019s tray and tosses you what looks like an expired chickpea. \u201cHey!\u201d you yell. \u201cIs this all I get?\u201d The cook just gives a hiss as she stares at you. \u201cThanks to you we need the rest of our rations to feed the rest of the prisoners. You stick your tongue out as Lockette walks out to find a place to sit. However, it isn\u2019t easy since everyone is sore at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one table with several inmates including Ariel who was just as fat as she was yesterday. Shelly was there too, the bitch and from the looks of it she was so obesely fat that her shell looked ready to crack. Then there was Elaine. The kitsune\u2019s thighs and breast were the biggest parts of her body whereas her face, arms and belly were mildly puffed. Along with them was Bebe, the only girl happy to see you (Shelly was lowering her head to keep suspicion away from herself). The Cheshire cat was now a 1500ft tall ball of lard with a massive stomach, a butt as wide as she was tall and huge H-cup breasts. She smiled as she waved for you and Lockette to join her and the other inmates. As Lockette sat down, the table broke down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade-ums!\" yells Bebe as she purrs and waves her tale. \"Come here. I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of people are mad at you. But don't worry, I'll protect you.\" Before you can even reject Bebe, Ariel shows her teeth at you before violently shoveling food into her mouth. Elaine stuffs her face with globs of food and then lets out a belch. \"We oughta eat him after everything he did to us.\" All the inmates were clamoring and it took the guards to hold them back from going after you. \"Smooth move, Wade,\" said Lockette with a mouth full of food. \"Now everyone's against you. It can't get worse for you from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamous last words because there's suddenly intercom static. \"Attention all inmates and staff,\" says Destiny over the intercom. \"Due to the nebutori outbreak, I've proposed something to relieve you of a lot of frustration. There will be an eating contest in the cafeteria in forty-five minutes. All guards and inmates are eligible to enter. The grand prize will be Prisoner 666, <i>Wade Wilson</i>!\" Your face turns pale. \"WTF DEMONA!\" you yell in your head before Destiny continues. \"The winner will do with him as they wishes because from that point on, he will be her property.\" Lockette gulps as all the guards and inmates look at you menacingly, except for Bebe who is smiling sweetly and rubbing her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" You moan to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Destiny was offering you as a prize in an eating contest and most of the would-be contestants want you dead because of that damned nebutori. You were fuming mad. \"You scummy blue fat gargoyle bitch!\" you shout at the intercom. \"I hate you, Demona, you blue, blue azure bastard!\" Lockette let out a mumble. \"This can't possibly end well for you,\" she says. \"99% of everyone in the prison wants to take you apart for making them chunky obese.\" \"Well, it's tough titty for them,\" you say. \"Because you're going to win the contest and get me out of this mess. Lockette grunts as she lowers her bloated neck in order to eat her prison food. \"Oh no,\" says Lockette. \"Not this time. You're on your own. Every time I've tried to help you, it's bitten me in the ass and my ass is now a LOT bigger.\" \"****ing dinosaur!\" you yell at Lockette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a whistle and turn to see a smile forming on Bebe's bloated cheeks. From the looks of it, Bebe would be three tons if she was human-sized. You groaned. The only hope you had was if the winner was that obese, lovestruck pussycat. Goody gee. You even pull on your hair as you hear monsters taunting you. \"I'm gonna swallow you up, Wade,\" said Mona. \"And then I'm going to regurgitate you and do it again.\" \"You're gonna make a very good buttplug, Wadey.\" Taunts Mariah. Arethusa breathes fire in your general direction and Elaine gives you the evil eye. \"You're going to be scrubbing the inside of my pussy for the rest of your life when I get my hands on you.\" Says Ariel. Clover gives a hiss and Priscilla moves her fingers across her throat. Shelly just lowers her head, glad that you're taking the blame instead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until the 45 minutes pass, there are at least twenty contestants, including a good majority of the guards, inmates from all levels and even some Dark Side inmates. The only people you're sure aren't part of the contest other than Lockette are Aria, who has problems with her gag reflex, Persephone, who wasn't allowed outside of her cell and Shelly, who probably doesn't want anyone to connect her to the nebutori. Even Belladonna is taking part in the competition. All of the girls looked as though they would weigh at least a few tons had they been human-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny was acting as the referee and looked the most obese of them all. She had bloated so badly that she had resorted to using a cane. She had you locked in a cage necklace that is sandwiched between her mountainous boobs and the rolls of fat on her stomach. \"As soon as I get out of here, Demona,\" you say to Destiny. \"I swear....\" \"You swear you'll <i>what</i>?\" asks the ginormous gargoyle as you look up at her multiple chins. \"You're in no position to be making any threats, you worthless pile of pest. You're finally getting what you deserve for this nebutori incident.\" You just give Destiny the finger, prompting her to make you gag as she stuffs the cage between a couple of rolls on her stomach. The cook then scurries and wobbles up to Destiny. \"Warden,\" she says. \"This is a very bad idea. We've barely got enough food to feed everybody as is.\" Destiny gives an even smirk that is even creepier with her chipmunk cheeks. \"It will all be worth it to put this troublemaking, racist, obnoxious son of a bitch in his place. Alright, ladies, start your appetites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny fires a gun and the competition begins. You're horrified as everyone is shoveling in food as if they were Persephone. Crescent downs three old hamburgers, as Cree is licking up what you think are mashed potatoes. Having two mouthes gives clover an edge as she shovels prison food into her normal mouth and inhales even more through her snake nose. Ursula savagely even bites at the table while Hack and Mariah are eating fast enough to swallow plates. Mona flicks her mouth to steal food from Icy who retaliates by pecking the lizard in the hand to swallow crumbs. Bebe is on a roll as well and not even bothering to chew just as Elaine is rapidly devouring fish and thawing away the bones that Ariel completely devours. You even see Simone eating up all the fruit as Arethusa burns her food to make it easier to suck up and swallow before she lets out a belch. Belladonna even tears into dead dinosaurs as Bebe begins to bump her. You then turn to see Ursula using her snake hair to eat everything in her path while Clover bites into a roast pterodactyl. You were sickened by the sight as the girls both eat and wear their food. Destiny smiles wickedly because it looks like you were in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the contest is over and you have to cover your ears to drown out the belching. The winner is...</span></div></div>",

Where's the justice in this world?\" \"Phooey,\" complains Crescent. \"I was planning to have him for dessert.\" \"And I was so looking forward to later.\" Complains Mariah. You just smile smugly in Destiny's cage necklace and stick out your tongue at the losers. \"That's right you greasy fatass monsters!\" you yell. \"You're not getting me today!\" You then turn to face Lockette who has her enlarged and flabby back to you. \"See that, Lockette?! I don't need you anymore you stupid plesiosaur. I've gotten really tired of being stuck with an unsupportive naysayer like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel quaking because Bebe is skipping up towards you. Given how big and obese she had gotten due to being infected by nebutori, her footsteps were creating monster-sized minor tremors and cracking the floor as she gave a wide smile that her species is known for. \"Congratulations, Bebe,\" says Destiny somewhat begrudgingly. \"Wade is all yours.\" Destiny unlocks your cage and you slip down Destiny's fat rolls as you yell and land in Bebe's swelled hand. Bebe is giggling with glee as she walks away holding onto you. As Bebe is walking away and holding onto you, Belladonna waddles her massive body covered in table scraps up to Destiny. \"I hate karma houdinis,\" said Belladonna. \"I can't believe you actually gave Wade away to Bebe. After all, it's his fault we were all infected by nebutori and you're letting him off surprisingly easily by giving him to somebody so hopelessly in love with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to Belladonna's surprise, Destiny is smiling rather evilly and playing with her own belly fat with her blimped-out claws. \"Oh, Wade's not getting off easy at all. If anything he's going to wish that he got eaten.\" Of course, you were in the corner of the prison cafeteria with Bebe lustfully smiling down on you. \"Thanks a lot, Bebe,\" you say. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta be escaping. It will be all too easy with the guards all turned into butterballs.\" However, Bebe closes her hand around you with a giggle. \"What the!? Bebe, you stupid fat cat! What are you doing?!\" \"Oh, you're not going anywhere, Wadey,\" says Bebe as she shakes her hips and grinds cracks into the walls as she purrs. \"You belong to me now and we are going to be very, very happy together. I finally have you.\" Bebe lets out a giggle. \"Oh, but I'm going to have to tuck you away for now, my cute little crumb. Don't want anyone else getting any ideas.\" Bebe then shoves you between the rolls of flab on her belly as you grunt and then she lets out a giggle. \"Bebe!\" you yell out muffled from Bebe's fat. \"Get me out of here.\" You struggle but all your movements do is tickle the fattened up Cheshire cat. \"Wadey, that tickles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. This was terrific. You were now the property of a lovestuck monster and she's trapped you in her own fat. This sucked. You could feel Bebe's excited movements as she waddles all around the prison throughout the day. You could swear that during your stay between the hot and sweaty cat woman's fleshy belly flab, Bebe actually gets fatter. You'd say that she was the biggest inmate in the entire prison. The fact that she was a bodybuilder before the nebutori struck is probably the only reason why she's still mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Bebe let's out a giggle. \"Now the real fun can begin, Wade-ums.\" She says with lust in her voice. Bebe reaches in between her rolls and tugs you out and when you see your new surroundings, you're filled with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you?</span></div></div>",

Oh no.\u201d You hear giggling and then turn around to see Bebe taking off her prison jumpsuit that at this point was reduced to tatters because of how tremendously fat she had become. Bebe was now 1200ft tall with a 1250ft wide belly and butt and huge H-cup breasts with four or five chins. The cheshire cat giantess had also outgrown her undergarments and was wearing nothing but her collar that Destiny put on to prevent her from turning invisible and breaking out. The corpulent cheshire cat goddess was shaking her hips against the shower walls and wagging her tail as she fondled her own breasts and looked down at you with lust and gave a purr. You were now more afraid than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are we doing here?\u201d you ask. Bebe gives a giggle and lowers her bloated face, bending the sides of the prison shower with her ginormous ass as her house sized sharp teeth were right in front of you. Her lips and jowls dripped with stains of prison food combined with cat saliva. \u201cWell,\u201d she said in a girly-sounding tone. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m an absolute mess after gorging on all that food in the eating competition, so I needed this shower.\u201d You then yell as Bebe  playfully licks you with her beach-sized sandpaper-like tongue.

If you think you\u2019re going to use me as a living soap, you\u2019ve got another thing... Ah!\u201d Before you could say a thing, Bebe grabs you and rubs the soap against you as she laughs playfully to herself. \u201cOh,\u201d said Bebe. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Wade-ums. You\u2019re just going to love every last inch of me. We\u2019re going to have so much fun together. And when we\u2019re finally released from Under Gloom, we can even get married!\u201d You freeze in fear at that idea. \u201cMarried to a monster?\u201d you think to yourself in horror. \u201cI think I would\u2019ve been better off in Cree\u2019s stomach. Augh!\u201d Bebe holds you up and she waves her tongue. \u201cAnd please let me know if you prefer me as a musclebound amazon or an obese feline blob. If you don\u2019t want me to change my figure, then your wish is my command.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe makes a kissing motion as she holds you up and you\u2019re sickened. You try to yell but you gag as both the soap and the water from the shower. \u201cNow Wade-ums,\u201d said Bebe as she shakes her obese body. \u201cWhich part of me would you like to see first in our shower of love. My beautiful dinosaur-killing breasts or my planet crushing pink and purple booty.\u201d Bebe shakes both her breasts and her butt and you let out a groan. It was a no-win situation either way. Which part do you ultimately pick.</span></div></div>",

Currently, there were three inmates in the Rec Room and each was seriously larger than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was Elaine. The kitsune still retained her hourglass figure but was still bigger all the way around. She had just gotten lucky that her thighs and breasts had taken most of the damage. Her face and arms had puffed considerably and she even had a hefty paunch. Her thighs were huge, veritable hunks a fat and fur that pushed out in all directions. But it was really her breasts that stole the show. They had been huge to start with and now they were even bigger: obscuring her face and most of her upper torso. You couldn't even make out her shoulders anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was Cornelia. Heck, she now resembled a blob that was so fat that most of her eyes were being forced either squint or close between her rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Priscilla. The orc was pudgy beforehand and now the nebutori had only made things worse. She now sported thunder-thighs that supported a large, dropping bowling ball of a belly with bulbous breasts with a fatten face peeking out from between her cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of those facts were even remotely important. Why? Because the moment you walked into the room, they all turned towards you, their expressions turned murderous. You don't know exactly what they did next because the moment you saw those faces, you booked it on out of there! Considering the yelling and the their thunderous footsteps, you could hazard a guess or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LITTLE BASTARD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"LL BITE YOUR HEAD OFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even turn around at look and just continued to run.</span></div></div>",

So, you are going to help me change that.\" Elaine replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\" You are confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone thinks this is your fault and want to kill or eat you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on her cot, staring down at you with red eyes was probably the most infamous inmate in the entire prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone was notorious for her cannibalistic habits and was fond of eating humans just as much. Even worse, she had a voracious appetite and if it wasn't for that muzzle on her, she would haven probably taken more than a few bites out of the guards and other personnel when they had to interact with her. All of this made her pretty intimidating to say the least, but truly, being in front of her in person was overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also didn't help that she was enormous. The nebutori had hit the others in the prison pretty hard but this was ridiculous. Persephone had become even larger than Destiny was after the nebutori and that still wasn't an adequate description! For one, she actually seemed to be taller than Destiny now! Her face, still muzzled, was surrounded by chipmunk-like cheeks swam in a series of multiple chins. Her chest was quite generous, each breast a large orb that rested on a gut. And what a gut it was! Persephone's belly had several large rolls and was almost was wide as she was tall. It went over her lap and slightly past her knees. It was big enough to almost completely cover her monstrous thunder thighs. Cushioning her was a rear that almost overflowed over the cot itself! All in all, Persephone was truly the largest monster you had ever seen and all of her focus was on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could truly even process all of this, she was on you. With a speed that defied her size, she snatched you up and brought you to her grinning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little human, what bring you here?\" Her voice was surprisingly smooth, like silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath before answering. \"I got chased in here by a bunch of the inmates.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone's eyes widen at that. \"So you must be Wade, then? I heard some of the guards grumbling about you and that nebutori. I mean, that's the only reason you get chased into Dark Side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod reluctantly. There as no point in really lying. Simply put, Persephone was a psychopath and contradicting her, making her angry while in her grip would only get you a quick death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone grinned at you again. \"So the whole prison has it out for you now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. \"And? I hate 'em all anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard about that too. But what if I could make them go away?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her for a few moments. \"...What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll make you a deal, you get this muzzle off of me and get me out of here, so that I can go to town on the fattened smorgasbord out there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped. She wanted you to release her? Just like that? \"And how do I know you don't eat me?\" You asked. Did she really think you were that stupid?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone gave you a deadpan stare and held you away from her body. \"Look at me.\" She grabbed part of her belly, held it up and then let it drop. \"One measly little human is not gonna fill this up. Besides, I need bait.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at her, but internally started to panic. \"Bait?\" You grounded out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone nodded. \"I'm pretty fast but all this bulk is gonna slow me down. With all the prison angry at you, they'll chase you down like their lived depended on it. You bring them to me and I'll eat them. That simple.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know I won't just run away?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even simpler. With everyone out for your hide now? You've tried again and again to get out, just like the rest of us, haven't you?\" She smirked at your silence. \"If you couldn't get bust out of here normally, how are you gonna do that if EVERYONE want your head?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed in your head. She was right as much as it pained you to admit to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Persephone said next drove the point even further home. \"Think about it. You hate them, right? Well, get them to me, I'll kill them and eat them. I get fed, you get some payback and you get less monsters roaming around for you. It's a win-win. So what do you say?\" By the time she was done, she was smirking at you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. You already knew you could outrun almost all the monsters anyway, so if she turned on you chances were you could get far enough away before Persephone caught you. There was also the fact that she was right about the prison gunning for you. The less you had to deal with the better things were. There was even the bonus that you could some real revenge on monsters like Cree, Cornelia or maybe even Destiny! And with all of the commotion that would be caused by Persephone's killing spree, all the attention would go away from you anyway and lighten all the security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe way lying and eat you the moment you got that muzzle off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much to lose but SO MUCH to gain. Could you really do this? Everything hinged on this. You steeled your resolve as looked into her smirking visage and gave your answer...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaping to it, you find it is large for you to actually climb into it partway. Doing so, you set to opening the thing. You were pretty skilled at getting locks open in the human world and this is pretty much the same thing, if on a larger scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you maybe a minute before you cracked the lock and it came loose. Persephone quickly removed it and grabbed you again before tossing the offending object to the floor. She snapped her jaws several times at the air, as if testing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" She groaned. \"That feels SO good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at the display. Persephone doesn't notice and instead puts you to the lock on the door. You climb inside and, just like the muzzle, you get it to unlock.

Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly. \"Yeah, yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glares down at you for a second. \"Don't mess up or else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the threat hanging in the air, Persephone lowers you down to the ground near the cell door. She opens it a little so you can walk out. Once your clear, she closes it again, ready to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the hallway, ready to play your part. This is the best chance you got of getting out of here and you're prepared to do anything and everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd make a perfect meal for Persephone and it allow you to get perfect revenge one of the monsters that always says she'd eat you. You hide your grin as she notices you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree grins. \"Look what we have here?\" Drools starts to leak from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip her the bird before turning tail and running back towards Persephone's cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never catch me, fatass!\" You yell over your shoulder.

You could wait and stick with the deal you and Persephone had planned. No matter what happens, you'll have at least raised your chances of getting out. Or you could try to make a run for it.

But that was part of the reason you were still following through with all this. Persephone made it clear that she wanted the fattened inmates and workers around the prison, but he knew she may turn on him. But if she was satisfied or just so downright full that she was unable to come after him then things would be worth it. Another obstacle out of the way and that much closer to freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the sounds of snapping bone that got your attention and turned back to Persephone and Cree.

One makes do with one has I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly gagged at the thought of that but swallowed it back. \"Are you done?\" You ask hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone swallowed and licked dripping blood from her lips. \"Yeah, I think I'm done with this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and turned to look at the scene. What you saw didn't surprise you but it did disgust you. Persephone had utterly decimated Cree's stomach captivity. Skin and entrails were gone to the point that you could see Cree's spine. Cree's throat was also torn out and her arms and thighs were were missing great chunks. The only thing fully intact as Cree's face, her expression fixed in pain and terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand flew to your mouth in an attempt to stem the dry-heaving as your stomach heaved. No amount of tv shows, Saw movies, or anything else could have prepared you for that! Turning away from the dead body and looked to Persephone. The werewolf's white fur around her hands and face were caked in blood. Menacing as that was, what really caught your attention was her stomach. The large mass of fat and fur  had increased in size. Even with Persephone standing, it touched the ground and seemed to bulge outward with it's fullness, making her seem even larger. You glare in repulsion was Persephone licks her fingers and digits of the blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you even eat anymore?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Persephone's stomach gave out what sounded like a growl of hunger. Persephone laughed and grinned. \"Does that answer your question?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. She really was nothing but a psycho cannibal glutton. \"So what now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We move on and do it again. Just not here.\" Persephone motioned towards the body of Cree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that would make things a little difficult.\" You think for a second. \"But what happens if we run into more than one other...uh...victims?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone rolled her eyes at you. \"Then I'll just kill them in rapid succession. THEN I'll eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it all sound so simple. You knew things would never go that smoothly. But that actually good. Once Persephone got in over her head, you'd run. A murderous cannibal on the loose in the prison would force everyone to either run to secure her or for their own safely, giving you more than enough chance to getaway in all the commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone slowly start to walk away and made motion for you to follow. You jog up to and then past her, remembering that you needed to act as bait again. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simone is only given a moment to turn around before Persephone slams into her. Just like Cree, Persephone was using her superior size to knock Simone to the ground. Unlike Cree however, Simone just didn't have the same bulk, so when Persephone all but body slammed her she crumbled like a domino. Persephone's attack had left her smothering the nue with her weight but she would leave nothing to chance. The moment she and Simone slammed into the ground, Persephone's immediately went for the throat. Simone, the shock of the impact knocking all the air out of her longs, couldn't even raise her arms in defense before Persephone's jaws closed in on her throat. Unlike with Cree, Persephon did not wrench but instead clamped down with as much force as she could and pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you are given no reprieve from the killing as you watch Persephone tears out Simone's throat, splattering blood on the floors, the walls and even you! You cannot stop the bile that rises in your throat and you bend over and puke. Persephone pays you no mind as she continues to her feast/assault. But this time her victim is still in the process of dying. Simone cannot help but try and reach from her throat in an attempt to stem the blood, gasping in pain all the while. Persephone shows no mercy, however. Even as Simone tries to reach her throat, Persephone takes the opportunity to take bites out of the nue's arms. All the while, Persephone is grinning with blood staining her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Persephone far less time for the werewolf to eat the majority of Simone's flesh. The entire time, you cannot help but watch in horror, the sheer brutality permeating your mind. With Cree, you hated her, she tried to eat you and it helped that you didn't watch as Persephone devoured her without hesitation. But Simone, when it came down it, never tried to eat you. In fact, she would just report you to Destiny which was part of her job. You hated monsters, no doubt, But did Simone really deserve that? You couldn't figure out an answer. Instead you focused on getting out of there and attempted to stamp out any doubts.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone turned towards you, blood still caking her face. She smiled, more pleasantly than anyone had smiled at you since coming to Under Gloom. She bent down and reach out to you with a pudgy hand-paw. You flinched and took a step back. That didn't deter Persephone. Oh, no! She was going to eat you! She- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone gently patted you on the head. \"Y'know, Wade?\" She purrs, smile still in place. \"This is the most fun I've had in a long time. And it's all thanks to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a nod and a forced smiled. \"Your welcome.\" You some manage to say that without stuttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone smiles just gets larger before she pulls back and sits down on the floor just a little ways from Simone's corpse. She gently rubs her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head in confusion. \"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone gives a small burp. \" Ate a little too much, too fast. Just need to digest for a few minutes. No point in throwing up all that meat after we worked so hard to get, right?\" She gives you sidelong glance and a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, though it is stiff. Things were spiraling out of control. Persephone was...she was...you didn't even know how to describe the creature you unleashed upon Under Gloom. You didn't know what she would do next or if you would even survive all of this. Even worse, you were covered in blood and once it got out that Persephone had killed and eaten two guards,..you were good as dead! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could really do was keep going and hoped this crazy plan actually worked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Surprised, you turned to see it was a roll of fat from Persephone's fat. You pulled away and dismissed it, thinking Persephone had simply shifted. But then it happened again. You looked up at the werewolf and your eyes widened. She was getting bigger! Slowly but surely Persephone was expanding outward in all directions. It stopped after awhile but the werewolf had at least grew another third of her former size. You swallowed. Just how big was she going to get?! Persephone was a monster just by her behavior alone but now her body seemed to be growing to match that personality. Was it all the nebutori infected flesh that she had consumed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get to ponder anymore as you felt fierce tremors through the floor. You turned to Persephone who was now getting up, her head looking in the direction behind you. You turned on your heel and faced whatever was coming. Whatever it was, it was big. Not as big as Persephone , but not that much smaller either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?  </span></div></div>",

It was Ursula Minor. The nebutori had hit her pretty hard as she, you noticed before wasn't too much smaller than Persephone. Most of her weight was concentrated in her belly and lower half. Her butt alone was the size of a small mountain range to you and her belly hovered just above the ground. You couldn't help but step back away from the werebear. But her attention wasn't focused on you. Instead, she was staring at Persephone. Ursula's one remaining eye was widened in shock and a little fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone smirked at her, licking her lips at the sight before her. \"Hello, meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-? How did you get loose?!\" Ursula all but screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both Persephone and Wade were surprised when the werebear lunged at her. Persephone caught one of the Ursula's arms but took a swipe to face from the other arm. The claws raked across Persephone's cheek causing her to cry out in pain. With a snarl, Persephone clamped down on the offending arm with her fangs. Ursula struck her again and again, attempting to get Persephone off her. After about the fifth hit, Persephone finally let go, tearing a chunk out of Ursula's arm. Persephone quickly swallowed the piece of arm and grinned at Ursula. Said werebear was trying to staunch the blood leaking from her arm. She glared at Persephone as the cannibal stalked a closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone was all smiles. \"Look how you bleed for me. Wet. Ready. Red. Wanting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white werewolf took to snapping at Ursula's injured arm, attempting to pull more chunks away. Ursula did a good job of swatting Persephone away but you knew that it was only a matter of time. While Ursula had left Persephone with some bleeding cuts on the face, the chunk of her arm that was missing was leaking blood and she was surely slowing down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone feinted going for another snap and when Ursula threw out her uninjured arm in defense, but that was exactly what Persephone wanted. In an instant Persephone bit onto the armed snatched a chunk out of it, just like she did before. Swallowing, she stalked closer to the all but defenseless Ursula, who was panting heavily with torrents of blood leaking from both arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was over. Ursula was a dead bear walking but she didn't give up. Instead. she took a page out of Persephone's book and attempted to take a bite out of her. However, she was sluggish and too slow and it was no surprise when Persephone leaned out of the way casually before going right for Ursula's throat. Persephone tore it out without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone spoke one final time as she swallowed. \"Finished, so all mine.\" As Ursula fell, Persephone jumped onto the dying bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same process all over again. Ursula had lasted longer than Simone or Cree but it was inevitable. You were convinced that nothing could stand against Persephone. As your companion, for the lack of a better word, helped herself to her feast, you resignedly turned around, your face in your hands, so that you didn't have to bear witness or be tempted to look at that horrific sight all over again. There was nothing you could do now. Everything was out of your control now. All you could was follow along and hope beyond hope, that you got out of here before all of it caught up to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At your size, it would take a year to turn around.\" You give a smirk as Destiny holds you tight and shakes in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna lets out a laugh. \"Well, I suppose that I better help her in.\" Belladonna then kicked Destiny in the ass, causing the doorframe to break off and get stuck around Destiny's fat body as she is pushed into her office. Destiny gets up and mumbles as she tears off the doorframe. \"If you weren't the only one in this prison even remotely qualified to be my successor,\" mutters Destiny to Belladonna. \"You'd be canned for this. And no more jokes about <i>my</i> can! If you make one more ass crack, I will pummel you severely.\" Belladonna just smirks as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny groans as she grabs her third chin. \"Belladonna disrespects me more than usual now. This can't get any worse.\" \"Cry me a river, Demonass.\" You say. Destiny then glares down at you. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Thanks for reminding me why I can in here to begin with. I'm going to give you what's coming to you for making a whale out of me.\" You look up and could almost laugh. That obese, chubby-cheeked, multi-chinned remnant of Destiny's blue, enraged gargoyle face looked far less intimidating and more comical. You stick out your tongue right before Destiny tosses you over her desk and you land with a grunt in the seat of her chair. \"Time for the marathon of pain.\" Says the gargoyle giantess. You then see a shadow fall over you and then you look up in horror as Destiny enormous blue planetary ass is descending down on you. Destiny gives an evil smirk right before she ferociously sits down on you. However, because of the nebutori, Destiny's ass is <i>much</i> bigger than her chair which then proceeds to break as she sits down and causes her to grunt as she pratfalls on the floor, plastering you under her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for some reason, you're still alive and you squirm underneath her ass and Destiny feels it as she smiles evilly. \"Squirm all you want, you little pest. I think I just found a new way to punish you for your transgressions. You permanently mangled my figure and now you're paying the price.\" Destiny laughs wickedly and wiggles her butt as you swear at her. Though your mouth is filled with gargoyle cellulite, making it impossible for her to hear you. Destiny then proceeds to look over some paper work all while you're plastered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany painful hours later, Destiny's shift is over and she's getting up to return home, with you plastered like a tattoo, flattened but still alive on her...</span></div></div>",

Destiny sat on you so hard, you're wedged into her cellulite and can't move. At this moment, Destiny is so enormously fat that she'd easily weigh a ton if she was human-sized. Most of her fat went to her belly and butt and because of that nebutori you unleashed on her, she was going to stay this way for the rest of her life. The titanically obese blue woman lifts up her stomach and gives a groan. She looks down to see only the top half of her breasts are being covered by her tank top and her belt had come undone to say nothing of her loincloth that was slowly being torn apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you gave me nebutori, Wade. I hate you.\" \"Well, I hate you too. I hate the actual day you hatched.\" \"Well I hate you even more than I hate men in general and that's saying a lot coming from a man-hater like me. I should've thrown you to Persephone the moment you got into this prison. Now look at me! I lost all the weight I had in high school and now thanks to your stupidity, I've got it back times 10!\" \"Go eat some flowers!\" You then yell in pain as Destiny squeezes her butt cheeks and causes you pain. \"As soon as I get home,\" she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in for worse torture.\u201d Destiny grumbles and is about to leave her office when her love handles get stuck in the doorway and she grunts as she tries to get out of the doorway. Destiny swears wildly and you laugh at her as Belladonna walks by with a smirk on her face. \u201cBelladonna,\u201d says Destiny as his eyes glow red. \u201cI\u2019m going to...\u201d \u201cSit on me?\u201d asks Belladonna smugly. \u201cLooks like you had one honeypot too many.\u201d Destiny in rage bursts through the doorway and then tosses Belladonna right through the other wall, leaving two Belladonna-shaped holes leading to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny soon makes her way out of Under Gloom, with you still stuck to her. She flaps her wings and tries to fly. However, she is now so heavy, that all this does is cause her to tumble and fall until she lands on the branch of a tree in the woods below and breaks it under her enormous weight. You grunt as you\u2019re further wedged between her butt cheeks and the gargoyle gets up and makes her way back into town grumbling \u201cSyadnom etah I!\u201d over and over again and rubbing her mammoth cheeks in pain. As Destiny walks down the street, she hears a whistling noise and then turns her head to see a grungy-looking male gryphon giving her a lustful look. The gryphon then tries to grab Destiny by the tail, irritating her. Destiny doesn\u2019t even hesitate to deck him before going on her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you notice that Destiny isn\u2019t going anywhere near the street that leads to her home. \u201cHey Demona!\u201d you yell. \u201cWade,\u201d mutters a very angry Destiny. \u201cIf you call me \u201cDemona\u201d one more time, I\u2019m going to actually ****ing murder you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just saying, I thought you\u2019d have enough brains to know where you live.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d says Destiny. \u201cI\u2019m not going home just yet.

The bloated gargoyle stares down at you. Before she speaks, you hear a loud growling sound and for once it wasn't coming from Destiny's mouth. The rumbling nearly gives you tinnitus and sounds like a moon splitting in half. \"Hear that, Wade?\" asks Destiny. \"Because of you fooling around with permanent nebutori, I'm starving. I feel like I haven't eaten in weeks and I <i>know</i> that I had dinner last night.\" You give a scoff. \"So what are we having?\" Destiny snaps her teeth, nearly biting your head off. \"After all the trouble you put me through, you're lucky I waste money feeding you gruel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny feels her stomach again and then the gargoyle who would weigh 2 tons if she were normal-sized, growls along with her tummy. She then shoves you into her larger than usual cleavage and you yell as you're squished between two blue breasts that were big enough to make meteors look like pebbles. It takes all the strength you have just to keep from being squished like a grape in the fat of this goddess-sized gargoyle. \"It's lucky that I know a place where I can eat like a queen. If I weren't a gargoyle, I'd eat you. And don't even think about trying to escape. I still have to punish you when we get home.\" \"Blah, blah, blah,\" you say disrespectfully. \"Go stuff your socks with cream cheese, Demo...\u201d Destiny shoots a glare down at you were crimson eyes that almost looked like the fires of the underworld. \u201cGo ahead and say it,\u201d said Destiny. \u201cI dare you.\u201d You zip your lips. Destiny almost sounded as if she was going to kill you. You wonder if she was angrier than usual because she was hungry. As Destiny was walking towards the restaurant in question, she grunted because she bumped into somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d says a familiar voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about... Mom?\u201d Destiny looked forward in surprise because the monster she bumped into was her daughter, Fate. Fate was an indigo purple-skinned gargoyle as tall as her mother but with brownish blonde hair and shorter horns that looked almost underdeveloped. Fate was wearing nothing but a white tanktop and a loincloth with a belt. Fate was also very large and fat but at this point, Destiny was so morbidly obese that she made Fate look like an anorexic and underfed prima donna supermodel. \u201cFate?!\u201d yells Destiny in surprise. \u201cI thought you were working tonight.\u201d Fate could not help but stare at how much bigger her mom had gotten, focusing on her multiple chins, thick red lips, continent-sized breasts, loincloth obscuring blue belly and finally, her planet destroying butt that made what was left of her skirt look like dental floss. Fate has to readjust her own jaw before speaking to her mom. \u201cLexi hired a second night guard at the Daily Tombstone and asked me to take a few nights off to break her in. But... uh... um....\u201d Fate was looking for a way to tell her mother that she was at least 10 times heavier than when she last saw her without offending her. The younger gargoyle put a clawed hand to one of her own chubby cheeks as she bites her lip. \u201cHow exactly do I put this?\u201d she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny rolled her eyes at her daughter hesitating. \u201cJust say it, Fate,\u201d says the blue giantess in an annoyed tone. \u201cI\u2019m fat. Heck, I\u2019m even fatter than you. That parasite Wade gave me permanent nebutori.\u201d \u201cNebutori?\u201d asks Fate. \u201cPermanent? You mean you\u2019ll never get any thinner? Ouch. So what did you do to him?\u201d Destiny squeezes her breasts together, causing you great pain as Fate puts her head over her mother\u2019s breasts and sees you. \u201cNothing worse than what I\u2019m going to do to him when we get home! But I can\u2019t torture him on an empty stomach. I\u2019m heading to Limbo Rojo.\u201d Fate let out a laugh. \u201cI was on my way there myself. Guess we were both in the mood for tacos tonight.\u201d You give a gag before Destiny pokes you down deep into her monstrous cleavage. As you\u2019re trapped underneath Destiny\u2019s cleavage, you hear her every stomping motion as she and Fate walk towards Limbo Rojo. \u201cNot to be disrespectful, Mom,\u201d said Fate. \u201cBut why don\u2019t you just fly to Limbo Rojo.\u201d Destiny growled at Fate before speaking. \u201cI\u2019m too fat to fly now. At least you\u2019re fat and can still fly.\u201d Destiny then heard a literal wolf\u2019s whistle and turned to see a male werewolf giving a flirting look at her. Destiny roars at him in rage to scare him off as Fate rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long before both of the SSBBW mother and daughter gargoyles reach their destination. Limbo Rojo was a Mexican restaurant that was painted black on the inside with fires painted on the walls and a floor that looked as if it was made out of magma. The male cashier was a jagged toothed red-skinned gremlin with ears that looked like a rooster\u2019s comb and pure yellow eyes. He stares at the two large gargoyle women, the chubby violet daughter and the morbidly obese nebutori-afflicted mother and is drooling in lust before he notices Destiny\u2019s eyes glowing red and she glares at the gremlin to warn him not to get any ideas. \u201cMy eyes are up here,\u201d says the blue gargoyle in a rage. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that are glowing.\u201d The gremlin wisely backs off, knowing that Destiny is obviously not in a good mood. While the creature is intimidated, you overheard Fate deciding to order for both gargoyles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take an order of 10 hardshell pterodactyl meat tacos and 10 soft shell steak tacos with tomato, lettuce, white rice, onions, black beans and jalape\u00f1os.\" \"We'll also take a side of nachos,\" says Destiny. \"1 large Hauntling cola.\" \"And one large diet Hauntling.\" Says Fate. For some reason, part of that order confuses the gremlin cashier. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"But did you say, <i>jalape\u00f1os</i>?\" \"Yes,\" says Fate with a sigh. \"You heard that right.\" The gremlin's confusion was understandable seeing as gargoyles usually hate jalape\u00f1os, similar to how vampires can't stand garlic. However, Destiny and her daughter were two of only three known gargoyles that actually <i>like</i> jalape\u00f1os (the third being Destiny's younger sister, Fortuna). In fact, jalape\u00f1os were actually Destiny's favorite food. You figured that she had such a fiery temper that spicy food had no effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Destiny and Fate have their food and are sitting at a booth in the corner. Due in no small part to the nebutori, Destiny had already begun to voraciously stuff herself. Some onions and steak juice actually fall from her lip and splatter on you in her cleavage as you grunt. Fate just looks in concern. \"You really shouldn't eat angrily like that, Mom. It's not good for you.\" \"Don't poke the dragon, Fate,\" warns Destiny as she shovels in some nachos. \"Thanks to that blasted Wade, I'm...!\" Destiny stops mid-rant and begins to choke, forcing herself to sip some of her soda before she breathes a sigh of relief. \"I told you so.\" Says Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to climb up Destiny's mountainous boobs in an attempt to escape while the giant gargoyle whales are eating. From what you see, Fate was hardly any better than her mother and had actually managed to stuff two hardshell tacos into her mouth at once before devouring them right before she took one of her soft shell tacos and put some nachos in it, to Destiny's disgust as she devoured one of her own tacos. \"That's revolting, Fate.\" She says. Fate just licks the nacho cheese off of her lips and pays no heed to Destiny's comment. \"Don't knock until you've tried it.\" Destiny rolls her eyes and bites into a hard shell taco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, she is so bloated that she can't even feel you climbing her breasts to escape. \"There's no way I'm sticking around for the end of dinner, lardass,\" you think to yourself. \"I better get out of here before Destiny remembers me.\" That's what you think, but as you squeeze your way out, you land...</span></div></div>",

She looked pretty pissed. Then again, she ALWAYS looked pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hand it over.\" Destiny demanded, reaching for the jar. Shelly kept a firm grip, though, and wouldn't give it up. Destiny tried to yank it out of her hand, but ended up dropping it. The jar shattered and released the ball. It floated for a moment, before zipping up and entering Destiny through her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Shelly said, worried. \"This isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right it isn't.\" Destiny replied, looking at the place the ball entered her chest. \"You smuggled illegal goods in here. That means you get to spend time in solitary. Cree, take her there.\" Cree nodded and grabbed Shelly, walking her out of the cell. Destiny then turned to you. \"As for you, Wade. You're going back to Lockette. And this time, Simone is going to make sure you don't get out. Simone, take him away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone grabbed you and left the cell. You looked back at Destiny, angry at her. Before Simone left the hall, though, you thought you saw a red glow on Destiny's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Simone tossed you back in your cell. Lockette was on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got caught again, huh?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it.\" You reply, before lying on your bed. You decided to try again tomorrow.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Cree woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, tiny. Destiny has an announcement to make and she wants you in the yard.\" Cree told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, but got up anyway. Cree grabbed you and took you out into the yard.

And your arms still hurt like heck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stomped down the hallway when she saw several inmates in their cells. She stomped on Ariel's tail, making the gremlin girl scream in pain. Then Destiny took out a taser to zap Darcy for no reason and then grabbed Priscilla by the collar before slamming her face first into the cage bars as the orc let out a groan. \"THAT'S FOR EVEN THINKING OF ESCAPING, YOU PARASITES ON SOCIETY! AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN MY (BEEP PRISON), YOU'RE UNDER MY (BEEP) RULES, YOU MISTAKES OF BIRTH!\" Even the guards are scared to look at Destiny. \"I don't know what Wade did,\" says Clover. \"But she's more cranked than ever.

Destiny growls as she looks at Fate. \"WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT BOTHERING ME AT WORK, FATE!!!\" Fate is shocked to see her mother in such a state and then focuses on you in the cage necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even want to know what you did this time, Wade.\" She said. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE!?\" yells Destiny. Fate folds her wings in fear and steps back. \"Well,\" says Fate. \"Belladonna told me you were more stressed than usual and I wanted to make sure you were....\" Destiny lets out a yell as she makes the sound of a steam whistle. \"THAT SNEAKY-ASS MOTHER****ING SCORPION CAT!! I SWEAR I AM GOING TO HANG HER NINE TIMES! THAT 3-LAYERED.....!!!\" \"Calm down, Mom,\" says Fate as she grabs hold of Destiny. \"You're so angry you've turned red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny then does something that really worries you. She pushes Fate to the ground as she grunts and then lowers her head to Fate's level. \"LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT **** BEFORE! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! YOU'RE ALWAYS NAGGING ME ABOUT MY STRESS AND MY HEALTH!! NOBODY ASKED YOU, FATE!! YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, I'M <i>YOUR</i> MOTHER! SO SHUT UP! SHUT THE **** UP!\" You were sweating in your cage. While Destiny may be hot-tempered, she had a soft spot towards Fate. Just how strong was that evil spirit of wrath?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fate is still shaken by her mother's outburst, Clover comes into the room and is scared to death herself. \"You better have a damned good reason for coming into my office, Clover.\" Says the angry Destiny. Clover shakes her feet as Destiny growls and you have to hold onto the bars of the cage. You were really glad that for once you weren't on the business end of Destiny's wrath. \"It's.... A-Ariel,\" says Clover. \"She got out of her... cell.\" Destiny then screams in rage so loud that Fate has to hold her ears and watch as the flames that now make up Destiny's hair flame up. \"I'LL BASH HER ****ING HEAD IN!\" As hard as it was to believe, you were actually feeling sympathy for Ariel. Before you know it, Destiny has run off to catch Ariel in the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel was running down the hallway panting in fear, hack wrench in hand. \"As soon as I get out of here,\" says the gremlin chopshopper. \"I am on the next bus to Screamtown. That hellspawn would never look for me there. I'm not even going to dismantle any more cars, just as long as I get away from Demona.\" But then Destiny leaps in front of Ariel and knocks her to the ground before letting out a Godzilla-style roar. Ariel screams on the ground and you're even sure that she wet herself in fear. The other inmates and even the guards look on in concern and Fate walks up behind Destiny to get a better look at what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T SAY, I DIDN'T WARN YOU ARIEL!\" yells Destiny. \"YOU'LL PAY FOR YOUR DISOBEDIENCE!\" Destiny grabs Ariel by the tail and pulls it as the gremlin girl screams in agony. \"Good grief.\" Says Clover under her breath. Cree even looks unnerved. Finally, Destiny pulls Ariel's tail so hard that it snaps off and Ariel screams. Fate is downright horrified. \"Greg Weisman in a cardigan sweater!\" yells Fate in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets even worse. Destiny takes Ariel's severed tail as the gremlin is crying in pain and throws it down the garbage chute. She then growls at Simone. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GAWKING AT! TAKE THIS PIECE OF **** TO THE PIT!!\" Then Destiny turns to Cree and Clover who are shaking in fear. \"AS FOR YOU TWO, CREE! YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF GUARDING ARIEL'S PART OF THE PRISON! CLOVER, YOU BROUGHT ME THE BAD NEWS! NOW THE PUNISHMENT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Fate both watch in fear as Destiny mercilessly pummels Cree and Clover. You've created a monster!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Fate left (well, ran), the rest of the day in Under Gloom pretty much went as you had expected: an utter nightmare! Throughout the day, Destiny just seemed to get angrier and angrier. You didn't even think that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the guards and inmates were completely terrified of her. No one in the Dark Side had the courage to do anything when Destiny was near there. Elaine made sure to stay far away from her (though you guessed that had more to do with her being worried that Destiny's fire hair would melt her implants). Belladonna never even thought of insulting her after her beating. Even the normally tough Aria was on thin ice after her boobs accidentally bumped into Destiny and Destiny choked her out. In fact, the only person you didn't see afraid was the prison Doctor, but then again, she never showed any emotion. And even then, you just knew that she was terrified on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed something odd. Throughout the day, every time Destiny went berserk, which was now every second, she seemed to get more muscular. And her firey hair seemed to get longer and hotter. That wasn't all. At one point, Destiny cut her finger on a cell bar, and as she was embedding the bar in a nearby wall, you saw a drop of blood melt the floor. Her blood had literally become lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, every single person in the prison was beyond relieved when Destiny left to go home. Not you, though. You were still stuck in the necklace cage and your arms still hurt like crazy. You were honestly terrified at what Destiny was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home and opened the door (well, to be precise, she tore the door off of it's handles and threw it into space), you and her saw Fate there.<br>\r\n\"What the f**k do you want, Fate?\" Destiny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well,\" Fate started. You could here the terror in her voice. \"I talked to B-Beth, and she s-said you might b-be possessed by W-Wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny just stood there for a moment. You looked up, and to your shock, her eyes, which had been blood red all day, reverted back to their natural color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth?\" She asked, actually sounding calm and a little confused. \"Why are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, her eyes turned red again and she growled. \"I see what this is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Fate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belladonna put you up to this. Make it seems as though I've gone mad so she can take over. Well, when I get back to work, I'LL RIP OF THAT F**KING TAIL, SHOVE IT DOWN HER THROAT, AND MAKE HER DRINK HER OWN DAMN POISON!\" She screamed. \"Now, I'm going to bed, and if you wake me up, YOU WILL PAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, Destiny went to her room, leaving a terrified Fate behind.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nLater that night, Destiny was snoring in her bed, and the cage you were in was on the nightstand. You were thinking over the days events. You usually never thought or even cared about the consequences of what you did, but this. You had turned Destiny into a living nightmare. What had you done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and realize someone was looking at you. To your complete shock, it was...</span></div></div>",

You were about to say something but she put her finger over her mouth and blew on her finger. \"Not so loud, Wade,\" she whispers. \"I didn't bust out of prison just to awaken the sleeping giant.\" \"Look what you've done,\" you say. \"You stupid turtle. You've made Demona over there 10 times more dangerous. She's more ticked off than ever. She even threatened her own daughter with violence.\" Shelly let out a sigh. \"That's the spirit of wrath talking. It bonded to her soul and she's only going to get angrier and angrier.\" \"That's impossible. Even Destiny can't get <i>that</i> angry. All that rage will be the death of her. Her heart will explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly bites her beak slightly. \"Actually, those possessed by the spirits of the 8 sins become immortal.\" You let out a groan. \"Oh great. Now she doesn't just <i>look</i> like Demona. But that doesn't explain why you're here.\" Shelly shushes you as Destiny continues to snore away. \"For some reason I actually feel remorse for my actions. If it weren't for the two of us messing around with that evil spirit, then a lot of this unpleasantness wouldn't happen.\" Shelly then starts to pick up your cage and tries to walk away. \"All we have to do is get as far away from Fearfield as possible and maybe find some way to get into a different prison with a different warden and then we can break out from there and never have to worry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me. Am I interrupting something?\" Shelly gasps and turns around to see Destiny glaring at her and gritting her fangs as her fiery hair erupts. Shelly screams and drops your cage before Destiny grabs her by the neck and causes her to gag. \"YOU REPULSIVE REPTILIAN FLIM FLAMMER!! SO YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO BREAK OUT OF <i>MY</i> PRISON! I'LL BET THAT BACKSTABBING ALLEY CAT BELLADONNA PUT YOU UP TO THIS LIKE SHE TRIED TO USE FATE TO DISCREDIT ME!! LOOKS LIKE TONIGHT, I DINE ON TURTLE SOUP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Destiny does next horrifies you. She grabs Shelly by the front and back of her shell and tugs hard as Shelly screams in agony and then you hear a loud SNAP!. Destiny yanks off Shelly's shell as Shelly begins to cry and scream. \"My shell! My beautiful shell!\" Shelly tries to cover her exposed and heavily bruised breasts and back as her eyes water and Destiny violently stomps on her. Fate is looking at the scene through the bedroom door and is horrified beyond words and even runs off to vomit. Destiny then grabs you and Shelly and smashes the bedroom door before flying back to Under Gloom where she confronts Belladonna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TRAITOROUS FELINE! YOU LET SHELLY ESCAPE SO SHE COULD MAKE ME LOOK BAD! TRYING TO GET ME FIRED AS USUAL, I SEE!!\" Belladonna is shaking and steps back as Destiny pounds her fist into her palm and corners her. \"I swear on my father's grave, Destiny,\" says Belladonna. \"I honestly didn't have anything to do with this. Shelly must've broken out somehow when nobody was looking. I'm telling you the truth.\" \"INSUBORDINATION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, SOLANACEAE! TIME TO REMIND YOU OF YOUR PLACE!\" You can only watch in horror as Destiny violently beats up Belladonna, at one point, trying to feed the manticore her own tail and forcibly making her drink her own poison, giving her a violent stomach cramp. Cree and Clover look in absolute horror and try to run but Destiny grabs them by their decks and beats on them, apparently seeing them just as responsible for Shelly's breakout. \"I've created a monster.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Belladonna is at home heavily bandaged from the beating. She's wearing an Elizabethan collar, a cast on her right leg, a brace on her left knee and a bandaid on her left ear. Her tail is heavily bandaged as well and she has a big swollen black eye and is holding an ice pack up to her jaw. Her older sister Astrid is there and is horrified with what she sees. \"Destiny did this to you? And you weren't even plotting against her.\" Belladonna spat out a tooth and nodded her head. \"I'm giving up. Her job isn't worth it. Starting on monday, I'm filing paperwork to be transferred to another prison. I'll just usurp the warden there. They can't possibly be worse than Destiny. She's always been hot-tempered but now she's acting like she's possessed. Oh.\" Astrid has to force her sister's mouth open to feed her her painkillers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Daily Tombstone, Fate is at work pouring an entire sugar bowl into her coffee as she tries to figure out what to do. Cree's werejackal wife Aurelia stomps up to her and growls. \"I have a bone to pick with you, Sirtis!\" Fate lets out a sigh. \"What is it, Aurelia.\" Aurelia then pokes Fate in her fat stomach as she berates her. \"Last night, Cree came home with half her teeth missing and a twisted ankle. When I asked which inmate beat her so horribly, she told me it was your mother who did it. I have never seen such an abusive boss in all my life. What your mom did to my wife was barbaric!\" \"Aurelia,\" says Fate. \"Mom can't help it. She's possessed by Wrath. And she already had a nasty temper to begin with so it only made her angrier.\" \"Evil spirit or no evil spirit,\" says Aurelia. \"I'm calling that attorney Kate Rowling in San Francisco.\" Aurelia walks away angrily as Fate lets out a sigh and Beth waddles her way up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what happened last night. Ouch. Lexi's already assigned Tara to cover the story at Under Gloom.\" Fate let out a sigh. \"I'll pay Tara's hospital bill. So what's the word, Bethany?\" Beth bites her lip. \"Your mom is only going to get angrier and angrier to the point where she'll beat the stuffing out of anything that so much as moves. Well, on the bright side, crime will be declining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fate's cellphone begins to ring. Fate holds up the phone and checks the caller ID to learn that the caller is Destiny's younger sister, Fortuna. \"Aunt Fortuna,\" groans Fate. \"Oh boy. This is gonna get ugly.\"</span></div></div>",

SHE CAN BE SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the necklace cage, you were curled up into a fetal position. For once in your life, you were truly terrified. Tara had walked in and asked Destiny a question. As soon as Destiny saw the notepad, she flipped out. Hence Tara flying through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guards in the prison had clocked out and bolted from the psycho warden. The only guards left were Clover, who was now rocking in a corner after getting yelled at, and Aria, for reasons you could only guess were very brave, or very stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warden, did you really have to throw her out?\" Aria asked, trying to stay calm but clearly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR OPINION, YOU PALE COW!\" Destiny yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you suddenly found yourself on the floor. Not knowing what just happened, you looked up. You realized you must have been knocked off, because Aria currently had Destiny in a choke-hold. From the looks of it, Aria was pissed off now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU F**KING CALL ME?!\" Aria screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you remembered something. Aria hates being called a cow. Yuri called her a cow once, and it took both Cree and Simone to keep her from snapping Yuri's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASSAULTING A SUPERIOR! NOW YOU'RE REALLY IN DEEP S**T, TAZEL!\" Destiny bellowed before biting Aria's arm. When Aria let go, Destiny decked her in the face and clawed at her, tearing her uniform. Aria responded by grabbing Destiny and throwing her to the other end of the hall. She then charged and headbutted Destiny in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO ONE! CALLS ME! A COW!\" Aria screamed before thowing Destiny down the left hall. She then chased after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover shakily stood up and picked you up. \"Great,\" she said, \"Now we have TWO pissed off women fighting each other. I don't think the prison can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if were're lucky, they'll rip each other apart. I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push it, Wade.\" Clover said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard what sounded like a scream of victory.

Some of her teeth were knocked out and her one eye had a really obvious shiner. Destiny roared towards the sky, proclaiming her victory. If that roar did not scare anyone, what came next would. Wade and Clover watched as Destiny's body began to pulse and ripple. Her arms began to swell as her muscles grew. She inched taller as her legs lengthened and calves thickened. But not just her muscles grew. The horns on her head began to grow out, getting thicker and sharper as they advanced. Her tail began to grow small spines that looked ready to serrate whatever they hit. Her hands and feet grew longer claws. The fiery hair grew hotter as the fire in her eyes exploded. Wade could have sworn he saw smoke coming out of her mouth. Strangely enough her breasts grew with her expanding stature, guess to just make sure others knew she was female. What seemed like forever she stopped growing, much to the other's relief. But the relief was quickly burned away as the red gargoyle stared directly to the two. \"<b>CLOVER. WHY DO YOU HAVE WADE. IN <u>MY CAGE</u>?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost fainted from fear, but she only held the cage up, \"I-It fell on the ground! I picked it up so it wouldn't...interfere with your fight...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cage was grabbed, but Clover was slapped. This slap almost knocked her out but did knock her to the floor. A big red handprint was on her cheek. \"<b>DID I SAY YOU COULD TOUCH IT?! AND EVEN IF IT DID I WOULD HAVE WON! NOW GET OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE YOU JOIN HER!</b> Clover ran off in tears. The gargoyle roughly placed the cage necklace around her neck, shaking Wade in the process. A faint groan from Aria signified that she was awake. Destiny quickly kicked her in her gut, \"<b>GET UP! NEXT TIME YOU PULL SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU ARE FIRED! UNDERSTOOD COW?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to, Aria could not fight again. She could only lay there and reply. \"Y-Yes mam...\" Destiny grunted in approval before angrily stomping to her office. She ignored the doorframe as her head crashed right through it, \"<b>AND GET SOMEONE TO FIX THESE F***KING HALLS!</b>\" Wade just sat in his cage, completely quiet and basically paralyzed by fear. He created more than a monster; he created a pureblooded demon that grows stronger, bigger, and angrier every passing moment. Her aggressive behavior was just getting worse. Now he was regretting every single moment he had ever taunted Destiny. Heck, he was even feeling sorry for causing that Mummy so much problems. Wade was actually now gaining a new outlook on monsters. He prayed that one would actually save him; but seeing how Destiny is, the chances of him leaving in one piece is to just keep quiet and hopefully get an early release.</span></div></div>",

Destiny was in such a bad mood that the first thing she did when she came in to work was break one bone in the body of every inmate. You couldn't bear to watch as Destiny tore out one of Lockette's teeth right before your former cellmate screamed and begun to bleed at the mouth. Destiny growled at Lockette and pushed her into the wall as Clover and Cree looked in horror right before Destiny's flaming hair lit up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point the spirit of wrath had mutated Destiny into a red hulking beast resembling a cross between a gargoyle, a demon and a dinosaur and she was so utterly mad that her footsteps were leaving burn marks in the floor as she walked by. Suddenly, Destiny's ears begun to twitch and she gave a hiss as she turned her head and looked into the cell of a trembling Mariah. Destiny growled and then stomped into the cell and you had to close your eyes as Destiny pummels Mariah who cries uncontrollably from the beating. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even doing anything!\u201d \u201cDON\u2019T THINK I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT YOU\u2019RE THINKING!!\u201d Destiny finishes by slamming the centauress butt first into the cell walls where Mariah\u2019s hindquarters are stuck. Mariah struggles to pull herself free as Destiny walks out of the door and slams it shut with the centaur along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is getting worse,\u201d says Clover. \u201cThe inmates are getting punished even when they\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d Cree gives a whimper. \u201cAnd when they do, we get punished as well. My mouth is still sore from when Destiny beat on me. Aurelia had to put my dinner in the blender.\u201d Clover gave a trumpet and a hiss. \u201cYou like, don\u2019t know how easy you have it. They don\u2019t make dentures for tusks. If my teeth get broken then I\u2019ll never get a man. Cree, you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re already married.\u201d Suddenly, both Clover and Cree froze in place and Destiny glared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DON\u2019T PAY YOU TO GOSSIP YOU BLATHERING FAT CANTALOUPE! GET BACK TO WORK OR I\u2019LL TIE YOUR NOSE IN A KNOT!\u201d Clover screamed and ran off crying before Destiny glared at Cree who whimpered and scurried away on all fours. Destiny was about to scream at Cree next but then she heard the sound of a punch clock and then turned around to see Simone trying to sneak away from the punch clock as she gave a wimpy sounding monkey shriek. \u201cSIMONE!\u201d yelled Destiny as her flaming hair erupted again. \u201cYOU\u2019RE 15 MINUTES LATE! I EXPECT CONTROL AND DISCIPLINE IN MY PRISON! WHAT IF AN INMATE GOT LOOSE IN YOUR TURF AND YOU DIDN\u2019T REACH THEM IN TIME!\u201d Simone was too scared to shriek and then Destiny proceeded to beat the everloving snot out of her as you tremble. \u201cI\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d You say. Destiny was driven so berserk by that evil spirit of rage that not even the guards were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Doris the executioner was there and she was scared to death. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says the gryphon. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if Belladonna needs a friend in Aquaslab. I\u2019m not even going to hand in my resignation to that walking Mt. Vesuvius. I\u2019m getting the heck out of here.\u201d Doris immediately ran to her locker and emptied everything out of it into a bag, up to including a rubber ducky with horns. She zipped her bag and flew off as Cree and Clover gulped. \u201cEven the executioner has abandoned us. We\u2019re doomed.\u201d Cree then gasped as she looked out the window. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said. Outside the window was Aurelia and she was walking right into Under Gloom and from the looks of it, she was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria floats in front of Aurelia, still holding her throat in pain as the jackal giantess walks into the prison. \u201cIt isn\u2019t visiting hours, Aurelia,\u201d says Aria with worry in her tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to...\u201d Aurelia just pushes Aria to the side and gives a growl. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Aurelia walks through the prison as Cree runs down to intercept her wife. \u201cAurelia! What the hell are you doing here?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m giving that tomato-haired temper tantrum a piece of my mind for how she\u2019s been treating you lately.\u201d Cree looks in horror. \u201cBelieve me, Aurelia,\u201d says the werehyena. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to run into Destiny.\u201d \u201cOh yes I do,\u201d says Aurelia. \u201cNobody beats up on my wife and gets away with it.\u201d Cree looks in terror as her mate walks forward and then there\u2019s a stomping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny comes down, more pissed than ever, skin bright red, spikes and teeth as sharp as knives, horns like a demon and her flaming hair burning so bright that the walls were starting to melt and char. You look at Aurelia in your cage and then step back in fear as Destiny growls at the jackal giantess. \u201cCREE! WHAT IS YOUR WIFE DOING HERE?! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU THAT ONLY STAFF WAS ALLOWED IN THIS WAY!\u201d Cree cowers in front of Destiny but an angry Aurelia just steps forward. \u201cListen here, Demona,\u201d says Aurelia with a voice full of spite. \u201cWarden or no warden, I will not tolerate an abusive boss, especially if said abusive boss employs my wife. It was not Cree\u2019s fault that Ariel escaped and even if it was, you had no right to beat her senseless.\u201d Destiny\u2019s hair begins to burn brighter as her eyes glow orange-yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d says Aurelia. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting like a complete jerk lately! I don\u2019t know how anyone could stand being around somebody who\u2019s always as angry as you are!

There is a look of pure anger in her one good eye and she holds her own claws out as she seems to prepare to fight Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

But yesterday. Ouch. I couldn't believe it. Mom has never been that cranked before. This sounds like more than mere stress.\" As Fate was flying to work, she looked out towards Under Gloom and she was wondering if Destiny was still livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Fate had arrived at the Daily Tombstone, where she worked as a security guard. She was taking her tray to a table and was with a fellow guard. This guard was a behemoth, a monster resembling, a giant dragon-like hippopotamus. The behemoth was as big and fat as Fate and had tan-yellow skin, long light brown hair and what looked like a skull tattoo on her right butt cheek. Fate and her behemoth friend sat down at the table and immediately dug in to several burgers but while the behemoth was shoveling away, Fate was eating rather slowly and nervously. \u201cSomething bothering you, Fate?\u201d asked the behemoth woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s my mom, Beth,\u201d said Fate. \u201cYesterday she was totally pissed.\u201d Beth just rolls her eyes before shoving some fries down her large mouth. \u201cSo what else is new?\u201d \u201cThis was different,\u201d says Fate. \u201cShe was literally burning with rage. I actually saw her rip an attempted escapee\u2019s tail off and throw it in the garbage.\u201d Beth slurps a milkshake before letting out a loud belch as she answers. \u201cWhoa,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s harsh.\u201d \u201cIt gets worse,\u201d says Fate through a mouth full of fries. \u201cShe beat on Cree and Clover for it.\u201d As Fate drinks her own shake, Beth raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s not like Destiny. Sure, she\u2019s an ill-tempered, man-hating crank but she\u2019s not abusive.\u201d \u201cIt gets worse,\u201d says Fate with a slight belch. \u201cAfterwards, she made the inmates wash their uniforms in bedpans.\u201d \u201cFate,\u201d says Beth as she shoves pterodactyl nuggets into her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate lets out a moan as she plays with her straw. \u201cShe even looked different. She was bigger and beefier, her skin was blood red and her hair was on fire.\u201d Beth lets out a gag on her burger. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d says Beth. \u201cFate, you ever heard of the eight deadly sins?\u201d \u201cEight?\u201d asks Fate as she devours a hotdog. \u201cI thought there were only seven.\u201d \u201cYou ever heard of the sometimes y rule. This is the sometimes despair rule.\u201d \u201cDespair is a sin?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re missing my point. For each of the eight sins, there is an evil spirit that corresponds to the sin. These spirits merge with the souls of a victim and force them to feed the sin, thereby indulging in it. It sounds to me like your mom somehow got possessed by the sin of wrath.\u201d \u201cOh geez,\u201d moans Fate. \u201cAnd she had a nasty temper before. We\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth lets out another belch before speaking. \u201cI think I might know how to fix the problem. Tomorrow, Lexi is hiring a couple of new guards in the event neither of us can make it to work. We can go to the library and maybe find a way to exorcise that evil spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

There has to be something in her that explains why she acts like she's got a you-know-what up her you-know-where. You start to laugh because you learn that Destiny was rather overweight in high school and in college. She looked like a blue skinned and red haired version of her daughter with longer horns. Then you see Destiny accompanying another female gargoyle, you learn that this is her sister. From the looks of it, Destiny's sister is a brown-skinned gargoyle with curved horns and ridged pink bat-like wings and long blonde hair. She appeared to be five years younger than Destiny given that you see an image of her as a child while Destiny is a teenager. Apparently her sister's name was Fortuna. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Fortuna</b></span>?\" you ask. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Was your mother a fortuneteller or something</span></b>?\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Yes</span></i>,\" says Destiny in annoyance. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">She was.

That must've been her ex. Then you see one morning with the two of them in bed with Destiny having motion sickness and her boyfriend with an \"Oh Crap\" look on his face as he appears to be getting ready to scram. Given that the next scene shows Destiny at the doctor learning of her pregnancy, you take it that schlub knew what was coming. Then you see an image of months later with Destiny holding Fate's egg and appears to be crying. You let out a laugh as Destiny is getting more and more frustrated with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you decide to see how that Fortuna bimbo turned out and see Destiny playing the best woman at Fortuna's wedding, albeit with a bitter look on her face and a glare at the groom who appears to be a black skinned gargoyle with rose colored hair. Fat appears to be a flower girl at the wedding which would mean that Fate had to be at least six when Fortuna and her husband were married. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I take it you have issues your brother-in-law. Kinda looks like..</span></b>.\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">I know what you're gonna say Wade, but I don't care. I don't like any man and I'll be crucified if I let some bum take advantage of my sister. So far he's been responsible, but I swear, if he tries to pull anything, I'll skin him alive.</span></i>\" You learn that Destiny's brother-in-law is named David. Kind of ironic when you think about it. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">And don't you compare by brother-in-law to that bearded pig. If that scummy son of a bitch you're thinking about were at Under Gloom, I'd feed him to Persephone</span></i>.\" You mentally give Destiny the finger as she pulls out the last quill and grits her teeth as she approaches her door and tries to unlock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the door is already unlocked and Destiny groans before she opens it to see Fortuna and David inside. \"Well, look who's back,\" says Fortuna. \"Hey there, big sister. I thought that you were going to be late, so we let ourselves in.\" Destiny lets out a mutter. \"You know,\" she says. \"In some parts, that's considered a crime.\" \"Lighten up,\" says Fortuna with a smirk. \"Demona.\" Fortuna laughs and you laugh as well. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Ha! Even your own sister calls you \"Demona\", Demona</span></b>.\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Shut up Wade!</span></i>\" \"Is everything okay, Destiny?\" asks David. \"You look more tense than you usually do.\" You then push Destiny out of the way in the mind. \"<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>What the?!</i></span>\" yells Destiny in her mind before you speak. \"And you're just as ugly as ever, you failed abortion.\" Fortuna and David are both shocked at what \"Destiny\" just said. \"You don't have to be a jerk about it,\" says David. \"What crawled up your craw?\" Destiny is visibly mad with you. But you smirk at her in the mind and flip her off. You made Destiny give a threatening gesture David's way as David looked on in confusion. But as you were walking, you let out a yell because you trip on something, or rather, someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the floor and look in your surprise to see that you caused Destiny's body to trip on a younger gargoyle. You'd say a teenager that looked like a female version of David and was surprisingly only 450ft tall, less than half Destiny's height. \"Ouch.\" Moaned the female gargoyle. \"Destiny,\" says Fortuna. \"Be careful. Pearl, are you alright, honey.\" You then cause Destiny's body to stand up and yell at Pearl. \"Watch where you're going, shrimp!\" Pearl does not take this well. \"Watch where I'm going? You were the one not paying attention, Auntie D? Wait, what was that?\" \"You heard me, you undercooked runt, get out of my way.\" Fortuna is shocked at what she is seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny!\" she yells as she stand between her sister and her daughter, completely unaware of the situation. \"What is wrong with you? You're acting really nasty today.\" Destiny then takes over and grunts. \"Sorry about that, sis,\" she says. \"I'm not exactly feeling myself today. Something happened at work that I'd like to forget happened.\" \"That's no reason to be so mean.\" Mutters Pearl. Destiny is visibly mad at you. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">The lousy brat started it. What's with that midget? I thought gargoyles were supposed to be huge?</span></b>\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Pearl is a dwarf by gargoyle standards</span></i>,\" says Destiny to you. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Show some sensitivity.\"</span></i> You flip Destiny off and then she begins to wring herself by the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" yells Fortuna as she stops her sister. \"Destiny, are you feeling alright?!\" \"I'm fine!\" yells Destiny. David looks very worried. \"I think she's finally lost her marbles.\" Destiny makes her eyes glow red.\" \"I think I better get dinner ready,\" says Fortuna as she walks into the kitchen. \"Let's just home you have something other than pre-cooked junk food in your fridge.\" \"Oh no,\" says Destiny. \"I'm coming with you. Last time I let you use my kitchen, you made a mess of things.\" Destiny accidentally runs into the wall and then begins to swear under her breath as you laugh at her.</span></div></div>",

Then come back to me.\" She said, still bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine thanked her and left. The Doctor sighed and walked over to a nearby radio, turning it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're listening to KRRZ-19. The home of classics and opera. It's almost 9 at night, which means in a few minutes, The Danielle Connor Show will be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor turned off the radio. She hated Danielle Connor. She was too energetic. She went back to her desk, but before she had a chance to sit down, Clover entered the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, are you alright?\" Clover asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, why?\" The Doctor replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darcy just escaped the prison.

The boggart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, The Doctor got up and ran over to the drawer where your body was kept.

Fortuna then reaches into a basket of some kind and lets out a sigh. \"It's a good thing I came prepared. Maybe a good meal will put you in a better mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna takes out what looks like a giant centipede and you reflexively force Destiny's body to grab her by the mouth.

Fortuna stops what she's doing and then raises a... gargoyles don't have eyebrows but you get the idea. \"Did you just call me Desdemona?\" You root around in Destiny's fridge and see several bottles of green soda pop that looks somewhat like ooze and then you see an old leftover pizza covered in dead cockroaches (you don't know if they're eating it or just part of the food). Then you see some strange literally blue cheese and take a slice. Then you give a smirk and spit on it, only for Destiny to grab herself by the throat to make you gag. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">I saw that, you three-layered little anus.

I mean, he's only a human, how bad can he be.\" \"You'd be surprised.\" Muttered Destiny. \"What surprises me is how that loincloth stays onto your thunder thighs, you goat-headed....\" Destiny covers her mouth to shut you up as Fortuna gasps and feels her thighs. They are rather large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me,\" says Fortuna, obviously annoyed. \"You know my butt slowly got fatter after a nineteen-year marriage. You're acting really nasty today.

So much that it cracked every window in the house. Destiny pants as David gives a shocked face at what he had just heard. Destiny then turns to a very scared Fortuna. \"Fortuna,\" she says. \"There's trouble at work.

He was also wearing a suit of armor like one that a samurai would wear and was sharpening his sword to discourage anyone in the store from making any moves while his mothman teammate robbed the place.

I knew all that stress and anger would ruin Mom some day, but I didn't think it would happen like this.\" Destiny shakes in place and grunts as Fate looks on and even starts to cry. \"I hate to do this to you, Sis,\" says Fortuna to Destiny. \"But you leave me no choice. Without proper help, your mental health is only going to get worse.\" Fate gets into the seat and then looks back at her mother. \"It's going to be okay, Mom. Dr. West is out sick, but Whitney should help you back on your talons.\" Fate kisses her mother on the forehead before she puts on her seatbelt and then Fortuna drives the car away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, within her own mind, Destiny is none too pleased with you. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Wade</span></i>,\" she says. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">You ass nugget. I hate you. You ruined my life. My family thinks I'm a lunatic, I've lost my job at Under Gloom and I broke one of my horns. You really outdid yourself this time, you heartless asshole</span></i>.\" \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Cry me a river, Demona</span></b>,\" you snap back. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">If you weren't such a psychotic bitch...</span></b>\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Because you kept driving me crazy</span></i>!\" \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">You think I like this development!? Now I'm gonna be stuck in a house for monster-sized retards!</span></b>\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">I wish I had a gun so I could shut you up once and for all, you jerk! I hope that your body gets eaten by a dinosaur and that dinosaur gets eaten by a minotaur</span></i>!\" \"<span class=\"cgreen\">It's go soak your head o'clock, you blue temper tantrum!</span>\" Destiny shakes angrily in the back seat as Fortuna and Fate look on in concern, not knowing it's you causing her distress. \"Oh good grief,\" says Fate. \"We can't get her to the K.D.P. fast enough. Damn that Wade. Even when he's in a coma, he wrecks Mom's life. I hope he never wakes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Under Gloom, Aria is floating through the hallway when she catches two guards slacking off. \"Up and at 'em,\" says the onryo. \"The government isn't paying you to slack off.\" \"Yes, Vice Warden.\" Groans the guards. In what was once Destiny's office, Belladonna is smiling blissfully as she twirls in the seat. Since Destiny has been declared legally insane, Belladonna has taken her place as the warden and the manticore was giggling to herself. \"I didn't even have to do anything. The blue mutant just self-destructed.\" Belladonna let out a laugh and then took out her laptop. \"Now,\" she says. \"I need a new uniform, one that says \"I'm the boss\".\" Belladonna just laughs again as she web searches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Fortuna and Fate have taken Destiny to the K.D.P. where they've met with the head orderly. She was an obese and albino skinned 975ft tall wererhinoceros who resembled a white rhinoceros in a silver bikini, a lab coat and a nurse's hat. She also wore a pair of glasses since rhinos have very bad eyesight. The rhino giantess had long orange-red hair and a blue tattoo of a rhinoceros' head over her right eye. \"Well,\" says the rhino woman to Destiny. \"Looks like that awful temper of yours finally boiled over.\" Destiny lets out a mumble. \"We really appreciate this, Whitney,\" says Fortuna. \"If anyone can get her to fly right again, it's you.\" Fate then hugs Destiny tight before Fortuna leads her out. \"Don't worry, you two,\" says Whitney. \"This time it's personal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scoff. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I can't believe it. I've gone from one prison to another with Rocksteady's daughter as the new warden.</span></b>\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">You had better be nice for Whitney, Wade. She happens to be my best friend</span></i>.\" \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I didn't know you had any friends</span></b>.\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Okay, now you're just being hurtful</span></i>.\" Whitney then undoes Destiny's muzzle. \"Whitney,\" says Destiny. \"This is a terrible mistake.\" Whitney just blows on her finger. \"I know what happened, Destiny. You've gotten so used to Wade that with him in a coma, you're now playing both sides of the argument. I'd even hazard a guess you've developed a split personality between the dedicated stone-faced prison warden and the obnoxious ne'er-do-well who pushes her buttons.\" Then you take over Destiny's body and snap at Whitney. \"Why don't you mind your own business, Fox Xanatos?!\" you shout. Whitney is confused at your statement and doesn't appear to understand what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney begins to wheel Destiny's body away. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Give it up, Wade</span></i>,\" says Destiny. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">Whitney has never heard of that TV show so you're wasting your breath. I don't think she even watches human TV. Besides, she barely looks like Fox at all.</span></i>.\" It was there you and Destiny see a blonde-haired human girl in a cage on Dr. West's desk. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Slyvia? What the hell is she doing here</span></b>?\" \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">You know her</span></i>?\" You let out a scoff. \"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Well duh. She's a floozy I met in Kansas. I bet she still thinks I'm her boyfriend</span></b>.\" You let out a laugh while Destiny is appalled. \"<i><span class=\"cviolet\">You are going straight to hell, Wade, you know that, don't you?</span></i>\" You then give Destiny a raspberry and cause her to have a hissy fit as Whitney tries to hold her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney just rolls her eyes as Destiny's eyes turn red. \"This is gonna be hard.\"</span></div></div>",

Fearing what you would see, you look away as you raise an arm, only to glance back and confirm that Lockette's reflection was doing the same. With a sigh, you look down at yourself, as if you needed any more confirmation. You were Lockette, completely and totally. That damn Kappa! This isn't what you wanted! And...what happened to Lockette? Because as much as you hated to admit it, you cared about her somewhat. You were cellmates after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, your old body begins to stir, and you realize just how crazy the size difference was. Of course you were very aware of it <i>before</i>, but never from this angle. \"Was I sleeping?\" your old voice says lazily. It rolls off of its side and puts a hand to its head. \"I don't remember going to sleep...\" \"Well, that's a funny story actually...\" you begin to say shakily, unnerved by the fact that you sounded <i>exactly </i>like her. \"Wait, I didn't say...Wade? Wait, what's going on?!\" she begins to yell, now suddenly awake and looking around in a daze. As you shared an infirmary bed, she was shocked to have to crane her head up...and up...and up...to see the face of someone so ginormously huge she had a hard time comprehending it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her </i>old face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's what happened. That Kappa's potion must've swapped us around, or some shit.\" Lockette put her hands on her (your) head, letting out a much due groan of anger as you sheepishly rubbed your elongated neck. This wasn't exactly ideal for you either, seeing as how you were not only a giant Loch Ness Monster-woman, but you were also a <i>woman</i> and a <i>monster</i>. But your worries didn't compare to Lockette's. After all, she's now in a body that may be in prison for a <i>long </i>time, of which the warden hates with all her being. Whereas you were now in a body that might even be released <i>soon</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette was always known for her good behavior...maybe...that's how you'll leave the prison? As Lockette? Is that even possible? Could you live like that? Could you live <i>with yourself</i> if you did that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you had time to grieve over lost old-lives for very long, however, as the door to the infirmary practically burst open with the entrance of...</span></div></div>",

It's a special potion that can change the species of anyone who comes into contact with it. Be it drinking it or getting it on yout skin. All you need to do is think of the species you want. And you can dump on others, and they turn into the species you want.\" Shelly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound excited by it. Should that worry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I used it a lot to evaid authorites. It works perfectly. Oh, and one more thing. If there is a disease or disorder specific to a monster, like Lactose Overload Syndrome for example, you can think of both the species and the condition, and the potion will give whoever comes into contact with it that condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.

With the chaos this potion causes, you could slip out unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Shelly replies before handing you the vial. The vial was surprisingly light for have a potion in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go, let me suggest something.\" Shelly says. \"If you want to cause maximum chaos in here, try putting the potion in the prison sprinkler system. Every inmate will get soaked, and in the confusion, you can slip out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, that sounded pretty good. So you waited for a guard to come back to check on Shelly. When one did, you ran out the now open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of running and hiding, you made it to the sprinkler control system in the basement. Climbing up, which wasn't easy with a vial on yout back, you went to an opening on the water tank where you could dump the potion. Now all you had to do was think of a monster type.

Maybe if you just play it cool and calm with the staff and other prisoners, especially Destiny, perhaps there could be some hope you might get out of prison one day. Besides, many escape plans would and might have failed somehow in some way, so perhaps being a good prisoner could win you some brownie points with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw this. I might as well be a good prisoner and perhaps I might get out of here one day. Just got to avoid causing any trouble for now.\" you suggested to yourself, and it is quite a plan. Staying on good behavior could help you build relationships or so, and doing that might mean one day you might just leave prison. It's not the best plan in the book in any sort of way, but it's one worth trying. You then decide to just sit around, letting the hours go by and all, and then Destiny comes to the prison cell you are in.

I'm beginning to think Lockette was right,\" you lie through your teeth. \"After all, all my escape attempts got me nowhere. Maybe serving my time, good behavior...\" Destiny drinks from a water tower sized bottle of soda pop before she answers you. \"You aren't a fertilizer salesman, Wade, so don't go selling me 1500 tons of crap. You and \"good behavior\" go together like donuts and mayonnaise. What do you think I am, an idiot?!\" \"You don't want me to answer that.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just great, Destiny was skeptical. Makes sense.

Get in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiobhan? What kind of dumb name is that. \"In case you're wondering, Wade,\" says Destiny. \"It's Irish. The new guard's mother was a banshee. A good friend of mine I might add. Siobhan.\" The door opened but from your spot on Destiny's desk, you didn't see anyone. You walked to the edge of the table and look down in surprise. The guard was a pandaren, a panda-type were bear but she was only 100ft tall, 1/10th Destiny's height. The smallest adult monster was 300ft. Destiny wouldn't hire a kid, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A panda?\" you ask. \"Destiny, are you serious?\" You have to fight back the urge to laugh or you'll blow your cover. \"Besides, don't you know there are child labor laws.\" Siobhan gives an angry roar that forces you to cover your hears. \"Watch what you say!\" yells the panda. \"I was born in 1988. I have a condition! Since my body can only accept meat, I have a growth deficiency.\" \"Meat?\" you ask. You thought pandas only ate bamboo, but then you gasp because Siobhan shows her teeth and you see that they look like those of a mako shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siobhan will be your warden for the next 365 days,\" said Destiny. \"And remember. If you aren't truly reformed, she can eat you.\" You begin to shiver as you notice that Siobhan is staring at you and the panda/banshee hybrid is drooling. Destiny even smiles smugly.

Anyway, that book you\u2019re holding is a death note and if you write somebody\u2019s name in it, that person, or monster, will die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the book in your hands in shock \u201cYou\u2019re saying this book can kill absolutely anyone, just by writing their name in it?\u201d Renn nods \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I dropped it on top of you, to see if you would use it, and so you could see and hear me. You see, even by monster standards, Shinigami are considered myths.

But, if this works you'll be out of here and home free, with no worries of Destiny or anyone else coming after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your plan meant that you would have to play suck up to Destiny. Just the thought of it made you cringe and gag at the same time. But if you played your cards right, and made her think you were truly sorry for what you did (-which of course was a lie) then you'd be out of here in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back in your cell, and wait for Destiny to make her daily rounds, going around and checking all the cells.

I have more important things to do than chit chat with a criminal like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it. Time to put your acting skills to the test. You pretend to hang your head in shame and say \"I've had a lot of time to think while I've been here, and, well, I kind of regret setting that mummy on fire, along with the other stuff I've done. Getting into fights, stealing cars, too much stuff to list really. I just though you should know, you won't be hearing about any more escape attempts from me. I'll serve my time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you expected, Destiny is skeptical. \"Why should I believe you?

You heard about Gnarly Nani; she was a nandi bear, a monstrous beast resembling a one eyed cross between a baboon and a hyena. That woman was one of the more hot-tempered inmates. \"I heard that Gnarly Nani was building a tunnel,\" says Destiny. \"Perhaps you could infiltrate her gang and see if the rumors are true?\" There was nothing you hated more than a fink, but to fink on a giant monster? Gnarly Nani would kill you if you ratted her out. But maybe you could use her alleged tunnel to escape yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" says Destiny. \"There's a second option. My little sister, Fortuna, in Dreadberry said that there's a bank robber on the loose called Specter and the sheriff is having trouble catching them.

Maybe I can pay my debt to society by catching Specter was it?\" Destiny nods her head and unlocks your cell before she grabs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, you'll be staying with my sister and don't you make any trouble for her, her husband or my niece or you're gonna get it.\" You groan. Terrific, your one chance to get out of Under Gloom and you have to stay with Destiny's relatives. This sucked, but at least there was a chance you could escape. A few hours later, Destiny has locked you up in a cave with your arms crossed as you pout. She is speaking to Belladonna, the vice warden manticore. \"I won't be back until tomorrow Belladonna,\" says Destiny. \"So I need you to <i>temporarily</i> be in charge of things until I come back from visiting my sister. I don't want to hear about any problems while I'm away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna lets out a snicker and salutes Destiny. \"Don't worry Warden,\" she says. \"Nothing will go wrong.\" Destiny just gestures to her second in command that she is watching her and then flies off, carrying you in the cage. There's a strange collar that Destiny put around your neck. \"Hey Demona,\" you complain. \"What's with the collar? And why don't we take a car?\" Destiny's eyes light up. \"Call me Demona one more time and I'll drop you. As for your question, I don't own a car. What would a flying monster need with one?\" You knew this was going to be a long trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two of you are flying over a small town with homey looking buildings in contrast to the skyscrapers of Fearfield. There is a sign that reads \"Welcome to Dreadberry\" and the skies above are unusually sunny and unclouded for being an area in a monster world. Destiny flies to the ground and holds her wings into a makeshift cape as she walks down the street carrying you. She eventually comes up to a pinkish colored two floor house and walks up to the door. Destiny knocks on the door and you look up to see somebody opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gargoyle girl was slightly shorter than Destiny with smaller horns, albeit curved downwards and with tan skin and long blonde hair. Her wings were a pinkish color and she was wearing a shirt shirt and blue skirt with an apron. You take it that was Fortuna given how she smiled at the sight of Destiny. \"Destiny!\" yells the other gargoyle as she hugs Destiny to the blue gargoyle's discomfort. \"What's shaking big sister?\" Destiny shoves her sister off before walking in. \"Hello Fortuna,\" she says. \"I can't stay long, this is a work related visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna shakes her head. \"You're no fun Sis. It's all work and no play. Relax once in a while.\" Destiny lets out a scoff. \"With my job, every second counts. I already regret leaving that backstabbing arachnid Belladonna in charge. By the way, Fortuna, I need to ask you a favor.\" \"Shoot.\" Destiny holds you up in your cage and Fortuna looks in confusion. \"Take a picture horn head,\" you say rudely. \"It'll last longer.\" \"You must be that Wade character my big sis is always complaining about,\" says Fortuna with a chuckle. \"I can't believe this is the guy who causes you so much grief Destiny. He looks harmless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny pounds on the wall to get her sister's attention. \"Don't be a fool Fortuna,\" she says. \"This, this Wade has been driving me crazy since he came to Under Gloom. I'm ready to pull my hair out and floss with it because of this rule breaking little creep. But the punk says he's learned his lesson. Since I highly doubt it, I've taken him here to help your sheriff catch Specter.\" Destiny hands Fortuna your cage and Fortuna looks dumbfounded. \"Destiny, even Maggie hasn't been able to catch Specter. And you're trusting a human to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny takes out what looks like a remote control with only one button and gives it to Fortuna. \"Trust <i>him</i>? Yeah right, I'm giving him thirty days to catch Specter before I haul his carcass back to Under Gloom. If he gives you any trouble, press that button, it will give the malcontent a nasty shock.\" You couldn't believe it. Destiny put a shock collar on you. \"This is an outrage!\" you yell. \"Talk about mistrust you big blue son of a..!\" Destiny presses the button and you let out a scream as the collar sparks electricity and zaps you. You pant as Destiny nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get fresh Wade,\" she says. \"You will behave for my relatives or I'll dismantle you.\" As Destiny is saying this, you move your lips to mouth her words, just to mock her. Fortuna notices this and holds her finger over the button to gesture to you to stop. \"What's going on here Fortuna?\" asks a male voice. Into the room walks a tall pitch black skinned male gargoyle with light rose colored hair. Destiny just rolls her eyes at the sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello David.\" Says Destiny. \"Destiny?\" asks the male garg. \"Hey, hey, how's my favorite sister-in-law doing.\" Destiny reluctantly shakes hands before David notices you. \"Fortuna,\" he asks. \"Dear, what exactly is going on?\" Fortuna lets out a smile. \"Oh nothing David,\" she says. \"Destiny just brought one of her prisoners to help the sheriff with the specter case.\" David lets out a sigh. \"Well, he better catch him, or her or whatever Specter is. The bank manager threatened to can me if I let that ghost get in one more time.\" You take it Destiny's brother-in-law was a guard at the bank. You almost laugh at how a relative of that blue nightmare was having trouble with specter just as Fortuna opens the cage to let you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" says Destiny. \"Where's Pearl?\" \"In school,\" replies Fortuna. \"<i>Our</i> daughter is still a teenager you know. How's Fate doing? I take it she's still single.\" Destiny nods her head. \"And I plan to keep it that way.\" You let out a scoff. \"Marriage is a scam,\" you say. \"Take you for example Goliath, you get stuck with that big blue harpy as an in-lAAAA!!!!\" Fortuna presses the remote again to zap you. \"Geez,\" says David. \"That human is not like Neil at all. Could stand to learn some manners.\" You flip off the male gargoyle before Fortuna glares at you and shakes the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll leave him in your hands,\" says Destiny. \"And I'm really sorry for the horror I've unleashed on you.\" \"Up yours Demona.\" You say to Destiny as you flip her off. Destiny gets so mad that she almost pounds you into paste but David grabs her by the arm to stop her. Fortuna breaks into laughter. \"Oh. That's what they've been calling you since they noticed the resemblance.\" Fortuna laughs but Destiny is unamused. \"It's NOT funny!\" she yells. \"You gotta admit it's a little funny.\" Says Fortuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny leaves in a rage and slams the door. \"Good riddance.\" You say. \"I'd behave myself better if I were you,\" says David. \"You're not in Dreadberry even ten minutes and you've been nothing but rude and insulting. And I used to wonder what crawled up that woman's craw.\" You stick out your tongue as Fortuna picks you up and shakes her head. \"I hope for your sake you don't act like this when we take you to meet Sheriff Reaver.\" \"Another gargoyle?\" you ask. \"Nemean lion actually.\" Nemean Lion?! That woman clearly sent you here to get eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can complain, the door opens up and Fortuna turns her head. \"Hi Pearl,\" she says. \"How was school today?\" You look forward but don't see anyone. That's when you look down to see Pearl, Destiny's niece and you were surprised. She was barely half the height of either of her parents, which surprised you greatly. She had to be 450ft tall which was unusual given that gargoyles were usually the biggest monsters there were. Destiny herself was the biggest monster you've ever seen. Pearl looked like a female version of her father with white hair that had pinkish tints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School was okay. We're starting a project tomorrow and Mrs. Keys is assigning us partners. I just hope I don't get stuck with Onyx again.\" Pearl looks up and notices you before Fortuna explains everything. \"You just missed your Aunt Destiny. She's arranged fro one of her inmates to stay with us and help the sheriff with Specter.\" Pearl blinks slightly. \"A human in a monster jail? I'm surprised he isn't bones.\" \"And I'm surprised your species is smart enough to talk shrimp boat.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Pearl lets out a growl and hovers in the air as she glares at you. \"What was that?\" she asks in a threatening tone. \"You heard me you rabid midget. I've seen leprechauns bigger than you.\" Pearl is about to attack you when David grabs her by the tail. \"Calm down Pearl,\" he says to his daughter. \"Geez, that bugger is provocative.\" \"Wade,\" says Fortuna in an annoyed tone. \"Don't make fun of Pearl's height. The doctor said she had a growth defect and she's rather sensitive about it.\" \"I can see,\" you say mockingly. \"She's almost as fiery as that crone sister of yours.\" Fortuna shocks you again as you scream and Pearl manages to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a long month.\" The teenage gargoyle mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next Day...</span></div></div>",

You notice that Pearl left her backpack right outside her bedroom door and slide down the table you were sleeping on before you walk towards the backpack chuckling to yourself. \"Stupid gargoyles,\" you say to yourself. \"Destiny's sister has got to be as empty headed as that big blue bitch herself. Now, here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unzip the front zipper to Pearl's backpack and then you slide right in. You laugh to yourself. \"This is perfect. I'll follow the brat to school, hitch a ride on some unsuspecting sap and soon enough I'll be out of this town. I doubt that shock collar works beyond this hillbilly hellhole. Wade, you finally outsmarted that damn Demona.\" You were confident this plan would succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Pearl is just putting on her backpack and is getting ready for school when Fortuna comes in. \"Pearl,\" says Fortuna to her daughter. \"Have you seen Wade today? I'm supposed to take him to meet Sheriff Reaver today.\" \"No Mom,\" says Pearl. \"I haven't seen Wade. And I don't want to see that insulting twerp.\" Fortuna lets out a sigh. \"I know he was extremely rude yesterday, but your aunt is trusting him to help Maggie catch Specter.\" Pearl lets out a laugh at that thought. \"Come on Mom,\" she says. \"Aunt Destiny doesn't trust anyone.\" \"She trusts me to zap him. Well, first things first. You better head to school. You're not forgetting anything are you.\" \"No Mom, I'm perfectly fine. Checked everything before I went to bed last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief. If Pearl double checked her backpack, you'd be toast. Fortuna bends down to kiss Pearl and smiles. \"Have a good day at school sweetie.\" \"I hope so.\" Says Pearl. With that Pearl has stepped out of the house and is flying off to high school, completely unaware of her passenger. You laugh to yourself and rub your hands. As soon as Pearl lands, you unzip the zipper slightly and see that she's at a school called Nightmare High. You look out and see all sorts of giant monster teenagers. Aside from the fact that the students are monsters, it seems to be an average high school setting, albeit with sasquatch jocks, gorgon cheerleaders and a nerdy sphinx or two. However, all the monsters are taller than Pearl. You even see a leprechaun girl who was slightly bigger than the gargoyle shrimp. You let out a chuckle. \"How embarrassing,\" you think to yourself. \"She really is a runt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl walks up and sees one of her friends waving at her. You look in surprise because this monster girl looked like a living rag doll. She had yellow eyes and long blue hair and a zipper for a mouth. She was wearing a patchwork dress and mittens and didn't appear to have fingers. \"Hey Emerald,\" says Pearl as she shakes hands with her friend. \"How're you doing?\" The rag doll giantess smiles and nods her head as Pearl smiles at her. But then Pearl lets out a sigh. \"Well, you're lucky. I've got company and he is the worst. You remember my Aunt Destiny? The prison warden?\" Emerald nods her head. \"Well, she sent one of her crooks over to stay with us. He's supposed to help your aunt catch Specter.\" Aunt? This rag doll was the sheriff's niece? But Fortunate said the sheriff was a Nemean lion. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald just raised an eye. \"I know Under Gloom is a woman's prison. They made an exception for him since he was human. Just like your uncle.\" \"Uncle?!\" you think to yourself. From the context, the sheriff was married to a human. \"Who'd be stupid enough to marry a monster?\" you think to yourself. \"Especially a big mangy man-eating cat? That's when you zip yourself back into the backpack and you feel Pearl moving as the gargoyle girl gets to class. But which class?</span></div></div>",

Aside from being monsters as big as skyscrapers, they all were dressed like the kinds of teenagers you\u2019d expect from high school, to the overweight werelizard anime geek to the musclebound kappa jock. You then begin to climb out of Pearl\u2019s backpack and take a look at the classroom. In the corner there\u2019s a werewolf skeleton on display (You\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s real or plastic), on the back table there are several jars including one filled with dead snakes being preserved in chemicals and there was also what looked like the head of an anatomy dummy and a shelf full of beakers containing technicolor liquids that seemed to be glowing as well as what looks like several jars containing different types of molds, spores and fungi. \u201cOh great,\u201d you mutter. \u201cScience class. No way am I sticking around.\u201d With that, you start to make your escape as Pearl takes out her science textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the Sirtis residence, Fortuna is turning the house upside-down looking for you as David looks on, eating a piece of leftover pizza. \u201cWhere could one human disappear too? Doesn\u2019t that Wade know he\u2019s supposed to meet with the sheriff?\u201d David let out a scoff. \u201cDo you honestly think that somebody like that would hold up their end of the bargain. You heard the nasty things he said at dinner last night.\u201d Fortuna growls as her eyes glow red. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me, David. That rude little punk has only been here for one day and I already can\u2019t stand him. No wonder that sister of mine is so ill-tempered.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says David as he rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t killed him by now. Wait. I just had a thought; maybe he followed Pearl to school in an attempt to escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna punches the wall, leaving a large dent in it, startling her husband. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. Pearl\u2019s Napoleon complex had her touchy enough but that ****ing Wade had her almost as angry as Destiny with all those insults he hurled. The last thing we need is for our daughter to be tormented by someone that obnoxious in our own home. Now he\u2019s going to cause an uproar at Nightmare High.\u201d \u201cLook on the bright side, Fortuna,\u201d says David as he shrugs his shoulders. \u201cMaybe somebody will eat him.\u201d Fortuna gives a scoff. \u201cWith his bad attitude, they\u2019ll get indigestion. Destiny won\u2019t be happy when she hears what happened.\u201d David gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019ll bet that fire eating sister of yours doesn\u2019t care what happens as long as she\u2019s dumped that creep off on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fortuna has a flash and a sinister smirk appears on her face that intimidates David. \u201cOh, David,\u201d says Fortuna. \u201cHow is that sister of yours doing?\u201d David gives a look of concern. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says. \u201cFortuna, you\u2019re not seriously thinking of dumping Wade off on Catherine. The last thing she needs is someone ridiculing her about her condition.\u201d Fortuna gives an evil smirk at her husband. \u201cAu contraire,\u201d says Fortuna. \u201cIf memory serves, every monster that lives above the gym your sister owns has Glutos Syndrome, including her. And if memory serves, when all those girls see a human man, they get more than a little excited.\u201d Fortuna gives an evil laugh that would make Demona herself blush and David lets out a groan. \u201cMy mother told me she was insane,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cBut did I listen?\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you have managed to free yourself from Pearl\u2019s backpack and begin to move towards the door. \u201cSee you later, you angry dwarf.\u201d you say. However, before you could leave, into the room waddles an obese gryphon woman with the lower body of a reddish brown lioness and the upper body of an American bald eagle. She wore rectangular glasses and a white labcoat, which meant that she was clearly the science teacher. \u201cGood morning, class.\u201d Says the gryphon giantess. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Keys.\u201d Says the entire class. Mrs. Keys adjusts her glasses as she steps forward with what looks like a cooler. You have to move out of the way to avoid being stepped on. \u201cToday,\u201d says Mrs. Keys. \u201cWe will be reviewing what we\u2019ve discussed about anatomy. It\u2019s that time of your school career when you have to get down and dirty. There will be no squeamishness in this class today.\u201d As Ms. Keys is saying this, the mer-lioness in the corner looks nervously at the cooler and you move your hand to mock the bird teacher without her noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Keys then opens the cooler to see that it is full of dead cycloptic frogs with six legs, each frog the size of a parade float. \u201cUgh,\u201d you say. \u201cThey\u2019re dissecting frogs today? Now I remember why I hate school.\u201d \u201cEach pupil, take a frog and return to your seats for dissection.\u201d The entire class moves forward, in the process, pushing Pearl to the side. Pearl grunts as she tries to move about, but the rest of her classmates utterly dwarf her. You can\u2019t help but laugh as she struggles. By the time Pearl reaches the cooler, every other student has already gotten their frog and Pearl looks in the cooler in confusion. \u201cUh,\u201d she says. \u201cMrs. Keys. \u201cThere appears to be a frog missing from the cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further inspection, Mrs. Keys realized what Pearl was saying was true. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled the gryphon giantess to herself. \u201cI would\u2019ve bet money that there was one more frog in that cooler. I told that husband of mine those were for my class, not for dinner.\u201d Mrs. Keys grumbled to herself and even plucked out one of her own feathers. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019ll have to do the dissection tomorrow?\u201d asks Pearl. You let out a scoff and just continue to walk towards the exit. What was going on, clearly was no skin off of your nose. While those monster teens were busy with their experiment, you\u2019ll just walk out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink, Ophelia,\u201d thought Mrs. Keys to herself. \u201cI\u2019m not one to let one of my students fall behind the others. Then again, Pearl\u2019s so short, who would notice if she was held back? Okay, that was a mean thing to think. I just had to use frogs. If I could find enough humans, I\u2019d have the class dissect them.\u201d Of course, you have no idea what this massive obese gryphon lady is thinking and your only concern is escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then...</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Keys snatches you up and you grunt. \"Hey!\" you yell. \"Watch those claws feather face!\" \"A human!\" yells the gryphon. \"Did you figure that out for yourself,\" you mutter. \"Or did you have help.\" Mrs. Keys bites her beak at that remark. \"An obnoxious human.\" You even spit in Mrs. Keys's eye, forcing her to wipe her glasses as she clicks her beak and the class looks on. \"Where did that human come from?\" asks the otaku lizard boy. \"Who cares?\" asks a werecrab boy with a sigh as he's already dissecting his frog. The merlioness turns her head and shivers as Emerald is so shocked that the zipper on her mouth comes undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pearl is the one most stunned. \"What is that idiot doing here?\" the dwarf gargoyle thinks to herself. \"Oh man. If Mrs. Keys finds out I'm the one who brought him here, I'm in big trouble. If he makes her two mad, I might even get suspended.\" Pearl then looks in fear as Mrs. Keys turns to her and then looks at you with an evil smile. \"Oh, Pearl,\" says Mrs. Keys. \"I think that I found an answer to your problem.\" Pearl actually looks worried. \"Yes, Mrs. Keys?\" Pearl asks in worry. Mrs. Keys gives an evil laugh. \"I may have one less frog than required for the class, but I found something just as good as a frog.\" Pearl gasps and the merlioness in the corner even outright faints and hits the floor with a thump. You look up and gulp because obviously there's nothing good in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a minute, you are taped to a piece of glass by the limbs and placed on Pearl's desk. \"No way,\" says Pearl. \"Mrs. Keys. You can't be serious. You do realize that I'm a gargoyle, right? This is against my species' principles.\" \"Like that's ever stopped that blue-skinned temper tantrum you call an aunt you living anthill.\" Pearl holds up a knife and stabs it right to your side as she growls at you. Mrs. Keys gives a blink. \"Does this guy <i>really</i> sound like he's worth protecting?\" \"Shut your piehole Big Bird!\" you yell. Mrs. Keys in response puts tape over your mouth and then walks back to her desk. Pearl looks down at you uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" asks Pearl. \"If I don't cut him up, I'll fail. But gargoyles aren't supposed to kill humans. Then again, he's a colossal jerk. What do I care if he gets chopped up?\" You look up at Pearl thinking it over and start to sweat as she holds up her knife. You could not believe this was happening. It would take a miracle to save your skin at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, at that moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fire alarm suddenly goes off, startling the entire class. Emerald in particular panics and jumps through the window causing it to shatter as she runs. Mrs. Keys grumbles. \"Of all the times for a fire drill!\" she yells. \"Everybody out!\" Everyone begins to leave the classroom, with Pearl pausing to pick up the piece of glass that you're stuck to. She gives a grumble. \"Saved by the bell.\" She mutters before following the rest of her classmates. Pearl places you into her backpack, not even bothering to remove the tape as she leaves the building. It isn't long before all of the students in all of Nightmare High have evacuated and the teachers are in the front of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree in particular run forward. One of them is a large Ziz who resembled an anthropomorphic ostrich but with wings that looked like they were made for flight. Another was a fat mummy woman who looked like an undead Elisa Maza with her dark skin, raven hair and red jacket. The third was a werewolf who resembled an anthropomorphic collie with paint staining her fur. The Ziz is squawking as her knees knock. \"I didn't know there was a fire drill scheduled for today.\" \"There wasn't, Aziza,\" says the mummy woman. \"There was mustard all over the fire alarm. I'd say somebody is pulling a rather distasteful prank.\" The wolf woman gives a growl. \"I was just in the middle of a painting class,\" she says. \"I had to send my students out with their artwork half-finished. When I get my claws on whoever pulled the fire alarm, I swear...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Pearl has nobody looking at her, she takes out her cell phone and calls her mother. \"Hi, Mom. I know I should be in class right now, but some jerk pulled the fire alarm. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm glad they did. I almost carved up Wade like a turkey.\" Fortuna yells out some nasty swears from the other line. She clearly was pissed you followed Pearl to school. \"Mom,\" says Pearl. \"I think you've been hanging around Auntie D too much. You're starting to swear like her. Okay. I got it. Don't worry. The punk's tied up. Come over at lunch and I'll give him back to you.\" You just mumble from inside Pearl's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch time, Pearl hands you to her mother who painfully rips the duct tape off your mouth. \"Ow!\" you yell. \"Watch it, blondie.\" Fortuna makes her eyes glow red before flying into the air. As Fortuna flies away, you look down and see a police car being approached by the sheriff who is apparently a morbidly obese white-furred Nemean lioness wearing a green sheriff's outfit. She was parked outside the school and escorting inside a teenaged cyclops who had apparently pulled the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're flying, Fortuna gives a glare at you. \"It's lucky for you that you didn't get Pearl suspended or expelled.\" \"Like your brat was going to make it to college anyway.\" Fortuna squeezes you and makes you gag as she growls. \"You're pushing your luck. I'm beginning to think that having you help the sheriff is a terrible idea.\" Fortuna then gives an evil smirk. \"Which is perfectly okay with me.\" You give a look of skepticism at Fortuna. \"What are you talking about?\" you ask her. Fortuna gives a laugh. \"I already talked with Destiny and she's agreed on a much more fitting punishment for you. I'm sending you to my sister-in-law, Catherine, in Cryptfork.\" You let out a scoff. \"So?\" Fortuna gives a smirk. \"Well,\" she says. \"Catherine owns a gym that doubles as an apartment building and all of the women have a certain condition. Catherine runs a tight ship and she has an unusual kind of house rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a gulp as Fortuna arrives back home and places you inside a box that she wraps up in postage and puts a stamp on. The gargoyle giantess then walks up towards the post office and hands you towards a gargoyle dressed in a postal outfit. You gripe from inside the package. This was going to be another gargoyle you'd be stuck with. You only hope she isn't anything like Destiny or Fortuna.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It isn\u2019t long before you arrive in Cryptfork. You look out of one of the airholes that Fortuna poked in with her claws and see that they apparently had to take a boat all the way to Cryptfork. From the looks of it, Cryptfork was on an island that was near Dreadberry. You can\u2019t tell the species of the postal worker delivery you but from the looks of it, they\u2019re bringing you to a strange looking apartment building that had a gym at the bottom floor, given the exercise equipment. Some of it looked expensive and there was one weight that looked like it weighed as much as the meteor that hit Russia. You look up at the sign on the top of the building. It read \u201cRolling Boulder Gym and Apartment\u201d. Then you read another sign under it that reads \u201cAmazons Only\u201d. The mail carrier takes you into the building and takes the package you\u2019re trapped inside into a room full of mail slots before placing you inside one of them. You grumble and cross your arms as you wonder how you\u2019re going to escape Fortuna\u2019s sister-in-law. So far you\u2019ve gone from one gargoyle warden to the next and then to some other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d you think. \u201cFortuna said that all the girls in this apartment building have some kind of weird condition. You\u2019re curious as to what exactly Fortuna met and decide to look out and wait until one of the female tenant came and it isn\u2019t long before you hear loud stomping. You look out in surprise to see that walking into the mail room to check her mail box was a female werewolf who had bright purple fur but with red and yellow striped arms and long blue hair. She was dressed in a gymnastics outfit. But what really caught your attention was that this wolf woman had an enormous butt that looked like it belonged to a woman three times her weight. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d you ask. \u201cThat wolf woman\u2019s butt is big enough to eclipse the moon.\u201d As the werewolf giantess was walking away from her mailbox, you look in surprise because she has a belly bag with what appears to be a male human and a muscular tan-skinned one at that, riding inside of it. \u201cHuh?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the werewolf woman leaves, she passes by a harpy lady with the wings and legs of a scarlet macaw, tanned skin and an outfit that looked like the kind somebody from Brazil would wear. Her butt was just as big as the wolf lady\u2019s and they bounced against each others as they passed and grunted. \u201cPlease watch where you\u2019re going, Luana.\u201d Says the harpy girl in a Brazilian accent. \u201cSorry.\u201d Mutters the wolf girl as she walks away. You look at the harpy woman and shutter. \u201cI\u2019d hate to be an egg under that big harpy.\u201d You then look in surprise again because the harpy lady had another human on her shoulder, in the same position a parrot would be, ironically enough. Once the harpy got her mail, a third giantess walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis third giant lady was heading right towards the mailbox with you inside. You realize that this must be Catherine because from the looks of it, she was a gargoyle. This gargoyle girl was a yellow green-skinned gargoyle giantess with long light blue hair. She had a punk-like look with multiple facial piercings, including a pierced nose and a piercing under her chin. She wore yellow lipstick along with a tank top and a Hawaiian print sari. Her butt was even more enormous than the werewolf\u2019s or the harpy\u2019s, to the point it was two heads higher than her actual head. From the looks of her wings, she couldn\u2019t fly. She also had a male human and a very skinny albino-looking one, riding in her hair. \u201cLook at that, Magnus,\u201d says the gargoyle lady. \u201cThat must be the package Fortuna sent. Let\u2019s see the punk who\u2019s been giving my big brother and his wife so much grief in so little time.\u201d Magnus slid down to Catherine\u2019s ear before speaking. \u201cBetter take him back to the office, dear. We need to tell him about the house rules.\u201d Catherine turns her head and gives Magnus a large kiss before walking her huge frame into an office with a door that looked specially designed for her large behind right before plunking herself down in a chair that looked way too small for her right before she held out one of her clawed fingers to cut open the box and reveal you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Wade.\u201d She says. You give a scoff. \u201cAnd you must be that sister-in-law that goat-horned moron told me about. I didn\u2019t expect you to have two wrecking balls at the body of your back, fatty. What\u2019s with all the girls in this building.\u201d Magnus slides down his wife\u2019s hair before speaking. \u201cAll women in this building, including my wife, have Glutos Syndrome. It\u2019s a rare disorder that only affects female monsters and it\u2019s incurable.\u201d \u201cFortunately,\u201d says Catherine. \u201cThis apartment doubles as a gym and all the women here take working out very seriously. I for example am as graceful as a ballerina.\u201d You give a scoff. \u201cYeah,\u201d you say. \u201cA hippo ballerina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine scratches her chin before continuing. \u201cFortunately for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not like that sister-in-law of mine or that blue moron she\u2019s related to. I don\u2019t have a bad temper. However.\u201d Catherine gives a laugh before you look up in confusion. \u201cHowever, what? Continent thighs.\u201d Catherine picks her fangs with a claw and then gives you her answer. \u201cMen are not allowed in this building. House rules.\u201d You then look in more confusion than ever. Besides Magnus, you saw several human men hanging around the pear-shaped residents of this building. \u201cThen what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Magnus lets out a chuckle. \u201cHuman men are the exception and even then there\u2019s one condition.\u201d You look up and glare at Catherine as she strokes her husband\u2019s head with one of her claws as she gives an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order to stay here,\u201d says the titanic gargoyle. \u201cYou have to marry one of the girls who live here.\u201d You give a look of horror and clutch your chest. \u201cWhat?!\u201d you yell. Catherine lifts her husband up and they exchange in a kiss before speaking. \u201cOh,\u201d says Catherine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not so cruel as to rush it. There will be a 90 day courting period between you and the ladies in this apartment building. You have to pick one of them within that time period to marry.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding me!? I hate monsters! What makes you think that I\u2019ll agree to this.\u201d Catherine gives a large fanged smile and giggles. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. But it\u2019s the house rules. If you\u2019re not married to one of the tenants in 90 days, well, let\u2019s just say you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d You\u2019re fuming mad. This woman was even worse than Destiny. At least Destiny never tried to put you through a shotgun wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine then snaps her fingers to get Magnus\u2019s attention. \u201cMagnus,\u201d she says. \u201cBe a dear and get me the ledger for all the tenants. Remind me which ones are still single.\u201d \u201cYes, dear.\u201d Magnus climbs his wife\u2019s enormous rear to reach a shelf with a ledger of some kind before pushing it down into Katherine\u2019s hand. The pear-shaped gargoyle landlady flips through the book and then gives a smirk as she looks at you. \u201cLucky for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI know the perfect girl to start with.\u201d You\u2019re now suddenly very afraid. Exactly who is the first girl that creep tries to set you up with?</span></div></div>",

Fortuna has a sour look on her face. \"Couldn't this wait until after seven o'clock? At least I could've had a crappy breakfast to make up for that awful dinner last night.\" \"You were unbelievably nasty at dinner last night. That was my grandmother's recipe. Not to mention I had to hold Pearl back twice before she killed you. I'm beginning to think Destiny only sent you here to get revenge on me for losing that scarf I borrowed from her years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fortuna was speaking, you move your lips to mock her, only stopping when her eyes glow red. She then holds her forehead as she lets out a sigh. \"The sooner I get you to Maggie the better for my sanity.\" Fortuna soon walks up to the sheriff's office and finds a pair of monster girls working on the sign on top. The monster holding up the ladder was a hunch-backed frost giantess with light blonde hair in a Viking ponytail while the monster painting the sign was a basilisk resembling a cross between Godzilla and a Giratina given her black and red striped underbelly and spiked back. \"Jolene,\" says the frost giantess in a somber voice. \"Didn't Maggie tell you not to paint the sign in gold letters. She said it was too gaudy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basilisk girl smiles down and holds up a bucket of paint. \"She didn't say not to paint it in <i>silver</i>. Come on Irma, this will get people's attention and show them we mean business.\" \"Pa-the-tic.\" Says Irma the frost giantess in response. That's when Fortuna rolls her eyes and watches as Jolene spills the paint on Irma right in the eyes. Irma yells and then covers her eyes before letting go of the ladder. The ladder falls and Jolene screams before she falls down on Irma. You let out a chuckle. \"Idiot monsters.\" You say under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deputies.\" Says Fortuna. Both deputy monsters get up and notice Fortuna. \"Hi Fortuna,\" says Jolene. \"New pet?\" \"Not exactly,\" says Fortuna. \"Is Maggie in?\" Irma points inside and Fortuna walks inside. \"Sheriff Reever.\" Says Fortuna. The sheriff walks out and you look up to see that she's an obese white furred Nemean lioness with green eyes and blonde hair that looked similar to mane. \"Hi Fortuna,\" says Maggie. \"What can I do you for today?\" You look up in fear and begin to think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" you think. \"A lioness. I'm not here to catch Specter. I'm here to be lunch for some bloated pussycat.\" Maggie looks down and is surprised to see you. \"Do I even want to know?\" asks Maggie. \"You remember my older sister Destiny do you Maggie?\" Before Maggie could answer, Jolene overhears and lets out a laugh. \"I know her. That grumpy frumpy blueberry stick in the mud who looks like Demona. How's the cotton candy headed grouch doing Fortuna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolene continues to laugh before she gags as Irma pours paint in her mouth. Fortuna shakes her head. \"This is Wade Wilson,\" says Fortuna. \"The most obnoxious prisoner under her watch.\" Maggie shakes her head. \"I don't approve of humans sharing prisons with monsters. So, what's he doing here.\" \"Helping you catch Specter.\" Says Fortuna as she puts your cage on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie at first seems offended. \"Look,\" she says. \"I know we haven't had much luck in catching Specter, but to send a crook to catch a crook?\" \"You can send him back in thirty days if it comes up fruitless. I'll explain the situation to Mayor Yorkshire. See you at dinner Wade, and you better like it this time.\" Fortuna walks out and you stick out her tongue at her. After all she <i>was</i> Destiny's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie takes a closer look at you. \"Do you mind Sheriff Furball?\" you ask rudely. \"Whoa,\" says the lioness. \"That's a bad attitude.\" \"Get used to it pussycat, and don't even try to eat me, I'll bet right now your ass is big enough to smash Jupiter.\" Maggie lets out a growl and shows you her claws. \"For your information,\" she says. \"I haven't eaten a human since I was a teenager and I don't appreciate cracks at my weight unless they're coming from my husband.\" \"Is he blind?\" you ask smugly. Maggie lets out a roar that rattles your cage before she sits at her desk. \"You and me aren't going to get along well are we?\" she asks. You just stick out your tongue at the Nemean lioness sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a sigh. \"Worse than the marshal.\" She complains to herself.</span></div></div>",

In walked in a weretiger woman who was just as tall and obese as Maggie. She had bright blue fur with purple stripes and navy hair. The blue tigress was wearing a black cowgirl's hat with a blue rose on the side and vest with daisy dukes and a bandana around her neck. She looked like something out of a western picture and was wearing a silver badge that was similar to Maggie's, except that it read \"Marshal\" instead of \"Sheriff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a slight growl. \"Speak of the devil.\" The blue tigress walks in and lets out a slight arrogant sounding purr. \"Howdy Maggie,\" she says in a western accent. \"Finally catch that sidewinder, Specter?\" \"Shut up Prussia,\" says Maggie. \"I've already got one pest to deal with.\" Prussia waddles up to Maggie's desk and then notices you. She licks her lips and you step back. \"Are you going to eat that human?\" she asks. Maggie lets out a growl as if Prussia offended her. \"For your information, he is a criminal sent from Under Gloom to help us catch Specter. Wade, this is Marshal Prussia Kipling.\" As Prussia lowers her head and you look into her colossal eyes, you wonder why Dreadberry would need a sheriff <i>and</i> a marshal. You knew from experience one was just as bad as the other, so you walk up and spit in the side of Prussia's eye. Prussia roars and is about to slam down on you but Maggie stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me,\" says Maggie. \"I'm tempted to do that myself.\" You stick out your tongue. Prussia calms down slightly and then you see the blue tigress shaking her large tail and monstrous ass as she stares at Maggie. \"You know Maggie,\" she says. \"Why must we always be at each other's throats? You're a lioness, I'm a tiger. We should be friends. Maybe even more.\" Prussia lets out a purr and Maggie rolls her eyes. You have never been against girl on girl, but between giant monsters, that's sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia leans on Maggie's desk and looks her eye to eye. \"Perhaps you'd be interested in joining me for dinner Friday night? I know a place that serves the best barbecued humans. They're delicious.\" Maggie actually shutters at such a thought. \"Prussia,\" the Nemean lioness says. \"Do me a favor and watch Wade for me. I've got to go use...\" \"The litter box?\" you ask smugly. Maggie roars angrily at you before stomping off. \"Oh,\" she says to herself. \"You will pay for this Fortuna. You will pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maggie is walking away, Prussia purrs and stares at the lioness's massive ass. \"You know,\" says Prussia. \"Maggie's mama is a splinter cat. They're known for their high behinds, if you know what I mean. Rowr. Some day that woman is gonna be mine.\" You let out a scoff. \"Don't bet on it Lady Garfield,\" you say. \"That hairball said she had a husband.\" Prussia growls and lowers her head to your level. \"I've seen that wedding ring shrimp,\" she says. \"But I don't buy it. Every time I ask Maggie about that so called husband of hers, she changes the subject. It's as if she's hiding something from me. I know she has a daughter, but I've never seen the father. I wonder what that implies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly don't care. You just hope Specter shows up so you can get the heck out of here. Suddenly, you grunt because you feel something digging into your back. You turn to see that Prussia is lifting you by the shirt with her claws. She lifts you in front of her face before she smiles fiendishly at you. \"What are you doing you damn tiger!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia licks her lips and then shows you her fangs. \"Oh, nothing, just having a little snack.\" \"You imbecile! I'm supposed to be helping your fatass and that fatass sheriff!?\" Prussia lets out a scoff. \"Sending a criminal to catch a criminal? That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard.

I'll bet the sidewinder only lied so he could get out of Under Gloom.\" You flip off that were tiger for guessing the truth. \"Up yours you bloated blue hillbilly!\" \"See?\" asks Prussia. \"I oughta wash the rascal's mouth out with soup before I chomp him. But if you insist, who am I to argue. See you later.\" Prussia taps Maggie's ass and Maggie grunts before she watches the marshal walk away. Prussia twerks slightly and blows a kiss at Maggie which Maggie proceeds to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're expecting a thank you, don't hold your breath, Madame Catnip.\" Maggie just gives a glare. \"You know,\" she says. \"It wouldn't kill you to be nice.\" \"Nice to monsters?\" you ask. \"That's a laugh. As Maggie is growling at you, Irma and Jolene are looking in. \"Geez,\" says Irma. \"And I thought Meagan had a rotten attitude. This guy doesn't know when to shut it.\" Jolene nods her head. \"He's lucky the boss doesn't eat humans and that they give me heartburn.\" \"Ugh,\" groans Irma. \"No thanks. I don't like to eat anything that looks that much like my species and that guy would probably taste like sour candy that has been left out in the sun too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lays you back on her desk and then stares at you. \"Look, you don't like monsters and I don't like you. So the sooner Specter shows up, we can bust him and then we never have to see each other again.\" \"Fine with me, Furball.\" Maggie hisses at you and Jolene and Irma step out of the room. \"I think I left the teapot on.\" says Irma obviously fearing her boss's anger. \"Uh,\" says Jolene. \"Yeah. I think I left her teapot on as well.\" You just roll your eyes. As much as you hated it, you only have 30 days to find Specter or you'll be sent back to Under Gloom. You really hope there's a Specter attack soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It isn't long until Maggie's shift is over and unfortunately, the phone didn't ring at all. Not that you should be surprised. In a town as small as Dreadberry, it's not as if there's a major crime wave. You get so mad you kick the phone. \"Come on you stupid piece of junk!\" you yell. You grunt in pain just as Maggie shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like Specter is laying low for now. You have 29 days left to go, Mr. Wilson.\" You stick out your tongue at Maggie and she gives a glare. \"I'll get you for this Fortuna,\" she says under her breath. \"I'll get you.\" Speaking of Fortuna, you wonder where that bratty sister of your mortal enemy was? \"Where is Fortuna?\" you ask. \"Not that I look forward to seeing her or her pint-sized brat.\" Maggie crosses her arms. \"I think you should spend the night at my place,\" the lioness giantess says. \"Something tells me I should keep an eye on you.\" \"You're just as bad as Destiny,\" you say. \"And what's with the name? Maggie isn't the type of name I'd expect for a ginormous cat freak.\" Maggie lets out a roar that stuns you and causes Jolene and Irma outside to freeze in fear like statues. \"Thank Odin I'm made of ice.\" Says Irma. Maggie seizes you and then stomps out of the station before locking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie makes her way towards a giant car that looks like a silver colored hybrid of a Buick and a monster truck. It even has teeth on the grill Maggie lays you on the dashboard before she starts to drive away. You feel humiliated. You feel like one of those Hula Girls dudes put in their cars. \"So where are we headed?\" you ask. \"Well,\" says Maggie. \"I have to pick up my husband and daughter. Sapphire is already with Neil at work.\" You take it Neil was the idiot who married the skyscraper sized feline beach ball. Maggie pulls over to a salon that reads \"Primordial Earth\". \"What the hell is this dump?\" you ask. \"This is where my husband works,\" says Maggie. \"He does various odd jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scoff. \"You're kidding me?! What kind of fruit loop works in a place like this? It's emasculating.\" Maggie just glares daggers at you again. Out of the salon waving at Maggie is a blue lioness except this one looks like a teenager. She had the same face and body shape as Maggie but strange eyes. Also, instead of fur, she had scales like a fish and gills on her neck. She was a mer-lion. \"Hi Mom,\" says the blue lioness. \"How was work?\" Maggie smiles at her daughter but then frowns. \"I got a new partner and he isn't exactly working out.\" \"A new deputy?\" asks Sapphire. \"Not exactly. Now, where is your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look, curious as to what kind of monster would result in a mer-lion, probably a merman or some other aquatic monster. But to your surprise, Sapphire reaches into her purse and you see in her hand was an older looking human man, you'd say in his forties, with graying hair and a wrinkled face. He waved up to Maggie. \"Hi Honey.\" He says. You couldn't believe it. Maggie's husband was a <i>human</i>?! A human monster marriage!? That was wrong on so many levels. Wait?! That meant that Sapphire was... Oh, how you want to vomit right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reavers get in the car and Sapphire takes her seat next to her mother before placing Neil on the dashboard. Neil looks at you and seems to frown. \"So you're this Wade Wilson I've heard about,\" he says. \"I hope you haven't been causing any trouble for my wife.\" \"Shut it, you monster loving traitor,\" you say. \"What could you possibly see in a mouse munching, mountain-sized pile of tapioca pudding?\" Neil gives a look of shock and then crosses his arms as Maggie drives down the road. \"Not to mention that fish stick? How do you know your so-called wife is even loyal to you, Old Man?\" Maggie and Neil both take offense to that. \"F.Y.I.,\" says Neil. \"Maggie is a Nemean lion, the direct descendant of the original Nemean lion, which might I add, was a child of Echidna. Her genes don't work the way humans do. Before Sapphire was born, I didn't know what I was going to get. She could've been a sphinx for all I knew.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"Either way, she's an abomination.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire gasps and seems genuinely hurt at that remark. Neil on the other hand, grits his teeth and then decks you right into the car window, causing it to crack, leaving a Wade-shaped imprint in the glass. \"You take it back!\" yells Neil angrily. \"You're calling my baby an abomination? You know, it's racists like you that are why some monsters hate humans. Ordinary racism is bad enough. You bite your tongue around my family, or being eaten will be the least of your concerns you little punk!\" Maggie is at the moment both angry at you for insulting her daughter and annoyed for the damage done to her window. \"You're paying for that.\" She says. \"Your husband was the one who did it!\" you yell. \"Make <i>him</i> pay for it! I was just stating a fact.\" \"Geez,\" says Sapphire. \"And I used to wonder why Pearl's auntie was such a crank.\" So Sapphire was friends with that hot tempered runt. Big, fat hairy deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the Reavers take you back to their home. It looked like something right out of a sitcom in a Texas neighborhood out in the boonies. Once inside, Maggie puts you and Neil on the kitchen table before she opens the refrigerator, taking out what looks like a bag of giant clams. \"Having a clam bake?\" you ask. \"We've been planning this for weeks,\" says Neil. \"I live with two giant cat girls. You could probably tell that my two favorite girls love their seafood.\" \"Well it beats the half-digested poison Destiny forces us to keep down back in Under Gloom.\" Sapphire sets the table as Maggie takes the clams out back. To your surprise there are only three plates. You know they weren't expecting you, but they could've at least had the decency to have a plate ready for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where's my plate?\" \"Oh,\" says Sapphire. \"You'll be sharing my plate. All our human sized dishes are in the washer.\" \"And get your monster germs in my mouth?\" you ask. \"I don't think so?\" \"You know,\" says Neil. \"You are <i>really</i> close to a kick in the ass right now. Maggie and I don't have problems eating off the same plate.\" \"That's because you probably already caught some nasty disease from sl...\" Before you can finish your sentence, you wince in pain and fall on your knees because Neil literally just kicked your ass. Geez, the guy's pretty strong for a geezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't say anything nice,\" says Sapphire. \"Keep your trap shut. But in your case, that would make you mute.\" You hold up your fist and rub your backside. \"You're as bad as that stupid Demona back in Under Gloom.\" Neil raises an eyebrow before you realize who you're talking about. \"Oh, you mean Destiny. I'll admit she does look like Demona, but I don't say anything about it.\" \"And why not? That woman is biggest example of evil incarnate on this planet.\" Neil lets out a scoff. \"You obviously haven't met Cattleya.\" \"I heard that Neil!\" yells Maggie from the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realize something. If Maggie and Neil shared a plate and there were three plates, they were expecting company that wasn't you. Suddenly the doorbell rings. \"I'll get it.\" Says Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly who is at the door (See Monster Boondocks for details)</span></div></div>",

She was a green manticore with purple hair. Surprisingly, unlike Belladonna, this manticore had a pair of giant leather wings, though you highly doubted someone as obese as her could get off the ground. She had a sad looking expression on her face and she appeared to be wearing a tight white A-shirt and a pair of black shorts. Neil let out a groan as the manticore woman walked in but she seemed friendly with Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire,\" says the manticore woman as she hugs the teenage mer-lion. \"I haven't seen you in weeks.\" Sapphire grunts before freeing herself of the manticore's grip. \"I'm sorry, Aunt Fiona. I've been busy with homework lately. Ms. Khamen is out sick and the sub doesn't know what she's doing.\" Fiona and Sapphire seemed friendly with each other, but somehow both Sapphire and Neil were looking at Fiona with unease. Of course, you looked at her with pure disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great! Another friggin' manticore?! I got enough of that from that bitch, Belladonna.\" Fiona then notices Neil and smiles. \"Hi, Neil.\" She says with a creepy stare as she waves at Neil. \"Wade,\" says Neil. \"Meet my sister-in-law, Fiona.\" Fiona walks forward and smiles as she stares down at Neil. \"What are you looking at, you 300-toothed freak.\" Fiona finally notices you and seems surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she says. \"I didn't know, you had.... other company.\" Fiona then stares at you slightly. \"What the hell is your problem?\" you ask. At that moment, Maggie walks back into the room. \"Good news,\" she said. \"The clams will be ready in five minutes. Oh, hello, Fiona. How's life been treating you?\" Fiona just lets out a sigh. \"It's going.\" she says in a somber tune. As she slumps you can see her obese green stomach about to hit the floor. \"What's with the sad sack?\" you ask Neil. \"I see her staring at you. Your sister in law is planning to eat you.\" Neil let out a scoff. \"It isn't that kind of hunger, smart guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize something, Fiona had one eye focused on Neil and another eye focused on Maggie's wedding ring. From the looks of it, her scorpion tail was twitching nervously on the ground and was even scratching the dining room table's leg. You shudder. \"You incestuous freak!\" you say. Fiona gasps and Maggie and Sapphire give reactions of horror. \"Are you talking about me?\" \"Who else would I be talking about, scorpion butt!? You're looking at this digesting weirdo the same way that bitch Bebe looks at me back in Under Gloom. Hello, he's your brother-in-law for damn sake, which should give you a clue about his questionable taste in women.\" Fiona begins to frown even moreso than before and from the looks of it, neither Maggie nor Neil appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show some sensitivity,\" says Neil. \"Fiona behaves the way she does because she's divorced. Her asshole husband openly cheated on her and then the bastard abandoned her on Valentine's Day.\"  \"Neil!\" yells Maggie. \"Not in front of Sapphire!\" \"Shut up, mouse muncher!\" you yell up. \"If you ask me, the guy grew a brain.\" Fiona gasped again and it looked like her eyes were watering but you weren't done insulting her. \"In fact, anyone who would even consider marrying a fat waste of life with snaggleteeth and a poisonous tail who looks like a Thundercat on a 20 year junk food and drug binge is a giant sucker! Your face is so ugly, it would turn a gorgon to stone and you smell so bad it would make a skunk ape lose their lunch! Any sane man would rather be dead than spend the rest of their life looking at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, Fiona breaks down crying and you and Neil have to get back to dodge tears the size of meteors as Sapphire runs to comfort her aunt. \"What is wrong with you!?\" yells Sapphire. \"Nothing is wrong with me, you insult to nature,\" you say. \"You're as much of an abomination as that million ton pile of expired pudding.\" Neil is about to deck you but then suddenly you hear a loud roar and then Maggie snatches you up and drags you into the other room just as Neil hops into her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the manners of a cow!\" yells Maggie. \"And you smell like one,\" you say. \"So we're even.\" You then scream in pain because Maggie squeezes you in her hand. \"Kid,\" says Neil. \"You just don't know when to quit. What you said to Fiona back there was just plain nasty.\" \"That's right, Dear,\" says Maggie. \"I've put up with this little creep back at the office and even saved his ungrateful ass from Prussia. He was still rude to me. But what this... this... <i>this</i> waste of life said to my emotionally fragile sister, that was the straw that broke the yppotryll's back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Maaggie the finger and the lioness giantess growls before holding you up to her face. \"You listen here, Wilson, you are going to make up for this.\" \"And how will I do that, Lady Garfield.\" Maggie roars and holds you in front of her sharp teeth. \"You are going to ask Fiona out on a date for tomorrow night. Maybe with a new man in her life she won't be so depressed.\" \"I'd rather be dead.\" \"Funny you should mention that,\" says Maggie. \"Because if you don't ask Fiona out, I'll eat you right here on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil is actually shocked that his wife would consider eating you. After all, he and you were the same species. \"Maggie,\" you say. \"You're not serious are you?\" \"I'll admit,\" says Maggie to you. \"I haven't eaten a human in 23 years and I swore off them forever when I married Neil, but you are <b>really</b> tempting me to make one exception in my life. So what's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you have to say to this development?</span></div></div>",

Down the hatch.\" Neil actually seems intimidated that his wife would consider eating you. You must've really pissed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie walks you into the next room where Fiona was still crying meteors as Sapphire was desperately trying to comfort the manticore woman. \"Come on,\" says Sapphire. \"Aunt Fiona. Don't listen to him.\" \"But he's right,\" moans Fiona. \"Look at me. I could've had any man I wanted back in high school but I let my body go straight to hell after the divorce. A man would have to be crazy to want me now.\" You start to have second thoughts about it. \"What a crybaby,\" you thought. \"No wonder Fang dumped her.\" Then you feel a poke and then hear Maggie growl. \"Fine,\" you say. \"Fiona, was it.\" Fiona pulls her tear soaked face out of her chest and turns to face you as Sapphire herself starts to growl at you. \"Sapphire,\" says Maggie. \"No. Dining room. Now.\" Sapphire obeys her mother and walks to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" asks Fiona through her tears. You turn and see Maggie glaring down at you and Neil waving his finger at you before you let out a sigh. \"Fiona,\" you say. \"Will you... ugh... go out with me, tomorrow night.\" Almost immediately, Fiona changes from depressed to happy and lets out a squeal before grabbing you and rubbing you against her face, all while giggling like a schoolgirl and crying tears of joy. You let out a groan as Maggie laughs at your expense. \"Uh, Maggie,\" says Neil. \"Are you sure that this is a good idea.\" \"Please,\" scoffs Maggie. \"It wouldn't be the first time Fiona went out with an oxygen wasting jerkwad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you're eating clams and fries with the Reavers. Maggie and Neil are sharing the same plate while Fiona is laughing and force feeding you fries as you groan. Damned stalker. She was worse than Bebe. Sapphire just rolls her eyes and is focused on her food. \"What are you looking at?\" you ask Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Fiona is blowing you a kiss as she leaves and shaking her tail. \"I look forward to tomorrow Wade-ums.\" she says. You mentally gag. \"I was definitely better off in jail.\" You mumble. Maggie calls Fortuna to tell her that you're staying with her family that night. You find yourself staying in a cage in Sapphire's bedroom. \"I sense a lack of trust.\" You say. \"It's your own fault for being such a raging A-hole,\" says Sapphire. \"It wouldn't kill you to be nice.\" \"Nice to monsters,\" you say. \"Phooey. The only reason I'm even agreeing to go on a date with your stupid aunt is because your asshole mom was going to eat me.\" Sapphire scoffs as she puts on her pajamas and tosses her shirt over your cage. \"You'd give her keriorrhea with your attitude.\" Sapphire then sits in bed as she reads a comic book blown to monster size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read comic books?\" you ask. \"What a geek. I'll bet you're still a virgin. You probably never even kissed a guy. And your dad doesn't count, so don't give me any of that bull...\" Sapphire responds by throwing a cream puff at your cage and hitting you in the face. With that, she puts her comic book on her desk and turns out the light. \"I guess being a bitch fat bitchy cat runs in the family!\" you yell. But Sapphire has already fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're in bed when Sapphire is tasked with waking you up. \"Wade,\" she says. \"Mom wants you out of bed.\" \"How about you kiss my ass.\" \"Do not try my patience today Wade.\" Says Sapphire as she shows you her claws. \"Alright,\" you say. \"I'm up.

It didn't help that Destiny called the office and told you the clock was ticking. 28 days left and you can trade hillbilly hell back for Under Gloom. And then like that Maggie's shift was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wonderful,\" you say sarcastically. \"Hey, Specter! Come out so I can get out of freakin' jail already!\" Maggie shakes her head as she hears you as she's washing her hands in the bathroom. \"Whatever,\" you groan. \"Hey, Nala, hurry up in there so I can end this crappy day already.\" \"Oh,\" says Maggie. \"The day isn't over yet, Wade. Remember, you have a date.\" That's when you remembered. That Nemean lioness press ganged you into agreeing to a date with her manticore sister.

Fiona was no hot date; she was Belladonna plus 500 or so hamburgers, green skin, wings and bad hygiene. Her lousy sister had to threaten to eat you to get you on a date with her. You'd rather take your chances with the Creeper on the first floor in Under Gloom. But it couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was driving you down the street in what looked like the west end of Dreadberry and you look out and see what you assume is Fiona's house. It was a crude-looking single floor house that looked like the paint was chipping away and the yard was an absolute mess with dead grass and weeds. \"What a dump.\" You groan. Maggie lets out a growl. \"Show some sensitivity. Since Fang left her, Fiona stopped bothering with appearances.\" \"Cry me a river.\" Maggie holds a claw dangerously close to your neck. \"Remember, Wade,\" the lioness says. \"Fiona better be smiling by the end of the date, or you'll see how indestructible a Nemean lion is on the inside.\" You give Maggie the finger but she ignores you and picks you up to walk you up to Fiona's doorstep where she rings the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up and you look in surprise to see Fiona was wearing a dark yellow cocktail dress and had her hair tied into a ponytail. She was smiling at you as she looked down, giving you a good few of her hundreds of razor sharp teeth. \"Hi Wade.\" She says. Maggie hands you to Fiona who is shaking her scorpion stinger as she looks down at you. \"Have a good night, Fiona,\" says Maggie. \"And Wade, she better.\" You would say something but Fiona shoves you between her large green boobs and squeezes tight before you can badmouth Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you let out a groan, Fiona's breasts shake as she enters her car.

The dullahan looked up at Fiona in surprise as he only opened one eye. \"Fiona?\" he asked. \"Haven't seen you around for a while.

One of them was a huge and fat werecheetah woman who looked like a furry Wonder Woman, another was a selkie resembling a giant gray seal with blonde hair and a monstrous girth who was wearing headphones and a fur coat and nothing else, another was a heavy set red furred minotaur girl in a jacket, skirt and beret who was smoking like a chimney and the last was a burned up skeleton woman with purple highlights in her bone and reddish brown hair that looked like a wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you set Wade up on a date with your sister, Maggie,\" said Fortuna as the gargoyle woman took a card. \"What am I going to tell my sister.\" \"I seriously doubt Big D will care if Wade is on a date, Fortuna.\" Said the wereseal woman. The skeleton woman shook her head. \"I still can't believe you threaten to eat a human,\" says the skeleton. \"My own sister-in-law.\" \"Relax Meryl,\" says Fortuna. \"With his rotten attitude, any monster that would eat him would get sick.\" The minotaur woman then snuffs out her cigarette before lighting another one. \"I still say that your sister has a self-destruct button built to destroy the prison and everyone in it in case of lockdown.\" Fortuna made her eyes glow red. \"Lily, shut up. Sometimes I think you just speak to hear yourself talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werecheetah woman secretly take out a queen of hearts from her thong before speaking to Maggie. \"Fiona's standards are really at an all time low.\" \"It beats you, Barbara Anne,\" says Maggie. \"You go out with a different monster every week and you're still not married.\" \"But at least I never dated a criminal. He's got what, now 28 days to find Specter before you send his ass back to Old Lady Demona.\" Fortuna breaks into laughter at her sister's nickname as Maggie gives an evil smirk. \"I have a better idea. Once the time limit is up, I'll give him an alternative to prison.\" Meryl actually looks in fear. \"I hate it when she gets like this.\" She mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the theater, Fiona returns to her car with a large soda and two coliseum-sized tubs of buttered popcorn with you between her breasts. \"No wonder she's such a blimp,\" you mumble. \"The woman eats like a garbage disposal. Then Fiona starts to shove some popcorn into your mouth as you grunt. \"Hey!\" you mutter through the large kernel. \"Hey! You may like being a fat lard, but I...\" You gag because your mouth is too full of popcorn as the movie is starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is now the reader's chance to make up their own movie.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a groan. \u201cSo what the mother of **** are we watching?\u201d Fiona giggles and squeezes her breasts together, nearly smothering you in the process as you groan. \u201cFinders Famous Five.\u201d \u201cSay what?\u201d you ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a detective film,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cThe fifth in the Finders Famous series. This chapter is called, the Aviary of Death after the main villain, a terrorist creature known only as the Bird who is responsible for a string of fatal bombings from the air. Nobody knows who the Bird is or what he\u2019s up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA detective movie?\u201d you wonder to yourself. \u201cJust great.\u201d You hated detectives. They already were natural enemies of criminals like you. From the looks of it, it was taking a while for the movie to actually start but Fiona was already starting to stuff her face with popcorn. No wonder that manticore was such a fatass. Of course, you couldn\u2019t say anything. Normally, you\u2019d have no qualms about hurting the big green crybaby\u2019s feelings, but you didn\u2019t want to provoke her sister into devouring you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, tell me, Fatas\u2026 er, Fiona, what is the Finders Famous franchise about.\u201d Fiona gives a smile. \u201cOh, they\u2019re the most popular movies to hit Dreadberry. The Finders Famous are a team of detectives called to deal with the most dangerous of criminals.\u201d You hated the sound of it already. But then you realized something. This was a detective movie and the Bird in the movie sounded a lot like the mysterious Specter, the very criminal you were released to help find. Perhaps if you studied this movie more carefully, you would be better able to figure out how to capture Specter and then you can say goodbye to Under Gloom and jerk-face Destiny. Of course, then you\u2019d have to escape from this over amorous fat cat, but you\u2019ll cross that bridge when you get there. Of course, that would mean knowing more about the movie you\u2019re watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Fiona,\u201d you say. \u201cBefore the movie starts, could you tell me more about the Finders Famous?\u201d Fiona reaches into a glove compartment to show you a poster for the movie. From the looks of it, the main villain, the one known only as \u201cthe Bird\u201d, was a shadowed out figure resembling a winged and possibly avian type monster given the shape of his face, but it didn\u2019t seem to tell exactly who was playing him. You study the poster closer and see that there were six monsters that appeared to be the protagonists with the two main protagonists appearing in the center. The one on the right appeared to be a fat and red furred werecheetah woman who appeared to have some form of pyrokinesis. Beside the cheetah giant was a dark blackish skinned and red eyes Flatwoods Monster with bright red eyes that made him look like a Kamen Rider. He also appeared to be wearing a white fedora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it that those two are the main protagonists?\u201d you ask. Fiona points to the Flatwoods monster giant. \u201cThe Flatwoods monster is called Zone. He\u2019s the heart of the group and the one who started the Finders Famous. He tries to be hard-boiled, but half-boiled is more like it. However, it\u2019s usually him who puts the mystery together, but acts like an all around clown. The cheetah to his side is named Brimstone. I actually know her actress. Deborah Sprinter. Her older sister is Maggie\u2019s best friend. As for her character, she\u2019s an amnesiac with pyrokinesis, but has no idea where it came from. Oh, and Brimstone is Zone\u2019s love interest as well as partner.\u201d \u201cFascinating.\u201d You say sarcastically. It seemed simple enough, but then you noticed four other characters that were apparent protagonists in this movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a completely blue skeleton with a sniper rifle who appeared to be riding a motorcycle of some sort. He also looked very muscular, as far as skeletons could go. Next to him was a silver Frankenstein that had mechanical arms and a face that looked like a hockey mask as well as a yellow skinned female werelizard with crescent moon shaped horns. She looked like a mystic based on her attire. However, the protagonist that really caught your attention seemed to be a green skinned male sylph, a wind-elemental. From the looks of it, he had a prison tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the green man.\u201d \u201cWildwind,\u201d said Fiona. \u201cHe was the main antagonist of the first movie. Part of this movie involves a chance of redemption. In this film, they need an ariel monster to help capture the Bird. So they sprung Wildwind and gives him the choice; he can either go through with his 666 year prison term or he can catch the film\u2019s latest dangerous criminal for a chance at freedom. However, Terra, the psychic werelizard member of the team doesn\u2019t entirely trust him, but that also acts to hide her own feelings for Wildwind.\u201d From the sound of it, Wildwind was like you. Perhaps this movie might be worth paying attention too. Just as long as the romance scenes don\u2019t get Fiona too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this movie gave you a good idea on how to catch Specter, than hopefully it will be worth being stuck with Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what you don\u2019t know is that Maggie has already decided her plan for you and Fiona and it catches her friends by surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d yells Barbara Anne. Maggie just gives an evil smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s kidding,\u201d says Penny with horror in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d Maggie nodded her head. \u201cIf Wade hasn\u2019t found Specter by the end of the month,\u2019 the obese lioness in the green leotard says. \u201cThen he\u2019ll have two choices; he can either go back and rot in Under Gloom or he can marry Fiona.\u201d Everyone is unsure about that plan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea, Mags,\u201d says Barbara Anne. \u201cYour last brother-in-law was a complete dick but at least Fang didn\u2019t have a criminal record.\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d says Fortuna. \u201cWade is extremely annoying. I\u2019ve only known him for two days and I already see why my sister is so grumpy all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie just pours herself a glass of milk before giving a glare that proved she was serious and was going to go through with her plan. \u201cI am not changing my mind, girls. This may be my only chance to find a husband for Fiona so she\u2019ll leave Neil alone. Wade may be a jerk but given the right incentive\u2026\u201d Meryl just bites on her finger bones. \u201cCattleya is not going to like this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You let out a scoff. \"It was unrealistic.\" \"Why? I liked the idea of Brimstone proposing to Zone at the end. I can't wait to see their wedding in the sixth movie.\" \"Not that, you bloated lion. I meant Wildwind joining the police force at the end. I mean, you're a crook who just got a get out of jail free card. If I were him, I'd be treating to Rio and it would be booze and cabana girls all the way. What a disgrace. Wait, why are we going back.\" Fiona lets out a laugh. \"For the double feature silly.\" You let out a moan. Now you had to sit through another movie with that fatass manticore. She was even worse than Bebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the next movie about?\" you ask. \"It's a surprise,\" says Fiona. \"But I'm sure you'll like.. oof! Sorry about that!\" Fiona had bumped into an enormous white weretiger who looked like she was as enormous and fat as she was. \"Fiona?\" asks the tiger woman looking at Fiona's cocktail dress. \"You look surprisingly well tonight.\" Fiona smiles at the tigress. Apparently, she and the tigress were friends. \"Hi, Ava. I'm just on a date.\" \"Ava?\" you ask yourself. \"How ironic.\" The tigress's eyes pop out of her head in absolute surprise. \"You? On a date? That's... that's actually great. So, you're back in the saddle. Now, where is the... lucky... man.\" You gasp because Fiona then reaches down to snatch you up. You try to climb down deeper into her cleavage but her clawed green fingers grab you and pull you up as you groan. \"Wade,\" says Fiona. \"Meet my best friend, Ava.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva bends over in surprise when she sees you. \"A human?\" she asks. \"Well at least he won't be able to run away.\" \"What did you say, Ava?\" asks Fiona. \"Oh,\" says Ava. \"Nothing.\" \"Hey, fat cat,\" you say. \"Don't you have costumed freaks to be chasing.\" Ava looks in surprise and then you flip her off. \"Yikes,\" says Ava. \"What a bad attitude. Where did you meet him?\" Fiona let out a giggle. \"Maggie introduced us.\" Ava raised an eye. \"What did you do to Maggie?\" she said below her breath. \"Uh, what business is he in?\" Fiona smiled and then explained. \"He was doing time in Under Gloom and he's in town helping Maggie catch Specter.\" Ava's jaw drops. \"YOU'RE DATING A CRIMINAL!? Old Mother Hubbard, Fiona! I knew you were desperate after that shipwreck of a marriage with Fang but I didn't think you were THIS desperate.\" Fiona just smiles. \"What are you worried about, Ava. Him catching Specter is community service to get out of prison. After that, he'll be the perfect man.\" Ava lets out a scoff. \"Sure,\" says the tiger giantess sarcastically. \"And I've just been crowned Queen of Atlantis.\" You don't think you like this Ava girl and stick your tongue out at her. Ava lets out a hiss. \"Enjoy the rest of your evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger giantess just walks away and mumbles to herself. \"What is Fiona thinking?\" she asks. Suddenly, Ava's cellphone begins to ring and Ava reaches into her cleavage to take out her phone. \"Hello? Oh, hi Maggie. Listen, Sheriff, I have a bone to pick with you. I know Fiona's a pain about Neil and all but what possessed you to saddle her with that creep? What?! Are you ****ing kidding!? I was already the best woman at her last wedding and I do not want to watch her marrying a jerk again. Besides, what if he catches Specter by then. I understand.\" Ava puts her phone away before she walks up to the snack bar. \"Three large popcorns,\" she says as she puts money on the counter. \"I'm going to need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona then plops down in her car and starts to force feed you popcorn again as the double feature comes up. How do you get yourself into these messes? To make matters worse, Ava was sitting in the car next to you and was gesturing she was watching you as she stuffed her face. That cat was sure paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the next movie comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'll leave the second movie up to the creativity and imagination of the writer)</span></div></div>",

The next movie is a new film called Catch the Ten. It\u2019s a Murder Mystery and the assailant seemingly chooses his or her targets based on connections with numbers from 10 to 1.\u201d You roll your eyes and stick out your tongue. \u201cIf I don\u2019t learn how to catch Specter from this alleged movie, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d Fiona just nudges you deeper into her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll like it,\u201d said the obese manticore. \u201cCorona Poe is in it?\u201d You raise an eyebrow.\u201d \u201cWho the **** is Corona Poe?\u201d \u201cCorona is a famous actress. One of the best in the monster world. In this movie, she plays the role of 1 of the 10 targets. Penny Fairheart. Here.\u201d\u2028\u2028Before the movie could even start, Fiona holds up miniature fliers used to advertise Catch the Ten. All 10 of the subjects were monsters both male and female designated by colors. Fiona gestures to the character played by this famous actress and you nearly have a heart attack because from the looks of it, Corona Poe is a giant and fat apple-figured minotaur with brown fur and long black hair with an udder as big as her head. She looked like a mix between a bison and a Native American woman and from the looks of it, she wore glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be kidding me!? Corona Poe is a minotaur!\u201d Fiona looks in confusion. \u201cIs that a problem, Wade-ums?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou\u2019re right it\u2019s a problem!\u201d you yell. \u201cI hate minotaurs! They\u2019re worse than gargoyles! 4 stomachs and no heart!\u201d You shiver in both hatred and fear and Fiona continues to stare at you in confusion. \u201cI am definitely not going to enjoy this movie unless that bloated cow\u2019s character is killed before it\u2019s over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva is watching from her own car and shakes her head before she stuffs her face with some popcorn. \u201cThat\u2019s REAL mature,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cWhat a rotten temper that guy has. He might actually be worse than Fang and that\u2019s saying something. Maggie must be insane to try and hook Fiona up with that little creep. Cattleya will have a freaking heart attack when she finds out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, the movie begins and in the opening scene there appears to be a white-skinned male gargoyle with a thick black beard and hair and two rows of spikes on each side of his head. From the looks of it, he was drunk and was staggering away from a bar and one of his wings was wounded as if he had been in a bar fight. From Fiona\u2019s fliers, he was one of the targets and was called Clyde White. Not that you think of it, all the targets had color motifs in their names. It\u2019s as if they were combining Clue with Detective Conan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the movie, Clyde looked up and saw the sun go down. He was about to spread his wings but held his wounded wing in pure pain. \u201cOh,\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight. ****ing centaurs. Serves me right for hitting the bar too early.\u201d The gargoyle walked down towards a bus stop to wait for the upcoming bus and then the camera revealed a view behind Clyde as he continued to hold his wing in pain. You couldn't see who was approaching because it was too early in the movie and there was no way to tell the species of monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, Clyde turned around and squinted as he was still drunk. \"Oh, it's you.\" He says unsurprisingly. \"What the **** are you doing he.... Ack!\" As you watch the movie, you see the gargoyle in the movie being strangled with what looked like a tether of some sort. You give a smirk. \"Well,\" you say as you watch the movie. \"At least they're starting the movie off right.\"</span></div></div>",

She was a feline based monster who looked like she was in the monster equivalent of her late fifties. Appearance wise, she resembled Pumyra from Thundercats except looked more like a lynx than a mountain lioness. She had brown hair with a white streaked ponytail and white furr around her hands that made them look like clawed gloves. For clothing she was wearing an orange brown leotard with a skirt. However, her most striking feature was her large ass that made Maggie's look almost non-existent by comparison. It was a wonder it was even able to fit through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Grandma,\" says Sapphire as she hugs the older cat woman. \"Glad you could make it.\" \"Sapphire,\" says the new giantess. \"Good to see you again. How's everything going in school?\" Neil lets out a moan. \"Cattleya,\" he mutters. \"Maggie just had to invite to dinner the one person good at making me lose my appetite. From the sound of it, Neil didn't sound too excited to have his mother-in-law join him for dinner. Not that you can blame him. Mother-in-laws were awful and this one was a literal monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Cattleya is through talking to her granddaughter, she turns to see you and Neil. She glares at Neil. \"I thought we were having clams for dinner,\" she says with a smirk. \"Not shrimp.\" \"Oh, ha-ha,\" says Neil sarcastically. \"You know Cattleya, how a cutie pie like Maggie came out of a crumb like you is beyond me.\" Cattleya simply hisses at Neil and Sapphire lets out a sigh. \"I better go help mom with the clams, Grandma.\" She says. Once her granddaughter leaves the room, Cattleya walks up to you and Neil. She gives a look of confusion when she sees you. \"Who's the other bug?\" she asks Neil. \"A friend of yours perhaps?\" \"Like I'd be friends with him, you old cow.\" Cattleya gives an angry meow as Neil actually smirks at that crack. Even if he doesn't like you, he apparently despises his mother-in-law more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a real smart alec eh?\" asks Cattleya. \"You got that right. And I thought Maggie was a blob. Your ass is as big as a planet!\" \"Of course I have a big ass,\" says Cattleya with a scoff. \"I'm a splinter cat.\" \"What the hell is a splinter cat?\" you ask. \"It's a nocturnal feline monster from the Pacific Northwest,\" says Neil. \"They bang their hard, not to mention empty, heads into trees in order to eat the bees and honey inside. It puts them in a nasty mood, while some are just naturally ill-tempered and horrible. They are described by Julie Andrews Edwards as high-behinded. I should know, given the amount of times one particular splinter cat sat on me, on purpose I might add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya just spits at Neil and forces him to move out of the way to avoid the saliva bullet. You've seen some bad in-laws before but these two hated each other. \"If you must know,\" says Neil. \"Wade is a criminal they sent to help Maggie catch Specter or they'd take him back to jail.\" \"Jail?\" asks Cattleya. \"That's funny. I always thought of you belonging in a zoo. Not jail.\" This splinter cat bitch was really getting on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we don't look like a Thundercat after a twenty-year long drinking binge.\" Cattleya then turns her attention to you. \"You heard me you alley cat,\" you say sounding smug. \"Are you sure that all those bees you've been eating having been stinging your ass from the inside.\" Neil actually starts laughing at your jokes at Cattleya's expense. \"And could you point that tuna breath somewhere else? Bees? More like dung beetles. Not to mention you've got more wrinkles on you than a shrunken head and your hair looks like a washed up coonskin hat.\" Neil can't stop laughing as Cattleya glares at you. However, to your surprise, the old hag smiles at you, showing you her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say. \"Why aren't you mad?\" Cattleya looms over you with a grin that makes you wonder if there's any Cheshire Cat in her blood. \"Don't get me wrong,\" says Cattleya. \"I despise Neil, but he's still my son-in-law. You on the other hand are of no value to society, and contrary to what Neil says, I actually like humans.\" Cattleya licks her lips, making it clear to you and Neil what she has in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Cattleya!\" yells Neil. \"Sure, he's a jerk but...\" Cattleya just takes a wine-glass and puts it over Neil to shut him up. \"Pipe down, Neil. If you weren't Maggie's husband, you'd be good with a glass of rose wine. Wade however...\" Before you can do anything, Cattleya snatches you up and holds you in front of her face. \"Go ahead and try it!\" you yell. \"I'll give you heartburn.\" Cattleya just lets out a laugh. \"I'd like to see you try.\" With that the splinter cat tosses you into her mouth as you grunt and assaults you with her tongue. It feels like sandpaper and actually seems like it could peel your skin off.  Cattleya purrs as she pushes you into her chubby cheeks. She's obviously enjoying your flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just great. You get a chance out of Under Gloom and you wind up being sucked on like a jolly rancher by the sheriff's mother. This was just terrific. Speaking of which, where was that stupid lioness? She saved you from the were tigress. She could at least rescue you from her mother's jaws as well.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure she'd like to take you apart and see what makes you tick.\" You just stick your tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until it's time for dinner. Maggie, Cattleya and Sapphire are digging into their clams while Neil is chewing on a fry from Maggie's plate. You're forced to share a plate with Sapphire and you cross your arms at having to eat with a teenage monster. As Sapphire takes a fry from her plate, you spit on it and cause her to drop it. \"Mom!\" \"I know,\" mutters Maggie in annoyance. \"Wade, do you have to be such a jerk all the time.\" \"Go eat your own vomit, Reaver. You're just trying to stuff me like a turkey.\" Cattleya bites into a clam before speaking. \"Not a bad idea,\" she said smugly. \"Oh, now I regret trying to eat you. Cats don't eat <i>garbage</i>.\" \"Hey, Pumyra,\" you say. \"How about I come over and kick your ass? Given the size of it, I'd have to be blind not to hit it.\" Neil lets out a laugh before Maggie glares at him and he shuts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" says Maggie. \"I'm starting to wonder why Destiny kept you alive this long. Your poor behavior should've gotten you executed by now.\" You walk over and then push on Maggie's glass of milk in order to spill it all onto Maggie's clams and fries. \"Ew.\" Groans Sapphire. \"Hey!\" yells Neil. \"You didn't have to do that!\" \"Oh,\" you say mockingly. \"Is your big fat kitty gonna cry over spilt milk?\" Maggie at this point, hisses at you and shows you her claws. Cattleya smirks at Maggie. \"Not one word, Mother.\" Grunts Maggie as she is quickly losing her temper and claws the table, scratching dents into it. \"I gotta give Destiny credit,\" said Neil. \"It can't be easy having to keep someone this obnoxious in check without going completely insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then grabs you as you grunt and then she proceeds to place you in a jar and screws it shut. \"You insulted my mother and daughter and ruined my dinner,\" says Maggie. \"And you were very rude to me even after I saved your sorry ass twice.\" You just stick out your tongue and flip Maggie off again. \"Oh, so you're still begin nasty! Fine! You can stay your ass in there for the rest of the night! I hope you get eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness giantess stomps back into the dining room as you stick out your tongue. \"At least I don't need three chairs just to sit down!\" You cross your arms before you see that Maggie left the jar on the windowsill and it was dangerously close to falling over. You smirk and then rub your hands together and then kick the side of the jar to move it before the cats could figure out what happened. You manage to knock the door out into the yard and grunt as you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees are sore as you stand up in the jar but the jar didn't break. \"Damn!\" you yell. \"Damn unbreakable plastic! I better split before Queen Fatass and her Creepshow family realize I'm gone.\" You roll the jar off of the lawn and into the street. You manage to roll to the other side of the road to the house directly across the street. You manage to roll right into the steps and grunt. You grumble to yourself and then you try to push the lid right off the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at that exact moment, the homeowner opens the door and steps over you in your jar. This homeowner is a werefox with red-orange fur, a yellow-orange underbelly and long flowing raven hair worn in a ponytail. She also had a beauty mark on her chin. She was enormously fat, almost as much as Maggie and was wearing a pair of skin-tight jean shorts and a yellow jacket but she wasn't wearing a shirt or bra. As the fox woman took out her trash, she appeared to stare at the Reaver's house and gave a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox giantess is about to walk back into her house but steps on your jar and slips and yells before falling flat on her back. She groans in pain before she stood up and felt her back in pain. The fox then notices you in the jar and then shows her teeth before giving a malicious grin. \"Well, well, well,\" says the enormous fox woman. \"What do we have here? A snack.\" You could not believe it. You got away from being eaten by 2 cats today, only for some stupid mutt to make a meal out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox giantess walks inside her home and then takes you into her kitchen before she stares down at you with the intent to devour you. \"Alright, little human,\" says the fox. \"Your choice. Either I swallow you whole, or it's right in the oven.\" \"Go to hell, Carmelita!\" you yell. \"My name is Meagan.\" Says the giantess in annoyance. You let out a laugh. \"A fox named Meagan. How disgustingly ironic.\" Meagan shows her teeth. \"Listen here, Fido! I already escaped that stupid cat from across the street and I can just as....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Meagan grabs her ears and yells into the air. \"Maggie Reaver!? That damned man-stealing cat!\" Meagan gives a growl and then smashes a plate. You look and see that she has a dartboard with photographs of Neil all over it and from the looks of it, she already stuck it with knives. \"Huh?\" you ask. Then you gasp because you see a photograph on the side with Meagan on the beach in a bikini and she's smiling with Neil on her knee. As for the real Meagan, she is staring at the dartboard. \"You little worm,\" she says. \"Are you happy with that fleabag!? Is she more woman than I ever was?! We could've taken it to the next level! You'll rule the day you married her instead of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Maggie wasn't the <i>first</i> monster Neil dated. \"What is wrong with that man?!\" you yell. You notice Meagan is still fuming mad. This gives you an idea. \"Hey, Meagan, was it?!\" Meagan growls at you. \"I just happen to have a month to help Lady Lardass down the street to catch Specter to avoid jail time. But I hate her and that idiot who married her as well.\" \"Yeah? You want a medal for it?\" \"Just here me out. I think we can help each other out. I want out of town so I can escape back to the human world and you want revenge on the monster loving piece of freak. Here's my deal. I help you get revenge on Neil and you help me escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeagan actually pauses to think it over and you cross your fingers and hope she accepts. Sure it would mean dooming Neil to that monster's appetite, but better him than you. You'll worry about the details of trapping him later. Now your fate is in Meagan's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she accept the deal?</span></div></div>",

I recommend you behave yourself Wade. There are children present and twelve camp counselors who know how to deal with pests like you. If I hear any trouble, it's back to jail with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the good news was that you could get out of this crappy prison. But now, you'd be spending the summer babysitting giant monster brats. The next day at the camp, the head counselor had gathered the staff to anticipate your arrival. There were nine other counselors, all women, mostly on the heavy side. First was a bright red skinned gargoyle woman with long purple hair worn in a ponytail. She was very pear-shaped compared to the rest of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a chubby, pale skinned blonde girl with a white jack o'lantern for a head. Next to her was a big-bellied, black furred and red-haired hellhound with long horns and a devil's tail. Next to the hellhound was a BBW kappa woman with yellow-green skin and green hair. The kappa girl was eating a bag of marshmallows as a heavy set weresheep with golden wool took her seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second row there was an hourglass shaped ogopogo woman, she looked similar to Lockette except more eel like with bright yellow fins going down her back and neck. Her skin looked like the color of an aurora. She must've been Odile, Fate's former roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her was a brocken specter, a rainbow colored ghost who looked like she was rising from the floor. Her face looked like a Haunter's and she had empty eye-sockets. Next to the brocken specter girl was a manticore woman in an apron. The manticore girl looked like Belladonna, but had purple skin, horns and leather wings as well as tattoos all over her body. The last monster was an obese creature that resembled a reddish brown furred lioness with the shell of a tortoise and six arms. She was a tarasque and from the looks of it, she wore a nurse's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head counselor was a bright blue skinned qilin with grayish pink hair and golden antlers. She looked in better shape than the rest of the counselors and had a grim expression on her face as she was taking attendance of the staff. \"Nat.\" She called. \"Here.\" Said the jack o'lantern girl. \"Venus.\" \"Here I am Kaylee.\" Said the winged manticore. \"Dolly.\" \"Here.\" Said the weresheep. \"Miranda?\" The qilin paused and then looked around in annoyance. \"Where are Miranda and Edgar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the last two counselors ran forward; first was an obese, bright yellow furred werewolf girl wearing a red hood over her head and the other surprisingly was a human young man with bright silver hair and tanned skin. \"Sorry we're late Kaylee.\" Said Miranda, the werewolf.\" The human stopped to pant while the weresheep, pumpkin girl, gargoyle, tarasque, kappa and hellhound all looked at him with lust. \"Hi Edgar.\" They said in a singsong voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar walked forward before the kappa girl finished her marshmallows and bent over. \"You look beat Edgar,\" she said. \"You can ride in the dome on my head. It's full of cold refreshing water.\" \"UH thanks Skyla.\" Replies Edgar nonchalantly. That's when Dolly, the sheep giantess knocked Skyla out of the way. \"Why take cold water when you can have warm wool Eddy.\" She says in lust. That's when the hellhound girl tried to push Dolly away only for Dolly to bite her and make her scream. \"Hey!\" \"Hey yourself Heloise,\" says Dolly. \"You're just gonna shove him down your purse. You know Edgar hates that.\" \"Too bad,\" says Heloise. \"I'm his fiancee.\" \"Funny,\" says Nat, the pumpkin girl. \"How can you be his <i>fiancee</i> when I'm his fiancee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdile lets out a sigh as Venus picks at her teeth with a spatula. \"Yikes, Summer's just started and they're already at it.\" The tarasque girl stepped in and tried to make a grab for Edgar but Heloise breathed fire on her back. \"What do you think you're trying to do Martha?\" asks the hellhound giantess. \"Edgar's tired and bruised from his run here. I'm the nurse,\" says Martha, the tarasque, rather angrily. \"And more important, his future wife.\" \"You're gonna need some medical treatment yourself nurse.\" Says Skyla the kappa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the girls heard a whistle. The gargoyle giantess had picked up Edgar and placed him in her cleavage, much to her rivals' dismay. Martha in particular was enraged and showed her claws. \"Curse you Janet! Just because that gargoyle hussy has the biggest rear of the staff, she thinks she's got the only hot guy in camp in the palm of her hand.\" \"Technically,\" says the brocken specter. \"She does.\" \"Bettina,\" says Miranda. \"Don't encourage them.\" \"Will you stop it!\" yells Kaylee as a storm suddenly appears in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the counselors settle down and take their seats before Kaylee calls the meeting. \"Okay, Camp Darkly opens tomorrow. But as for today, we're expecting a new counselor to the staff.\" Edgar lets out a gulp. \"Oh,\" he groans. \"If it's another stalker.\" Nat however smiles from cheek to cheek. \"A new face in the camp. This is gonna be <i>so</i> fun! I'll get the confetti!\" \"It better not be a succubus,\" says Skyla as she opens another bag of marshmallows. \"We've got enough competition here.\" Edgar looks at the girls nervously. Obviously he didn't exactly like all the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" says Kaylee. \"We're expecting a human. Another boy.\" Venus spots a bug on the table before squashing it with her spatula. \"That's actually a good thing. Now Skyla, Dolly, Janet, Martha, Heloise and Nat will be fighting over two hotties.\" Odile however is outraged. \"What?! Another human? You might as well fire us all and replace us with humans Kaylee! Is that it?\" \"Odile,\" says Edgar. \"Why are you always so paranoid. \"There's a human right here you know.\" \"Shut it shrimp.\" says Odile. \"No,\" says Kaylee. \"You shut it Odile. This counselor is a prisoner from Under Gloom undergoing rehabilitation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeloise lights herself a cigarette with her fire breath before speaking. \"Been there,\" she said. \"Done that.\" Kaylee glares at Heloise and suddenly the cigarette turns into a candy cane, much to Heloise's dismay. \"Really Kaylee?\" she asks. \"Think of the children Heloise,\" scolds Janet as she bounces her breasts and Edgar between them. \"You're setting a bad example.\" Kaylee then focuses on Odile. \"Odile, you don't have any right to complain. This is an order from Warden Destiny herself. You remember Destiny right Odile? Went to college with her daughter? Didn't you borrow money from Fate years ago to buy a textbook?\" Odile groans and slaps herself in the face. \"I should've paid her back when I had the chance.\" The ogopogo complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar and Miranda share a laugh before Kaylee turns to Miranda. \"And Miranda,\" says Kaylee. \"Do not eat him when he arrives like you do with Edgar all the time.\" Miranda blushes slightly. \"Come on Kaylee, why pick on me?\" \"Because A),\" says Kaylee to the werewolf. \"You're the only counselor who eats humans. And B) Unlike Edgar, this guy can't regenerate.\" Miranda glares at Edgar as he ducks down between Janet's breasts. \"Can I help it if I'm immortal.\" Edgar grumbles to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kaylee,\" says Venus the manticore as she proceeds to scratch her belly button with her spatula. \"Who's the new counselor.\" \"His name is Wade Wilson.\" Says Kaylee. Janet's eyes pop upon hearing this. \"Wilson?\" the gargoyle giantess asks. \"My big sis Petra told me about him.\" \"What was he in for?\" asks Bettina the brocken specter. \"He's a career troublemaker with a rap sheet as big as a phonebook,\" says Janet. \"But specifically why he's in Under Gloom, he set a mummy on fire for accidentally stepping on his car.\" \"Yikes,\" says Edgar. \"And he's coming to a camp for little girls. Robyn's not gonna like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee grabs her hair. \"I don't care what that bureaucratic bigmouth hobgoblin likes.\" \"You kinda have to Kaylee,\" says Miranda. \"She's the inspector and she's coming in a few days.\" Kaylee then makes her eyes glow before she grows tens of thousands of feet tall and storm clouds fill the air. The rest of the counselors cower before her. \"Quiet!\" shouts the qilin giantess. \"He's coming at noon and we are to make sure he doesn't cause any trouble! I have enough to worry about regarding this camp so it is up to each of you twelve to keep an eye on Wade. Got it!\" The other counselors nod their heads nervously before Kaylee shrinks down to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it when she warps reality.\" Groans Martha the tarasque. At that time, you're on a bus heading for the camp. Destiny has one of the guards escorting you because she obviously doesn't trust you. This guard was a gigantic cyclops woman with bright red skin and orange hair and a blue tattoo around her singular eye. The cyclops has you stuck between her breasts as you're shaking. \"Hey Iris,\" you say. \"You don't have to hold me all the way to the camp.\" Iris just shakes her head and glares at you. \"The Warden doesn't really believe you've changed. She sent me to accompany you because unlike the other guards, humans upset my stomach. You better behave yourself for the counselors though. Remember, there will be children present. At the first sign of criminal behavior, you'll be sent back to Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stick out your tongue. You heard about Edgar, the other human counselor and couldn't figure out why he could possibly enjoy being around monster brats. But soon you'd be in Horrorville and reach the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich point of view to follow now?</span></div></div>",

Iris hands you to Kaylee and then starts to walk away. She however, glares before she does so. \"I've got my eye on you Wade. Warden Destiny told me to come once a week to see how you're doing.\" As Iris walks off, you secretly give her the finger as Edgar looks at you in surprise. \"Dude!\" he yells. \"That was so uncalled for.\" Kaylee just snarls and looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however aren't intimidated. \"I take it you're in charge here horn head.\" \"As a matter of fact,\" says the qilin woman. \"I am. The name's Kaylee and let me assure you, I don't like this any better than you do. I hate humans.\" \"And I hate monsters,\" you say. \"Let's get this over with.\" As Kaylee walks towards the camp, Edgar looks on at you. \"Don't tell me you're some monster lover?\" you ask. Edgar shakes his head. \"No wonder you got in prison. That attitude won't make you a lot of friends.\" \"Blah! Blah! Blah! Why are you hear? You rob a bank?\" \"Actually,\" says Edgar. \"I chose this job. I was raised in this area. My mom's a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're actually appalled at that. A human raised by a monster? That's sick. \"Anyhow,\" says Edgar. \"My name's Edgar. My mom named me after Edgar All...\" \"Who cares.\" Edgar just shakes his head. \"I wonder if the warden sent you here just to get rid of you. The werebear that ate me last week had better manners than you.\" You just stick out your tongue. \"Whatever. What's the deal with this camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar smiles and begins to explains. \"Camp Darkly is a summer camp for young monster girls. We accept from any species. There are ten counselors besides Kaylee and me. Most of them want to marry me. For some reason big fat monster chicks find me attractive.\" You almost gag in disgust before Edgar explains. \"First off is my best friend Miranda the werewolf. She's really cool and always has my back. Of course she does eat me on a regular basis and she stole my bahamut girlfriend, Gia, but I don't hold that against her. Then there's Janet, a big red gargoyle and pretty much the most maternal mons....\" \"Gargoyle!\" you yell. \"Gargs are the worst.\" Edgar just ignores you. \"If you saw a can like hers you'd change your tune. Of course Nat is a close second. She's a jack o'lantern girl who makes it feel like a party everyday. I wonder if she's got sugar for blood or something.\" Edgar laughs at her own joke as Edgar clears his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's also someone you might like. Her name's Heloise. She's a hellhound who was given the choice of Under Gloom or here. Of course, she keeps me in a purse like a chihuahua when I work with her. It's so humiliating.\" \"Another reason to hate monsters.\" You say. Edgar gets slightly annoyed before continuing. \"There's also a kappa called Skyla. Nice girl, but don't ever take her out for lunch, you'll go bankrupt. Then you can meet Dolly the weresheep.\" \"Weresheep?\" you ask. \"You made that up.\" \"No, they're a legitimate species. Dolly was raised by humans and her folks still live with her.\" You let out a scoff. \"If I found something like that in my backyard, it'd be lamp chops for a year baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee looks down and growls. \"You two better get along down there,\" she warns. \"Or I'll eat you both right here.\" Edgar shakes his head again. \"Okay. Then there's Venus, a manticore who works as the camp cook. Of course, I'd never tell it to her face, but she's the worst cook I've ever met. She doesn't seem to know what she's doing most of the time. We gave her a job after the health inspector closed down her cafe.\" \"Can't be any worse than prison food.\" You say. Edgar coughs slightly. \"Next up is Nurse Martha, she's a tarasque.\" \"What's a tarasque?\" \"It's a big tortoise with a lion's head and multiple arms. I'd watch your mouth around her, she's got quite a nasty temper. Janet beat her in a beauty pageant years ago and she's held a grudge ever since. Then there's Bettina, a brocken specter ghost in charge of campfire stories. I don't like her much because she loves to scare me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and wish that you'd just reach the camp sooner because Edgar's descriptions of your new coworkers was making you crazy. \"And last is that jerk Odile,\" says Edgar with venom in his voice. \"That big ogopogo thinks my kind are out to steal her job. Her, you can be rude to as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see the camp up ahead as you sigh. Only three months as a counselor here and you never have to see a monster again.</span></div></div>",

Once she steps foot on the camp soil, there's a loud explosion and confetti fills the air. Kaylee even swallows some of it before she coughs. Nat the pumpkin headed girl runs out with a smile on her jack o'lantern face and is carrying a cake. \"Welcome to Camp Darkly!\" the pumpkin girl yells in an excited tone. You roll your eyes as Edgar lets out a laugh. The rest of the counselors come forward and Heloise the hellhound girl looks directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not as cute as Edgar.\" \"Oh really?\" you ask with a smug look. \"Well you're not as ugly as Destiny dog face.\" Heloise gives an annoyed look before the brocken specter Bettina floats forward. \"Ooh,\" she says as she waves her fingers. \"So we have a tough guy here.\" The rainbow ghost lets out a sinister laugh and makes a frightening face that you just blow your tongue at. \"He just doesn't know us,\" says Nat with that annoying smile still on her face. \"Let's be friends Wade. Cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag in disgust. \"Are you kidding me?\" you ask. \"It's probably made of toxic waste.\" Nat actually looks saddened and her eyes well up with tears as the manticore Venus shakes her head. \"He'd probably like it better if I made it.\" As Nat is crying, Skyla, the kappa woman decides to help herself to the cake as Martha the tarasque girl lets out a roar. \"How dare you make Nat cry like that?\" she asks. Martha growls and tries to come after you but Janet the gargoyle woman and Miranda the werewolf grab her by all six of her arms. \"Let me at him!\" yells Martha. \"I\"ll show him.\" \"Leave him alone Martha,\" says Janet. \"That temper of yours is out of control.\" \"You want to start something beauty queen?\" asks Martha angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogopogo girl Odile lets out a sigh and then slams herself in the face. \"Why me?\" she asks. \"Am I the only one here with any sanity.\" Dolly the weresheep giantess taps Odile on the back as you quickly grow impatient. \"Come on!\" you yell. \"Let's get this started before I go brain dead from being with these monsters any longer than I have to.\" Edgar at this point becomes so fed up he punches you in the face. \"Dude!\" he yells. \"What's your problem! You haven't said anything nice since you arrived. \"Oh grow up!\" \"Silence!\" shouts Kaylee as she makes thunder appear in the skies. All the giantess counselors stop and look at Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade will be staying at Camp Darkly serving community service until Summer ends. Since we don't have any human sized cabins, for each week of the camp session he will stay at a different counselor's cabin. His roommate at the end of the week will report to Iris, the cyclops Destiny sent to act as Wade's parole officer. If Destiny receives three particularly bad reports it will be back to Under Gloom for Wade.\" As Kaylee is speaking, you move your lips to mock her and she makes your mouth disappear. You groan before the qilin giantess continues. \"And I want you to at least try to get along with him, even though he's a jerk. Which means no eating him Miranda.\" The werewolf giantess shakes you head. \"Eat one immortal human one thousand times and you're branded for life.\" \"Next time,\" says Edgar to Miranda as Kaylee hands him to the werewolf giantess. \"Cut back on the garlic. Your insides smell bad enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miranda puts Edgar on her shoulder, Kaylee gives you your mouth back as you breath in deeply. However, Odile has a question. \"Wait,\" says the ogopogo. \"There are twelve weeks of Summer and only eleven counselors here that are monsters. What about the remaining week.\" Kaylee points up to the sky and you hear wings flapping. You look up and see another monster giantess. This one looked like a cross between a hippopotamus and a dragon with leather wings. She had gills on her neck and long blackish blue hair and was wearing a red jacket, black shirt and blue jeans. The strange giantess lands with a thump on the ground and then smiles at Edgar before blowing a kiss. \"Uh-oh.\" says Edgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Heloise, Martha and Dolly growl at the new giantess. \"Hello Elisa.\" Says Dolly in an angry tone. \"Sorry I'm late Kaylee,\" says Elisa. \"I overslept.\" \"What the hell kind of monster is that?\" you ask. \"I'm a bahamut,\" says Elisa. \"Basically a hippo combined with a fish, but with a dragon added in. Dungeons and Dragons, what are you gonna do?\" \"And all ugly.\" Elisa snorts angrily and blows black smoke out of her nostrils. \"Listen,\" she says. \"I may be used to humans and I work with one at my winter job, but I'm just starting work here today and I don't expect to make any enemies.\" You shake your head. \"Whatever hippo face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa walks up to the other counselors with only Odile, Venus, Miranda and Bettina being welcoming towards her as Edgar hides in Miranda's hood. \"Just what we need,\" sighs Odile. \"Another suitor for the one guy counselor. So who gets stuck with Wade the first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee snaps her fingers and summons a jar out of thin air with papers inside. \"I've taken the liberty of putting numbers in a jar for the weeks at camp. There are 12 monster counselors, this will decide the order in which we put up with the twerp.\" You couldn't care less and just wish that Kaylee would get it over with. Kaylee reaches in first and draws the number 6, meaning you'd stay with her on the 6th week of camp. You could've sworn it was a 1 a second ago though. She probably cheated with her reality bending powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Nat and Odile walk forward next and Odile lets out a sigh. \"I bet I get stuck first,\" says the ogopogo. \"I never had much luck gambling.\" Odile and Nat draw their cards. Nat gets a 4 while Odile gets a 9.\" \"Aw,\" groans Nat. \"I wanted a 1. I got off on the wrong foot with him and...\" \"Next!\" yells Kaylee impatiently as you grab your ears. Miranda and Martha draw next. Martha draws an 8 while Miranda draws a 10. Next up is Heloise and Skyla. Skyla draws a 2 and Heloise draws a 7. \"Ooh,\" says Heloise. \"My lucky number.\" \"Crud!\" yells Skyla. \"I get stuck with that grouch on the second week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBettina flies forward and draws a number as does Venus. Venus gets a 5 and Bettina draws an 11. \"Hey, hey, hey,\" says Bettina. \"It's my lucky day.\" Venus shrugs her shoulders because she doesn't care. Dolly is next to draw and Edgar asks her a question. \"What did you get Dolly.\" \"A 3. That leaves only a 12 and a 1. The first and last weeks of Summer.\" Janet and Elisa look at each other and glare slightly. \"You go ahead Janet,\" says Elisa. \"After all, you are my friend's kid sister.\" \"Uh uh,\" says Janet as the gargoyle giantess gives a fanged smirk. \"Age before beauty.\" \"Ha, ha.\" Says Elisa sarcastically. \"Just draw!\" yells Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bahamut and gargoyle reach in and draw numbers. You don't know which is worse because whoever draws a 1 will be your roommate for the first week of camp. Elisa already didn't seem to like you and she was a cross between a dragon and a hippo. That bahamut would probably get real mad if you tick her off. Then there was Janet the gargoyle. She's the last species you want to be stuck with during community service, especially after your experiences with Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who drew the 1?</span></div></div>",

She would be watching you for the first week of the Summer. \"Ooh,\" says Heloise.\"Bad luck Elisa. You get the jerk first.\" Elisa groans again and that hippo dragon giantess shakes her head. \"Whoop de doo,\" you say. \"I get to spend the first week with a fat smelling, hippo dragon fish.\" Elisa growls and breathes fire over your head before you're forced to duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled,\" says Kaylee. \"For the first week of camp, Elisa will be in charge of our new counselor. For the second week, Skyla will oversee Wade. In the third week, Dolly will be in charge. Week four, Wade will be Nat's responsibility and for week 5 he bunks with Venus. I'm in charge of him for week 6. Week 7, he's your problem Heloise, Martha will take him on the 8th week Odile will be in charge of week 9 and he'll be staying with both Miranda and Edgar week 10. Week 11, Wade stays with Bettina and finally, Janet is in charge of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet is secretly laughing at the development before Kaylee hands you to Elisa. \"Keep an eye on him Ms. Starkings,\" says Kaylee. \"We can't have him acting up around the campers.\" \"Don't worry chief,\" says Elisa. \"I know how to handle humans.\" Kaylee nods her head. \"I like you Elisa. You have a good work ethic. For a Terrordale dweller.\" \"Terrordale?\" you wonder to yourself. You had heard monsters from Horrorville and Terrordale were bitter enemies for some reason. This might be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa folds down her wings before she walks you to a cabin with an orange colored version of the camp logo on it. It had the number 12 printed on the side. Elisa opened the door and brings you inside. You look around and see the interior of the cabin. There is a skiing poster on the wall and there appears to be a stack of superhero comic books on the side of a shelf. Looks like the bahamut giantess is an otaku. Elisa puts you on a table before she walks to her dresser. \"Wait here,\" she says. \"I'll get your bed ready.\" You roll your eyes and see that Elisa placed you in front of two photographs in frames. One showed Elisa snowboarding down a hill along with a fat yellow skinned gargoyle giantess with black hair. On the gargoyle girl's shoulder was a young human man with purple hair and a well toned physique. The second photograph showed Elisa with who you assume was her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, her mother was a royal blue skinned bahamut with her black hair worn in a bun and her father was a muscle bound reddish skinned bahamut with graying hair. She also seemed to have two sisters. One was an indigo skinned bahamut in a gothic style outfit with a beret while the other was a cyan skinned bahamut who appeared younger than her sisters. What was weird was that there was another monster holding hands with Elisa's youngest sister. She was a white skinned behemoth with a pair of glasses and blonde hair. You're guessing that behemoth was Elisa's sister-in-law. You mentally gag. Girl on girl is hot, but with monsters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa then comes forward and you see that for your bed, she's brought out...</span></div></div>",

She looked human except for her pale skin, snub nose, pointed ears and red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" says Edgar. \"It's Robyn.\" Robyn comes forward and Kaylee bears her teeth. \"What are you doing here you hobgoblin hussy?\" she asks. \"You're not due to inspect the camp for a few days.\" \"You need a new calendar Kaylee,\" says Robyn. \"I prefer to start before your incompetence gets children hurt. The campers aren't due until tomorrow, so I'm going to run a quick check.\" Kaylee lets out a groan before Robyn notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" the hobgoblin girl asks. \"Oh him?\" asks Kaylee. \"This is Wade, our new counselor.\" Robyn shakes her head and lowers a finger to stroke your head to your annoyance. \"That is really abusive,\" she says. \"It's bad enough you expect Edgar to keep up with the rest of the counselors.\" As Robyn strokes you, you get annoyed and bite her on the finger as she yells in pain. \"OUCH!\" Edgar gasps and Kaylee looks at the inspector in fear. Robyn in retaliation reaches into her purse and takes out a squirt bottle before spraying you with it a few times. \"Bad human,\" she says. \"What an ill-behaved creature you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" you ask Edgar. \"Well,\" says Edgar. \"Robyn keeps humans as pets at home. She thinks that we're adorable.\" Pets? That goblin saw you as nothing more than an unruly hamster? That was insulting. Robyn puts her bleeding finger in her mouth and glares at Kaylee. \"Not coming to a very good start are we Kaylee?\" she asks. \"If I'm met with any more hostility from your counselors, consider this camp shut down.\" \"Good riddance.\" You think. That's when you realize something. If Camp Darkly is shut down, you'll never be able to fulfill your community service and it's back to Under Gloom for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee bites her lip, but then gets an idea. \"Uh-oh.\" Says Edgar. \"Say Robyn,\" says Kaylee. \"We need a little time to get the camp up and running. Perhaps I can interest you in a deal. You give us more time to set up and I give you Wade.\" \"What?!\" you yell. Kaylee then gives a smirk. \"Perhaps a little loving discipline from you would be enough to fix his attitude?\" Edgar actually laughs as you glare at Kaylee and Robyn seems to think this over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Robyn think of this idea?</span></div></div>",

I always adore them.\u201d Robyn said with a snickering grin to some degree, but it was quite cute none of the less. For you, this means one thing, oh the hell no in every possible way. Kaylee just sold you out to Robyn, and you would probably know that Destiny would eventually check the place to see how you are doing, and if she finds out that you aren\u2019t there, she would guess you escaped then, and if that happens, then more likely you are going back to the Under Gloom. Man this day just couldn\u2019t get any worse for you. \u201cAnd perhaps I can work out that Wade who has problems.\u201d She giggled kinda bit as she pokes a finger at you, making you really irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to state something though that explains why I should not go.\u201d Wade stated to everyone, and this kinda gets Robyn and Kaylee listening for a moment, although Kaylee was kinda reluctant. \u201cIf by some time or reason Destiny comes to Camp Darkly, and sees that I am not there doing my community service. She will think I escaped, and then she will look for me as I bailed on community service, if that happens, or the place gets shut down, then I go back to prison, and I don\u2019t want that. So I say let the inspection happen and just get it out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn then thinks this over and \u201cWell\u2026 to have a good working environment, I need everyone being positive, and your negative attitude is the problem, so I am doing what is needed (off camera scene, Destiny allows Kaylee to give Wade to Robyn to fix his attitude although it won\u2019t be revealed to him), and that means you need to start manning up for once.\u201d Kaylee smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it. Robyn, take me to whatever place and let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d Wade grunted, pretty mad that Kaylee just made his day gone from bad to worse. This might as well not be pretty. Robyn then grabs you, puts you into her bag, and then she drives off. \u201cAlright, have fun getting your attitude fixed.\u201d Edgar waved goodbye to his new friend who gives him the middle finger from the window (it was really for Kaylee).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay\u2026 Edgar. There is way that she cures humans and makes them positive. She is actually a spell user, who casts a spell on the humans she keeps as pets, and that makes the pets obey their masters. Perhaps we might be having a fully complying new worker when he gets back.\u201d Kaylee said to Edgar. \u201cThanks for telling me. At least I am not like him.\u201d </span></div></div>",

You were in Robyn\u2019s pocket, just relaxing and moaning in complete boredom and anger as you wait for your new home. It was a few miles away from her house, plus with all of the usual stop light and crap that she has to stop every once in a while, you know that this is going to be a long ride. \u201cOh this is going to be so much fun. I am going to be able to feed you, let you play with the others, tell bedtime stories with you, and all sorts of other stuff, and I know you won\u2019t be able to resist them, as I have something cooking up for you, and it\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d Robyn said with a nice and calm voice, as she seems to be a charming woman. You are just hoping that she isn\u2019t some sort of a witch (stated in last chapter by Edgar and Kaylee as he left that she is a witch) that could put you under some spell that will make you do some weird things. If it is, you would rather go back to prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reach Robyn\u2019s home, which kinda looks like an evil witch castle by some means with all the dark and spooky creatures that just give you the jaspers. They were like dead souls, zombies, and all sorts of other stuff. Somehow coming out of the house to see Robyn is some sort of a young daughter hobgoblin. It was a cute young girl with black hair, and was wearing a pink shirt with a white skirt, and she had some sort of a magic wand in her hand. \u201cAh\u2026 and guess my little helper in magic is going to join along with us. Ah that Soya.\u201d Robyn smiled just as her daughter comes up to the vehicle. Great, just looking at her, now you got two problems to worry about. Robyn, and now especially Soya. \u201cSay, I will be right in there in just a moment sweety, just get ready to cast your spells as soon as I am done with this fella.\u201d Robyn told her just as she gets out of the car, and Soya smiled. \u201cAlright mommy, I will be ready.\u201d Soya said (note that she appears like a 9 year old) and then she runs up into the house. Robyn then takes you out, and sprays some sort of a pixie dust from her can of something onto you, and it got you itching as it was not pleasant at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what in the heck is that?\u201d you shouted up to her just as you were sprayed by the pixie dust thingy. \u201cWell, you will find out as soon as you get in there.\u201d She said just as she walks into the main room where the daughter is ready with the wand. \u201cAlright Soya, I have brought our latest recreation toy right here, I like to see you work your magic right now.\u201d Robyn smiled for her daughter, just as the daughter begins some sort of spell casting like stunt. \u201cOh hello there human, you and I are going to become best friends, who are you?\u201d she asked you just as she begins using her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am\u2026\u201d you said before she puts some spell on you right then with the magic student that forces you to say. \u201cWade.\u201d In a happy voice, and then you suddenly gasped. You were angry enough to be brought here, but now you are saying your name and agreeing to be her friend happily. Well that is just creepy. \u201cSay, would you like to be my friend?\u201d she asked you and then you angrily shouted \u201cNo\u2026 I will not\u2026\u201d you said before Soya casts another spell again that forces you to happily say. \u201cYes, of course I will be your friend Soya.\u201d You said in a controlled happily state. Robyn was just laughing. \u201cIt worked, it\u2026 worked!!!!!!!!!\u201d she laughed, happily that her spell is working perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Wade, do you like to?\u201d Soya asked.</span></div></div>",

I spent six days in that wendigo, Desiree's belly just last week. She wouldn't let me out until I agreed to date her. And that's not getting started on the weretiger girl who bit my head off yesterday. It still stings.\" \"Come on,\" groans Miranda. \"I won't chew on you this time. You're the only human I know who can be eaten more than once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar rolls his eyes. \"You know, it's kind of uncomfortable having a best friend who considers me to be food. I'm just relaxing until this new counselor shows up. \"About that,\" says Miranda. \"We're expecting two new counselors. \"Kaylee told me Elisa is starting work here.\" \"Oh no,\" Edgar groans. \"Elisa is nice and all, but one more stalker? They're getting more bloodthirsty everyday. Just the other day, I was at the beach when I caught Nat, Skyla, Heloise and Dolly playing volleyball. Only Dolly saw me, and she hid me in one of the rolls on her belly to hide me from the other girls. Why do so many monsters consider me attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda lets out a laugh. \"Well,\" she says as she leans back so her head is above Edgar and the daisy. \"What can I say. You're so cute they could just...\" With that, Miranda snaps her friend and the daisy up in her jaws and devours the human before spitting out his bones. Surprisingly, the bones come back into place and Edgar's body regenerates no worse for wear. As Edgar recovers from being chewed to bits and holds his head, he looks up in annoyance. \"Hey! You said you wouldn't chew!\" \"Can I help it if I'm a wolf?\" asks Miranda before she lets out a burp. Edgar just turns his head and crosses his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" sighs Miranda. \"I'll let you decide how I eat you next time.\" \"That's better. Speaking of Elisa, how's Gia doing.\" Edgar takes out his wallet and holds up a photograph of an indigo skinned monster girl resembling a cross between a fish, a hippopotamus and a dragon. She had long black hair and was dressed like a Goth girl complete with a navel piercing. \"Relax Edgar,\" says Miranda. \"Your ex-girlfriend is doing fine. She was asking about you over brunch and by brunch I mean...\" \"Miranda!\" yells Edgar. \"That's my ex you're talking about!\" Miranda rolls her eyes. \"By the way, what do you think of another human in the camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar lets out a groan. \"Well, I'm not wild about having a criminal in the camp and he's from Under Gloom. My dad's killer is in Under Gloom you know. That gorgon Yuri, remember. Turned him from a wyvern to an overgrown lawn ornament. Rest his soul. That reminds me, I better visit my mom.

Edgar just lets out a sigh as the giant snake lunges at him. But before the snake could get him, another monster intervenes and scares the snake off. This time it was an obese white furred giantess with long blue horns. She was a wendigo and was dressed like a park ranger. \"Hi Edgar.\" Says the wendigo girl as she waves down and smiles with her large fangs. \"Hi Desiree,\" says Edgar in annoyance. \"As much as I'd like to be your dinner or your date, or both, I have to get to my mom's place. Thanks for saving me from that Midgard Serpent though. I'd rather be eaten by a sentient monster and preferably a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree pouts as Edgar walks away. \"Next time,\" she says to himself. \"I'm going to keep him in my belly until he proposes to me.\" As Edgar walked off, he saw his mom's place on the horizon. It looked like an old hovel and there were two other monster girls outside. First was an overweight purple furred monkey giantess who had giant white wings. She wore black shorts, a white shirt and orange cap and was sweeping the deck. Up on the roof repairing a hole was a giant pear shaped woman in silver armor who surprisingly didn't have a head. Her head in fact was tan skinned with long rose colored hair and was sipping a soda through a straw on a nearby table. She was a dullahan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Fay,\" says Edgar as he walks forward. \"Hi Katrina.\" Both apprentice monsters turn their heads and spot Edgar. Immediately they get excited. The dullahan girl's body even jumps off the roof and snatches Edgar up as her head squeals. Edgar grunts as the dullahan pushes her against her left breast. \"How are you doing today little cutie?\" asks the dullahan. \"It's so good to see you. Your mom asked me to fix the roof and low and behold...\" Katrina giggles as Fay, the winged monkey looks on in annoyance. \"Hey Katrina,\" she says. \"Stop hogging the hunk. I'm Nadine's apprentice. I deserve some time with her son.\" \"Go eat a banana.\" Says Katrina. Fay lets out a monkey shriek and holds up her broom to whack Katrina's disembodied head when Edgar clears his throat. \"Uh, is mom home.\" Both monster girls let out a sigh as Katrina puts Edgar down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadine's in her study working on potions.\" Edgar walks into the hovel and inside there was a strange monster brewing a potion. The monster giantess resembled a tyrannosaurus rex with dragon's wings and lumps on her yellowish-brown body. She had gray hair worn in a ponytail with tusks braided in the sides and was wearing a sorceress's dress. \"Now,\" says the nidhogg giantess. \"Mandrake sap, smilodon tears...\" As the giantess puts the ingredients into the cauldron, it causes an explosion of magical smoke that forces Edgar to cover his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine coughs and lowers her head before the smoke clears. \"Mother Hubbard!\" she shouts to herself. \"By Odin's beard, I wish I held onto that recipe.\" \"Mom!\" yells Edgar up to the dragon woman. \"Mom! Down here.\" Nadine lowers her head and smiles upon seeing her human son. \"Edgar,\" she says as she bends over and rubs her head against the tiny human. \"How good to see you. Tell me son, have you asked out any of your coworkers yet? Maybe Dolly or Janet? At this point, I'd settle for Martha.\" \"Mom,\" complains Edgar. \"Not that again. I just wanted to tell you we're expecting a new counselor. Nadine picks Edgar up and places him on the table as she starts to go through the rest of her ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Nadine. \"As long as she's a nice girl. At least 500 stones. I know what my baby likes.\" \"Mom,\" says Edgar. \"You doubt understand. It's a boy and a human like me. His name's Wade Wilson.\" Nadine nods her head. \"That's nice dear. I just hope Miranda doesn't eat him. You don't have any friends your own size.\" \"I doubt I'll be friends with Wade. He's coming in from Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Nadine drops a bottle on the ground because now she's horrified of your arrival. \"They're letting a criminal work in a camp for children?! Are they nuts!\" \"Well, they already have Heloise.\" \"Heloise is a minor offender,\" says Nadine. \"What is this guy in for?\" Edgar nervously rubs his head. \"Arson.\" \"Arson!?\" yells Nadine. \"You've got to be kidding me!\" \"Calm down Mom,\" says Edgar. \"it's only for 12 weeks.\" Nadine lets out a growl and then turns her head around to speak with her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks him a question?</span></div></div>",

More like keeper. How can you call yourself human with a mother like that?\" he calls back. \"I think I've seen enough.\" Nadine says. \"He certainly is rude, but he's just a loudmouth.\" She turns to walk away, probably to prevent herself from getting worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they hear a flapping sound and look up. Descending from the sky is a pear shaped gargoyle with red skin. When she lands she looks around. \"Whats with the little get together?\" she asks. Then she sees Edgar and his mother and straightens up. \"Oh! Hello ma'am! I didn't see you there!\" Nadine smiles at her. \"Hello Janet. I was just here to see the new counselor, and I think I've seen more than I want.\" she says. \"I'll be on my way now, so why don't you take Edgar here?\" She hands him to Janet, who squeals a little in glee. The other girls all stare with jealousy. Wade however, is not very pleased to see Janet. \"Oh great, a gargoyle? This just keeps getting better and better.\" he moans. Janet turns to him in Dolly's hand and responds. \"Do you have some kind of problem with gargoyles?\" she asks. \"Yeah, considering my life is hell thanks to a certain blue warden.\" he answers. \"Well Janet's really nice, so could you at least try to be nice?\" Edgar says. \"Fat chance.\" he spits back. \"Almost as fat as that flying tomato.\" Janet frowns at him. \"Well we can always send you right back to that \"blue skinned warden\" you love so much\" she tells him. \"Red or blue, you're all just big dumb rocks. Well I guess in your case I'd say boulder.\" he says. The girls who have already got acquainted with Wade all groan at his attitude, but Nadine turns to him in frustration. \"You should really watch your mouth criminal. Any of these girls could be my daughter one day, so don't insult them or my son!\" she says. The women present all gasp when she says \"daughter\". Wade just sticks his tongue out at her as Kaylee walks up. \"Okay, lets break it up, we have a camp to run.\" she says aloud. She then tells everyone her plan for the day.</span></div></div>",

Wade watches from Dolly's palm and starts picking his nose. The weresheep lets out a groan. \"Why do I get stuck with him while Janet gets to hold Edgar. It's not fair.\" \"You're dog gone right it isn't fair Dolly,\" says Skyla. \"Hand him over here Janet.\" Janet just waves her finger and shoves Edgar down her cleavage as Miranda lets out a laugh. \"Boo! yells Nat, Venus and Skyla at the same time. Odile rolls her eyes as Miranda smiles smugly. \"Man, am I glad that Gia's the only girl for me.\" Bettina snickers herself as Nat, Venus, Martha, Heloise and Skyla form a huddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Martha lets out a growl and crosses all her arms. \"That tomato red hussy,\" she grumbles. \"First she steals victory from me at the Ms. Horrorville Pageant and now she's hoarding the hottie all to herself.\" \"I'll bet that b... boulder, slipped a love potion into his drink last summer,\" says Skyla as she reaches into her shell to take out a bag of potato chips. \"Still,\" says Heloise. \"How can we compete with a can like that.\" \"Bah!\" scoffs Venus. \"No way it can be natural. I'll bet she's been taking nebutori on the side.\" Nat just lets out a giggle. \"That's okay. It just means I'll have to eat twice as much marble cake to be on par with Friend Janet.\" \"You better share,\" says Heloise as she rubs her big belly. \"I mean, this is promising, but Edgar loves his monster girls with lots of meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWade just lets out a scoff. \"What would any sane man want with any of you giant freakish blobs?!\" Dolly grits her teeth and looks down at you. \"What was that?\" Dolly asks. \"Well,\" says Wade. \"Look at you all. You're ugly monsters, especially that blond freak with the sagging stomach and vegetable face.\" Nat gasps and rubs her pumpkin head, but Venus snatches Wade up and growls. \"You're lucky humans give me gas,\" she says. \"You're playing with fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" yells Kaylee at the top of her lungs. \"Geez. Okay. We need to get the camp ready. The campers arrive tomorrow and more importantly, Robyn will be here in a few days to inspect the camp. Wade, you're new here, so I'll explain the camp rules. No swearing, no smoking, no drinking and overall, don't behave in such a deplorable way that little kids could imitate.\" \"Up yours horn face.\" Says Wade. Edgar slaps himself in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Wade isn't our only new counselor. You all remember Gia's twin sister.\" From the sky flies down a brown skinned monster resembling a hippo with gills and the wings and skin of a dragon. She was wearing a red jacket and scarf with a black shirt and blue jeans. \"Hi Edgar,\" she says dreamily. \"I'm back.\" \"Elisa.\" Groans Janet as she shoves Edgar deeper down her cleavage. \"Oh great,\" says Wade. \"Another freak. Hey Big Bertha, to the side! I can barely see!\" Elisa is not amused and the bahamut responds by breathing fire on Wade. Wade coughs up smoke as the counselors take their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" says Kaylee. \"We've got until tomorrow to get this camp ready. Janet, Skyla, Edgar, Dolly, Nat and Venus will join me in preparing the east side of camp. Oh, and Venus.\" \"Yes Kaylee?\" the manticore asks as she uses a kitchen knife to cut her toenails. \"If it has blue spots, throw it away. The last thing we need is a camper getting food poisoning and a lawsuit from her parents. Now, Heloise, Elisa, Martha, Odile, Bettina and Miranda will take Wade and cover the west side of camp.\" \"What?!\" yells Odile. \"You're sticking us with that crook. But why.\" Kaylee levitates Odile in the air and Odile grunts as she holds her neck. \"Because the warden knew about the camp through you, because you owe her daughter money and because I'll turn you into an aardvark if you don't Ms. Pogo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee drops Odile and Odile snatches Wade from Dolly. Wade sticks his tongue out. \"Listen here lady. I've had to spend six months in a cell with a Loch Ness Monster and I don't want to stay with an ogopogo either.\" Odile squeezes Wade before she puts him on her shoulder. \"Come on girls,\" says Kaylee. \"And Edgar, and Wade.

Janet smiles and looks down as she strokes Edgar on the head. Edgar smiles as Venus lets out a growl. \"The nerve of that Janet,\" she says. \"Well, just wait who's laughing when Nadine tries my stuffed tarantula souffl\u00e9. I'll show up Janet, and that jerk Circe as well. Let's see that pig deal with some competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar climbs out of Janet's cleavage and looks at the four other girls before shaking his head. \"When will it end?\" he asks. Janet lets out a laugh and then shoves Edgar back down between her titanic breasts. \"Well that's an easy answer, the gargoyle giantess says. It'll stop when we're married.\" Edgar rolls his eyes. \"I'm still worried about having Wade around Janet,\" he says. \"Can you believe he insulted my mother, to her face?\" Janet nods her head. \"Don't forget he insulted me and my species. Doesn't he know gargoyles have an instinct to protect humans? I'm terrified to see what he says around the little ones. He looks like he's bad with children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar nods his head. Suddenly his cellphone rings. Edgar grunts and tried to move his hands through Janet's breasts and then takes out his phone to see it is depicting an image of a bixie, a stone lion with winged shoulders. This bixie was a woman, very chubby with gray hair and thin glasses along with H-cup breasts. In the image on the phone, the bixie woman was wearing a bikini top that read \"Make me Purr\" and had a seductive look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar sighs and answers the phone. \"Hi Celadon,\" he says. \"Yes, I'm doing well. Is Nala ready for... oh good. We really enjoy having your daughter at Camp Darkly. She always has a good, uh no, I'm gonna be busy this week and...\" Janet looks down and glares as her eyes glow red. \"Celadon,\" says Edgar. \"I'm gonna have to call you back.\" Edgar hangs up and lets out a sigh. No sooner does the phone ring again and he grits his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar sees that this time the phone showed an image of a titanic crimson furred wereboar girl who was dressed similar to Wonder Woman and even had star shaped tattoos on her large hips. The caller ID identified this wereboar as \"Circe\". \"I'm just gonna ignore her.\" Groans Edgar as Janet continues to glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce \"Circe\" has given up, the phone rings once again and Edgar groans. \"I'm cursed,\" he said. \"It must be a curse.\" Edgar nervously lifts up the phone and it shows an image of a heavyset Frankenstein's monster giantess with lightning bolts in her black hair and electrical wires in her back. She was smiling seductively and holding out her belly. Edgar answers the phone and groans. \"Fanny,\" he says. \"How's the modeling business going. That's great. How's my big sis Sora doing? I haven't seen her in...\" Before Edgar could saw another word, Janet picks up the phone and lifts it up to her mouth. \"Edgar will have to call you back,\" she says. \"He's working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet then proceeds to toss Edgar's phone into her mouth and crush it between her teeth. \"Hey,\" says Edgar. \"Do you know how hard it is to find a cellphone store that caters to humans in Horrorville.\" \"No offense Edgar,\" says Janet with a smirk. \"But I have enough competition in camp with seven monsters.\" \"I think you mean <i>we</i> have enough competition Friend Janet,\" says Nat. \"But Fay, Fanny, Katrina, Celadon, Circe, Desiree and Dixie have an extreme disadvantage. We see Edgar everyday, so we have a better chance. Even with that stinky mouth Wade around.\" Skyla lets out a laugh before the girls and Edgar stop to dust off a cabin. \"Man, how much do you want to bet that Wade gets himself eaten on the first day. Maybe Miranda will make lunch out of him.\" \"Maybe you'll eat him Skyla,\" jokes Dolly as she applies some paint to the door. \"You eat everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dolly is saying this, Skyla is picking away at a nearby pear tree. She glares at Dolly as if she's offended. Janet places Edgar on the windowsill as Edgar tears off some cobwebs. However, he has a look on his face. \"Mom sure was mad when I told her about Wade,\" he says to himself. \"And she was even madder when she met Wade. I really hope that she doesn't do anything drastic. She looked ready to eat him alive. Well, at least it takes her mind off of my woman trouble.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not gonna let my son, or any potential daughter-in-law put up with that crook all Summer. Nadine you old girl, I think you've got an idea.\" Nadine lets out a cackle, revealing her hundreds of sharp tyrannosaurus like teeth as she makes her way home. On the way, she passes by another hovel where a golden skinned mock turtle with long blonde hair and the shell of snapping turtle, an enormous udder and a mole on her chin, was busy washing a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother monster, an obese chimera with the head of a lioness, cobra and goat wearing a spiked iron bikini was harvesting a strange fruit from a small tree. The chimera woman turns and glares at Nadine while her mock turtle apprentice stares at Nadine and bites her lip. \"Look away Dixie,\" says all three of the chimera giantess's heads in unison. \"Ignore that eyesore.\" Nadine growls at the chimera. \"Get off my case Tricia,\" she says. \"I'm in a bad mood today and I don't need some second string sorceress getting in my craw.\" \"How's that boy of yours doing Hofferson?\" asks Tricia in a malicious tone. \"Still single is he? At least he tastes good. Ironic, he won't die in a monster's belly, but he will die a vir...\" Nadine roars at her rival. \"For your information, he will marry one day and unlike you, his bride will have class. One would think a monster with three heads would have at least one brain between them.\" As Nadine and Tricia growl at each other, Dixie, the mock turtle giantess lowers her bovine head and secretly looks at a photograph of Edgar in her cleavage with a lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nadine is done arguing with Tricia, she returns to her hovel to find Fay washing dishes and Fay looks in surprise. \"Oh, Mistress, you're back. How was the camp?\" \"Dirty,\" says Nadine. \"The new counselor they hired is atrocious. But I'll fix him. Fay looks in confusion as Nadine holds up her cane and makes the eyes on the head decoration glow. Nadine draws a magic circle in the floor before she begins to cast a spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through the sounds of flames and thunder, take the power sent asunder, like an earthquake on a roll, I'm the witch who's in control. A human named Wade has been quite brash, but I'm the one who'll laugh the last. He sees all monsters as a disgrace, so let's give him a change of face. Twelve titanesses west and east, when morning comes, man turns to beast.\" Nadine cackles as the magic circle lights up and sends magical energy in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day in Odile's cabin where Wade was staying, the ogopogo giantess was still fast asleep. Wade however was just getting up. He lets out a yawn and gets up from the window he was sleeping in. \"And today marks the first day as babysitter to monster brats. No thanks. Huh?\" Wade looks closer into the window and as he sees his reflection, he lets out a loud scream that wakes up all the other counselors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine had cast a spell on him and transformed him into a human sized...</span></div></div>",

His resulting scream was so loud that Odile leaps out of bed and hits her head on the ceiling of her cabin. The ogopogo mutters to herself and rubs her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before several of the other counselors, including Kaylee, barge in. Kaylee is the first to enter and is wearing hair curlers as she gives an angry look. \"What the Sam Hill is going on in here? It's only five in the morning Next, Miranda walks in half asleep with Edgar on her shoulders still wearing his pajamas. Edgar lets out a yawn and then finally notices Wade and wakes right up. Janet comes in and gasps. \"Is that Wade?\" she asks. \"Of course it's me you dumb tomato!\" yells Wade rudely. \"More importantly, what happened to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" groans Edgar. \"Looks like Mom's been playing with magic again.\" \"What?!\" yells Wade. \"Oh,\" says Heloise as she wipes off her facial mask and walks in. \"Didn't you know. Edgar's mom is a witch. She must've put a curse on you after you acted like such an ass to her face.\" \"Language!\" yells Kaylee. Wade is now so mad that he drives his new claws into a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda being a werewolf doesn't see the big deal. \"Personally,\" she says. \"You've never looked better. Not that I'd be interested. I already have a girlfriend.\" \"Yeah,\" says Edgar under his breath. \"My ex.\" Wade climbs down from the windowsill and angrily growls as he walks forward. \"That old bag!\" he says. \"I'm gonna...\" Before Wade can say another word, he starts to scratch himself. Miranda puts Edgar on the ground and Edgar walks up to the human sized werewolf before picking off an unusually large flea. \"Yikes,\" says Edgar. \"Mom went all out this time.\" \"That hag gave me fleas?!\" yells Wade. \"Why I oughta...\" \"Fleas?!\" yells Kaylee. \"Martha! Do you have any flea repellant in your office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha's eyes actually pop before she slaps herself in the face. \"Aw man, that's the one thing I forgot.\" \"Edgar,\" says Kaylee. \"I want you to take that mutt...\" Before Kaylee can finish that sentence, both Heloise and Miranda growl at her. \"Uh,\" says the qilin nervously. \"That is to say, Wade, to your mother's hovel and get her to make a potion that will kill those blasted fleas. Do you have any idea how many furry monsters come to this camp?\" Edgar nods his head but Wade angrily storms off as he growls. \"Just wait until I get my hands on that old witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar runs after Wade before the two of them are nearing the outskirts of the camp. Odile rubs her head in pain and mutters to herself. \"I'm okay,\" she says sarcastically. \"Thanks for asking.\" \"Should one of us go with them?\" asks Miranda. \"Edgar is immortal but as for Wade...\" \"No,\" says Kaylee. \"We only have three hours until the campers arrive and with the humans going to Nadine's place, we only have twelve counselors. Say what you want about Elisa but if she hadn't started work yesterday, we'd be in big trouble if Robyn showed up and saw us understaffed. Besides, I doubt that Wade will survive out there, very highly.\" Martha lets out a scoff. \"I bet my shell that warden sent him here just to get rid of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wade is stomping out of camp as he growls in his new werewolf body as Edgar follows. \"Get lost monster lover.\" Says Wade. Edgar lets out a grunt. \"Dude, lighten up. That attitude has caused you nothing but trouble so far.\" Wade just growls and shows his fangs. Edgar rolls his eyes before the two of them keep walking. \"Listen Wade. This mountainside is extremely dangerous for people our size. There are Midgard serpents, giant insects...\" Before Edgar could continue he hears his cell phone ring. In case anyone asks, he keeps a spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar takes out the phone and it shows the image of a great white landshark girl who was very pear shaped, almost as much as Janet and had long flowing orange hair. \"Huh,\" says Edgar. \"Lucy's up early. I'll just let it ring.\" Edgar puts away the phone and he and Wade continue walking. Once they're out of the campgrounds and on the trail to Nadine's house, Edgar's phone rings again and Wade growls as he grabs his pointed ears. Edgar looks at the caller ID and it shows an image of the wendigo girl Desiree. Like with Lucy, Edgar chooses to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar and Wade just about reach a large sign when the phone rings again and Wade gets more annoyed than ever. \"Dammit! Again with that stupid phone!\" Edgar looks at the caller I.D. and it's that wereboar Circe again. He lets out a sigh. \"Circe,\" he says. \"I'm gonna have to call you back.\" Wade glares at Edgar. \"More dumb monster chicks?\" \"What?\" asks Edgar. \"I'm popular. They're all real friendly. Even the carnivorous ones.\" Wade just sticks out his tongue. \"That's disgusting. How many of those stupid fangirls do you have.\" \"16.\" \"Huh, you have enough for a harem... if they weren't BUTT UGLY FREAKS OF NATURE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar shakes his head. \"I feel very sorry for that poor warden.\" Wade starts to walk forward but Edgar grabs him by the shoulder. \"That's not a good idea Wade,\" he says. \"That way leads to Skellington Lake. That's where Wanda the vampiress goes fishing.\" \"So?\" \"Wanda loves to chomp humans,\" says Edgar. \"Them and fish are her favorite food. If she sees you, she'll use you as bait, reel in a big fish, eat the fish and then eat you.\" Wade grunts and then tries to walk the other way. \"I'd advise against that path too. That way leads to Tricia's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tricia?\" \"She's a nasty three-headed chimera and my mom's worst enemy. She hates people who trespass in her garden.\" \"So she's a witch too?\" asks Wade. \"Maybe I can find a cure from one of the fatass's spell books.\" Wade pushes Edgar and lets out a growl. \"Stay out of my way Mama's boy.\" With that, the human turned miniature werewolf walks off...</span></div></div>",

Inside the lake are all forms of monstrous looking fish. One of the fish even has three eyes and another had two maws. Wade takes a look at a pink urchin swimming down the water and sticks out his tongue. \"That stuff would make some real ugly sushi. Now, I wonder where that old bag lives. She'll pay for hexing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Wade stops in his tracks and his tail sticks up straight. A large shadow is cast above and Wade looks up to see a large heavyset vampiress with hot pink skin. The vampire giantess had huge E-cup breasts and black hair worn in an oversized ponytail with bright pink highlights. She wore a reddish pink Gothic Lolita outfit with pink stockings, high heeled boots and a white skirt. Lastly there was a red heart shaped monocle over her left eye. She was carrying a black umbrella, obviously to protect herself from the sun which would no doubt kill her on contact. What was really strange was that her feet weren't even touching the ground. She was levitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Mutters Wade. This was obviously the fisher Wanda that Edgar warned him about given that she had a fishing rod in the other hand and was holding a tackle box under her arm. However, she didn't seem to notice him yet. Instead Wanda smiles and licks her fangs as she floats above. \"That camp opens today,\" she says in a Transylvanian accent. \"I wonder if I'll see that delectable Edgar today. If there's anything yummier than fresh fish, it's fresh human filling. His blood tastes sweeter every time I chew him to bits. The best part is he's the one human I can chomp more than once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWade lets out a sigh. \"That stupid vampire didn't even see me,\" he says. \"Maybe if she's too busy looking for that mama's boy, I can sneak past her. I hope that wet blanket gets munched but good.\" Wade sneaks underneath Wanda, only to look up and gag as he looks at a pair of black panties covered with pink bats. But he couldn't think of that now since he had to get past the vampiress to get to Nadine's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does he make it?</span></div></div>",

Edgar shakes his head and keeps going, but is stopped by the massive chimera. She steps over him to get to another plant, and is now directly in his way. He holds his breath in shock and tries to find somewhere to hide. Tricia hates trespassers, but it would be especially bad for him since she hates his mother. He quietly sneaks away, trying to keep his distance from the giant chimera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he hears a sniffing sound and looks up. Tricia's lioness head is sniffing around and eventually zeroes in on him. She growls at him causing the other two heads to look his way. \"You!\" they all say at once. Edgar takes off running but Tricia catches him easily. She simply brings her hand down and swats him into the ground. Inspecting her palm she sees the remains of the human reform and return to life. \"I knew it was you. You're lucky your mother made you immortal.\" she says. Edgar gets his bearings and looks into Tricia's three faces. \"Please, I can explain.\" he says, but she won't hear it. \"I don't care, you were in my garden. I'll deal with you how I want, and then maybe I'll send you back to your hack of a mother. Just be thankful you won't die.\" she says. She walks to her house and places Edgar inside a jar. She bends down so she's eye level with him to gloat, but her lioness head suddenly sniffs again. The cobra head sticks its tongue out as well. \"It seems there's one more intruder around here.\" Tricia says. \"I'll find him and punish you both.\" You assume she just smelled Wade running around. After a little while someone walks over. Who is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd sooner trust Loki than you. I know a liar when I see one. You must think that I'm a complete idiot! Forget it! You're staying right where you are and for every escape attempt, you'll add more time to your sentence. I better not catch you trying anything funny today, or mark my words, Wilson, you're gonna regret it.\" Destiny even gestures that she's watching you and then walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you yell. \"That damn gargoyle saw right through my act.\" Lockette lets out a yawn as she stretches her neck up. \"Well,\" says the Loch Ness monster giantess. \"At least you tried a less provocative method of trying to escape for once.\" You stomp your fault. \"I swear,\" you say. \"If it's the last thing I do I'll get my revenge on that Demona! I'll never be able to escape with her big blue butt on my back all the time.\" \"Wade,\" says Lockette. \"Didn't Destiny warn you that she'd boil you alive if she heard you calling her \"Demona\" again. She's getting really sick of that nickname.\" \"Well it's her fault for looking the way she does. All she needs is that stupid tiara. Damn! I've got to find a way to get past that bitch. Every time I've tried to escape, she's shot my attempt down. Just yesterday she ruined my rocket to the moon plan.\" \"You tried to build a rocket out of a beer bottle. Boy did Destiny chew that guard on Level 1 out for sneaking booze into Under Gloom.\" You then bang your head against a bar. \"If only there was some way I could get back at Destiny for all the hell she's given me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're trying to think, you hear wheels moving. It was the day of the week where one of the guards brought books to the prisoners. Not that you were interested in anything. This week it was Icy's turn and she wheeled the cart in as Lockette looked at the choice of books. \"Hmm, which of these looks interesting, Wade.\" You let out a scoff. \"You're an idiot, Lockette. Wasting time reading instead of trying to bust out.\" Lockette browsed through the books. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"Don't you have any new Cadence Deadman books? Or anything by Olga Rowling?\" You roll your eyes but then you notice something and climb up Lockette's tail and slide down her neck and see one book in particular that stands out. It was a dusty book wrapped in mummy gauze with an angry face on the spine. The spine read \"The Catalog of 1000 Curses\". \"Lockette!\" you yell. \"That book over there!\" Lockette noticed the Catalog and realized something. \"How did that book get in...\" \"Who cares!?\" Lockette shrugs her shoulder and takes out the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette then holds up the book and blows off the dust as Icy leaves. In the process, Icy unknowingly drops her cellphone. Lockette looks through the book and is shocked. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said. \"This is a magic catalog. It says here that all you must do is call the number on the first page and tell them the curse you want cast on your enemy.\" You give a smirk. You look in to see that there are some particularly nasty curses in this book. \"This is perfect,\" you say. \"Perfect.\" Lockette just raises an eyebrow. \"There's just one problem? We don't have a phone.\" You then notice Icy's phone on the ground. \"Icy dropped her phone!\" you yell. \"Grab it you reptilian cretin!\" Lockette let out a sigh. \"He treats me like a dog,\" she thinks to herself. \"But he's the one who barks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette grabs the phone with her tail and pulls it into her cell. \"Game over, Destiny,\" you say wickedly. \"It's time for revenge. But which curse.\" \"I don't know Wade. A lot of these curses are nasty. First there's Curse #29: Yo Mama. The target of this curse for every time they hear a joke beginning with \"Yo Mama So Stupid\", the target will perform the action mentioned in the joke and progressively get stupider. Note: This curse only works if the target is indeed a mother.\" You let out a laugh. \"Perfect. Destiny's a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Wade, there's more curses. Such as Curse #10: Junk in the Trunk. This curse will cause the target's rear end to rapidly expand and become larger.\" That sounded good to you too. Which curse sounded better?</span></div></div>",

There is a slight ringing and then you hear a female voice. \"Catalog of 1000 Curses. How may I help you?\" You give an evil smirk. \"There's a curse that I want placed on Warden Destiny Sirtis of Under Gloom. Give me Curse #29.\" Lockette shakes her head. \"This doesn't sound free to me,\" she thinks to herself. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Destiny was walking down the hall. \"Wade's escape attempts aren't nearly as offensive as the credit he's giving my intelligence,\" says Destiny. \"If he thinks that I'm going to believe ay of his lies, he has another thing coming.\" Destiny then hears a growl and realizes that it's coming from Cree who is walking down the hall. \"Eyes open as always, Cree,\" said Destiny. \"No prisoner with any common sense would break free with a brute like you walking the halls.\" However, Destiny notices that Cree is in a bad mood for some reason. \"What's the matter, Cree?\" Cree let out a growl. \"It's that idiot sister of mine.\" Destiny rolls her eyes. \"Don't get me started,\" she says. \"Fortuna drives me crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree grit her teeth. \"Easy for you to say. Summer called earlier this morning for whatever reason and...\" \"Why did she call you so early?\" \"I don't know,\" says Cree. \"I didn't get to answer the phone. Aurelia beat me to it and as usual, Summer became enraged.\" Destiny rolled her eyes at that thought. \"Your wife and your sister just can't seem to get along. Sure, I'm not much for that brother-in-law of mine but with Aurelia and Summer, it's all out war.

What Destiny doesn't realize is that she's trying to use the key used to turn on her car in an attempt to unlock her front door. Destiny soon becomes too enraged to speak as she keeps trying the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to melt you down and make you into...!\" Destiny then sees that the car is her car key and groaned before she used the correct key to unlock her door. \"Idiot keys!\" she yells.

It\u2019s about time that you ate something that takes more than a minute to prepare.\u201d Destiny lets out a sigh. \u201cAlright. But I\u2019m preparing dessert.\u201d Fate and Destiny entered the kitchen and then Fate gets to work chopping up a swordfish. She then sniffed the fish and poured some alcohol onto it. In the background, Destiny was rooting through the lazy Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Mom,\u201d says Fate. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you seem extra stressed lately.

I\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to believe anything that comes out of his lying mouth.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why you put up with him,\u201d said Fate as she continued to stir the seafood bisque. \u201cIf he causes you that much stress, why don\u2019t you just feed him to one of your more unpleasant inmates.\u201d Destiny lets out a scoff as she puts some flower on the table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I do that?\u201d she asked sarcastically. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an idiot! That\u2019s why!\u201d Fate just rolls her eyes. \u201cAll that stress isn\u2019t good for you. I wonder how Aurelia\u2019s doing. I\u2019ll bet that Cree\u2019s gonna be surprised.\u201d Fate laughed at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Fate wasn\u2019t laughing at dinner time because Destiny repeatedly tried to eat her soup with a knife and was becoming increasingly frustrated as she kept trying. \u201cUh,\u201d said Fate. \u201cNot to sound preachy, Mom, but shouldn\u2019t you be trying to use a spoon? I\u2019d say it would be easier.\u201d Destiny realized her mistake and grumbled but instead of heeding her daughter's advise, she simply put the bowl to her face and drank it. Fate rolled her eyes and ate her own dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Destiny brought out a sponge cake for dessert and cut Fate a slice. \"Thanks, Mom. Man, this is going to taste so good.\" Fate took the first bite of cake and then her eyes popped out of her head as she gagged. \"Ugh! Gross!\" Fate coughed and spat up bits of yellow kitchen sponge. Fate then picked up one of the pieces and gagged. \"Mom,\" she said. \"Did you use actual sponges for the cake?\" Destiny looked at the inside of the rest of the cake and gasped. She reached in and even pulled out some steel wool. \"Good grief!\" she yelled. Fate made a face of disgust. \"That is so nasty. Did you use these things to clean the kitchen or the bathroom?\" Fate then choked slightly, reached into her mouth and pulled out a pair of brown shorts. \"I don't even want to know why these were in there. Mom, are you alright?\" Destiny slapped herself in the face. \"I don't know, Fate. What possessed me to do such a stupid thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then a knock on the door and Destiny went to answer it but she tried to push on the door rather than pulling it and was grunting as she tried in vain to open it. Fate let out a sigh. \"Uh, Mom. You're doing it wrong.\" Destiny grumbled and then opened the door. Into the house walked Fate's friend and coworker, Beth Forte. Beth was a type of hippopotamus-like monster called a behemoth. She was 1000ft tall like Fate and Destiny and had tan yellow skin with long light brown hair and was just as fat as Fate was, though that had more to do with Beth's species. At that moment, Beth was wearing a black t-shirt and red jacket along with a tight pair of jeans that and a belt that did nothing to hide the skull tattoo on one of her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fate,\" said Beth. \"I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by.\" \"Hi, Beth.\" Said Fate with a sigh. Beth spotted the cake on the table and licked her lips. \"That looks good.\" Beth picked up the whole cake and was about to bite into it when Fate stopped her. \"Don't eat that! It's not edible!\" Beth put the cake down and then saw Destiny get out a broom as she grunted. \"You could've at least wiped your feet before you walked in, Beth.\" Destiny grumbled and tried to sweep the dirt but was holding the broom upside down to the concern of her daughter and Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth couldn\u2019t help but stare at Destiny. \u201cFate,\u201d says Beth. \u201cIs your mom feeling okay?\u201d Fate scratched her head. \u201cShe has been acting weird today. She went outside with a bowl looking for chili, tried to change the channels with the phone and then she made a spongecake using actual kitchen sponges.\u201d Beth then spotted Destiny using soda to water a potted plant. \u201cI see,\u201d said the hippopotamus-like giantess. \u201cFate, did you hear that stress destroys brain cells? I think that dealing with Wade all day is making your mom dumber.\u201d Suddenly, the lightbulb burnt out. Destiny let out a grumble and then took out a package of batteries as she tried to stick them in the socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" said Fate. \"Mom, I think you should take a few days off.\" \"I'm not ain't isn't stupid, Fate!\" said Destiny. \"Wade ain't the boss of me, I'm the boss of him! I can work all 32 hours a day if I has to!\" Fate was now more concerned than ever and she and Beth each took Destiny by the hand. \"Let go of me,\" said Destiny. \"I'm ferfectly pine.\" \"We're taking you to a doctor, Mom,\" said Fate. \"You're stressed out.\" Beth let out a sigh. \"I never have these issues with my mother.\" Beth and Fate come to a traffic light that reads \"Don't Walk\" and had to wait as they were taking Destiny to the hospital. Beth then spotted a vending machine. \"I'm going to get us some drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth waddled to the vending machine and bought three bottles of a drink labeled Polter Cola.\" Of course, immediately afterwards a rather nasty looking gremlin came up and saw the machine empty. \"Hey fatso!\" he yelled at Beth. \"What's the idea taking the last bottle of Polter Cola in the machine?!\" \"Chill out,\" said Beth. \"Just get a bottle of Orange Crash or something. I was just buying drinks for me and my friends.\" \"Butt cheeks don't count as friends you obese pachyderm!\" \"Bitter attitude,\" said Beth. \"It's people like you who are ruining society.\" \"It's mothers like yours that are ruining society.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth then loses her temper and puts the bottles of soda into her cleavage before looking down at her antagonist. \"What did you say?!\" she asked angrily. \"You heard me, lard butt.

The door opens and reveals a purple-skinned metallic young man with short brown hair and bright green eyes. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d asks Mangaga mistaking the real Dr. Madman for an impostor. \u201cDo you have any idea how much trouble it is to hire a Dr. Madman impersonator? Come in.\u201d Dr. Madman gives an evil face that would make Mr. Hyde blush as he follows his oblivious enemy into the hotel room. \u201cSo what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d he asks sarcastically. \u201cYou the birthday boy?\u201d Mangaga lets out a sigh. \u201cWell, you\u2019re eager for the job. Look. I\u2019m a bounty hunter and Mrs. X hired me to catch Dr. Madman and hand him over to the police. Can you believe the twerp is worth 10 mil? Anyhow, I haven\u2019t had much luck catching the real Dr. Madman. That\u2019s where you come in. I turn you in and I give you 10% of the bounty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Madman then smirks. \u201cI see. Uh, won\u2019t Mrs. X realize that I\u2019m not Dr. Madman?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why you have to be as convincing as possible. Dr. Madman does a lot of things that people hate.\u201d \u201cYou mean like this?\u201d Dr. Madman then takes a hammer out of his belly bag and hits Mangaga in the shin, making him scream in pain and then grit his teeth. \u201cNot bad,\u201d he grunts. \u201cBut you have to be more obnoxious. Dr. Madman is the most annoying mad scientist on the planet. But above all, he thinks he\u2019s really funny. Say something insulting.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d says Dr. Madman. \u201cWant to see a photograph of the ugliest guy in the world?\u201d Dr. Madman takes out a mirror and shows it to Mangaga. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d says the bounty hunter. \u201cBut it\u2019s still not enough. Say something <i>really</i> insulting.\u201d Dr. Madman then turns to the camera and laughs \u201cMwah Ha Ha Ha!\u201d before clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it comes,\u201d says Beth as she laughs and watches the Dr. Madman cartoon. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna let him have it.\u201d \u201cYo Mama so stupid,\u201d says Dr. Madman in the video. \u201c....\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just came to see if either you or Lockette have seen a certain book.\" \"Book?\" asks Lockette nervously. \"Yes,\" says Destiny. \"Apparently somehow a catalogue of evil curses slipped through security. It's useless without a cellphone, something that the inmates aren't likely to have, but I'm not taking any chances. Have either of you seen the book.\" You just blow out your tongue. \"Do I look like I read any of the boring books your guards bring in. Ask Lockette, she's the one who wanted to read Jane Eerie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny glares at Lockette who is shaking nervously. \"Unlike Wade,\" says Destiny. \"I know I can trust you, Lockette. Did you see that catalogue.\" \"Uh, no ma'am.\" Destiny just raises her brow horns before the gargoyle turns around. \"I hope you're telling the truth. If I find out you're lying, you're both in the soup.\" With that, Destiny walks away, not noticing that her skirt looks tighter on her and her hips seem rounder. You just give Destiny the finger the moment she has her back turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny retreats into her office and plops down on her seat as she lets out a groan. \"Whoever put that catalogue in with the prison's books is so fired. We can't have spell books in a prison. It's a threat to security. Dammit.\" Suddenly, Destiny's cell phone rang. Destiny checked the caller I.D. to see that it was her younger sister, Fortuna. \"Ugh. What now? Hello, Fortuna. You do realize that I'm at work don't you? What? You're in Fearfield for the opera. What about David and Pearl? Sick as dogs.\" Destiny grunted and put her hand over the phone. \"They're faking it,\" she muttered to herself. \"I know those two all too well.\" Destiny then clears her throat, not noticing that her ass appears to be stretching and getting bigger. \"Alright. I'll meet you after I get out of work today.\" Destiny hung up and let out a sigh. \"That Desdemona is a real pain in the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Destiny could finish her sentence, she grunts and lands on the ground with a crash. Her chair had broken beneath her and she let out a grumble as she felt her butt in pain, not realizing that each cheek was as big as a basketball. The gargoyle giantess ignored it and simply decided to go on with the rest of her day. Much later, Destiny was getting ready to leave when she grumbled and tried to squeeze her way out of the office. Her ass had gotten so big that she was stuck right before she squeezed her way out the door and broke the hinges. Belladonna noticed this and gave a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My,\" she says. \"There's a lot of junk in that trunk.\" Destiny holds out her claws and intimidates Belladonna. \"Don't flatter yourself, Belladonna.\" Destiny walks away and Belladonna sees that the gargoyle's ass is getting so large that her tail looks like a piece of blue spaghetti. Outside of the prison, Fortuna was waiting for Destiny. She was a brown-skinned gargoyle with curved horns like that of a ram and long blonde hair with pink membranes on her wings. Fortuna was slightly shorter than Destiny and was more pear-shaped and chubby in body. She was looking for her watch. \"I wonder what's taking that sister of mine so... long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny walks out and Fortuna looks in surprise because Destiny's ass was now as big as...</span></div></div>",

It had even managed to become as tall as her, the top of her cheeks reaching the top of her head. It was even touching the ground. Her hips and thighs had also blown up to accomidate her gargantuan ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny tried to walk foward, but the sheer size and weight of her butt sent her falling foward and faceplanting on the ground. She tried to get up, but her massive butt was just too heavy. She was pinned to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny sighed. \"Fortuna, could you go into the prison and grab Aria for me? And have her bring Wade and Lockette. We need to talk.\" She said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Fortuna and Aria were leading Lockette out of the prison. Aria was holding you tight. You and Lockette were brought to Destiny's front, where she could see them. She was still pinned to the ground. From the looks of it, her butt had stopped growing, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lockette,\" Destiny began calmly. \"You lied to me, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette sadly nodded. \"It was Wade's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gathered that.\" Destiny replied. \"How did you even call to curse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icy dropped her phone. And I'm not the one who cursed you.\" Lockette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've figured. Lockette, I'm dissapointed. You're a model inmate, and yet you do this? I have no choice but to punish you. You're going to be spending one week in the Pit. However, since you are a model inmate, I'll have Clover bring back the book cart, and you can pick the book YOU want.\" Destiny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette nodded.

And please don't pick any curse books this time.\" Aria says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette looks over the books and sees one. \"'Cabin of Blood' by Ivy Noroi. I thought she mostly wrote fantasy novels.\" Lockette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria just shrugs. \"I think I heard something about her branching out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll take this.\" Lockette says. She then turns and walks over to the pool of water to read. As she did, Aria noticed something: it seemed that Lockette's butt was slightly bigger then normal. Raising an eyebrow, she called for Icy to come and pick her and the cart up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack above the Pit, Aria turns to Icy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find that book of curses?\" Aria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy nodded and handed her the book. Aria took it and immediatly began flipping through the pages. Due to what happened to Destiny, she immediatly found which curse she was looking for. When she read the curse effects, her eyes widened. She then started for the vice wardens office.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nBelladonna was watching a monitor in her office when Aria walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Aria?\" Belladonna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may want to hear this. It's the curse cataloge that got in by mistake. Destiny was hit with curse number 10, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria was cut off by Belladonna's laughing. \"I've read that book! 10 is Junk in the Trunk!

Destiny\u2019s ass was so large at this point that it made the tow truck look like a construction crane carrying a wrecking ball. The Gashadokuro driver can barely hold back himself from laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d grumbles Destiny. \u201cIt\u2019s a curse. Ugh. I hate you, Wade. I\u2019ve never been so humiliated in all my life.\u201d You then bite Destiny and make her grunt in pain as you\u2019re wedged deep between her car-sized butt cheeks. Destiny grits her teeth in rage as Fortuna rolls her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that little twerp got his hands on that catalogue of curses. Now I\u2019m going to be stuck with this big blue wrecking ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna gave a laugh. \u201cYou look even bigger than that mngwa friend of Maggie\u2019s.\u201d Destiny just holds up her claws at her sister who steps back. \u201cGeez,\u201d says Destiny. \u201cYou\u2019re in a black mood all of a sudden, Demona.\u201d Even though you were trapped in the gorge that was Destiny\u2019s butt crack, you couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the fact that Fortuna addressed Destiny by the same nickname as you do.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d yells Destiny as she slaps her own ass, squeezing you in the process. Fortuna rolls her eyes and smirks. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re still single.\u201d She says. \u201cLet\u2019s just get on with the stupid concert you dragged me into because your husband and daughter turned it down.\u201d Grunts Destiny. Destiny at this point is trying to walk on her own two feet, forcing you to grab the walls of blue flesh to keep from being anal-vored by your gargoyle captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny and Fortuna are walking towards their seats and the sheer size of Destiny\u2019s monstrous booty is catching a lot of attention, even causing a wolf whistle from an actual werewolf. Destiny\u2019s eyes glow red with rage as one male gargoyle is about to tap her can. \u201cTouch it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be playing Captain Hook in the Peter Pan play at Fagerbakke Theater.\u201d The male gargoyle immediately changes his mind and steps back. Destiny lets out a sigh and groans. Because of the sheer size of her ass, she ends up taking up 12 seats. As Destiny crosses her arms and Fortuna takes her seat next to her sister, three women consisting of a behemoth, wererhinoceros and minotaur take their seats and give a glare. \u201cLook at her,\u201d scoffs the behemoth. \u201cThat\u2019s totally fake.\u201d Destiny grunts and then rolls her eyes just as the concert is about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of it it appears to be a mangled version of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 5. You can somehow hear the music through Destiny\u2019s enormous ass cheeks and since you need your arms to stop yourself from sinking in deeper, you can hear every note. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this family? Desdemona out there has bad taste.\u201d The concert lasts for 3 hours and your ears are practically bleeding. Outside, Destiny\u2019s ass appears to have gotten slightly bigger and she is shaking her head. \u201cIt was okay, I guess. Of course, I can see why David and Pearl wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they were missing.\u201d Says Fortuna smugly as she keeps poking Destiny in the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny grits her teeth and then she hears a spraying sound. She turned her head to see a sukeban kappa girl running away, having spray-painted kabuki makeup on Destiny\u2019s ass. Destiny gave a groan as Fortuna had to wipe the makeup off. \u201cHow did Wade pull this curse off? He never seemed like the sorcerer type.\u201d \u201cHe got his hands on dangerous contraband. Ugh. I can\u2019t wait to punish him severely when I get home.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of home,\u201d said Fortuna. \u201cI gotta get to the bus station and head back to Dreadberry. See you later, Big Sister. Just wait until I tell Pearl about her aunt\u2019s huge ba...\u201d \u201cGoodbye, Fortuna.\u201d Says Destiny angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fortuna is walking away, you manage to squeeze an opening in between Destiny\u2019s cheeks. Just before the flesh closes, you see that Fortuna\u2019s ass looks fleshier and bigger, albeit not as big as Destiny\u2019s was right now. But before you can think anymore on the manner, you\u2019re pressed once again between Destiny\u2019s ginormous blue cheeks. Destiny was trying to maintain her balance as she walked down the street. At one point she had to grab a street lamp in order to better position herself. As Destiny is holding onto the street lamp, three male teenage monsters see her and throw money at her to her annoyance. \u201cDamn Wade,\u201d thought Destiny to herself. \u201cNow I look like a cheap stripper. I hope he slips down so far that he gets stuck forever. Note to self, Destiny, stop off at Taco Hell on the way home. That\u2019ll fix him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Destiny\u2019s cellphone was ringing and Destiny groaned because her phone was in her back pocket and she was having trouble reaching it over all that ass. Not that the ringing was doing you any good because you were being shook up in between Destiny\u2019s cheeks due to the phone vibrating. Not that you could see it, but the caller I.D. was Aria, which meant the call was probably important. While Destiny was trying to get to her phone, Fortuna at this point was on the next bus heading back to Dreadberry and was listening to her iPod. As she was sitting in her seat, a chubby black furred werejaguar girl with brown spots and yellow-green hair playing a video game in the seat to the side of the gargoyle woman, failed to notice her own ass was getting bigger. The bus driver was a tan-skinned and blonde-haired elf girl with purple ears and a pair of rounded glasses and her ass was getting bigger as well. It would seem the curse would soon be wreaking havoc in Dreadberry as well as Fearfield.</span></div></div>",

She tries to get out of the bus, but her butt at this point was as big as Destiny's and she was having trouble. \"Oh!\" yells Fortuna. \"Oh, come on! I knew I was putting on weight lately, but not as much as Destiny. Ugh!\" The bus driver kicks Fortuna's rear and causes her to stumble out of the bus. Fortuna wobbles slightly before she repositions herself. \"I feel dizzy,\" she says. \"Almost like how Destiny was acting when that jerk made her butt swell up.\" Fortuna gave an uncontrolled laugh to herself. \"It was so big that it made Michelle's behind look small. And that's saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna then tries to flap her wings in order to fly but she can only get one foot off of the ground before she collapses and grunts, creating a small earthquake in the process. \"What the?\" asks Fortuna. The brown-skinned blonde gargoyle then lets out a sigh. \"Heck,\" she says. \"I needed the exercise anyway.\" Fortuna puts her headphones back in and then jogs down the street, not realizing that her butt was so enormous and that it seemed to still be growing, as if the spell spread and got stronger. Unfortunately, Fortuna was about to unintentionally spread the curse to everyone she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she passed by a large and fat golden furred werecheetah who was wearing a blue bikini with white star prints and a red headband that made her look like a feline Wonder Woman. She passed by licking a popsicle as Fortuna passed by her. \"Hey, Barbara Anne.\" Says Fortuna. The cheetah woman then gives a grunt and accidentally swallows her popsicle in one gulp as she turns around and sees Fortuna's rear obscuring the rest of her body. \"Holy minotaur,\" says the cheetah woman. \"Fortuna must've been hanging around her sister-in-law too much. Wait, is Glutos Syndrome contagious?\" The cheetah shrugs her shoulders and walks away, not realizing her bikini bottom seemed even tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna then passed two monster girls hiding in the bushes. One of which was a pink-furred baku, a tapir-like Japanese yokai. From the waist down she was yellow and wore a bob haircut and magenta jacket. She was accompanied by a large red-furred minotaur with long black hair wearing a crimson jacket, beret and skirt. She paused to light a cigarette as the baku took out a camera. \"Are you sure this is going to work, Lily? I only came here because you said it would help me get my job at the Daily Tombstone back again.\" The minotaur girl then blew smoke out of her mouth. \"I'm positive,\" she says. \"Aliens are going around and stuffing our mailboxes with junk mail. I saw one the other day.\" As Lily was rambling, she and her baku companion failed to notice their butts were expanding out of the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna then passed by two more joggers. One of which was an obese werewolf woman resembling a humanoid collie and the other was a fat mummy girl wrapped in bright gold gauze up to her waist. Her dried out tanned skin and bluish black hair made her resemble a certain policewoman and her black shirt and red vest made the resemblance more uncanny. She also had hieroglyphs tattooed to her arms. \"Geez,\" says the mummy. \"Fortuna sure has been putting on weight lately.\" The wolf woman nods her head. \"Thank goodness is summer. We don't have to go to work, so we can keep ourselves from suffering that same fate.\" Both the mummy and werewolf let out a laugh, not realizing that their rears were expanding as well. The mummy girl's behind was getting so big that it was shredding her mummy wrappings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Fortuna passed the sheriff, an obese white-furred and blonde Nemean lioness who was wearing a bright green leotard with a red band around her left ankle. She was busy giving a parked car a ticket since it was next to a hydrant. As Fortuna passed by, the sheriff's rear started to expand faster and faster than the others, mainly because she was already quite bottom heavy. The lioness let out a sigh as she put the ticket on the car. She rubbed her brow because of the heat and turned around, accidentally crushing the illegally parked car with her now bigger behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Fortuna's battery in her iPod ran out and she turned around and gasped as she saw that her behind was as large as Destiny's and all the adult women in Dreadberry seemed to have been affected as well. \"Wait,\" says the younger Sirtis sister. \"Only Destiny was cursed by Wade. How could...? Uh-oh. It must've been contagious. Oh boy. Maggie is going to give me an earful.\"</span></div></div>",

Belladonna had called a meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, everyone,\" Belladonna began. \"You've probably heard that we are going into lockdown. That's because we have reason to believe there's going to be an outbreak. Aria will explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, Aria stepped up. \"A while ago, inmates Wade Wilson and Lockette Ness used a book of curses,\" She pauses for a moment to raise the book up and show everyone. \"To put a curse on our Warden, Destiny. This curse has caused her butt to grow to immense sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inmates, and even some of the staff, began to laugh. \"ZIP IT!\" Belladonna yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria sighed. \"Unfortunately, there was fine print they missed, saying the curse had a 50 percent chance of being contagious. Miss Ness, would you come up here please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette had been brought out of the Pit for this, so she walked up to where Aria was. Everyone except Aria was surprised by her. In the time between going in the Pit and now, Lockette's ass had blown up to the size of yoga balls. Her hips and thighs were also swollen to accomidate her ass. And everyone could see it was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see,\" Aria began. \"Lockette is under the effects of the curse. Most likely, all of us will be getting giant butts soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was a ripping sound. Everyone turned and saw that Bebe's butt had begun to outgrow her uniform. Another rip turned their attention to Arethusa. More and more rips started to sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was quick.\" Aria said as she felt her own butt begin to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, listen up.\" Belladonna said, trying to ignore her own growing rear. \"A guard will be assigned to two of you. They will keep an eye on you to make sure this curse doesn't harm you. You are all to return to your cells now. Also, the Doctor will be avalible for check-ups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't she get cursed too?\" Lockette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think expansion curses affect inorganic monsters.\" Belladonna said. She then turned to the guards. \"Alright, I'm splitting you guys up. Cree, you have Persephone, Yuri, and Mariah. There's 11 inmates, so I need one guard for 3 inmates. Clover, you have Cornelia and Priscilla. Icy, you've got Elaine and Darcy. Simone, you're dealing with Ariel and Bebe. And Aria, you're watching Ursula and Arethusa. I'll keep an eye on Lockette. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Janice and Sakuya?\" Aria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot about Janice. Clover will take her. And Sakuya was transfered to another prison weeks ago.\" Belladonna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go.\" Belladonna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards went to get their inmates as Belladonna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a long day.\" She said.<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\nAlright, now who do we follow?</span></div></div>",

Of course, you were still stuck between the former's monuments butt cheeks that at this point seemed bigger than before and Destiny could barely move under the weight of her own behind. Her loincloth was even shredded, exposing her panties and even then they were barely visible through all that blue flesh. Needless to say, Destiny's big booty was not something that could be ignored and the humiliated gargoyle was attracting many stares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, needless to say, Destiny's anger was boiling over. \"**** you, Wade,\" mutters Destiny. \"This is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me.\" Destiny then hears a camera go off but her butt is too enormous for her to turn her head and see who took the photograph. \"Alright,\" she mutters. \"Who's the dead man with the camera?!\" Fortuna can't help but laugh at her sister's rage. \"Don't encourage them, Fortuna!\" yells Destiny. Fortuna just continues to laugh as Destiny grows more and more enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a muffled laugh from inside your fleshy prison and Destiny grits her teeth. \"Wade,\" she says. \"As soon as we get home, you are in for the most horrid form of pain.\" \"Blah, blah, blah. Blow it, Demona!\" Destiny starts to squeeze together her butt cheeks as Fortuna continues to laugh herself silly. \"I swear on your mother's grave, Wade, I'm going to crush you!\" You just bite a wall of Destiny's flesh and she grunts in pain as she grows more and more furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out, Demona.\" Says Fortuna mockingly. Destiny just holds her claws dangerously close to her sister's neck. Fortuna is unfazed and simply smirks at her. \"You know, Destiny. Mom always said that short temper of yours would get you into trouble.\" \"Shut up, Fortuna.\" Destiny then grunts and hears a squeaking noise and then she realizes that some punk tengu kid had used a magic marker to draw graffiti all over her rear end; including an angry face, a skull and crossbones and even a spiral leaf symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny turns around and roars in absolute rage as the kid runs off laughing at her and in the process, she accidentally knocks over a large truck with her behind. Upon realizing this, Destiny's blue-skin starts to turn pink in the (face) cheeks and she lets out a groan. To make matters worse, nearby there is a chalk white-skinned vampiress with half her face burned off and golden blonde hair who was holding up an umbrella in one hand and an iPhone in the other. She spots Destiny and gives a smirk as she takes a photograph. \"Wait'll Lexi sees this,\" she says as she leaves the scene. \"Heck, wait until Fate sees this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Fortuna and Destiny return to the latter's house and Destiny struggles to fit her titanic booty through the doorway. This causes you distress as well because Destiny's butt is being squeezed and it's making your prison of cellulite tighter and you grunt while Fortuna is trying to push her sister's huge butt into her house. \"Could you please hurry up?\" Grunts Destiny. \"I'm trying,\" grunts Fortuna. \"But I feel like Sisyphus. Of course, Sisyphus never had to push a boulder made out of cellulite and pizza dough. Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna manages to push her older sister inside, causing the extremely bottom-heavy blue gargoyle to fall flat on her face. Destiny struggles to stand up as Fortuna gets up herself. \"Geez,\" says Fortuna. \"That is one powerful curse.\" Destiny feels all around her booty and then manages to find you and pulls you out as you're gasping for air. \"I am going to pulverize you for this, bug!\" yells Destiny. You just stick your tongue out as Destiny's eyes glow red with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Fortuna shakes her head and heads for the kitchen. \"I better get you some dinner, Destiny. You seem flustered. Maybe... ooof!\" Suddenly, Fortuna stops in her tracks and it appears that her butt has gotten stuck in the doorway leading to the kitchen. \"What the?\" Fortuna grunts and tries to shake her butt out. Both you and Destiny look in surprise and then the telephone rings. In her attempt to reach the phone, Destiny's enormous behind knocks over and breaks her television, prompting her to curse under her breath as she answers the phone. \"Hello?\" asks Destiny in an annoyed tone. \"Uh, Destiny,\" says Belladonna. \"How's tricks?\" \"What the **** do you want, Belladonna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone, Belladonna's butt had gotten so big that she was using it as an impromptu chair. \"Well, as it turns out, that curse Wade put on you that made your keister so enormous has a 50% chance of spreading to other women.\" \"What?!\" yells Destiny. \"Don't tell me...?!\" Fortuna gives a gasp as she overhears and then sees her loincloth tearing apart, revealing that she had apparently chosen to go commando underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny glares at you. \"You really did it this time, Wilson! I'm going to... urk!\" Fortuna's butt grows at such a rate that it presses against Destiny's own and soon Fortuna's booty is...</span></div></div>",

It was twice Destiny's height and Fortuna's tail was so undersized, it looked like a piece of copper spaghetti. Fortuna turned and saw her butt and then let out a groan while Destiny gave a broken looking smile. It was half a smile of amusement at her sister's condition and half a smile of fury at what you had done. You were now very afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my butt!\" yells Fortuna. \"It looks like it belongs on a splintercat with nebutori. Oh! It would take a car carrier to get me back to Dreadberry.\" Fortuna then screams because Destiny scratches her butt while pressing her own massive booty against it. \"Karma really is a funny thing, isn't it Little Sister,\" Destiny says. \"You usually always have something to laugh about, but it looks like the joke's on you this time.\" Fortuna blushes and bites her lip. \"Oh,\" says Destiny. \"But this shouldn't be a problem to a stay-at-home mom like you who doesn't have to go anywhere. Besides, something tells me, you and David are going to be <i>much</i> more active than ever in the bedroom.\" Destiny then gives a laugh that actually irritates her sister. \"Shut up, Destiny!\" yells Fortuna in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is embarrassing!\" Destiny gives a trolling smirk. \"Perfect choice of words, Fortuna.\" As Destiny is laughing, you try to slip out of her blue clawed fingers but the blue gargoyle squeezes you as Fortuna is struggling to hold up her titanic booty. \"This sucks!\" yells Fortuna. \"I already had a bubble butt brought on by marriage and motherhood. But why would this happen to me!? <i>You</i> were the one who got cursed!\" Destiny then gives a growl. \"Apparently the little twerp didn't read the fine print. \"This curse is contagious.\" Fortuna gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" says Belladonna still on the phone. \"Is anyone still there?\" \"Well, Belladonna,\" says Destiny. \"You weren't kidding. Fortuna's badonk is twice as big as mine.\" \"Uh, yeah, about that. As the curse spreads to different women, the effects get stronger. Each time the curse spreads to a different butt, the size increase is more and more extreme.\" Fortuna crosses her arms and leans back. \"****.\" She mutters before gasping as she just swore. Then Fortuna realized something. \"Oh my Greg!\" she shouts. \"If that curse really is contagious, I can't go back to Dreadberry now! The last thing we need is for this curse to spread beyond Fearfield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny glares at you. \"This is all your fault Wade.\" \"Cry me a river, Demona,\" you say. \"You and Desdemona over there better just suck it up.\" Destiny's eyes glow red with rage and even Fortuna looks ticked off. \"You were right, Sis,\" says Fortuna. \"He is <i>so</i> annoying! And now he's gotten me in the crossfire of your antagonistic relationship.\" \"Well, Sis,\" says Destiny. \"This calls for a tag team punishment.\" Fortuna's eyes turn red as well as you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it...</span></div></div>",

Every step she took caused her rear to bounce. Every minute, she would feel her butt to confirm it was real, and not a delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cell, Elaine and Darcy were just as bloated. Darcy's behind was as big as the mattress in the cell, and Elaine was actually pinned under her car sized ass.

The first was Ursula Minor, a titanic grizzly werebear with long brown hair worn in a ponytail and her left eye missing from its socket. Ursula was a terrorist who led an anti-fairy rebellion when the new governor was elected and had a vicious hatred of all monsters that belonged to the fairy family. She was eventually caught, but she took down several police officers before she finally went down. Her butt had expanded until it reached her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could be said of the other Dark Sider assigned to Aria. Her name was Arethusa Dragneel, prison number 101. She was an orange-brown-skinned European dragoness with long blonde hair. She was a maniac who was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for building, using and selling bombs that were used for murder. She was infamous for her fiery temper and unfortunately, Ursula was one of her customers. It didn't help that Aria had chosen to lock them both in the same cell to keep a closer eye on them. Aria's butt had swelled so big that the ghost woman was virtually immobile. She could still make herself intangible, but was too heavy to levitate herself. She kept a close eye on the bear and dragon giantesses who were growling at each other and crossed her arms as she used her behind as a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArethusa breathed fire and torched Ursula's backside, making the bear woman roar. \"That's for stiffing me on the last bomb I sold you! You owed me a million skulls.\" Ursula took a swipe at Arethusa's face but was too bottom heavy to reach close enough to actually hurt the dragon woman. \"That bomb of yours was a dud! All it did was blow off smoke.\" \"Because you tried to use it to blown up a boat! If I knew what you were going to use it for, you stupid old bear, I'd have waterproofed it.\" Ursula gives a growl. \"You dragons will always let the fey races dominate you. It's a wonder that your species is sapient while dinosaurs are only slightly higher up on the food chain as humans.\" Arethusa gives a snort. \"Oh, look at the queen of bears, acting so high and mighty. The only thing higher in the air than your stupid, blackberry-shaped nose, is your butt! I'd kick it if my own butt wasn't too heavy for me to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Arethusa and Ursula roared and it caused Aria to let out a shriek as her eyes glowed bright red. \"I'm warning you both, if you two make too much trouble, I'll sit on both of you until you're flatter than stamps.\" \"Butt out, you cow!\" yells Arethusa. Aria gives a growl and grits her teeth. \"What did you call me!?\" \"You heard her, ghost breath!\" yells Ursula. \"She called you a cow! So go away and graze on a field! You don't scare us!\" \"Yeah!\" yells Arethusa. \"You used to be human. The same species whose bones I use as toothpicks. I'd like to see you try something, you cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria gets really steamed and at that moment...</span></div></div>",

What if it turns Destiny into something more dangerous than a gargoyle?\" You let out a scoff. \"Oh please,\" you say. \"This is revenge. Dial the number, Lockette.\" Lockette rolled her eyes as she dialed on the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Destiny was in her office trying to open a jar of jalape\u00f1os. \"Damn these stupid jars,\" she says. \"Why do they have to make them so tight.\" Aria flies by the office and looks in surprise. \"I thought gargoyles hated jalape\u00f1os.\" Belladonna gave a scoff. \"Destiny and Fate love jalape\u00f1os. I'm pretty sure Fortuna does to.\" Destiny finally manages to tear the lid of the jar before she started to eat the jalape\u00f1os. \"Hey, Belladonna. Aria. Want one of these jalape\u00f1os?\" Belladonna shakes her hands. \"You couldn't pay me to eat one of those things. Why do you torture your tastebuds like that.\" Destiny gives a scoff and bites into the pepper before grunting as the spell is cast. Destiny feels her head just as the curse strikes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Warden?\" asks Aria. Destiny gives a scoff. \"It was probably just a bad pepper.\" Destiny continues to eat the peppers right before she finishes and begins to drink the brine as Belladonna and Aria look in disgust and walk away. \"No wonder she's got a hot temper,\" says Aria. \"Drinking that pepper juice can't be good for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Destiny is just about to leave when she realizes you're smiling at her rather smugly. Destiny glares at you and then she gestures that she's watching you right before she opens her wings in order to fly home. As she does this, she feels somewhat light-headed and gives a slight belch. \"Ugh,\" she says. \"I think I ate too many peppers. Well, that's what I get for being one of only three gargoyles in the world to like them. Other gargoyles just don't appreciate a good pepper.\" Destiny then gives a hiccup. \"But perhaps I shouldn't have pickled them first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny arrives home right before she unlocks the door and then cooks several gyros in the microwave for dinner. For some reason she's extra ravenous. It must've been a side effect of the curse. As she was eating, she was speaking on the phone with Fate. \"So they finally hired another night guard.\" \"That's right, Mom. They're going to break her in tomorrow.\" Destiny gives a scoff. \"I hope they hired another day guard. Sometimes I don't think Beth takes her job seriously. (Hic). Sorry about that Fate. For some reason, I've got quite an appetite.\" \"I hope you're eating something that takes more than a minute to cook. Don't forget Aunt Fortuna and her family are coming to Fearfield.\" Destiny lets out a sigh. \"What is that idiot sister of mine in town for this time?\" \"She said something about an art exhibition she wanted to see. And hey, she's nothing compared to Bona.\" Destiny grits her teeth. \"Don't mention that bastard in my presence, Fate.\" \"But aren't I...\" \"Poor choice of words!

Guess it's time to turn in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny went to bed not even knowing about the curse and as she sleeping, she underwent a strange transformation. The next morning, Destiny's alarm clock was ringing loudly right before Destiny smashed it. \"I hate mornings. This is why gargoyles are normally nocturnal.\" Destiny lets out a yawn and gets out of bed before she steps into the bathroom and starts brushing her teeth.

Her wings were gone and her tail was now very thick and fluffy. She looked at her hands and feet to see canine claws replaced her talons. The former gargoyle even felt her new snout in disbelief before she growled. \"I'm a werewolf!\" she yells in shock. \"How did?! Why did?! What did?!\" Suddenly Destiny gets an idea of what happened and growls furiously before she scratches the window with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WADE! I don't know hooooooooow he did it, but I know he did it!\" Destiny was so enraged she gave a loud howl that was caused her neighbor to hold his ears in pain. Although Destiny didn't see the neighbor, she heard what he was saying with her new wolf ears. \"That blasted gargoyle,\" he said to himself from offscreen. \"It's bad enough they let a woman be the warden but now she's got some blasted dog. Then again, I'm not surprised since only one man was stupid enough to touch her. It's about time she got the kind of male she deserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny overheard the man next door and growled. \"Shut up, Hal!\" yells the wolfified Destiny. \"At least <i>I</i> didn't marry a worthless leech!\" There is a slight beat before Destiny's neighbor speaks again. \"Can't argue with you there. But that is one <i>ugly</i> dog you have there!\" Destiny gives a growl and rolls up her sleeve before she goes next door and gives a rather angry roar that scares her neighbor into screaming and retreating into his house. Destiny goes back into her own house and scratches the refrigerator door before she takes out a large steak and bites into it, not even waiting to cook it first. Her new werewolf form was affecting her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the little twerp turn me into a werewolf?!\" yells Destiny. Destiny then gave a growl as the phone rang. \"What the **** do you want!?\" Destiny yells into the phone. \"My,\" said Fortuna's voice on the other end. \"Aren't we nasty today?\" \"Fortuna,\" says Destiny. \"This is really not a good time. Wade turned me into a werewolf!\" Fortuna laughs on the other side of the phone. \"Come on, Destiny. He can't do that.\" \"He just did!\" yells Destiny. \"Here!\" Destiny holds up her cellphone and takes a photograph of herself as a wolf and then sends it to her sister. \"Oh my. You weren't kidding. How did he do that? Wait until Pearl sees her Auntie D has turned into a wolf. Don't forget, we're coming over later. Don't worry, I'll stop at a butcher's shop before I get there. Werewolves eat a lot of red meat, you know. Also, I'd avoid silver and wolfsbane if I were you.\" Destiny growls at the other end of the phone and Fortuna hangs up. \"Oh boy, she's in a dark mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Under Gloom, Aria was flipping through that cursed catalogue. \"What are you looking at, Aria?\" asks Belladonna. \"This evil spell book got into the book cart by mistake,\" says Aria. \"It's a catalog of curses. Check out this curse it's flipped to. It says that anyone under this Species Swap curse will change into a different monster species from their original species every day when they wake up. Thankfully, I confiscated it before anyone could use it and that it's useless without a cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time back at her house empties out all the bacon she has onto a frying pan as she ferociously tries to cook it. However, she grows impatient and eats the bacon raw as she growls. \"Now only am I furious,\" she says. \"But I'm famished. Is this how Persephone feels all the time? No wonder werewolves eat so much.\" Destiny growls and then goes back to the fridge, but unfortunately for her there's only mushrooms and tomatoes and this enrages Destiny who howls loudly and then slams the door before pulling on her ears. \"Meat!\" yells the gargoyle-turned-werewolf. \"I need meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny growls and then leaves her house to head for....</span></div></div>",

When she remembers she doesn't have wings she growls to herself and starts walking. \"Can't believe this! Wade is gonna get it, but first I need some meat!\" she mutters to herself. Being a werewolf must be affecting her hunger. Now she can only think about having delicious juicy meat. \"Thank god I don't have a craving for humans.\" Being a gargoyle, she has a natural instinct to protect humans, it would be bad if she started eating them. although she might make an exception for Wade at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reaches the butcher shop and enters, causing the bell on the door to sound. The smell of meat hits her new wolf nose and she gets even hungrier. \"This can't be what werewolves go through everyday.\" she says to herself. \"It must be because these instincts are so new to me...\" From behind the counter the butcher, a tall dragon, waves at her. \"Hey there! What can I get ya?\" he asks. Destiny walks over and looks at the various meats on display behind the glass. \"Just...get me anything. Beef, chicken, it doesn't matter.\" she says. The dragon gives a laugh. \"I figured as much. Most werewolves aren't picky about their meat.\" he says as heads into the back. Destiny scowls when he says this and waits for him to return. While she waits the door opens again and a muscular werebear walks in. Upon seeing her he grins and approaches. \"Hey there, gorgeous.\" he says smoothly. Destiny glares at him. \"Whats a wolf as pretty as you doing here?\" He doesn't even notice that she's beginning to growl slightly. \"How about we get together and I'll give you a bone?\" He tries to places his paw on hers but then she grabs it in a flash. \"Hey! What the-?!\" he gasps as she squeezes harder and harder. She growls louder at him as she crushes his paw in her grip. When she finally lets go he rushes out in fear, nursing his appendage. \"Men...\" she mutters annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the butcher returns he has several bundles of meat wrapped up to go. As he places each one on a scale to weigh them he starts punching the price into his register. \"I heard the bell ring, did someone else come in?\" he asks. \"Yeah, but he had somewhere else to be.\" she says. He just shrugs as he bags up her meat. Destiny pays him and takes her order. \"Thanks for your business.\" he says. \"Too bad I don't carry humans, huh?\" She just shoots him a glare and walks out. \"Geez, she seems nice.\" he says sarcastically to himself. Once she's outside she pulls a piece of beef out and devours it raw. \"That hits the spot.\" she says, and starts to walk as she eats. Next...</span></div></div>",

I'm going to grind his bones and make them into gingerbread!\" Destiny tosses away several bones from her meat and continues to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Under Gloom, Belladonna is eating a breakfast burrito when she wipes off some meat from her lip. \"That's funny,\" she says. \"Usually, Destiny is at work by now. Hmm.\" Belladonna sneaks in to Destiny's office and locks it from the inside as she gives a sneaky laugh and kicks back in Destiny's chair. She reaches under the desk for Destiny's jalape\u00f1os and starts eating them one by one. She also notices that Destiny left her laptop computer on the desk and smirks as she turns it on. However, it comes up and requires a password. Belladonna ponders the password and then smirks as she types in \"F-A-T-E\" and then proceeds to look through Destiny's private photos. \"Hmm,\" says Belladonna. \"There's gotta be something hilarious in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in yours and Lockette's cell, Lockette gives a concerned look. \"Wade,\" says Lockette. \"Something tells me that Destiny knows you put a curse on her and bent her species.\" \"Good,\" you say with a smirk. \"I hope she turned into something really ugly. Come on, Lockette, aren't you curious as to what Demona turned into.\" \"But what if she got turned into something that preys on humans. She probably realized that it was you responsible.\" You just blow a raspberry when you hear a loud canine growling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" says Lockette. \"You don't suppose Persephone broke out, do you?\" Lockette screams and backs up as a wolf-shaped shadow appears in the hallway. You look and see that the shadow looks pudgier than Persephone and then your eyes pop as you see why. Destiny had arrived and she was pissed. All the meat she ate gave her a balloon belly and she was still chewing on a bone in her mouth before she growls at you. \"You sneaky son of a bachelorette!\" yells the wolfified Destiny. \"I knew you had something to do with this, you miserable piece of pest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Demona? Fleas?\" Destiny gives a growl. \"Because of you, I have a hunger for meat that I can't control!\" \"Oh, go blow down a house of bricks!\" Destiny glares at you and growls but then she grunts and holds her stomach as she looks at you. Lockette gives a gulp. \"Uh, Wade....\" Destiny is looking at you and drooling. \"Should I?\" thinks Destiny to herself. \"Or shouldn't I? He's the reason I'm in this mess. I'm a werewolf now and werewolves eat humans and boy does he deserve it. But I'm still a gargoyle on the inside. I can't eat him.

Just dial.\" Lockette lets out a sigh and dials on the phone before she holds it up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" says a female voice on the phone. \"How may I help you.\" \"I want curse #69, Gender Switch, placed on my most hated enemy; Warden Destiny T. Sirtis.\" You snicker to yourself as Lockette moans. \"Wade,\" she says. \"Not a good idea.\" Once your order is placed, you hang up on the phone and Lockette holds it down. She sees Icy coming and then throws the catalog to the side as Icy goes to get her phone back. \"Uh,\" says Lockette. \"Lose something, Icy?\" Icy lets out a sigh. \"Thank goodness,\" she says. \"That phone is new.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"Now get lost, Articuno.\" Icy gives a scoff and storms away with her phone. \"Aren't we a Mr. Sassy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give an evil smirk as the curse will take effect soon. Later the day goes on like any other prison day, except that you decide not to try and escape at all, something Destiny takes notice. She watches you like a hawk for the rest of the day and is puzzled when you don't make a move. Soon, it's time for her to punch out and the warden is somewhat suspicious. \"Belladonna,\" she says. \"Wade didn't try to escape even once today. He's up to something, I just know it.\" \"You're just being paranoid, Demona.\" Destiny just holds up her claws and even seems to give Belladonna the finger. \"Between you and Wade,\" she says. \"It's a wonder I haven't been committed to the KDP by now.\" With that, Destiny walks away and Belladonna gives a smirk. \"Now there's an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Destiny returns to her house and is in bed snoozing away, unaware that a transformation is taking place. The next morning, the gargoyle's alarm clock rings and Destiny slams down on it as she gets up and lets out a deeper yawn than usually. Destiny then stumbles into the bathroom in order to brush her fangs, but then she looks in the mirror to make a startling discovery. The spell had worked and Destiny was now a muscular male gargoyle, complete with slightly shorter hair and what looked like stubble on her or rather his chin. The newly transmogrified Destiny was so horrified that he felt his chest and groin area just to confirm he wasn't dreaming before he gave a loud scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now male Destiny dropped his jaw and looked in horror at what happened. \"What the hell!? I'm a guy!? How did...\" Suddenly, Destiny realized something and then grit his teeth. His eyes glowed bright but instead of being red like they usually are, Destiny's eyes glowed pitch white as he realized what happened. \"When in doubt, blame Wade!

Destiny ain't getting any younger, that's for sure.\" As Belladonna laughed to herself, she was sketching a rather unflattering drawing of Destiny that appeared to be drawing her as a cross between a gargoyle and a cow. \"Everyone on the outside is afraid of her. Can you believe it. I work with her everyday and I know for a fact that Destiny is nothing more than a complete and utter...\" \"A complete and utter what?\" asks a confused voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna stops and then looks in horror as Destiny enters the office. Normally Destiny would be triggered at Belladonna sitting in her chair and insulting her, but instead the gargoyle giantess had a goofy smile on her face. Belladonna gasped and fell back. She turned and saw the sketchpad on the floor with the unflattering drawing of Destiny as Destiny calmly helped Belladonna up. She then held up the sketchpad and surprisingly she wasn't insulted in the least. \"That's quite an interesting drawing, Belladonna. Perhaps you should paint.\" Belladonna is understandably baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\" Destiny just gives a smile and shrugs her shoulders. \"I'm feeling good. It's a wonderful day.\" Belladonna drops her jaw and swings her tail, accidentally knocking an entire pot of hot coffee all over Destiny. Belladonna gasped and recoiled, expecting Destiny to clobber her like she normally does for her transgressions. However, Destiny still was as calm as ever and left her office peacefully, leaving Belladonna very afraid. \"What is wrong with you?\" asks Belladonna. Destiny just raises a horned brow in confusion and shrugs her shoulders. Belladonna then rubs her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Destiny,\" says Belladonna. \"Isn't that annoying sister of yours coming over. And her husband.\" \"I know,\" says Destiny calmly. \"I hope everything is in place back home.\" Belladonna then bit her lip. \"By the way. That gargoyle guy who works at the donut shop. The red one with the beak. I saw him wink at Fate the other day.\" \"Oh, good,\" says Destiny. \"I'd say that Fate's old enough to date by now.\" Belladonna's jaw drops in surprise. \"Are you ****ing drunk!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny just taps Belladonna on the head. \"I never noticed before, Belladonna, but you seem stressed out.

The Doctor was an 800ft tall living mannequin with skin made of red plastic, blonde nylon hair and green eyes. The Doctor had put her stethoscope to Destiny who at this point was so calm that she had a rather loopy look on her face. The Doctor shifted her head and spun it around a few times before speaking to Belladonna. \"There don't seem to be a bloody thing wrong with the old girl.\" \"Nothing wrong?!\" yells Belladonna. \"She won't get mad no matter what.\" \"And at's a problem, how?\" asks the Doctor. Belladonna just stomps her foot on the ground. \"I'm serious! This is Destiny Troi Sirtis! She can't go a single day without getting pissed off at something going on around here! Can't you check her blood pressure or perhaps run a urine test or something?! This isn't healthy.\" \"Well I says she's as fit as a fiddle.\" \"And I say she's a sick puppy!\" yells Belladonna in retort. \"I don't feel like a sick puppy.\" Says Destiny. \"Shut up!\" yells Belladonna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Belladonna is walking Destiny through the hallway. \"That wooden quack doesn't know what she's talking about.\" \"Please leave the Doctor alone, Belladonna,\" says Destiny. \"She said that I was fine and I trust her 100%. Although I worry about you. You're acting unusually short-tempered today.\" Belladonna grits her hundreds of teeth. \"What the heck is going on?\" asks Belladonna to herself. \"Has she got Sunshine Banjo Face disease or something? Destiny's acting so sweet my teeth hurt.\" Suddenly Destiny gives a grunt. Somebody had tossed a plate at her head. Belladonna gasped and turned to see a rather rude looking female prisoner. She was a wereboar girl with tanned skin, long tusks and black hair that was worn in an Asian bun. \"Excuse me,\" said the wereboar inmate. \"What kind of cheap prisoner are you running here? The eggs were upside down.\" Destiny didn't even respond to the heckling. \"Hello! Are you like, totally deaf or something?\" Destiny still didn't respond. \"I heard you perfectly well the first time. I\"m sorry, but that's beyond my control. I'm not the cook.\" The boar woman stuck her tongue out but surprisingly it was Belladonna that was upset and then grabbed the girl by the tongue and made her squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here you annoying waste of space!\" yells Belladonna. \"It's your own fault for being here for kidnapping that pop star. Destiny is the warden and you will treat her with respect or I'll make you eat your own nose!\" Destiny had to pull Belladonna away. \"Belladonna,\" she says calmly. \"Might I recommend anger management.\" Belladonna just screamed into her chest in frustration. The fact that Destiny couldn't get enraged ironically pissed Belladonna off. Suddenly, there was loud yelling. \"You're a rotten sneak! I don't drink! That wasn't even my beer!\" \"Then what was it doing in your lunchbox. Besides, that's payback for last week.\" \"I oughta brain you, you stupid dog!\" \"I'm not a stupid dog! I'm not even a dog! Hyenas aren't dogs!\" Belladonna recognized the yelling as Clover and Cree in the middle of an argument. \"Not those two again.\" Grumbled Belladonna. Destiny walked right down the hall to see Clover and Cree ready to clobber each other. \"Hold on you two,\" said Destiny. \"Hug it out. Don't slug it out.\" Clover and Cree turned and looked at the warden in surprise. \"What appears to be the problem?\" asks Destiny calmly. \"Cree told Belladonna I was drunk because she saw me throwing away a beer bottle that wasn't even mine.\" \"And last week, hose nose told the rest of the guards I had fleas.\" Destiny just gave a chuckle. \"I'm sure it's just a big misunderstanding. We're all friends here so I expect you to act like it.\" Both Cree and Clover were understandably okay. \"Are you feeling alright, Boss?\" asks Clover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral inmates saw what was going on and were surprised. \"What's wrong with the warden?\" \"Have you ever seen Destiny smile?\" \"Not like that. Last time she smiled, there was a scowl on her face as ell.\" \"I think she's lost her marbles.\" \"Maybe Wade finally drove her over the edge.\" \"Hey, Demona! Nice hair! I can only see one gray light!\" Destiny didn't even respond and it made Belladonna's eye twitch. \"Destiny! Priscilla just called you \"Demona\"!\" Destiny shrugged her shoulders. \"To be fair, I do look a lot like her.\" This act of OOC caused Belladonna to struggle to close her jaw again. Cree and Clover were both surprised. \"Belladonna,\" said Clover. \"Can I go home early today? I think that megalosaurus sandwich I had for lunch went bad.\" Belladonna was at this point spewing like an angry cat and even started to rip up and eat her own shirt. Belladonna saw Aria floating by and then grabbed her by the shirt. \"Aria,\" says Belladonna. \"I need you to cover for both of us. Something is seriously wrong with the warden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna soon is in her car driving Destiny into town. Belladonna's car was a car that resembled the Thundertank, except with skeletal designs on it. \"Destiny,\" said Belladonna. \"You're obviously not in your right state of mind.\" Destiny just continued to smile goofily. \"I appreciate the concern, Don-Don,\" she says. \"But you're worrying over nothing.\" \"Don-Don?!\" yells Belladonna in anger and surprise. Belladonna let out a yell as she honked the horn on her car. As Belladonna comes to a four way intersection, who should she see walking down the street but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Down the street was Destiny's daughter, Fate Sirtis. Fate was the same height as Destiny but in contrast to Destiny, she was somewhat on the heavy side. Ironically, Fate resembled Angela in the same way that Destiny resembled Demona. Fate worked as the night security guard at the Daily Tombstone, however, the editor asked Fate to take a few nights off as they were breaking in a new guard and Fate was at that moment apparently walking from the grocery store given the bag in her hand and was wearing a white loincloth and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Belladonna spotted Fate, she drove the car right to the side of the street and parked, to the younger gargoyle's surprise. \"Belladonna?\" asks Fate. Destiny notices Fate and smiles. \"Hi, Sweetie,\" she said. \"How's work been doing.\" \"Shut up,\" says Belladonna. \"I'll talk to Fate, thank you very much.\" Belladonna drags Fate into the other side of the corner to explain the problem to Fate as Destiny turns on the radio in Belladonna's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate,\" says Belladonna. \"There's something seriously wrong with your mom. No matter what happens, she won't get mad.\" Fate blinks. \"Isn't it a good thing that she's started to control her nasty temper?\" \"Are you kidding me!? What is wrong with your family!? Don't you see that this is completely unnatural. Priscilla called her the D-word and she didn't even get mildly annoyed.\" Fate was slightly concerned at that. \"O-kay.\" She said. Belladonna let out a sigh. \"Come on,\" she said. \"I'll give you a ride home.\" Fate nodded her head and got into the back seat of the car where she put down her groceries. She saw Destiny's goofy smile in the mirror and gave a look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" asks Fate. \"Is everything alright?\" Destiny gave a slight giggle. \"Oh, everything's fine, Fate. Don't worry. Did you hear that your Aunt Fortuna and her family are in town.\" Fate let out a scoff. \"Uh, yeah. They're staying with me. And I'll bet right now she's already been messing with my curtains.\" \"Mind your aunt, Fate,\" says Destiny. \"By the way, how is that husband of hers doing?\" \"Since when do you care what goes on with Uncle David?\" asks Fate with suspicion in her voice. Destiny shrugs her shoulders as Belladonna drives the car. \"I'll admit, I've had my differences with my brother-in-law, but he's still family.\" Fate then scratches her double-chin before Destiny says something that really makes her worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Fate. Aren't you at the age when you should be married? Belladonna told me about a nice sounding boy who works at the donut shop.\" Fate's jaw drops and she has a look of pure shock on her face. \"Mom,\" she says. \"You are definitely not well.\" Destiny gives a chuckle. \"Oh,\" says the blue gargoyle giantess. \"No need to worry Sweet Pea. The Doctor gave me a clean bill of health.\" Fate however, isn't so sure and takes her cell phone out of her cleavage to call somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate had contacted Destiny's old friend, Whitney Steranko, a giant albino redheaded wererhinoceros who worked as the head nurse at the K.D.P., a mental hospital. At that moment, it was Whitney's day off and she was eating a pizza with her human husband Xander who was sitting on her shoulder. Fate explained the situation to Whitney who was confused. \"What was that?\" asks the were rhino as she bites into a slice of pizza. \"It's like I said, Mrs. Steranko,\" says Fate. \"Mom isn't getting mad no matter what. She even said that I should get married. Mom hates men, she'd sooner die than let one get close enough to propose to me.\" Whitney let out a sigh. \"Methinks that you're overreacting. I'll come by in a few days. But I hardly think that Destiny Sirtis calming down is anything to worry about. If she can control her temper, maybe there's hope for me.\" Whitney let out a laugh as she hung up and ate another slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Under Gloom, Aria is going through the books from the book cart and comes across that catalog of curses that you used to hex Destiny. The onryo picks up the book and curiously begins to read it.</span></div></div>",

First the Doctor and now Whitney. Are they giving a doctorate to anybody these days? Isn't that rhino rump supposed to be Destiny's best friend? Some friend she is when she can't see a major problem.\" Destiny just gives a giggle. \"Oh, that Whitney,\" she says. \"I wonder how she and Xander are doing. I sure hope Susan isn't giving them any grief. When is that younger sister of hers getting married?\" Even Fate seems worried. \"Mom?\" she asks. \"Did you by any chance take a serious head injury earlier?\" Destiny just smiles at her daughter. \"Oh, no. Nothing like that at all, Fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate bites her lip and scratches her chubby cheek. \"Oh dear,\" she says. \"I hope this is nothing serious.\" Belladonna arrives at Fate's house. It's a modified clock tower and from the looks of it, there is a veritable rock garden to the side and a stained glass window of a spider's web. Belladonna and Fate step out of the car and Fate takes her groceries and Destiny's hand. Destiny is wobbling as she smiles blissfully. \"And she doesn't get mad no matter what?\" asks Fate in concern. Belladonna turned her head and showed her teeth. \"Haven't you been listening, you purple idiot!\" Destiny continued to smile goofily and holds up a finger. \u201cNow, now, Belladonna. If you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Belladonna was at this point jumping up and down. \u201cI just insulted your daughter, you blue dummy! Don\u2019t you want to strangle me or yell my head off or something!? Belladonna pulls on her hair as Destiny ignores her rant and continues to smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have your hug when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Belladonna gets so mad that she kicks a potted plant by Fate\u2019s door. Unfortunately for her, it\u2019s a rose plant and Belladonna then yells in pain as she then spouts out bad words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate gives a sigh and opens the door. Like Fate said, Destiny\u2019s younger sister Fortuna was inside. Fortuna was a brown-skinned gargoyle slightly shorter than Destiny with curved horns like that of a ram, large hips and long blonde hair. She had been accompanied by her husband and daughter. Fortuna\u2019s husband David was watching television. He was a pitch black-colored gargoyle with rose-colored hair and muscular build. Fortuna and David\u2019s daughter, Pearl was there as well and was reading a comic book. Pearl looked very much like a female version of her father. However, unlike other gargoyles who were among the tallest species of monster, Pearl was only 455ft tall, making her puny by gargoyle standards, something she was touchy about. Fortuna turns her head and sees Fate bringing Destiny in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Destiny,\u201d said Fortuna. \u201cSo glad that you could join us.\u201d Fortuna was glad but David turned his attention to Destiny and looked nervous. Not that anyone could blame him given that his sister-in-law had quite a nasty reputation. He was even cowering as Destiny walked in the room. \u201cGood afternoon, Fortuna. How are you doing? And how is that husband of yours?\u201d Fortuna and David are both very surprised, though David seems more afraid than anything. Fortuna notices her sister smiling and her jaw drops just as Fate is putting the groceries away. Destiny was still smiling as Belladonna came in. \u201cBelladonna,\u201d muttered Fortuna. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise seeing you here. I thought you\u2019d be out trying to steal my sister\u2019s job.\u201d \u201cHey, Fortuna,\u201d says Belladonna. \u201cIt\u2019s go soak your head o\u2019clock! Time for you to go to the bar and....\u201d Destiny then stood between Belladonna and her sister. \u201cNow, now. You two get along now. Nobody likes to be angry.\u201d Fortuna\u2019s eyes pop out of her head upon hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl takes her head out of her comic, really confused and surprised about her aunt\u2019s mild attitude. \u201cAuntie D?\u201d asked Pearl. \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly clear that she\u2019s not!\u201d yells Belladonna. Fate opened the freezer to put away some ice cream as Fortuna walked up to her. \u201cFate,\u201d said Fortuna. \u201cIs your mother drunk? I can\u2019t recall the last time she was this cheerful.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Aunt Fortuna,\u201d says Fate. \u201cBelladonna said that no matter what happens, Mom won\u2019t get mad.\u201d David gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me? She can\u2019t go a day without something pissing her off.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d asked Fate. \u201cShe suggested that I get married.\u201d Pearl then drops her comic book in shock as Fortuna drops the cup of coffee in her hands on the floor. Fortuna sees Destiny smiling goofily and watching TV. David himself gets up and is utterly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna turned to face Belladonna. \u201cIs this true?\u201d \u201cDoes a splintercat have a big butt?\u201d asked Belladonna in annoyance as she stomps her foot. \u201cAnd that stupid wooden toy and pizza gobbling rhinoceros gave her a clean bill of health!\u201d David then walked up behind Belladonna. \u201cUh,\u201d he said. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, Belladonna, but you said that she doesn\u2019t get mad no matter what?\u201d Belladonna let out a yell. \u201cAre you deaf!? What did I just say!\u201d Belladonna in rage took a lamp that was on Fate\u2019s table and smashed it on the ground. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Fate. \u201cYou poison-tailed jerk! That lamp cost me 60 skulls!\u201d \u201cLeave her alone, Fate,\u201d said Destiny calmly. \u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d shouted Belladonna. Belladonna punched the wall but got her hand stuck between two gears and grunted in pain as Fate had to pull her out. Fortuna was baffled at Destiny\u2019s new behavior. David on the other hand, gave a sinister smirk. \u201cWait right here,\u201d he said maliciously. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for my favorite sister-in-law.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna was really surprised but then smiled. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if Belladonna is correct. Uh, Destiny.\u201d \u201cYes, Fortuna, what is it.\u201d Fortuna gave a sly smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t today the anniversary of the day you met Mason.\u201d Fate and Belladonna both gave looks of horror upon hearing that. \u201cWhat are you doing, Aunt Fortuna?\u201d asked Fate. Destiny scratched her chin. \u201cI remember that.\u201d \u201cThen you also remember what an animal he was. Remember, the Leaning Tower? That was a good night.\u201d Destiny nodded her head. \u201cI suppose it was.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said Fortuna. \u201cYou were real sick the next morning and the next thing you knew, he was gone.\u201d Fate was biting her fingers nervously and Pearl covered herself with her wings, sure Destiny would get mad.\u2028\u2028But Destiny just shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Fortuna gasped and stepped back. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said. \"Belladonna wasn't kidding. If that doesn't trigger her, nothing will. I guess she's finally started to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fortuna could finish her sentence, David snuck up behind Destiny with a smirk. \"Oh, Destiny.\" Destiny turned her head. \"Yes, what is it, David?\" Without warning, David splattered a boysenberry pie in Destiny's face. \"David!\" yelled Fortuna in horror. David just gave a smirk. \"That's what you get for all those years of intimidating me and making me feel so small! You've had that coming for a long time you blue battle-ax!\" Belladonna is just about ready to attack David but Destiny stops her. \"Now, now,\" she said as she was wiping pie off of her face. \"He has every reason to want to do that to me.\" Fortuna gave a nervous laugh and Pearl actually fainted. \"Well,\" said Fortuna. \"If Destiny can calm down, maybe there's hope for Pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna was fuming mad and then she heard her cellphone ring and picked it up. \"Belladonna,\" said Aria on the phone. \"There's something you should know. Somehow a catalog of making curses got mixed in with the prison books.\" \"What?!\" yelled Belladonna. \"According to the book, you can order any of the curses in here to be placed on an enemy. One of the curses has the power to take away a victim's ability to get angry.\" Belladonna gave a growl. \"I should've known! Who placed that curse on Destiny?! As if I didn't already know! Bring Wade here immediately, Tazel!\" With that, Belladonna crushed her cellphone in her hand and threw it into the wall as she screamed in anger. \"You know, Belladonna,\" says Destiny. \"You have a terrible temper.\" \"Shut up!\" yells Belladonna. \"As soon as Wade gets here, I'm going to roast him alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna then grabs Fate's coffee table and proceeds to smash it into the wall. Fate's eye twitches. \"I hope Aria gets Wade here so Belladonna can punish him while I still have some furniture.\"</span></div></div>",

She's not like that big blue crabapple who just got de-crabbed.\" You even stick your tongue out at Aria and she gives a hiss as she closes the cell door and then floats off. Lockette lets out a gulp. \"Oh no,\" she says. \"This is not likely to end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Fate's house, Belladonna is so mad as she waits for Aria to bring you to her, that she has resorted to clawing at Fate's wallpaper as Fate gives a look of annoyance and Destiny is laughing at something funny on the television. \"When Aria brings Wade over here, I'm going to put him to sleep!\" yells the irate manticore. Fortuna rolls her eyes. \"Belladonna,\" she says. \"I think you've been hanging around my sister too much. \"You're starting to act like you.\" Belladonna then points her tail dangerously close to Fortuna's face. \"Say one more word, Fortuna,\" warns Belladonna. \"And I'll see to it that your face is as puffy and swollen as your butt!\"  Fortuna gasps and looks back at her round butt before giving an indignant look at Belladonna. Pearl gives a hiss at Belladonna for insulting her mother, to which Belladonna responds with a lion-like roar that intimidates Pearl into submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry manticore then starts pulling springs out of the walls of Fate's clock tower and Fate grits her teeth. \"Belladonna!\" she yells. \"Quit dismantling my house!\" \"Get off my case Fat Angela!\" yells Belladonna. \"Why do you even live in a clock tower anyway!? It's a bad place to live! Don't those grinding gears keep you awake at night!? Tick tock, tick tock, tick-tock, tick-tock! That would make me psychotic! And what do you do when your skirt gets caught in the gears!\" \"Chill out, Belladonna,\" says Fate. \"Just because Mom can't get anger doesn't mean you have to scream everybody's head off.\" \"If you weren't Destiny's daughter, I'd shove my stinger tail so far up your large, overstuffed and purple backside that you'd see it come out your mouth!\" \"You're acting like a complete jerk, Belladonna.\" Fate gets so frustrated that her eyes glow bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" yells Belladonna. \"Go eat a rice paddy, you fat purple clone of that blue scarecrow!\" \"Don't cheese me off, Solanaceae,\" says Fate. \"I can get pretty nasty myself!\" Fortuna lets out a gulp. \"Oh no.\" David wisely takes cover behind his wife as he watches Belladonna and Fate argue. \"Shut your trap, Fate!\" yells Belladonna. \"The sooner Wade gets here, the sooner I can clobber him for breaking your Mom!\" \"Breaking my mom? You mean finally getting her to calm down for once? I'd think you'd be happy about it since she can't get mad at you for all the times you've tried to stab her in the back.\" \"It goes against the natural order! Destiny Troi Sirtis is supposed to be the angry jerk who yells at everyone! What fun is it to antagonize her if she isn't going to explode!\" \"I'm about to explode at you!\" \"Like you're as intimidating as Destiny, you hippopotamus in gargoyle's clothing.\" \"What was that, twig?\" \"Your butt is so big the moon orbits around it! In fact, you are so fat, the last time you went swimming, Captain Ahab went after you!\" \"I am not taking that kind of sass from somebody who can't decide if she's a feline or an arachnid, goes to the bathroom in a sandbox and sustains herself on rodents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate and Belladonna at this point are so mad at each other that they'd be ready to clobber each other at the drop of a hat. Destiny is as calm as ever and just smiles and waves. \"Now, now. Let's not let anybody get overheated. I'm sure neither of you mean any malice.\" \"Shut up!\" yells Belladonna. Fate then slaps Belladonna in the face and makes her growl. \"Don't you tell my mom to shut up, fleabag!\" \"Maybe if I pound your chunky butt, it will get a rise out of her!\" \"I'd eat you alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Aria floats in carrying you and you're laughing at Belladonna and Fate getting mad at each other.

Fate herself grabs Belladonna in a choke hold but Belladonna bites her in the hand to force Fate to let go before she slugs Aria one, causing her breasts to shake and send you into the air as you scream. Aria lets out a scream and picks up a floor lamp to try and bludgeon Belladonna (batting you into the air in the process as you have to grab onto the ceiling fan) but Belladonna ducks and Aria hits Fate by mistake, shattering the head of the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate's eyes glow red with rage and then she throttles Aria and Aria starts to knee her. Destiny turns her head and rolls her eyes at the fighting while still smiling. \"Girls,\" she says. \"Girls. Hug it out, don't slug it out. You're letting your tempers get the best of you.\" Belladonna turns her head and grits her teeth. \"Like you're one to talk you big blue... Ouch!\" Aria kicks Belladonna in the bread basket and wiggles out of Fate's grip before she starts to strangle Belladonna. \"NOBODY calls me a cow, you backstabbing piece of pest!\" \"Well maybe if you didn't have those wrecking balls attached to your chest, nobody would make that mistake!\" At that moment, you fall off the ceiling fan and grab the area of Fate's loincloth below her tail as Fate rises up. \"You two need a time out!\" yells the gargoyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" You mutter. Fate turns around and then jumps up and slams her huge butt into Aria and pressing her against the wall with Belladonna right behind her. You let out a muffled scream as you're sandwiched between Aria's boobs and Fate's butt cheeks. Belladonna is pressed into the wall so hard that she leaves a Belladonna-shaped imprint in it. Belladonna in retaliation, stings Fate in the buttocks, pushing you further into the gargoyle's butt in the process and making Fate scream in pain as she's forced to jump out. Fate feels her butt in pain from Belladonna's poison but the manticore only injected enough poison to temporarily burn her. You are wedged between Fate's cheeks and trying to push yourself out right before Aria kicks Fate in the rear and provokes Fate into kicking Aria in the fork. The swift movements knock you into the floor and you narrowly avoid Fate stomping on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna then nearly steps on you and jumps up and kicks Fate to the floor, nearly causing her butt to reduce you to paste. You even clutch your chest. Maybe this wasn't your best idea. The three of them were acting as hotheaded as Destiny was before the curse. Aria then rips a few gears out of the wall and tosses them like shurikens at Belladonna, provoking Belladonna to tear out a spring and start beating Aria with it right before Fate gets back up and slams both of their heads into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Fortuna has had enough and then starts to walk into the scrap. \"Fortuna!\" yells David. \"Don't! You'll get creamed!\" \"This is getting out of hand,\" says Fortuna. \"This is the kind of savage behavior I'd expect from Destiny.\" Destiny had at this point fallen blissfully asleep, not even caring about the chaos going on around her. Fortuna stomps off as Aria, Fate and Belladonna are trying to choke each other. \"Will you three knuckleheads cut that out!\" yells the brown-skinned gargoyle in rage.  Belladonna in response slaps Fortuna. Fortuna's eyes glow red and she slaps Belladonna back. Belladonna then punches Fortuna in the fork and Fortuna grabs the newspaper to hit Belladonna in the foot with. Then Belladonna pulls on Fortuna's hair, provoking Fate into smashing a vase over Belladonna's head before Aria tackles Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna gives a roar and body slams Aria, all while you're trying to avoid getting crushed by four giant women having a free-for-all and have to run from Aria and Belladonna rolling on the floor. In the confusion, Pearl notices the catalog of curses laying on the ground. She picks it up and flips it to the page with the Angry Away curse and reads it, when she notices the obscured print and takes out a magnifying glass to take a look at it and drops her jaw. \"Uh-oh.\" \"Uh-oh?\" asks David. \"What uh-oh?\" \"I don't think Wade bothered to read this curse all the way through,\" says the teenaged gargoyle. \"It says here that while the curse takes away the victim's ability to get angry or fight back, it also has a 50% chance of causing any monsters near the victim to become as surly and ill-tempered as they once were.\" David's jaw drops in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortuna and Aria have reduced to screaming swear words at each other while Fate and Belladonna have taken their cat fight outside with you caught in the middle, all while Destiny wasn't doing anything to stop the fighting and just relaxing in the background.

I can't wait to see Destiny shriveled up like a corpse, or better yet, bloated to the point of immobility.\" You laugh wickedly. \"Dial the phone!\" you yell.

What curse can I interest you in today?\" \"Give me Curse #138 and have it cast on Destiny Sirtis, Warden of Under Gloom. I have a score to settle with that blue troglodyte.\" As the spell was being cast, Destiny was walking by and scoffed. \"Wade must think I'm a moron to believe that I'd fall for such an obvious ruse.\" As Destiny is walking by, she hears loud munching sounds and then sees Cree munching on a rather large piece of pterodactyl meat and saw several bones lying on the hyena's obese stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Weisman, Cree!\" yells Destiny. \"You eat like a pig.\" Cree wiped her mouth. \"I'd say I eat more like a hyena.\" \"No wonder you're so fat. Your eating habits are more questionable than Fate's.\" Destiny shivered as she walked away. \"What am I saying? I had the same disorder when I was younger than Fate is now. Speaking of which, it's about time I had my lunch.\" Destiny returns to her office and takes out a meatball sub that she tears into a lot like Cree, finishing it in seconds. \"Jalape\u00f1o,\" groaned Destiny. \"I must've been hungrier than I thought. Speaking of which.\" Destiny walks to her fridge and takes out a jar of jalape\u00f1os. While most gargoyles hate jalape\u00f1os, Destiny actually considers them her favorite food and was eating the peppers like popcorn. Perhaps her hot temper made it impossible for the peppers to burn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Destiny finished the peppers, she resorted to licking the jar. \"What is wrong with me?\" asks Destiny. \"I'm still hungry.\" Destiny then walks out of her office and for some reason she looks skinnier and her hips looked smaller. The gargoyle soon reached the vending machine at the end of the hall and  put her money into the machine to purchase a bag of chips and then quickly ate them. As she did that, her cheekbones were more and more visible. She then bought a candy bar and ate it as well but that still didn't do anything for her monstrous hunger and she bought another bag of chips. It continued on until there was nothing left in the vending machine and Destiny was groaning as she ate another bag of peanuts and she looked slightly thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna came in and looked in surprise and horror at the wrappers and empty bags littering the ground. \"Son of a bitch, Destiny!\" yells Belladonna. \"Don't tell me you ate all that junk!\" Destiny let out a slight belch. \"I can't help it, Belladonna,\" said Destiny weakly. \"It feels like there's a black hole inside of my stomach.\" Destiny heard her stomach growling and Belladonna gave a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food,\" said Destiny as she begun to drool. \"I need food.\" Destiny's stomach groans and then she decides to....</span></div></div>",

Aha! Got it.\" Destiny smirks as she plucks out one of the jalape\u00f1os from the jar. Belladonna is walking by and takes a whiff before grabbing her nose and holding it in pain. \"Whoa!\" yells the manticore as Destiny bites into a jalape\u00f1o as if it were nothing. \u201cGeez, Destiny. How can you eat those things? It\u2019s like putting firecrackers in your mouth. You know, gargoyles normally hate jalape\u00f1os.\u201d Destiny ignores Belladonna and devours each pepper one by one. \u201cI\u2019ve never found myself burned by jalape\u00f1os. Other gargoyles are just lightweights. My sister, my daughter and I eat these things everyday.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny then does something that really surprises Belladonna. She places the entire jar of peppers to her mouth to devour all of them at once and even drank the brine they were soaking in. Belladonna makes a face as if she\u2019s going to throw up before Destiny tosses the now empty jar into a recycle bin and then grabs another jar from underneath her desk and opens it to dine on more peppers. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me!\u201d thought Belladonna to herself. \u201cShe\u2019s going through <i>another</i> jar of jalape\u00f1os? I'd faint after just one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny continues to stuff her face as she inadvertently drops a jalape\u00f1o on the floor. Out of curiosity, Belladonna picks up the dropped pepper and eats it herself. Immediately afterwards, her eyes bulge out of her head and she begins to sweat as her yellow-skin turns bright red and steam comes out of her nostrils before she lets out a scream and runs up to Destiny's water cooler before chugging the entire contents. \"Good grief, Destiny,\" groans Belladonna. \"What were those peppers soaking in? Black widow venom?\" Then Belladonna looks in surprise as Destiny tosses away another empty pickle jar and then takes out a third jar of pickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" thought Belladonna. \"Something is up. Even Cree couldn't eat three jars of jalape\u00f1os.\" Destiny shoved some jalape\u00f1os into her face before she spoke again. \"Can you believe that Wade actually tried to trick me into thinking he'd gone straight? I know a liar when I see one. He's one of those people who would take a mile if you give him an inch. That human drives me crazy.\" Destiny's pours more peppers into her mouth and then drinks the brine before throwing the third jar away and taking out yet another jar of jalape\u00f1os. Belladonna is now very confused but then Aria flies up behind the manticore and accidentally knocks her to the ground with her enormous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna falls head first on Destiny's desk and grunts before Aria speaks. \"Warden Destiny,\" says Aria. \"I just got word that somebody managed to smuggle in a catalogue of curses. Somebody could order a dangerous curse if they only had a cellphone.\" \"Well then.\" said Destiny as she shoveled in jalape\u00f1os. \"I want all guards to keep a close handle on their cellphones and make sure nobody finds that accursed book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny then holds her stomach before she gets up and walks by Belladonna who is holding her head. \"Where are you going?\" \"Out to lunch,\" says Destiny. \"I'll be back in an hour.\" \"Lunch!? You just ate four jars of peppers!\" \"And for some reason, I'm still hungry. Belladonna, watch after things while I'm gone. And if you lock me out of my office again, I'll clobber you.\" Destiny walks off and as she's walking away, Belladonna notices that the gargoyle woman's behind looks rounder than usual and scratches her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" thinks Destiny to herself. \"I'm starving. I need something in my stomach. Hmmm.\" Destiny reaches the outside of the prison and then opens her wings to fly off to find a restaurant. Before she does so, she takes out her cellphone to call her daughter Fate. \"Hello, Fate,\" says Destiny. \"You did say that a new restaurant opened down the block from your clock tower, right?\" \"That's right, Mom,\" says Fate on the other end of the phone. \"I was going there myself.\" \"Well,\" says Destiny. \"I'm coming myself.

Destiny could feel her stomach roaring in anticipation of the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the, Fate landed behind her. She smiled when she saw her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom.\" She said. \"What do you think of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate didn't get to finish her sentance when Destiny marched in. Fate was surprised. \"Guess she's in a hurry.\" Fate muttered before walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was just as simple as the outside. It looked like any other buffet restaraunt. There were only a few other customers. Destiny had already made her way to the checkout counter. Behind the counter was a chubby toucan harpy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, and welcome to Jenny's Pizza Buffet. My name is Lara. How many will be eating today?\" The harpy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\" Destiny said, looking more at the buffet then Lara. Fate walked up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, just follow me.\" Lara said. She then proceded to lead Destiny and Fate to a booth near the back of the restaraunt. \"Here you go. When your ready, just go get-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara couldn't finish before Destiny made her way to the buffet counters and started filling plate after plate with food. Lara and Fate looked at her surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess she's ready.\" Lara said before walking back to the cash register. Fate just kept looking at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Destiny came back to her seat, somehow carefully balancing 20 plates of food at once. She sat down and, without even saying anything, began tearing into her food. Fate just looked shocked as she got up and went to the buffet counter to get her own food. As she filled her own plate, she started thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom never eats this much. Wade must have done something.' She thought. By the time she had filled her own plate and gotten back to her mom, Destiny had already cleaned of 12 plates and started her 13th. Now Fate was really shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you full yet?\" Fate asked her mom, now a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close.\" Destiny said, her mouth full. She just continued to devour pizza, cheese-sticks, salads, and so on. Fate just started eating her own food. By now, the whole restaraunt was looking at Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Destiny finished all twenty plates. Fate was barely even done with her first plate. Destiny then got up and went right back to the buffet. After a little bit, she came back with 20 more plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just ate twenty plates of food!\" Fate yelled. \"How are you still hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny looked at her daughter. \"I actually don't know. I ate 4 jars of jalape\u00f1os and was still hungry. Guess I've just built up an appetite.\" She said, before going back to her mountainous meal.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nThis went on for two hours. Destiny would finish her massive meal, only to immediatly get back up to get more food. The only reason she and Fate left was because the owner Jenny, a fat cobra naga with purple scales, asked them to. They also had to pay almost 500 skulls for all the food Destiny devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even leaving the buffet wasn't enough. Almost immediatly after exiting, Destiny flew of to a nearby corner store and started buying as much food as possible. Fate was now worried. Fate also noticed that her mom seemed to be getting fatter. She had a obvious pot belly, her breasts shot up several cup sizes, and her butt was tearing her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mom, don't you think you should be getting back to Under Gloom?\" Fate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny went wide-eyed. \"Crap! I was supposed to be back an hour ago!\" She yelled, before flying off. \"See you at home!\" She called down to Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate just watched her mom fly. \"OK, something's wrong. I should call Ororo.\" Fate said, before fishing out her cell-phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, after flying and eating for a while, Destiny had landed in front of...</span></div></div>",

Not that I have any problem with it, but I'm curious. It's no fun locking Destiny out of her own office when she isn't back when she says she's going to be.

Belladonna drops her jaws as she saw how huge Destiny had gotten. \"Good gracious me!\" yells Belladonna. \"All we need now is Captain Ahab! What did you eat?!\" \"If you must know,\" says Destiny in annoyance. \"Fate and I went out for pizza and the owner asked us to leave before I could eat my fill.\" \"You mean you emptied out a pizzeria and you're still hungry!?\" asks Belladonna. \"Even Cree's not that big a glutton.\" \"Hey, if you're here? Who's running Under Gloom!?\" \"I left Aria in charge. I'm hungry too.\" Destiny just gives a scoff. \"You'll have to pay for your own hotdogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna saw that Destiny's pants were tearing and beginning to show Destiny's pixel-print panties. \"Looks like big blue has some junk in the trunk.\" says the sneaky manticore. Destiny responds by slapping Belladonna with her blue tail and making her grunt. \"Jerk.\" Mutters Destiny. At the counter of the restaurant was a male weretiger with bright golden fur but surprisingly no stripes. He couldn't help but stare at Belladonna before Destiny grunted to get his attention. \"Oh,\" says the tiger man. \"Welcome to Caligula Dogs. Table for two?\" \"Make that table for two dozen.\" Smirks Belladonna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny shakes her fist in front of Belladonna. \"One of these days, Belladonna,\" she warns. \"One of these days. Pow! Right to the moon. She's with me. But she's paying for her own meal.\" \"Right,\" says the weretiger. \"What can I get for you.\" Destiny smirks as she takes her order. \"I'll have an order of 2 dozen Italian foot longs on pretzel buns topped with ketchup, mushrooms, pickles and jalape\u00f1os with a large kettle popcorn and a Hauntling cola.\" Belladonna's jaw drops at that order and the tiger man is surprised as well. \"Did I hear that correctly? You want jalape\u00f1os? But gargoyles don't like jalape\u00f1os.\" \"Well I do.\" Says Destiny as she hands the tiger man a large row of skulls. The weretiger nods his head to take Destiny's order and then turns to Belladonna who is deep in thought. \"And this beautiful creature?\" \"I'm thinking it over.\" Says Belladonna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Under Gloom, you get an idea and dial on Icy's cell phone again. \"What are you doing, Wade,\" asks Lockette. \"You already placed the curse on Destiny.\" \"Yeah,\" you say with a vicious smirk. \"But why should we leave Belladonna out of this? She's Destiny's right hand attack cat. And even if she does manage to steal Destiny's place as warden, I'm not taking any chances.\" You hear the dial tone as you're getting ready to hex Belladonna as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Caligula Dogs, Belladonna is just about to make her decision. \"As for me,\" says Belladonna as something comes over her. \"I'll have 3 dozen foot long linguisa dogs on Chicago buns topped with bacon, onions, chili and tomato wedges with a large cinnamon swirl popcorn and an Orange Crash.\" Destiny seems surprised but shrugs it off as Belladonna is about to pay the weretiger. \"Ah, ah, ah,\" says the tiger man. \"It's uh... Manticore Day. Manticores eat free.\" Belladonna smirks at Destiny as Destiny rolls her eyes. \"Manticore Day?\" she asks. \"More like Bonnacon Day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Destiny and Belladonna were waiting for their orders, Fate was on the telephone with the library in Screamtown several towns away. The librarian, Ororo Parker was an obese 950ft tall cobalt-skinned wereboar woman with long white hair and sharp teeth. She was gorging on donuts as she spoke with Fate. \"And you say she cleaned out an entire pizzeria, ate 4 whole jars of jalape\u00f1os and was <i>still</i> hungry? Wait, a gargoyle ate jalape\u00f1os?\" \"Focus, Ororo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro gave a snort and then threw away her first two boxes of donuts before taking out another box and messily devouring a chocolate donut. \"It sounds like she got hit by a curse from the Catalog of 1000 Curses. It's an evil spell book that was stolen from my library 10 years ago. Specifically, Curse #735: All You Can Eat. Anyone hit by that curse will have a hunger that could never be satisfied no matter how bloated they get and eventually they become obsessed with food.\" Ororo is so busy talking to Fate that she grabs her library stamp instead of a donut and eats it by mistake without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief,\" says Fate. \"Wade must've found that book and used it to curse Mom. I gotta go warn her.\" With that, Fate hung up and flew off to find Destiny. Back at the Screamtown library, Ororo was sucking her fingers. \"I think that last jelly donut was stale.\"</span></div></div>",

You're going to hate all men forever just because of something that one man did to you?\" \"Don't judge me,\" mutters Destiny. \"If I ever see Mason again... oh, it's just lucky for him that Persephone doesn't have a taste for gargoyle.\" Belladonna turns her head and just laughs smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny punches out and then exits Under Gloom before flying down to a bus stop where a friend of hers is waiting for her. This friend is an albino white wererhinoceros with long red hair (though more orange in comparison to Destiny's) with a bright blue tattoo of a rhino's head over one of her eyes. This ironically made her look like Fox as much as Destiny's appearance made her look like Demona. The rhino woman was wearing a blue cocktail dress with a blue rose corsage and she was wearing a golden necklace with ivory earrings and bright blue lipstick when Destiny flew down. \"Hey, Des,\" said Whitney. \"Can you believe that Lark Canmore is finally getting married.\" Destiny gave a scoff as she failed to notice a purple aura around herself that flashed and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Whitney came close to Destiny, the aura cast over her. \"You know,\" says Destiny. \"I don't see what the big deal is.\" Whitney gave a scoff. \"I'm married and Xander and I are very happy.\" Destiny gave a scoff. \"Where <i>is</i> Xander?\" Whitney let out a sigh. \"Xander has a terrible cold. He couldn't make it. You know, Destiny, you should get back in the saddle again. Just because Mason was a deadbeat...\" Destiny hisses at Whitney as her eyes glow bright red. \"Don't mention that piece of detritus in my presence. I hate him more than I hate Wade and that's saying something. Let's just get to the wedding so we can watch Lark get saddled with a loser.\" Whitney lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she and Destiny don't notice as they're talking, they are getting fatter and fatter. Their bellies, breasts and butts expand as their clothes grow tighter on their body and with each step they seem to be getting...</span></div></div>",

You know it sounds risky, but perhaps you could stow away on the big blue hag and escape. Talk about the biggest irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear footsteps and hide to the side where you find Destiny walking down the hallway and she was grumbling to herself as Belladonna walked alongside her. \"Of all the ridiculousness,\" groans Destiny. \"Stupid quack. There is nothing wrong with my blood pressure.\" Belladonna gives a smug grin. \"Come on Warden, you haven't taken a vacation for decades. You heard what the doctor said, all that stress is eating you alive inside.\" Destiny lets out a grunt. Looks like you finally drove her over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Destiny's tail moving and run quickly so neither the warden nor the vice warden can detect you before you begin your climb. Destiny lets out a sigh. \"I'm only doing this because that quack told everything to Fate and got her on my ass about it.\" Fate was Destiny's daughter, you had never met her but given that she came from such a nasty womb, you'd prefer not to. If anything she'd be just like her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna smiled wickedly because with Destiny on vacation, it meant she was the boss, not that you'd care since you'd be safely out of this hellhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you've climbed up Destiny's tail and were standing on one of her butt cheeks as you reach for her shirt. It isn't long before Belladonna and Destiny are out of the prison. \"I'm leaving you in charge while I'm away Belladonna, don't make me regret it.\" Belladonna smiles and puts one hand behind her back. \"Oh you won't Destiny. I know you won't.\" You assume that Belladonna has her fingers crossed but you couldn't see a thing with Destiny's ass it the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear flapping and feel wind beating down on you. You look up to see Destiny is flapping her wings and flying away. You yell and tumble before you're forced to grab hold of Destiny's skirt. You look up and cringe at the sight of your archenemy's panties. Wait, you couldn't worry about that, from the looks of it, you were a million feet up in the air. A fall from there could be bad for you. Then there was the fact Destiny could find you and then you're toast.

You cross your fingers as Destiny flaps and comes across a strange house that had strange statues on the sides and a demonic face on the door. It looked like some place Dracula's daughter would like. Destiny flies down to the front door and then reaches for her keys. At that moment, you climb her belt and see her keys right next to you. You have to climb out of the way as the blue gargoyle grabs the keys and unlocks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously Destiny didn't notice you as she walks in the front door. On the inside you see that Destiny's house has quite a gothic design. The furniture has spider web designs and there appears to be a glass menagerie of different mythical monsters and heroes in the side of the room. You never knew Destiny collected glass animals. Maybe you'd smash one of them to make her really mad. That's when you notice Destiny's mantle with several photographs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them depicted Destiny as a teenager and you have to hold your mouth to keep from laughing at how fat she was back then and from the looks of it, she used to wear braces. There was another photograph of Destiny with a younger gargoyle; a blonde with brown skin, you guess Destiny's sister. You had no idea she even had one. Then there was a photograph of Destiny with a friend of hers in college. Destiny's friend in the photograph was a pudgy albino skinned wererhinoceros woman with long orange hair reaching to her behind and a blue tattoo of a rhino's head over one of her eyes. The rhino woman appeared to be wearing glasses. It was kinda funny. The rhino woman sort of looked like Fox in the same way Destiny reminded you of another blue gargoyle. From the looks of the photograph, they were both in the same sorority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see a photograph that was attached to a dartboard. It had a purple skinned male gargoyle with brownish blond hair and the photo appeared to have been stabbed several times with knives. Then you turn your head and see a photograph of Destiny holding a female infant gargoyle with the same skin and hair. Then you put two and two together. That baby garg in the photo had to be her daughter, Fate. From the looks of it, Fate was born out of wedlock. You're not surprised, who would want to be married to that blue barracuda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide down Destiny's tail and hit the floor as Destiny lets out a sigh. \"I'm terrified to think of what will become of Under Gloom in my absence. High blood pressure my shiny sapphire ass. Destiny then opens the fridge and takes out a can of soda that she opens with her claws before she pours into a glass. As she opens the freezer to take out some ice, you see microwave pizzas. You weren't surprised. From the looks of it, Destiny lived alone and given the kind of hardass she was, she'd probably prefer something she wouldn't have to waste time cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny comes back into the living room and you duck under a recliner as she sits down in it. \"Terrific.\" You mutter to yourself as Destiny looks at the TV guide. \"I wonder what's on. Young Justice marathon on channel 60. Hmm, Young Justice. Wait a minute, didn't the guy who worked on that also... oh heck no. I ain't watching that. Not after the humiliation I suffered from his previous work.\" Destiny turns the TV on and flips channels. It was lucky for you that Destiny hadn't seen you yet, but you're right under the gargoyle's chair. If she sees you escaped and in her house, she'd roast you alive. All you can do is bide your time and wait for a chance to escape before Destiny realizes you're here.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately Destiny's foot comes down and you flinch. The good news is that she didn't squish you, the bad news is you're stuck between her talons. You let out a groan but as Destiny raises her foot in the air with you between her toes, you realize something, she didn't notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny looks at the caller ID on her phone and sees that it reads \"Whitney\". She picks up the phone and answers it. \"Hi Whitney.\" She says flatly. On the other side of the phone was that wererhino woman from the photograph, the one that looked like Fox and while you couldn't tell from your side of the phone, she had just gotten out of the shower. \"Hi Big D,\" she says. \"How's my B.F.F. doing?\" Destiny lets out a sigh. \"Miserably Whitney,\" she says. \"That bigmouthed doctor told Fate about my blood pressure results and she wouldn't stop badgering me until I took a vacation.\" \"Well you needed it girl,\" said Whitney, the rhino woman. \"You still have that one crook driving you insane. He'll put you in the K.D.P. soon enough. Lucky for you, I'm the number two girl there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K.D.P.?\" you ask as you overhear. You heard of that place. It was a crazy house for monsters. You think you heard of some human girl there. Sylvia. She was nothing special to you. Just some floozy you conned into thinking she was your girlfriend. Destiny then scoffs. \"Whitney,\" she says. \"Don't you have somebody driving you crazy as well.\" Whitney lets out a snort. \"Yes, yes I do. It's that Sylvia girl. She pleaded insanity to get out of going to prison, but I'm pretty sure that she's faking it.\" Destiny lets out a laugh. \"Maybe Wade should've thought of that. I'd like to see what you'd do to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney lets out a laugh. \"By the way, how's Fate doing?\" \"Last I checked, she was okay She's got a good work ethic that girl. Maybe you and Xander should have kids.\" Whitney scoffs at that thought. \"Destiny,\" she says. \"The last thing I need are kids. I work at the K.D.P., In a way, I have more kids than anyone could want.\" \"It's just as well,\" says Destiny. \"Wererhino human hybrids are probably something the world isn't ready for.\" That's when your eyes popped. Destiny's friend was married and to a HUMAN!? \"What is the guy?\" you ask. \"Blind and stupid. That's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Destiny,\" says Whitney. \"You're single and I'll bet that you'd be turning a lot of heads.\" Destiny's eyes glow red for a moment. \"Whitney,\" she says. \"I'm going to tell you the same thing I told you at your wedding reception. Men... are.... poison.\" Wow, it looks like Destiny's still sour about what happened with her ex-boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Whitney,\" says Destiny. \"Why did you call anyway?\" \"Well,\" says Whitney. \"It's getting close to winter and Xander and I wanted to invite you to the Grimmsly Lodge. Perhaps some fun on the slopes will put you in a better mood. Destiny lets out a sigh. \"Okay Whitney,\" she says. \"I'll go.

You cover your eyes and mentally scream as you look at Destiny's... unmentionables. If she wasn't your worst enemy, this would be so hot right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower turns on and Destiny walks inside. You look up and groan as you see Destiny's huge mammaries and hips shaking as the water drips off of her. \"Stupid sexy Destiny.\" You grumble as you try to take your eyes off the gargoyle giantess putting shampoo through her long pinkish red hair. Some of the stuff even falls between her toes and causes you to slip free. You get swept in a current and have to grab one of the sides of the drain to avoid being sucked down. You look up and wish you hadn't because it gives you a good view of Destiny's ass and her tail moving back and forth. How anybody could find her fictional doppelg\u00e4nger attractive is beyond you because all you see when you look at her is a bottle of angry nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny then grabs a bar of soap to wash herself but it slips out of her hands. \"Damn it all,\" grumbles the gargoyle. \"Me, the warden, making the worst mistake anyone in prison can. Oh well, I'm at home.\" Destiny's tail reaches down for the soap and you look and gasp to see the soap is right behind you.

NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could NOT be happening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny's tail lifted you up away from the drain and raised you to her back, right where her wings met her body and started rubbing you up and down against her back. Destiny sighed in contentment as you cough and sputter as the showerhead shoots down warm water drops the size of buses to you. As you let out a muffled scream as the water violently comes drown on you and swallow a lot of liquid, cough in more viciously, you felt yourself developing a friction burn from being rubbed against Destiny's body before you're suddenly pulled away. Then you see another cyan fleshy wall right in front of you. You then smash into it as Destiny keeps scrubbing with you. Good news was she wasn't paying much attention to you, bad news was you were being drowned and as soon as she finds you, you're dead, that is to say nothing of how turned on as you were dragged across the generous hourglass figure of this naked, dripping-wet giant woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH? You look down at yourself. To your horrified revulsion, you were getting rather hard below the waist. Meanwhile, Destiny was using you to wash between her thighs, still using her tail. Any moment,  she was going to spot you and you were dead meat. As you were moved you saw Destiny was getting ready to put you in her claw, still thinking you were the bar of soap. There was only one place you could go to escape being spotted was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer looming ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo no! No WAY were you going to try hiding there!

When it looks like you're going to fall, you grab the beginning of Destiny's tail and squeeze yourself inside her ass just as her claw reaches out and grabs the real soap on the shower floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. You were resorting to hiding in your own archenemy's titanic ass. Trapped in a gargoyle's butt. Of all the indignity. You had to hide in Destiny's booty as she was scrubbing her body and then proceeded to rub the soap across her planetary cheeks, causing some of it to get into your mouth as you gag. Fortunately, Destiny turns around and that giant Demona doppelg\u00e4nger positions her butt to the direction of the shower, causing hot water to hit you and make you gag and cough as you slip further inside as the gargoyle giantess is busy washing her pinkish red hair. You still feel hard and look down with anger in your eyes. \"Stupid, stupid sexy Destiny? What am I saying?! She's a monster. She's big time ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Destiny steps out of the shower and wraps a towel around herself. You were glad that horrible experience was over. Now you could get out of Destiny's ass. Or could you? She shimmied and tried to get out but your legs and one of your arms was still trapped in the crack. \"Dammit!\" you think to yourself. Now you were stuck to Destiny. Somebody up there must really hate your guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Destiny takes off her towel and puts on a white tank-top that showed off her midriff and what appeared to be a white loincloth with a belt. Finally she slips on a pair of red and black spider-web print panties, blinding your vision. You feel like biting Destiny, but you couldn't risk her reaching into her underwear and finding you out.

Last night I accidentally watched a marathon of that train wreck cartoon about those so-called \"superheroes\". Yeah right. If those twerps are superheroes, than I have the Phoenix Gate in the back of my panties.\" \"Well I don't know about the Phoenix Gate,\" you mumble. \"But you have something in the back you blue ****.\" Destiny's ears then twitched but at that moment, the popcorn was ready. \"You know,\" says the gargoyle. \"I could've sworn that I heard Wade. Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny takes her popcorn and plops down into her easy chair, unknowingly pinning you under her mountainous blue ass. You grumble as Destiny sits on you and turns on the television. There was a news report on the television. \"Earlier today, Dr. Gregarious's nefarious plot to contaminate the city's water supply was utterly foiled by Dire Ass, making the bad doctor, the gorgon crime fighter's third unlucky victim this week.\" Destiny let out a scoff. \"Superheroes,\" she groaned. \"That's just what we need. Where there's superheroes there's super villains. I hate super villains. They're even harder to keep caged than regular criminals. And this superhero. What kind of superpower is sitting on the villains?\" You're in too much pain to appreciate the irony as Destiny changes the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the next channel there appeared to be a series of videos involving creatures that looked like gargoyle versions of cats performing all sorts of strange activity, including one gargoyle cat that appeared to be swatting at a punching bag. \"Good grief,\" says Destiny. \"They're advertising the cat video contest on the television now? I still can't believe that yesterday Fortuna suggested that <i>I</i> get a cat. Did it ever occur to that blonde busybody that I <i>like</i> being alone.\" \"Well, duh,\" you think to yourself. \"Not even a cat would want to get within one hundred feet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny changed the channel again and it appeared to be a channel for a horror show and on the television there was a red moloch-like lizard man with a thick white mustache. \"Hellcome, poison ghouls, and welcome to another installment of Shocker's Tales.\" The Shocker let out a laugh on the television as Destiny rolled her eyes and ate some popcorn. \"Give me a break,\" says Destiny. \"What else is on?\" Destiny then flipped to a different channel and actually seemed excited for once. \"O.M.G., I haven't seen this installment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television there was a movie about to start, from the titles the movie took place in an environment that looked like a combination of a wasteland and a beach and there were several werebats and lizard folk on the beach. The title on the movie showed up and it read \"Lady Lethal VI, Blood Red Paradise.\" From the looks of it, the protagonist of the film was a copper-skinned Female gargoyle with reddish-blonde hair who looked heavy-set and was dressed in a Mad Max-style biker outfit with what looked like a glass eyepatch. Destiny munched on some popcorn as she smiled and watched the movie. \"I heard about this movie,\" said Destiny. \"They said that Zirconia Richardson gained weight for this role. No way I'm missing a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently curse under Destiny's body as Destiny watches the movie. \"I hope popcorn doesn't make her gassy,\" you groan to herself. \"I can't even see the ****ing movie from here?\"</span></div></div>",

It takes you hours to get yourself unstuck and you're stuck in Destiny's bed. If Destiny wasn't a stomach sleeper, this would be much harder. You're about to walk all the way to the end of the bed to escape but Destiny's alarm clock goes off at the worst possible moment. \"Damn!\" As if that weren't enough, Destiny unknowingly kicks you and you get stuck in her ankle bracelet as you groan. \"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stands up in bed and moans right before she checks her phone and goes on the internet. \"Let's see. Good grief, I'm barely awake and Fortuna is already texting me to boast about her new car. Give me a break. Huh, what's this link. Ugh. Cats!\" Destiny puts her phone down and then walks into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. And she isn't even getting dressed first so you have to deal with a naked Destiny in the kitchen. Just looking up at your arch-enemy's blue body made you sick as she poured herself a bowl of cereal. \"Cereal?\" you think to yourself. \"That stuff barely qualifies as food.\" Destiny munches away at her breakfast and by some miracle doesn't notice you in her ankle bracelet right as she crunches rather loudly. Makes sense she'd not be one to pour in milk and wait for it to get soggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Destiny is packing up a suitcase full of clothes and jewelry as she's eating a cinnamon bun. She was clearly getting ready to go skiing. Then you see her hand coming and it looks as though she's going to discover you. But you hold on to the ankle bracelet as she takes it off and then throws it into the suitcase. You are bounced out and land with a grunt on bright pink-colored snowsuit. You duck into the pockets as Destiny puts on a pair of panties and skirt with a tank top right before she picked up the snowsuit and put it on along with a pair of earmuffs shaped similar to a tiara and a pair of goggles before she puts on a pair of lavender leg warmers, all while you're in her pocket.\" As soon as Destiny is ready, there's a knock at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny walks to the front door and you look out to see that at the door was Whitney, Destiny's wererhino friend. She was 975ft tall, slightly shorter than Destiny and was very fat. She was albino white rhinoceros with two long horns. She had long bright red hair and a blue tattoo of a rhinoceros's head over her right eye. She was wearing a bright red parka with tight black pants and a pair of glasses. You could not believe it and rub your eyes because Whitney bore a shallow resemblance to Fox. Rather ironic given your nickname for Destiny. You then take a closer look and see that Whitney was carrying a human in her cleavage, a tan-skinned male human with brown hair worn in a ponytail and a beard. What the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Destiny,\" says the human. \"See you're up and early.\" \"Hi, Xander,\" says Destiny with a slight bit of annoyance in her voice. \"Should've guessed you were coming along.\" \"Well, duh, Destiny,\" says Whitney. \"You don't expect me to go to Grimmsly Lodge without my husband.\" You have a mental heart attack. Husband!? That human was Whitney's husband?! That was an abomination. How could a human marry a monster. Especially a titanically obese horn-nosed pachyderm. You really hope they don't have kids. Destiny shook her head. \"I told it to you at your wedding, Whitney,\" says Destiny. \"And I'll say it again.\" \"Men are poison.\" Said Whitney and Destiny simultaneously, the former with a tone of exasperation in her voice. \"Destiny,\" says Whitney. \"Just because things didn't work out with... I don't even remember his name. Sure he got you pregnant with Fate and left you but maybe you'll find someone nice the second time around.\" \"Maybe I should just shave my head and stick it in a wasp's nest while I'm at it.\" Xander just lets out a laugh. \"That's what I like about the company you keep, Whitney Honey. That gargoyle never fails to make me laugh.\" Whitney rolls her eyes. \"Well, lock up, Des. We leave shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk as Destiny locks her front door and then walks into Whitney's car with you in her pocket. \"You totally need this vacation, Destiny,\" says Whitney. \"You've been in a nasty mood lately.\" Destiny let out a huff. \"It's Wade. He's been driving me up the wall. Last Tuesday he tried to build a plane out of cigarettes and nearly burnt my office down. How did he even get cigarettes!? I made it perfectly clear to the guards that Under Gloom is a prison, not an ashtray.\" Whitney grunted. \"Don't even get me started. Yesterday, Sylvia tried to escape through the plumbing system.\" Sylvia? You remember that tramp from Kansas. You wonder if she still thinks you're her girlfriend. Looks like she's having the same antagonistic relationship with Rhino Rump over there as you do with Destiny. \"At least Sylvia isn't an obnoxious little shit that insults you to your face. I swear, if I hear that cretin call me \"Demona\" just one more time, I'll take him apart.\" Whitney seems confused at Destiny's words. \"One day I'm going to ask her why that name makes her so mad.\" You couldn't help but laugh at Whitney's ignorance. But then you look in disgust to see Xander lounging in Whitney's boobs. What could he possibly see in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both Destiny and Whitney reached Grimmsly Lodge right in the mountain area around Terrordale. It was really cold and you had to duck into Destiny's pocket as she flew into the air. Whitney chose to scale the mountain on foot. \"Must be nice having wings.\" Jokes Whitney. \"I'd carry you up the mountain,\" says Destiny. \"But you're too fat for even a gargoyle to carry.\" Whitney gives a smirk and shakes her stomach as Xander looks noticeably aroused. \"You know, Destiny,\" says Whitney. \"You'd probably be a real bombshell if you put on a few tons. Then you'd have a goddess figure like me.\" Xander let out a wolf whistle. \"That's why you turn me on, my sexy meteor.\" Whitney giggles and then bends her head down and you look away as she kisses Xander. Gross!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny and Whitney soon reached the lodge and you see that there were dozens of monsters inside. The proprietress walked forward and smiled. She was a giant silver-furred werecoyote who was fat and had a crescent moon birthmark on her face. There was a graying haired human on her shoulder resembling a lumberjack. Apparently Xander wasn\u2019t the only human dumb enough to marry a human. Whitney walked up to the coyote woman to check in. \u201cSteranko, Steranko and Sirtis,\u201d says the coyote woman. \u201cThere, you\u2019re all checked in. Room 106. Enjoy your stay.\u201d Once Whitney and Destiny put away their luggage, you\u2019re about to try and escape again but then Destiny and Whitney both walk out. \u201cAlright, Destiny,\u201d says Whitney. \u201cThe sooner somebody teaches you to have fun, the better.\u201d Destiny lets out a scoff and soon she and Whitney walk outside to see the ski instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The ski instructor was a 950ft tall bahamut. She was an odd monster who resembled a titanically obese brown skinned hippopotamus except that she had gills on her neck. She also had the wings, claws and scales of a dragon. She also had Shiny Midnight Black hair and bright red lips. She was wearing a red snow jacket and scarf with a black tank top and blue jeans. \u201cHello,\u201d says the bahamut. \u201cMy name is Elisa and I\u2019ll be your ski instructor. \u201cElisa?!\u201d you think to herself. You were surprised. You were about to joke about her appearance and find out her name ACTUALLY is Elisa. If that\u2019s not irony, you had no idea what irony was. Surprisingly, she\u2019s shaking hands with Destiny and Destiny isn\u2019t being hostile at all with her. \u201cElisa?\u201d asks Destiny. \u201cNow that sounds like the name of a friend. There are no enemies named \u201cElisa\u201d in my book.\u201d You could not believe the irony of Destiny's words. Elisa smiles at that. \u201cThanks. And in my book, there are no bad gargoyles. My best friend is a gargoyle. Right this way. We'll start with you, Ms. Sirtis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gives a scoff. \"Call me Destiny.\" This was your chance, as Destiny is lining up to ski, you make your move and try to jump out, only for Destiny and Elisa to both ski down the mountain at the same time. You are knocked to the side by Destiny's skis and you yell as you tumble in the snow and it forms into a snowball over you. \"CRAP!\" you yell as you roll down the hill. Before you can try to break out, you start to shiver. Then it donned on you; you were improperly dressed for the occasion. This sucked. You escaped Under Gloom only to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could say anything, you crash into the side of the tree and see that you had been frozen in ice. You main as you can only move your eyes. After an hour, you're still in ice and still conscious when someone walks up and finds you and that someone is....</span></div></div>",

The hippopotamus/fish/dragon hybrid flapped her wings as she flew down and gasped as she spotted you. \"Oh my gosh!\" Elisa flew down and picked up your frozen form as you mentally groan. \"This is bad,\" says the bahamut giantess. \"I better get Roxy to take a look at this. I definitely don't want to have what happened with Fatima repeat itself.\" The bahamut shoves you in her cleavage as you're mentally angry. \"I can't believe this,\" you think to yourself. \"How humiliating to be rescued by a monster. Especially one that's on good terms with that blue bane of my existence. This shouldn't even be possible. Her name is Elisa. She and that alleged warden should be enemies! That's how it's supposed to go!\" You're fuming mad but it's no use since you're still frozen as Elisa is carrying you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa returns to the lodge and immediately runs into the infirmary. Nearby, Destiny is twitching as she drinks a cup of hot cocoa. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asks Whitney. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Destiny. \u201cI sensed a disturbance. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s something really nasty in the area.\u201d In the infirmary, from what you can see trapped in frozen ice, to your dismay, the nurse was a gargoyle. From the looks of it, she was a morbidly obese yellow-skinned gargoyle who looked somewhat shorter than Elisa and had long Shiny Midnight Black hair similar to Elisa\u2019s own. As you see her face, you let out a moan. \u201cYou have got to be kidding? There are two Elisa lookalikes in the lodge?! What the heck! This one arguably looks more like Elisa than the bahamut actually named Elisa.\u201d The yellow gargoyle giantess looks up at Elisa. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d she yells. \u201cWhat happened, Elisa!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Roxy,\u201d replies Elisa. \u201cI found this human frozen out in the snow.\u201d \u201cRoxy!?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cWhat kind of a stupid name is \u201cRoxy\u201d for a gargoyle? What were her parents lazy or something?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy bends over to take a look at you, giving you a view of her large boobs and fat ass as she looks at you. \u201cWell no wonder,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cHe\u2019s not even remotely properly dressed for walking out in the cold. Looks like he isn\u2019t from around... hey, wait a minute. Why is he wearing an orange jumpsuit?\u201d Elisa looked down in surprise and you give a glare at Roxy. \u201cOh my!\u201d yelled Roxy. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive. There\u2019s a chance to save him. You know what to do, Elisa.\u201d Elisa lays your frozen form on the table and your eyes move and see Elisa opening her mouth wide, giving you a good view of her large hippo-like teeth. Then you see a light coming from her throat. \u201cOh no!\u201d You mentally scream as the bahamut breathes a stream of fire to melt the ice right before the ice is finally melted away and you let out a scream. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, you stupid hippopotamus-headed fatass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy and Elisa both look in shock and Elisa is somewhat miffed. \u201cHow\u2019s that for gratitude?\u201d asks the rather annoyed hippo woman. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for us, you\u2019d freeze to death.\u201d \u201cAnd nearly get burned to death by you!? I don\u2019t think so! I didn\u2019t come to an Elisa-lookalike convention by choice.\u201d Elisa looks in confusion. \u201cBut my name <i>is</i> Elisa.\u201d You then turn around and look up at Roxy. \u201cAnd now we got the gargoyle variety. This just keeps getting better. I hate gargoyles! What good are they? By the way, Elisa is supposed to be enemies with the blue-skinned tyrant!\u201d Elisa then realized something. \u201cOh my gosh! This must be an escaped convict from Under Gloom. He probably hitched a ride on Destiny in order to escape.\u201d \u201cDid you figure that out by yourself, or did your mother help you out, hippo hips!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we should tell Destiny?\u201d asks Roxy. Elisa gives a hippo-like snort. \u201cIt isn\u2019t nice to spoil somebody\u2019s vacation. Believe me, I heard that Destiny was a horrible crank.\u201d \u201cThat Demona is the bane of my existence!\u201d you yell. \u201cAll she does is make me miserable! I hate her guts!\u201d Roxy looks in surprise. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular ball of anger.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re a regular ball of lard!\u201d Roxy gives a look of shock and then grits her teeth as her eyes turn bright red. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d \u201cYou heard me, you fat lemon bitch! You\u2019re so fat that children use your ass as an umbrella when it rains. Continents sink the moment you step on them! You are the most morbidly obese gargoyle I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Roxy then gives an angry shriek and tries to punch you into oblivion as Elisa has to hold her back. \u201cGood grief! No wonder Destiny\u2019s always so angry. With that guy around, it would be impossible for her to not get angry.\u201d \u201cLet me at him, Elisa! I\u2019ll teach that punk some manners.\u201d You stick your tongue out right before Roxy overpowers Elisa and grabs you. \u201cYou know,\u201d she says. \u201cNormally I like humans. My best friend is a human.\u201d You stick your tongue out and gag at that thought. \u201cBut you are pushing it. Normally my partner keeps me from doing something reckless, but he\u2019s sick in bed. I have half a mind to hand you over to Destiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just give Roxy the finger and she growls. \u201cOh, why should I bother Destiny. Elisa, let's show this miserable creep some manners.\" Elisa gives a snort. \"You don't have to tell me twice. I heard about him. That's Wade Wilson, the most obnoxious prisoner in Under Gloom. I have an idea.\" Elisa then snatches you from Roxy and makes you grunt. \"Hey, you stupid hippo! I oughta...!\" Before you can yell, Elisa takes a piece of sticky tape and puts it over her mouth to gag you. Then she takes another piece of tape and then sticks you to...</span></div></div>",

Destiny is so mad that veins appear on her body. What's worse was that she and her curves were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou despised Destiny but you couldn't help but stare at her naked breasts bigger than asteroids and her blackhole like love tunnel that was opened wide.

Perhaps you need a new warden.\" Then Destiny turns and gives an evil psychotic smirk your way. \"Or maybe you just need an <i>old</i> warden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny laughs insanely as she walks up to the phone outside her bathroom. \"Uh-oh.\" You say. Destiny took the phone and dialed up the numbers before she heard the ringtone. \"Hello,\" she said. \"Marina. It's Destiny.

I've tried every punishment and torture that I could think of to try and put him in his place but he's still giving me a hard time about it.

You finally pushed her to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before there's a knock on Destiny's door. Destiny walks up to it, wearing a towel to hide her nudity.

She and violet hair worn in a bob cut an usual for a koala, she had large fangs at the sides of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing nothing more than a red loincloth and bra that leaved little to the imagination. \"He Destiny.\" Says the koala giantess.

You were in your pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the ride!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, hell no!  You grab onto the inside of the pocket-like skin and start pulling yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you try to climb out, the drop bear threw back her head and laughed, \"Already trying to get away?

I can already tell that you'll be <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><u><i><b>FUN!</b></i></u></font>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale, not liking that at all.

That was REALLY bad for you, because from what she was saying, YOU were going to be her entertainment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster woman, who looked like  she was in her early 50s. (It's kinda hard to pinpoint monster ages), smacked her pouch, right where you were currently climbing, stunning you and causing you to drop back to the bottom. Marina cackled again \"Your climbing and the way you went tumbling down both really tickled!\" she said, grinning. \"Say, tiny... wanna know why my kind are called \"drop bears\"? We inhabit treetops and attack our prey by dropping onto their heads from above, usually ass-first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I take it you wanted to jam me up your fluffy ass and grind my bone to make your bread, Eucalyptus-breath?\" you snapped up at her from her pouch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar from being insulted, Marina hooted with amusement, \"Scrappy little troublemaker AND headstrong with going against the better judgments of common sense by insulting a giantess? I'm REALLY going to enjoy every last second of messing with you! I never had to deal with someone like that at my old job, and no doubt it'd gratt my nerves if I was still working at the hoosegow. But since I need to keep busy since I have too much time on my hands and nothing to do with it all, you're PERFECT! As for what you said just now...I could have, but I prefer formal introductions with my big butt. When I get home, you can bet you will. And F.Y.I. shortie: If you thought Destiny was bad, when I ran Under Gloom, the safest places for the ones in there were the cells! Even the guards felt that way! And that was about the idea of my shadow being over them! Like I said, we drop bears attack our prey by dropping onto their heads from above, usually ass-first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAY WHAT?! Oh...that wasn't good! If the guards felt threatened by the idea of her shadow...no wonder Demona gave you to this psycho marsupial! You scramble to climb up the interior of the pouch again, but the pouch suddenly opened wider and you saw the silhouette of what looked like a giant misshapen spider enter the pouch, heading for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna getcha, you little amusement! Ha! Not even home yet, and you're already breaking my boredom! I love it! Damn Destiny should have sent you to me long before now! I can't even decide if I WANT to tame you, you're so fun!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of your over 9000,000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 times you had attempted escape from Under Gloom, you never even imagined things would end like this! The ennui-repellent of a carnivorous koala-woman! You ran  as much as you could. Occasionally you had to climb the inside of the pouch again, only to have to go sideways or diagonally or even let go and drop to the bottom to avoid this crazy monster's grabbing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your scampering feels good in my pouch, little bug! Come to mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a nightmare! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she  started her car and drove off, heading home. The G-forces of that made it so you were instantly propelled to the back of the pouch and Marina grabbed you with her free hand that she had stuck into her pouch. \"Sorry bug, as fun as you are, we'll need to wait a bit, now that we're heading to your new home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive took hours while you sweltered from the mixture of the heat from Marina's fur, the warmth of her hand around you, and the heat of her pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, I'm glad you're not boring, bug, otherwise I'd just kill you. I live alone and have been needing something to keep me busy, and you're it.\" Marina chatted absently as she parked and got out of her car, then climbed up a set of what felt like stares and you heard heard a lock click open before she entered and you heard a supersized door shut.

There appear to be eucalyptus plants in pots at every corner of the house and a chandelier made of human skulls attached to the ceiling much to your surprise. There was one shelf that had a few dolls of yowies that appeared to be there for simply decoration. The floor was covered in a carpet that looked like the flag of Australia and in the center of the room was a glass coffee table. You even see a photograph on the mantle that depicted Marina as the warden with Destiny in a uniform that was identical to Belladonna's albeit with holes for her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see your drop bear captor smiling fiendishly at you. \"I knew that Destiny had what it took when I made her my successor.

Although what possessed Destiny into giving her previous position to that two-faced scorpion cat, I'll never know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to fake bravado and grit your teeth. \"You don't scare me, you overgrown teddy bear!\" you shout. \"I'll be out of here in...\" Marina just laughs so hard that it shakes her jiggling body. \"Oh no, oh no, oh no, my little entertainment, you're never getting out. In fact, you'll be staying with me, for the rest of your life. Just deal with it, criminal.\" She then pokes you in the throat with one of her claws as you gag. This was just great, stupid Destiny. Thanks to her you were going to be a slave to this giant killer koala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Marina got an evil idea and she spots a jar of gum on her coffee table. Marina took a handful of the gum and tossed it into her mouth, with you screaming afterwards. You look around just as Marina closes her mouth. It smells like eucalyptus and carrion in there but that was the least of your worries as you see the gum all around yourself. \"No! you yell. \"No, no, no, no! Ah!\" Marina begins to rapidly chew the spearmint gum, tangling you in it. You try to move but it's far too sticky and you can't even scream because some of it got into your mouth. Marina is careful not to chew on you but then the koala wraps the gum around her tongue and blows a bubble with you screaming inside as she looks in amusement, pops the bubble with a claw and then slurps you back into her mouth to blow another bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for twenty minutes before Marina pulls your sticky body out. You're screaming because your eyes were stuck with the gum. Marina lets out a laugh as she holds you up to her mouth and then licks the gum off. \"You are one sick bitch!\" you yell. Marina let out a laugh. \"Ooh,  you're really fun, insect. I guess Destiny was too uptight to enjoy you herself. Her lose. Now the real fun can begin.\"</span></div></div>",

With no concern whatsoever she pushes in the stopper and lets the water fill up into a nice steamy pool and then takes you and drops you in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou feel it getting warmer but you can\u2019t turn to look around. Then without warning something grabs you by your legs and then you are turned upside down and carried over a pool of water and then you drop. You hit the scolding hot water face first and sink. You tried to get some air but you can\u2019t, you're drowning. You struggle to move your arms and kick your feet\u2026your legs break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t breathe but your legs are now breaking free and you kick your way to the surface. You break the surface and your arms like magic spread out to keep you up. Air. Sweet air fills your lungs then you are sucking in water. Large objects are drowning you and then you are grabbed and nearly pulled apart as your legs go one way and your torso is pulled another. You try to make it up for air but only get a gulp before you are cascaded down again and rolled into a ball and squeezed then wiggled out then rolled again and squeezed. OH, AH, AAAH, you scream losing all your air as your arms and legs are bent back and forth and strained.You yelp, wriggle and flinch in the water and the subsequently added chemicals and vigorous scrubbing via stiff bristle-brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes fray quickly under this stress, and you realize that Marina's deliberately removing them when she starts to peel away the more stubborn pieces, like your shoes. Finally, she seems satisfied, as she pulls your naked form from the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re beaten and you give in ready to die when a vice grip grabs you by the head and starts lifting you up out of the water. You can\u2019t move. You\u2019re too badly hurt as Marina dries you efficiently and roughly with a hand towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, my little entertainment incest. Now to get rid of those covers you were wearing...you'll never need them again.\" Marina cooed laying you on the counter, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she mean by that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet-red koala bear took your clothes up in one hand and raised them over her head and looked up, opening her mouth and dumped them all down into her waiting mouth. You stared as the former warden gulped down your clothes. WHAT THE HELL?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her little snack, Marina turned and smirked down at your prone form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...Remember what I told you about why my kind are called \"drop Bears\", my bug? Time to feel it all over!\" she cooed wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale. Oh CRAP! THAT'S what she meant by the bath from hell?! Marina cackled as she swept you up into her hand and carried you to the love seat that she had instead of a couch and dropped you onto the cushion, making SURE you were face up, and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape at the sheer size of her butt as it looms over you. Even for a monster, saying she was bottom heavy was an understatement. How could ANYTHING that massive even exist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready to be formally introduced to your owner's booty, my eeny-weeny buggy?!\" she laughed, shaking it over you. You couldn't answer. you were too shocked. Then the Drop bear started singing softly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The itsy-bitsy buggy<br>\r\nMade Destiny Shout<br>\r\nDown came Marina's booty<br>\r\nAnd knocked the buggy out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last line, Marina slammed her booty down on you like two meteors of Armageddon and starts wiggling and bounce her rump on top of you and causing you pain. You try to bite her but that only makes the Drop Bear giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So feisty! I'm NEVER gonna tire of you, bug! NEVER!\" she hooted as you felt yourself baking underneath her from the combination of Marina's body-heat and her fur. It felt like an oven!  Marina's fur was everywhere you could see, and since you were bare butt naked, it feels like the bristles of a broom are running all along your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter who knew how long of being ground into the cushion by her massive ass like a stain...     </span></div></div>",

You're even gagging and gasping for breath as the drop bear lets out an evil laugh. She peels you off and brings you up to her face. \"Have enough yet, mate?\" asks the koala giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\" You say weakly. Marina just lets out a vile sounding laugh and shows her fangs. \"You really don't learn your lesson at all do you. No wonder Destiny couldn't handle you. She was always so uptight. That's why I made her my second in command. Good for demoralizing the criminals, but she never did know how to have fun. I wonder how that daughter of hers is doing. Let's hope that apple fell far from the tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina lets out a laugh and you respond by giving her the finger. The drop bear responds by giving a grin and scratching you in the crotch to make you scream in absolute pain. \"I could almost strangle those walking garbage disposals, Cree and Clover. It was Destiny's idea to hire those two but I wish that they left some human prisoners alive so we could've had some fun. Oh well, I guess one is better than nothing, especially when that one is a puissant who just can't learn his lesson. I've got a chillingly good idea for some further torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina lets out a laugh and you're in too much pain from your wounded crotch to care. You were legitimately scared for your life. The previous warden was an even bigger bitch than Destiny was. You really hope that <i>Marina's</i> predecessor wasn't still alive because if you had been given to whatever bitch was around back when this killer koala was only the vice warden, you wouldn't even last one second. You were shaking as Marina puts you in the kitchen and taps you to a cutting board. She then slams a large knife dangerously close to you and you scream right before she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Marina. \"Don't you worry. I've got something more delicious in mind.\" Marina digs into her cupboard to take out a large glass that she slips some cubes of ice into. Then she opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of a strange aqua blue liquid you can't even identify and then puts in more ice and then a giant straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina twirls the straw around and gives an evil look your way before she painfully rips off the tape and makes you scream as your skin is nearly torn off. It is so red and irritated that you're convinced that she even took off the muscle. You're sweating bullets as the koala woman lifts you up and tapes you in front of her grinning mouth and you see her fangs. No koala should have teeth that sharp. Then Marina drops you into her drink and you scream because the drink was colder than a frozen hell. Marina sticks in the straw and spins in around to create a whirlpool that sucks you screaming under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bounced off of the ice cubes and whatever that strange liquid was, you were forced to close your eyes as it irritated them. It was so cold your blood was frozen and you couldn't move your limbs. You can even feel suction and you gasp as the liquid is being sucked into the vortex in the straw. You are sucked into the steam and in Marian's mouth. You're powerless to stop Marina's tongue as it swishes you around the cold cold liquid that seems to bubble in the koala woman's mouth. She wouldn't swallow you, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina swishes the liquid around for ten minutes before blowing you out through her straw and swallowing that cold liquid. You lie motionless on a giant cube of ice and gasp for breath as Marina licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" says Marina. \"What to do with you next?</span></div></div>",

You're gonna go to the door but Destiny steps in the way and you have to hide under her kitchen table. You hear a grunt and sure enough, Destiny stops in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I heard something for a moment,\" she says in a suspicious tone as she walks to the microwave with a frozen pizza. \"I was sure the exterminator got rid of my ant problems.\" Looks like you have to lay low. \"Oh well,\" says Destiny as she puts the pizza in the microwave. \"A tarantula and sea urchin pizza should fix that.\" You mentally gag. Monster food was always so gross. You have to hold onto the table leg as Destiny taps her foot, waiting for her pizza to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon hear a ding and Destiny brings the pizza back to the table. \"She's gonna eat that whole pizza?\" you ask yourself. \"Pig.\" However, as Destiny is about to cut the pizza, the pizza cutter falls out of her hand and near the floor. You scream as the pizza cutter nearly falls on you and cuts you in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Destiny heard your screaming and grunts in confusion. As she reaches down to pick up the pizza cutter, she looks at you and her eyes pretty much pop out of her head before glowing red with rage. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADE!\" she shouts at the top of her lungs. \"Aw crap.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Destiny has you trapped under a wine glass on her kitchen table as she angrily bites into a slice of her pizza. \"So,\" she says with a mouthful of pizza. \"You tried to escape by hitching a ride on the warden to her own house. I don't know if you're ballsy or just stupid.\" \"Well the fact is I'm the first prisoner to escape from your Under Gloom craphole, Warden Demona.\" Destiny pounds her fist on the table before chewing on a second piece of pizza. \"You're walking on thin ice Wilson! I just got your record from all the crimes you committed in the human world. Grand theft auto, arson, destruction of property, bootlegging. There's enough here to keep you locked up for at least a decade and trying to escape doesn't win you any brownie points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny eats a third slice of pizza and you just have to take a jab at her. \"Oh yeah, we'll you're nothing more than a real life Demona who hasn't done anything but eat pizza since the show ended and it's all going to your ass!\" Destiny grits her pizza sauce covered teeth and glares at you. \"You're playing with fire Wade.\" She says as veins appear on her neck and her blue skin turns more purple. \"On thin ice, playing with fire. Make up your mind you stupid gargoyle bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gets so frustrated, she shoves two more slices into her mouth and chews ferociously. \"You should consider yourself lucky that I <i>am</i> a gargoyle. Did you know that gargoyles are the monster species least likely to eat humans? We have an instinct to protect humans, which unfortunately, extends to people like you. If you ask me, they should've dropped that bearded pig to his death. But you're seriously pushing your luck Wade. You're <b><i>really</i></b> tempting me to reconsider my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try you big blue cow!\" Destiny rips the slice of pizza off of her latest slice and chews angrily and while her mouth is too filled with pizza to yell back, you decide to really insult her. \"And while I'm at it, I saw your school picture, Demona! Nice mouth metal! And also, I've seen a lot of ugly babies but that eggplant skinned horror you unleashed on the world takes the cake! I'm surprised you didn't have to pay somebody to get that close to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny swallows her pizza before responding and she lets out a angry Godzilla style roar as she holds up her claws. She's so angry that she can't even speak clearly. You let out a laugh as you watch her lose control but then you hear scratching and see her digging her claws into the table as she looks down at you, growling and drooling like an angry dog with eyes glowing red. You actually gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, you did it this time, now Destiny's more pissed at you than ever. What now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Destiny opens a door, you see something that immediately gets your attention. There was a young gargoyle girl, you'd say in her twenties (though you knew absolutely nothing about how long monsters lived). She was the same size as Destiny and looked like her in the face except she had purple skin, long brownish blonde hair and smaller horns than Destiny's. Additionally she was very fat in contrast to Destiny's hourglass figure. Then you remember that baby gargoyle from the photo. That must be Destiny's daughter and from the look on her face, she did not expect to see Destiny fuming mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate,\" says Destiny trying to stay calm. \"This is not a good time.\" \"Geez, Mom,\" says Fate. \"You needed a vacation worse than I thought. What the hairy heck has you so steamed?\" Destiny points to you in your glass prison and Fate walks forward to get a closer look, only for you to flip her off to her surprise. Destiny turns her head and lets out an angry roar as Fate is forced to hold her back. \"Mom! Calm down!\" Fate turns her head again and glares at you. \"You must be Wade,\" she says. \"So I finally meet the jerk who's always driving my mom crazy.\" \"Drop dead.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny really doesn't appreciate that comment and grabs your jar before shaking it up a few times and banging it on the table to toss you about. After Destiny resets the jar, she begins to pant heavily before speaking again. \"Listen here Wade, you better watch what you say to my daughter, or so help me, I will drop you IN MY BLENDER!\" Fate just grabs herself by the chin and shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asks. \"Now you're so angry, you're threatening him. That little creep is making you crazy. All that anger is going to eat you alive. Your temper is out of control.\" \"I DO NOT HAVE A TEMPER!\" \"Better listen to the whale, Demona,\" you say. \"Wouldn't want you to get anymore gray hairs and look like the hag you are!\" Destiny roars again and from the look on her face, she almost looks ready to breathe fire if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate slaps herself in the face. \"Oh, I get it. Another wise guy. Listen here, Wade, you're not the first person to compare my mom to that <i>fictitious</i> maniac. Apparently they didn't know real gargoyles actually existed and happened to design a villain who turned out to look almost identical to somebody who was nothing like her personality wise. It wasn't very funny. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to know you look just like a cartoon villain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go sit on a church, <i>Angie</i>!\" you say as you give Fate the finger again. Destiny at this point is about ready to metaphorically and possibly literally explode. \"Fate,\" says Destiny. \"Please, go get Mommy her sledgehammer.\" However, it would seem that Fate is pretty peeved herself. You didn't know her, but from the looks of it, she was definitely calmer than that bitch who brought her into the world. Yet she was glaring at you with glowing red eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" shouts Fate before turning to her mother. \"For crying out loud, Mother! That creep is the reason why you need to take time off in the first place! Until you started babysitting the troublemaker, I've never seen you this pissed off. The closest thing to your current level of anger is a crocodile with a toothache being repeatedly poked with a stick. If he's <i>that</i> annoying, you should just feed him to Cree and be done with him. Instead, you're letting him get you so riled up that you're ruining your health. At this rate, he's going to give you a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny lets out a growl but starts to calm down before you grunt. Fate unceremoniously seizes your jar and shoves it in her cleavage. \"You need a break from this S.O.B. Which is why I<i>'m</i> going to torture him for you.\" You couldn't believe it. \"Like jerkass mother,\" you mumble to yourself. \"Like jerkass daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Destiny doesn't completely agree with the plan. \"You have no idea what you're doing Fate,\" says Destiny. \"He'll drive you mad.\" \"He's already done that to <i>you</i>,\" says Fate. \"I'll take my chances. I can handle him, I'm not a hatchling anymore. I have a job as a guard.\" \"A guard for a <i>newspaper</i>. Fate, that man is the most obnoxious and annoying inmate I've ever dealt with. What makes you think that you can handle him?\" Fate rolls her eyes. Guess the blue bat is just as overprotective with Fate as she is nasty to you. \"Mom,\" says Fate. \"Do yourself a favor and relax. I'll deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny lets out a sigh. \"Fine. Just keep your eye on him.\" Destiny kisses her daughter and then looks down on you. \"And Wade,\" she says. \"You better behave for my daughter or else. And if you give her the finger just one more time, just one more time, I'll bite your head off.\" \"I'd like to see you try, Demona!\" you yell. Destiny snaps her teeth at you and grabs her hair before yelling cueing Fate to get the heck out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate spreads her wings to fly as she carries the jaw with you in it in between her giant purple boobs. \"Good grief,\" she says. \"You know, you're a real piece of work. It's lucky for you that Mom and I <i>like</i> humans.\" \"Yeah right,\" you say. \"Bite me, Angela.\" \"How is <i>Angela</i> supposed to be an insult.\" asks Fate. You try to speak again but you're at a loss for a proper comeback. \"You're fat.\" You say with all your spite. Fate grabs herself by the forehead and grits her teeth. \"Laugh it up, shrimp. For all the trouble you've caused my mom, I'm going to put you through hell. By the time I'm through with you, your first instinct will be to rub my talons rather than insult me. Normally I'm nice to humans, but you, I will break you.\" Fate makes her eyes glow red to show how serious she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, whatever she has planned, it can't be any worse than what Destiny would do for you. So where does the big eggplant take you?</span></div></div>",

I could drop you from here.\" \"You don't have the guts, Angela.\" Fate bites her lip. \"I already told you that that's not an insult. Shut your trap until we get home.\" You just stick out your finger at Fate. You had a feeling you'd hate her as much as you hate Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Fate flies over her house which appears a rather old looking clock tower that appeared to have been modified to be inhabitable. Fate lands with a thump at the front door and reached into her panties for the key before she unlocks the front door. You give a smile. \"A clock tower?\" you ask. \"How appropriate.\" Fate ignores you as she walks inside and then lays you on the table. She begins to unscrew the jar as she glares down at you.\"You know,\" says Fate. \"You have quite the mouth on you.\" \"And you have quite the ass on <i>you</i>. You're not a gargoyle. You're a baby hippopotamus.\" \"Now you're making fun of my weight?\" asks Fate. \"Just reduce yourself to a neanderthal. I'm not some thin-skinned monster who blows her top just because somebody points out her waistline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff and then look at your surroundings. Being a clock tower there were gears in the walls and a collection of cuckoo clocks at the side of the wall. Then you see a mantle with several photographs. One depicted Fate as a schoolgirl beside her mother. Back then it appeared Fate was chubby but not as huge as she is now. Then you see a photograph of Fate with a friend of hers who appears to be a behemoth, a hippopotamus-like monster with brownish yellow skin and brown hair. Then you turn your head and see that Fate has quite a collection of crime drama DVDs and you also see what looks like Fate's security outfit hung up. From the looks of it, it's a black outfit that comes with a cap. You read the shirt to see that it says \"Daily Tombstone\" which is most likely where she works. There also appears to be a tomato plant of some kind in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dump,\" you say. \"Who would want to live in a clock tower anyway?\" \"Somebody who hates to be late for work,\" says Fate. \"And speaking of work, I fully intend to make you suffer for all you've done to my mom. She doesn't deserve what you put her through.\" \"What <i>I</i> put <i>her</i> through!? What about what <b>she</b> puts <b>me</b> through!?\" \"She wouldn't have to do it if you behaved yourself. Mom's not a bad person. She just has to be mean because she's a prison warden. Being nice doesn't get you far in that job. You're making it a lot harder than it needs to be. She's been through too much as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then smirk. \"Oh, I'm sure. Being stuck with you.\" \"Excuse me?\" asks Fate defensively. \"You heard me you grape bovine,\" you say smugly. \"You ruined her life, not me. You look to me like an unplanned burden. I'll bet that whatever man was stupid enough to impregnate that blueberry-skinned nightmare wised up and split for the hills the moment he realized you were coming.\" Suddenly, Fate becomes enraged and her eyes glow blood red as she shows you her fangs. From the sound of it, that was <i>exactly</i> what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother******!\" yells Fate. \"So you admit it.\" You say smugly. Fate lets out a loud growl. \"That does it, you little piece of scum! I'm going to settle your hash once and for all! Wait here.

While Fate is gone, you try to scale the jar in order to break out, but it's of no use and you can't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Fate returns in a skimpy black leather bikini with plastic skulls at the crotch and nipples that looked painted on her massive booty and breasts and a commissar cap along with spiked ankle and wrist bracelets. She even holds up a whip. \"It's a good thing I borrowed this costume from Beth,\" says Fate with glowing eyes. \"Because you're in for a world of pain.

From the looks of it she was 950ft tall, leaving her a head shorter than Destiny. She was wearing a tight red shirt and black pants that looked painted on her obese body and was wearing a pair of glasses. Makes sense since rhinos have bad eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Des...tiny?\" Mutters the rhino woman as she sees just how angry Destiny is. \"Uh, is this a bad time.\" \"You don't know what bad timing is, Whitney.\" Mutters Destiny as she grits her teeth. \"What are you doing here anyway?\" \"Well, Fate said you were on vacation for once and I came to visit my old friend from college. But you look stressed.\" Destiny lets out a growl and then Whitney looks past her and sees you in the glass on the table. You walks forward, shaking the entire kitchen due to her massive size and weight and then looks down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I even want to know?\" asks Whitney. You give Whitney the finger as she looks in surprise. \"Whitney,\" says Destiny, still pissed beyond belief. \"Meet Wade, the most obnoxious prisoner in all of Under Gloom. The little malcontent tried to use me to break out.\" \"Uh-huh,\" says Whitney. \"So you're the little troublemaker.\" You let out a scoff. \"Get off my case, Fox. I have enough problems with that big blue bitch on my case all the time.\" Whitney looks at you in confusion. \"Fox?\" she asks. \"I'm a wererhino, not a fox.\" Well apparently Whitney isn't aware of who she looks like, unlike Destiny. You let out a scoff. \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny pounds her fist on the table and causes it to crack slightly. \"Listen here you miserable, little creep! You're the one who's always breaking out! You wouldn't be in this mess if you were an upstanding citizen!\" \"Go to hell, Demona!\" you yell back. Destiny is ready to punch you into paste but Whitney stops her. \"Destiny! Calm down! You do realize they teach anger management at the K.D.P., where I work?\" \"I don't have an anger problem!\" yells Destiny. \"I have a <i>Wade</i> problem! Like you're one to talk! You can be pretty nasty when you lose your temper!\" \"What do you expect?\" asks Whitney. \"I'm a rhinoceros. Geez. You're letting this one little jerk mess with your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blow your tongue out at Whitney but Whitney takes it in stride. \"See what I have to put up with?\" asks Destiny. \"I should eat him myself, with the rest of my pizza.\" Whitney shivers at that thought. \"How can you even think about eating a human? That's just cruel.\" \"What do you care fatty?\" you ask. \"I care,\" says Whitney as she crosses her arms. \"Because I'm happily married to a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag at that thought. A human monster marriage? That was just wrong. \"That's disgusting!\" you yell out. \"He must be blind!\" Whitney lets out a snort. \"What did you just say?\" she asks. \"You heard me, Fox! Whatever human married you has got to be a complete and utter moron with no taste whatsoever! I'll bet the guy has fewer brain cells than a garden hose. Any human who would marry a monster is a giant sucker. Especially one married to a bloated, horn-nosed pachyderm with bad breath.\" Whitney snorts more angrily this time and grits her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is worse than Sylvia,\" she says. \"At least she isn't nasty to my face. No wonder you're such a sourpuss Destiny.\" Destiny growls, shows her fangs and nods her head. Oh, terrific, now you got two giant women mad at you. What could be worse?</span></div></div>",

I swear, that little shit's gonna make me have an aneurysm...\" She rubs her temples. \"God, Whitney; I wish I could just smash him sometimes!\" She turns to your jar and snarls down at you, to which you reply with a VERY obscene gesture that should not be discussed in polite company. You can't help but put on a smug smirk when Destiny's face turns purple with rage--her hated nickname is doubly appropriate; she really does look cartoonishly angry. You're almost disappointed smoke doesn't shoot from her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch amusement lasts all of five seconds, turning rapidly to fear when you see Whitney give you a devilish smirk. You know that look all too bloody well--it's the look monster giantesses have when they're about to toy with a tiny, helpless human. You gulp, wishing you'd kept your mouth shut. Turning to Destiny, Whitney taps her gargoyle friend on the shoulder to get her attention. \"Y'know, Destiny; I've got my own little annoyance to deal with--the little faker Sylvia. She's not as bad as Wade, but the little harlot still ratchets up my blood pressure. And Wade here trash-talked ME just now, so he's open for an attitude adjustment...just like old times, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny's anger drops off a bit and she quirks an eyebrow. \"What are you talk--\" She cuts herself off and realization hits...then she mirrors Whitney's smirk, showing more of her fangs than you've ever seen. \"<i>Oh.</i> You mean how we dealt with noisy roommates, punks who cheated off our tests and such?\" She drums her clawed fingers together, snickering. \"It's been a long time since I've done that...maybe too long.\" Her eyes flick to you, this time filled with malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh good fucking lord...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney nods, twisting the lid off your jar. \"Exactly...let's relive some old memories, shall we Destiny? You know what to do.\" The two titanesses share an acidic laugh as Whitney tosses the lid aside and reaches in to snatch you out, pinching you tight by the legs and holding you upside-down in front of her face. \"You're gonna regret pissing us off, you little punk-ass. Back in college, girls like us had ways of dealing with punks like you.\" She bobs your form around, giving you whiplash. \"Sometimes humans, other times monster guys we shrank with a little help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny suddenly clears her throat, and you and Whitney both look at her...<br>\r\nwait, why did that gargoyle bitch have that long string?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done talking to him? I want to get started.\" Destiny...<i>giggles</i>...at that. The tough-as-nails warden, the bane of your existence...<b>giggling</b>. Whatever these two had planned for you, it sure as HELL wouldn't be pleasant. Whitney laughs at that, and tosses you over to Destiny. The blue giantess rudely catches you out of the air, tying the sting TIGHT around your waist. \"Get ready, Wade--I know we're gonna enjoy this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh, Destiny moves her arm over her shoulder....and drops you, screaming all the way down, until the string goes taut and you rudely stop, whiplash throwing you perception to the wayside and the string painfully squeezing your stomach, threatening to make you vomit. A snicker from Destny and a sense of having something round and soft at your back is all you can clearly make out before your senses clear....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when things finally DO clear up, you realize that you're dangling about half-way to the floor, <i>level with Destiny's behind</i>. And that Whitney is turning around, presenting her own butt to your view...and walking backwards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the view, tough guy?\" the rhino giantess taunts, her massive derriere filling your view. \"Because it's gonna be all you see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to scream out some profanity, but any unprintable language is cut off when the twin booties make impact, sandwiching you between the flashy mounds! The pressure and pain are incredible: Destiny may have had an hourglass figure, but she stayed in good shape: her behind was more muscle than bulk--not exactly soft or padded, and coupled with her size it made her ass feel like twin boulders pressing against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for <i>Whitney</i>....as rotund as she was, she was still very much a rhino-based monster. And so, despite the sheer size of her behind; how it SHOULD have been soft and squishy...it wasn't. Her thick, armor-like skin felt like sandpaper even through her tight pants! The sheer SIZE of her rhino-butt enveloped you, and between her and Destiny's behinds you could barely move, even to trash around in pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tormentors' rumps press against each other, your feeble struggles and muffled curses making them laugh. They even wiggle against each other, squeezing you even flatter and making you scream out in pain! The torment continues for what has to be hours, gargoyle and were-rhino smashing your pitiful form between their prodigious rears, laughing up a storm at your flattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the butts separate and you suck in fresh air, coughing and twitching from the posterior assault you suffered. Alas, your relief is short-lived: you are once again rudely jerked upwards, and find yourself lying on your side in Destiny's palm as she and Whitney smile down at you. \"Haven't done that in a while...great idea, Whitney. Brings back memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..thanks, Destiny; for a minute I thought you wouldn't want to do it. So, what should we do with him next? I say we keep to our assets, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny smiles and answers.....</span></div></div>",

I'm sure she deserves this as much as you do. According to her record, you're her boyfriend.\" Although it would be dumb and even suicidal at this point, you have shoot your mouth off again. \"Oh yeah!\" you yell. \"Shows what you know, Rhino Rump! That blonde bimbo means nothing to me. I'll bet she's still waiting for me. If only she knew.\" You let out a snicker to yourself which prompts Destiny to squeeze you and cause you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney actually seems offended by your words. \"Wow,\" she says. \"You truly are a scumbag. Even Sylvia deserves better than a punk like you. I'll bet you traded her in for some shapely older woman.\" \"A trade has <i>value</i>,\" you say sounding smart. \"I <b>scrapped</b> her!\" Destiny's eyes glow bright red and you scream as she drives her claws into your ribs and causes you pain. She's furious, but then her eyes glow red and she smiles maliciously. \"Laugh now, Wade,\" says your gargoyle nemesis as she strokes your head roughly with a claw. \"Because your pain is only about to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this went pear shaped fast. You make Destiny mad all the time but this time you insulted her <i>and her friend</i> who happens to be just as much of a bitch about punishing upstarts like you as Destiny. You really did it this time. You hear vibrations and Whitney comes in with a chair from the kitchen before giving a smirk that Destiny returns. You <i>really</i> don't like where this is going. It gets even worse because Destiny  rips off your prison jumpsuit and you're now in your underwear. she then picks out some duct tape and places you on the seat of the chair before applying the tape to your wrists, ankles and just to be a super bitch, to your groin area. Yep, this was definitely going to hurt later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth titanesses look down, the gargoyle and the were-rhino and both of them are smiling. \"What's your game this time, Demona?\" Destiny lets out a growl and is about to stomp you but calms herself down as Whitney looks in confusion. \"What the heck is a Demona?\" she asks herself in her head. Destiny just exhales. \"You really are a glutton for punishment, Wade. Even when you're about to endure physical punishment, you just HAVE to be an asshole. Look where it's gotten you so far, Mr. Asshole.\" You'd give Destiny the bird but you were already in enough trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question,\" says Destiny. \"Whitney and I are going to take turns plastering you. Oh, we'll make sure NOT to kill you. But I'm feeling generous. You get to pick who sits on you first.\" Well, at least the big blue bitch is letting you pick your poison. Either one would be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you knew Destiny hated you more than anyone else and would just love to pound you into the ground. Whitney might not be so mean. After all, she said she had a human husband at home so she <i>must</i> know how to be gentle. Then again, she was obviously MUCH heavier than Destiny. If she was human sized she'd probably weigh <i>at least</i> half a ton. Perhaps you should stick with Destiny since she's the tormentor you're used to. You know next to nothing about that rhino bitch other than her way too appropriate appearance given that she's Destiny's friend and the fact that she apparently deals with psychos everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you're screwed. \"Tick, tock,\" says Whitney mockingly. \"Have you come to a decision yet.\"</span></div></div>",

You'd flip her off, but that would only make a very bad situation even worse. Destiny snaps a photograph of Whitney ready to sit on you and smirks as Whitney giggles and lowers her behind. You try to shake free but the damn tape is too stuck tight to your body and you can't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney lets out a yawn and stretches out her arms before flipping her long bright red hair and popping the muscles in her neck and shoulders. \"You should consider yourself lucky, Wade,\" she says in a mocking tone. \"Normally only Xander gets to see this side of me.But unlike him, you're not in for a pleasure, you're in for a world of unimaginable pain.\" With that, Whitney moves to the side giving you a plain view of her right cheek as she slowly begins to sit down. Whitney waves at you as you're about to be enveloped in rhino rump and at this point, Whitney's ass is coming down like an asteroid and is about to touch you. You shout out words too horrible to write down as Whitney's right cheek makes its impact with you and slowly starts to flatten you as you yell and get a mouth of light gray flesh and white fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney giggles like a schoolgirl as she sits on you and Destiny lets out a cackle. \"You're finally where you belong, Wade,\" she says. \"Oh, I've been holding this back way too long. Whitney, try not to kill him. I'm not done indulging this urge to put that transgressor in his place.\" Whitney lets out a scoff. \"Don't worry Big D,\" she says. \"I know how to sit on humans without killing them. How do you think Xander and I have sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're cursing and mumbling underneath Whitney's hulk. It feels like a thousand mountains pressing down on you. It's a miracle you're not turned into a giant red smear on the pachyderm giantess's rear. You have never seen a monster with an ass this big. Leave it to Destiny to have a wererhino as a friend. And to think, some human willingly married this sadistic bitch. You have half a mind to track down this 'Xander' and beat the hell out of him. But then you let out a muffled scream as you hear a cracking noise. You can't feel your knees anymore. Rhino must've cracked them like eggs. This was so not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it weren't bad enough, things heat up as Whitney accidentally lets out a large fart that causes your eyes to burn. Whitney actually blushes at that as Destiny grabs herself by the mouth and tries to fight back the urge to laugh. Keyword, <i>tries</i>. \"Dang,\" says Whitney nervously. \"I actually didn't mean to do that.\" Even though your mouth is full, your lungs ache anyway and your body is way too numb to move. It was official, you were in hell and these two bitches were your tormentors. And you thought you were screwed enough with Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney then decides to shake her behind in the chair, causing you even more pain. You're almost hoping that you don't survive this. Whatever horrible pain Whitney would inflict on you would PALE in comparison to what Destiny might do to you. Aside from Destiny's hysterical laughter, all you can hear are more snapping noises. Your bones were breaking and you feel as if some of them were already beyond recovery. Destiny and Whitney <i>definitely</i> weren't screwing around anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torment goes on for another hour and Whitney gets up. At that point, the duct tape had come undone and while it was still stuck to you, it had gotten stuck with you to Whitney's gigantic ass. Destiny takes a good look at you and sees that in the state you're in, you look a lot like a zombie. She gently removes the tape and you from Whitney's ass and then she rapidly rips off the tape, starting with the tape at your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a blood-curdling scream as Destiny smirks. \"Music,\" she says. \"Sweet music. You deserve all the pain that's coming to you, Wade. For breaking the law, harming an innocent monster, driving me crazy and for what you did to that poor Sylvia girl. Believe me, you're not the first man I've encountered to love 'em and leave 'em. It just gives me a whole other reason to drop you naked into hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney rubs her backside and then grins at you and Destiny. You cough up some blood before you glare at Whitney. \"What are you looking at horn face? Don't you have a human husband at home to get back to.\" \"He's at a wedding,\" says Whitney. \"In the human world. No monsters allowed. I'll just tell him I helped a friend with a little <i>pest</i> control.\" You'd really flip that hard skinned bitch off, but you couldn't feel your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny takes out more tape but this time she removes your underwear before applying it to the same places as before, just as you grunt and she tapes you back to the chair. \"Don't you think Fox has put me through the wringer enough for one day, Demona.\" You say to Destiny. Surprisingly, Destiny doesn't even blow her top like she usually does when you mention that hated nickname and instead gives a slasher smile. \"Funny thing,\" she says. \"I'm not even mad about that. It's my turn and I'm ready to pulverize you.\" Destiny laughs like an evil witch as it looks like her eyes are going to bulge out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were really afraid.

You didn't even want revenge any more; just to get away from these sadistic, vengeful giantesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no escape. Destiny stomped back into view again, now wearing a bright red bikini that looked even tighter than Whitney's; the thing might have been painted on. And rather than Whitney's rhino-flab, Destiny's rear looked toned and muscled as she turned around and hovered it over you, smirking demonically. \"Like the view, Wade?\" she taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whitney already used that line, bitch!\" You try to sound defiant, but there was a tremble in your voice. You were more afraid than mad now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA camera clicks as Whitney takes a picture. \"That's the best you have?

If Whitney sitting down slowly was hellish, Destny slamming down was unimaginable.  Pain screams through your body as her butt crushes down, the tightness of her bikini constricting you and adding to the agony. The force of the impact even smashes her cheeks together, sandwiching you between them and adding even more pain. And from the loud crunches, pops, and cracks your body was making, your bones must be getting turned to jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny moans in ecstacy, slowly grinding down on you. <b><i>Yessssssss....</i></b> This is for all that you've done, Wade. Setting that innocent mummy on fire, framing that poor Sylvia girl, making my job hell with all your escape attempts--this is what you get: smashed flat under Whitney and my behinds. Humiliated. Punished by butts...oh, that feels so GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny bounces up and down, wiggles and grinds, clenches her cheeks...but no flatulence. She says that's more Whitney's thing, which makes the wererhino woman laugh. It goes on for half an hour, maybe longer. You were too delirious with pain to tell time any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last wiggle, Destiny gets up, with you plastered to her behind. She clenches her cheeks tight one last time before peeling you off. You look like a broken doll, with limbs askew and twitching. Destiny smiles. \"This is justice, Wade. You deserve all of this. ALL. OF. IT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney actually winces at seeing you. \"Jesus, Destiny! You did a number on him. I'm surprised he's even alive. I don't think he can take any more...\" she shrugs, \"Not that I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny sighs in bliss, her crazy look now gone. \"Guess he IS at the end of his rope. Well, what do you say we end this? Finish him off? Maybe squeeze him between our rumps again, or sit on him together? Or do you want another turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney thinks.... \"Hm...you want to kill him? Well, it's not like he'll be missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wade's been your problem more than mine, after all; and I don't think I'll get a chance to do <i>this</i> again any time soon.\" She shakes her large hips, \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say that great minds think alike!\" Destiny said it like she was going to see a movie, rather than agreeing to murder you. \"So, how should we kill him? Sit on him together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney taps her chin, seeming to like that; but shakes her head. \"Nah, I like that chair--don't think it could take both our weight. Only thing I want to break is this punk...Aha! How about we just finish how we started? Squeeze him between our rears!\" She rips you off the chair and holds you up to her face. The light glints off her glasses in a way that made them seem to glow demonically. \"That was fun, wasn't it Wade?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please don't...\" You beg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny was already turning around. \"Sounds good, Whitney. Tape him to your ass, though. I want the last thing Wade sees to be me...and the part of me he always insulted. Seems poetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney laughs evilly as she turns around, slapping you and the tape onto her bikini-clad rump. Your futile, weak struggles only seem to tickle her. Stretching out the moment, the wererhino woman slowly bends over, sticking her butt out. Destiny smiles sadistically over her shoulder, also bending over. She shakes her hips in glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little to the left, Witney...perfect! Stop there! Have fun in hell, Wade!\" Destiny laughs, and bends her legs to leap back. \"One...two...<i>THREE!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantessess hop booty-first towards each other--walls of flesh closing in.<br>\r\nYou barely have time to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*crunch*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney and Destiny both heard the sound, felt the sensation of tiny bones cracking. They even felt a spreading warmness--Wade splattering, now doubt--but they didn't separate immediately. They both ground their rumps against each other, sighing in bliss at the feeling of Wade's body being pulped and crushed; enjoying the further pops and snaps as his bones ground to nothing. After a few moments, they finally parted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. Felt. Incredible.\" Destiny panted, fanning herself. \"Not just getting rid of Wade, but...just the feeling of him squirming under there, how helpless he was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney chuckled and clapped her friend on the shoulder. \"The first time you sit on a human is pretty intense, even if you're NOT trying to squish them. Just ask Xander about our honeymoon! I could teach you how to do it non-lethally, if you want.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny shook off her bliss and smiled. \"You know...I might like that. Well, let's see what's left of Wade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at their rears. Whitney's once-immaculate white bikini was plastered with a red and pink stain, a tiny human-shaped shillouette marking where Wade's body had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny's red bikini was now decorated with what looked like a tiny broken doll, limbs and neck bent at unnatural angles and covered in blood. She sneered. \"Ugh, that's a bad stain...\" She peeled Wade's body off her rump and tossed it in the garbage. \"Guess we'll have to wash these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up,\" Whitney announced. She picked up her camera and snapped two more picutres--one of her rear, one of Destiny's. \"There. Now our little photo album is complete. Gotta save the ending, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny laughed. \"Heh, send me some copies. Now come on, let's wash these bikinis before the stains set in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and laughing, the two giantesses made for the laundry room, picking up their work clothes on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey barely gave Wade's torture and death a thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You even see veins appearing on her neck and laugh. Whitney however, grabs her friend by the shoulders. \"Destiny, calm down. You're letting that creep ruin your health.\" \"It would serve Demona right for ruining my life all the time.\" You say. Destiny lets out a growl and is just about ready to kill you, but Whitney is confused. \"Demona?\" she asks. \"What's a Demona?\" \"Shut up!\" yells Destiny. \"At least tell me why he calls you that.\" \"Because she's a real live Demona,\" you shout. \"All she's missing is the crown!\" \"If you don't shut up, Wade,\" says Destiny as she bears her fangs and holds up her fist. \"I'll crown <i>you</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny is all but ready to kill you but Whitney grabs her by the fist. \"And I used to wonder why you were always angry,\" says the rhino woman. \"With this guy provoking you all the time, it would be impossible for you not to get angry. I'll tell you what, I'll take Wade back to Terrordale. Since Under Gloom isn't helping his behavior, the Kaiju Disarming Plant will probably do him some good.\" \"That place isn't for people like Wade,\" says Destiny. \"The KDP is for psychos and vegetables.\" \"Exactly,\" says Whitney. \"If Kaguya can't fix him, hopefully he'll get eaten. This isn't for <i>his</i> mental health, it's for <i>yours</i>. You'll never recover if you have to worry about Wade, 24/7. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny is reluctant but she turns to you in the jar. \"Congratulations, Wade,\" she says. \"You just got a new warden.\" You stick out your tongue at Destiny right before Whitney picks up your jar. \"You know,\" says Whitney. \"You're walking on thin ice.\" \"Blow it out your tail horn face.\" Whitney gives a glare before walking out of Destiny's house to let her gargoyle friend's temper cool off. Whitney walks into a strange green car that looks like a cross between a 4x4 and a monster truck and places your jar in a upholder as she starts the car. \"So how's Destiny doing?\" asks a male voice at your side. You turn and look in surprise because next to your jar was a tan skinned human man with brown hair worn in a ponytail and a beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As hot tempered as ever, Xander,\" says Whitney. \"Right next to you is the root of her anger issues.\" \"Aha,\" says Xander as Whitney drives down the road. \"So this is the infamous Wade Wilson.\" \"Stow it, Xanatos.\" You say. \"That's pronounced <i>Xander</i>,\" says Whitney. \"Not only is he rude, but he's stupid. The guy can't even tell the difference between a rhinoceros and a fox.\" Xander has to fight back the urge to laugh at his wife's ignorance. \"He also called Destiny a weird insult,\" continues Whitney. \"I don't know what it meant but from context, he was comparing her to a really nasty cavity.\" Xander at this point can't hold back his laughter and you just glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could you possibly see in that bulldozer?\" you ask Xander. Xander shrugs his shoulders. \"I happen to have a thing for SSBBW redheads with fiery tempers. That reminds me, given how much Whitney says you fight with Destiny, the two of you should be married. It wouldn't be fair if she won the fight just by outliving you.\" You shiver at that thought. The idea of marrying a monster was blasphemous enough, but marrying Destiny would be a nightmare. The very idea might even be why her boyfriend split for the hills. \"You can't be serious!\" you yell. \"They're monsters! They're lower lifeforms!\" Whitney gives an angry glare as she keeps on driving. \"Listen here, Wilson,\" she says. \"It's an hours drive to Terrordale and I would appreciate it if you didn't act like a jerk for the entire drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up yours sandpaper thighs.\" You say. Whitney gives an angry snort and grits her teeth as Xander shakes his head. \"You're a glutton for punishment aren't you?\" \"Shut up, Zoophile.\" You say. Whitney comes to a stoplight and snorts. \"We're not even halfway to Terrordale and he's already more than I can handle,\" she complains. \"If this keeps up, I'm gonna be as bilious as Destiny by the time the day's over.\" You give Whitney the finger and she grinds her teeth before Xander calls up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blow a fuse Whitney! It's never a good idea to drive while angry.\" Whitney snorts again and seems to calm down, but then as the light turns green she glares at you briefly and feeling particularly belligerent, you pull down your pants and moon her. She lets out an angry rhinoceros like roar as she turns her attention to the road. Xander rolls his eyes. \"This is gonna be a long drive back to Terrordale.\" He gripes. \"You are so lucky I'm a nurse and a vegetarian, Wade,\" mumbles Whitney. \"Otherwise I'd kill you right here and now.\" \"You don't have the guts, you pachyderm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you and Whitney are exchanging cross words, Xander shakes his head and takes out an iPod to drown out the angry unrepeatable words filling the air.</span></div></div>",

If you're gonna be there, I'll find some way to gain immortality.\" Whitney arrives in her driveway and places Xander on her shoulder before taking the jar and walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look forward and see that the Sterankos' place was a two floor house that wasn't that far from the beach. It looked like something out of a 90s sitcom. \"What a dump.\" You say. Whitney just lets out a snort. \"I would've thought you'd find anything to be adequate given you were in prison this morning.\" \"You belong in prison!\" you yell. \"Correction. Make that a zoo!\" Whitney takes out her keys and angrily opens the door as Xander rubs her in the cheek. \"Calm down, Whitney,\" says Xander. \"Jeekers. I didn't think he'd be <i>that</i> volatile.\" Whitney walks in and sets both you and Xander on a glass coffee table before walking towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be getting dinner ready,\" she said. \"And Wade had better like it!\" Xander let out a sigh before turning to you. \"Dude,\" he says. \"Why did you have to make her this angry? When she gets this steamed, sex is out of the question.\" \"I did you a favor,\" you say in response. \"That's bestiality! I really hope you two don't ever have children.\" Those words actually get to Xander. \"I would <i>like</i> to be a father, but Whitney doesn't want any kids. She says with the mental patients she deals with everyday, a child would just be one more thing to take care of.\" You let out a scoff and give a smug grin at that. Xander just turns his head. \"I hope you get eaten by a hydra.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just turn your head and look around the place. As much as you hate to admit, Whitney's place was pretty nice. You see several photographs on a mantle. One was a wedding photograph of Whitney and Xander. You mentally gag. \"Isn't it illegal to marry a monster?\" you ask. \"You should be in prison.\" \"Funny thing about that,\" says Xander. \"Humans are considered food almost everywhere in the monster world, but nowhere is it illegal for a monster to marry a human. I'm from New York, I've seen stranger.\" You then see a photograph of another were rhinoceros, a blonde with grayish green skin and a hunched back. In the photograph with this older rhinoceros was what looked like a male fairy, less than half her height but with a disfigured face and skin that was white on one side and black on the other. \"And I thought Darcy was ugly.\" You say. \"Those are my in-laws,\" says Xander. \"Susan and Grayson. Don't get me started. The only cons I can see in marrying a monster is a supercilious mother-in-law and a mistrusting father-in-law. Thankfully Whitney's sister is more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see another photograph, another rhinoceros, except this one looked younger than Whitney and resembled a black rhinoceros. She was dressed like a goth girl. \"Looks like Shego.\" \"Funny you should mention that,\" says Xander. \"Noreen hates her real name so she'd rather go by Shego instead.\" That's when you hear Whitney calling. \"Dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you're joining Whitney and Xander for dinner, albeit it isn't what you'd call dinner. It was mostly grass salad with fried dandelions and thorns and even some flowers you couldn't identify. Xander didn't mind eating it but you sure did. \"You call this dinner?\" you ask. \"This stuff looks worse than prison food! Where's the meat?\" \"Wererhinos don't eat meat.\" Whitney says. \"You expect me to believe that snow job? There's no such thing as an herbivorous monster!\" Whitney just glares at you. \"Then maybe I should go carnivore right now and eat you, if I wasn't afraid of poisoning myself.\" You just stick out your tongue at the rhino giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, you little jerk. I told Destiny I would take you to the KDP to fix your attitude so you better behave yourself until then or so help me, I will give you to Cassandra.\" \"Who the hell is that? One of your retard patients.\" Whitney snorts angrily and then places you in a smaller jar that the one you were in before. Whitney lets out a yell of frustration. \"Son of a bitch, Xander!\" yells the rhinoceros giantess. \"If this keeps up, I'll have to admit myself into the KDP.\" However, Xander rubbed his chin. \"Maybe we don't have to send him to the KDP after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney snorts in confusion before Xander climbs her hair up to her ear. \"Your sister lives in Screamtown, right? Perhaps a positive environment would do him some good.\" (For information on Screamtown, see this link, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1940957-Monster-Cove\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney actually seems to consider her options?

I'm taking him to the K.D.P. and that's that. Maybe if we're lucky, Eartha will eat him alive.\" \"Screw you F...\" \"I am not a fox!\" yelled Whitney. \"Dammit! Get your species correct! Do I look like a dog to you!?\" You stick out your tongue and Whitney lets out an angry snort as veins appear to run down her neck. Xander shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Whitney has you sleeping in a jar by her bed. You look out to see the rhino giantess sleeping on her stomach as her tiny human husband was wrapped up in her hair. From the looks of it, Xander is wearing earmuffs. You soon learn why because Whitney snores loud enough to wake the proverbial dead and you're forced to plug your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at the KDP, there appear to be twelve orderlies gathered in the office of the doctor in charge. There was an obese owl woman resembling a great horned owl with orange red hair and bright green eyes along with talons for hands. She was wearing a rose colored two-piece bikini. Next to the owlwoman was a chocolate furred BBW pegasus woman with long white hair and Oreos tattooed to her thighs. She was wearing a one piece pink bikini with a cowgirl hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the pegasus and the wereowl was a cockatrice, an hourglass shaped creature with the lower body of a green dragon but upper body of a chicken. She was wearing an orange two piece bikini and was holding hands with her girlfriend, a muscular red-skinned Jersey devil with long pink hair and a blue two piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Jersey Devil girl was a muscular blue skinned werecrab with violet hair and large eyestalks. She wore a red one piece bikini and one of her claws seemed bigger than the other. There were two more monsters holding hands. One was a white behemoth, a monster resembling a hippopotamus with the skin of a dragon and an elongated tail. She wore a two-piece yellow bikini and had long golden blonde hair with a pair of thin glasses. The behemoth woman was with her wife, a bahamut, a giant light blue monster resembling a hybrid of a hippo, a fish and a dragon. She wore her head in a bob cut. It was red but given the black highlights, it was clearly dyed and the bahamut lady also wore a purple two-piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a fat yellow skinned Shishi resembling a Chinese guardian lion. She wore thin glasses and a green bikini. Next to the Shishi was an obese silver furred werewolf in a two piece gray bikini. She somewhat resembled Persephone except older and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final three orderlies were late arrivals. There was an elderly purple skinned European dragon resembling a female version of Spyro with long white hair, glasses and a black bikini. The dragon woman was using a cane to walk and she was assisted by a different kind of dragon, a black skinned six legged salamander with cyan hair and a bikini of the same color. From the looks of it, the salamander was the other dragon's granddaughter. The last one was a monster that looked like a strawberry blonde haired mock turtle. She had the scaly arms of a green sea turtle complete with the shell but the head, feet, legs and udder of a white and red furred minotaur. She wore a yellow-green bikini attached to her shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there the doctor in charge walked in. She was a violet haired Japanese woman with golden ears and feet of a fox with nine tails. She was a kitsune. \"Alright everyone,\" she says. \"I think you all knew why we're having this meeting?\" \"What meeting?\" asked the werewolf woman. \"What was that?\" asked the purple dragoness as she put a trumpet to her ear. \"Grandmother,\" said the salamander to the dragon woman. \"Shush.\" \"Thanks Tori,\" says the kitsune to the salamander woman. \"Now, Whitney has made a deal with Warden Sirtis of Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mock turtle woman dropped her cigarette on the ground and made a look of horror at that comment. From the sound of it, she was a born criminal and was hiding it from the other orderlies. \"They'll be another addition to the K.D.P. Another human patient.\" The werecrab woman begun to drool and snap her claw and the behemoth licked her lips while the bahamut woman turned her head and started to sweat. Behind the kitsune woman was a cage with Sylvia, that blonde you seduced a long time ago and it looked like she was listening in on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were owl then gave a smug smile. \"Excellent idea, Dr. West. I mean, after all. Another human might help to get Sylvia's raging psychosis under control. Might even cure both of their conditions. I have an idea, let's...\" \"Shut up Virginia!\" yells the pegasus, shishi and cockatrice at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, everyone,\" says Dr. West. \"The patient is an inmate of Under Gloom who is being brought here for the good of the warden's sanity and mental health.\" The mock turtle woman gives a smirk upon hearing those words. The door opened and Whitney walked in carrying you in a jar. \"Ladies,\" said Whitney. \"This is Wade Wilson, the most obnoxious troublemaker in all of Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crab, behemoth and cockatrice woman all give looks at you in the jar. The were crab woman even begins to drool as she looks at you and you give her the finger. \"Don't even think about it, Lilith,\" says Whitney to the crab. \"He'll probably give you food poisoning.\" \"What's in the jar?\" asks the werewolf woman. \"Diana,\" says Whitney. \"All you need to know is that this human is not to leave the KDP.\" You're about to badmouth Whitney again but you take a quick look at Diana's face and see that she looks a lot like Persephone. You even rub your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade,\" said Whitney. \"These are our orderlies; Virginia, Abilene, Gail, Charlene, Cressida, Tori, Cyprus, Tress, Diana, Jedda, Lilith and Tarja.\" She is referring to the owlwoman, pegasus, cockatrice, Jersey devil, purple dragon, salamander, behemoth, shishi, werewolf, bahamut, werecrab and mock turtle respectively. \"And this,\" says Whitney as she shows you to Dr. West. \"Is Dr. Kaguya West. P.S. <i>That</i> is what a fox looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. West looks at Whitney as if she said something completely crazy. \"Whatever, horn-face,\" you say. \"In one day I'll be out of this freak farm. And that goes double for you. I'm surprised you could only fit nine tails on that bloated ass of yours.\" Dr. West gasps and looks back at her nine-tailed rear before speaking. \"What a terrible attitude. Put him in with Sylvia and we'll begin the treatment in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney drops you in the same cage as Sylvia and you turn to yell at the monsters. \"Oh yeah, you ain't no prison guards like Cree or Clover! Just a bunch of nannies to a bunch of half brain-dead babies.\" \"Wade?\" asks Sylvia behind you. \"Is that you?\" You turn and face Sylvia and are surprised to see her. You seduced her a long time ago in order to break into a safe that was in her house in Kansas to steal her family's money. But there was too much heat so you abandoned the plan. But from the looks of it, Sylvia still carried a torch for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade,\" says Sylvia. \"I thought I'd never see you again.\" \"Enough chit-chat, doll,\" you say. \"We gotta get out of this nut hole.\" \"I've been trying ever since I got here,\" says Sylvia. \"Not exactly easy with Whitney around.\" While obviously you couldn't care less whether or not Sylvia escaped with you as long as you got out, but perhaps she could be useful in helping your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be a problem,\" you say. \"All we need is to get past Fox Xanatos over there and the twelve terrors.\" \"You don't know Whitney like I do,\" says Sylvia. \"She.. huh, you're right. I never noticed how much Whitney looks like Fox Xanatos. But that's beside the point. You don't know how many insane monsters are in this building. If we're to escape. We need a plan.\" \"So,\" you say. \"Let's have it.\" \"We have only an hour to come up with one,\" says Sylvia. \"Before Dr. West checks up on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one hour...</span></div></div>",

First is Lilith, the crab woman. She's nice and courteous towards the monster patients, but there's nothing she likes to eat more than humans. She's even talked about eating me with melted butter.\" A crab eating a human in melted butter, how ironic.

She's the oldest orderly in the building. She celebrated her 1000th birthday a few months ago.\" \"A thousand years old?\" you ask. \"She's ancient.\" \"Dragons can live for a very, very, very long time,\" says Sylvia. \"But Cressida's senile, arthritic, nearsighted and her nerves are shot. She can't even breath fire without hurting her throat anymore. She's the weakest of the guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh. \"Then why do they keep her around.

Bleck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's also that bigmouth owl woman, Viriginia,\" says Sylvia. \"She's a no-nothing know-it-all who treats me like I'm some gormless cavewoman. She thinks she's so smart but I know she's just a birdbrain.\" \"Then why not tell that bird to piss off?\" you ask. Sylvia lowers her head. \"She's the closest orderly to Whitney.\" \"Figures,\" you say rudely. \"She's no owl. She's a lapdog. Who else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Sylvia. \"There's one orderly I'm friends with.\" You couldn't believe it. Sylvia friends with a monster? That's appalling. \"Are you kidding?! They're monsters! They're the enemy.\" \"Not Charlene,\" says Sylvia. \"She's the only one who knows the truth behind why I'm here.\" \"Charlene?\" you ask. \"That Jersey devil woman? You're friends with that horse head.\" \"That's the one,\" says Sylvia. \"But I have to warn you. Charlene doesn't like human men for some reason.\" You let out a scoff and then Sylvia begins to shiver. \"It's her girlfriend that's the problem. That horrible cockatrice, Gail. Gail wants to turn Charlene into a human-eater.\" You knew a monster that didn't eat humans was too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of couples, there's also the Starking-Potter couple. Jedda the bahamut and her wife, Cyprus the behemoth.\" \"The hippo heads?\" you ask. \"Jedda is undergoing therapy,\" says Sylvia. \"She wants to stop eating humans.\" \"B.S.\" you mumble. \"Well,\" says Sylvia. \"She's not having much success. Not helped by the fact that her wife practically eats nothing <i>but</i> humans. Cyprus is the second biggest man-eater in this KDP. The only good side is that she's always losing her glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the pegasus?\" Sylvia shivers and turns pale. \"Abilene,\" she says. \"That pony is anything but friendly. You see, there's a lifeguard on the beach, a human lifeguard named Stephen. I've never met him but he's got a large female monster fan base.\" You make a gesture like you're ready to throw up. \"And I take it Abilene is one.\" Sylvia nods her head. \"But Abilene is paranoid of human girls who would steal Stephen from her so she stomps any female human she sees into the ground. She hates me. She's even scarier than Tress.\" \"The shishi?\" you ask. \"By the way, that's a dumb name for a monster species.\" \"Tress is a nightmare,\" says Sylvia. \"Every time she comes in, she rapes me. I once spent three hours stuck in her butt.\" Sylvia even breaks down crying. \"Why do you let her do that?\" you ask. \"No monster is the boss of me.\" \"I have no choice,\" says Sylvia. \"If I don't comply, Tress will eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only leaves the werewolf,\" you say. \"What was her name again? Delia? Danica?\" \"Diana.\" Says Sylvia. Diana? That was the name of a Roman goddess. From the sound of it she was related to Persephone or so it seemed. \"And what's her deal?\" \"Diana's a basket case,\" says Sylvia. \"She's forgetful and clumsy. I can't even predict her. I'm not even sure if she eats humans or not. She wasn't always like this though. One of her daughters was sent to prison. Diana was so upset she had a mental breakdown.\" You were now more and more curious. \"Diana's daughter wouldn't happen to be named Persephone would it?\" You ask. Sylvia was surprised to hear that. \"You know her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes popped. Diana was Persephone's mom!? She sure didn't look like someone who gave birth to a cannibalistic serial killer. You wouldn't believe it. Especially since Diana was so fat that her ass could deflect an asteroid and Persephone was so thin. Then again, Persephone is muzzled and it's doubtful Destiny feeds her that much. \"Just out of curiosity,\" says Sylvia. \"What was Persephone in for?\" \"She's a cannibal.\" You say bluntly. Sylvia's face turns white at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you knew how the orderlies worked, you and Sylvia decide to brainstorm a plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps if Wade could see humans and monsters living together in har...\" \"Hello!\" you shout. \"Didn't you tell Demona you'd take me to that home for retarded monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney gives a snort in your face. \"Think of this as some more extreme therapy. In Screamtown, all types of monsters get along with humans quite well. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm mailing you to Noreen and you had better not give her any trouble, Mr. Wilson.\" You just blow your tongue out. \"In five seconds, I'll be running that backwater town, Fox.\" Whitney just grabs your jar and shakes it a few times before slamming it back down on the table with you in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with that guy's eyes, Xander!?\" yells your wererhino captor. \"Why does he keep calling me a fox!? We're not even similar species for crying out loud!\" Xander whispers something slightly into Whitney's ear and causes her to look in surprise. \"That's ridiculous,\" says Whitney. \"You're telling me he expects me to get offended because of <i>that</i>? Only a complete and utter hothead would blow their top about looking like a cartoon character. Exactly <i>how</i> does she look like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're pouting in your glass prison, Xander walks up to one of Whitney's massive eyes and holds out his phone to run an image search. When Whitney does see an image of Fox, she just lets out a scoff. \"That looks <i>nothing</i> like me. Idiot.\" Well, while Whitney does have a temper it turns out she isn't as easily pissed off as Destiny. Maybe you'd be able to get under his sister's skin. \"Noreen,\" you mutter to yourself. \"With a stupid name like that, it's no wonder she prefers Shego. Where the hell would their parents get a name like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Whitney is driving to the post office with you in a jar and you've been fitted with a tracking brace around your ankle. Whitney had already told Destiny the plan and from what Xander told you on the way out, she was perfectly okay with it. You take it the old hag didn't care what happened as long as you were nowhere near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Whitney arrived at the post office, at the front was a green haired banshee girl wearing heavy purple makeup and a white dress with polka dots under her postal uniform. From the looks of it, the banshee clerk was wearing chains wrapped around her body down to where her feet should've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney hands you to the clerk before explaining. \"I need this human mailed to Screamtown. 310 Autumn Avenue. Recipient's name: Noreen Steranko.\" The banshee looks down at you in the glass jar before you give her the finger. \"You do realize that we're not usually allowed to mail live food through the mail.\" \"He's going to <i>Screamtown</i>,\" said Whitney. \"So he doesn't qualify as food. \"We'll still have to charge an extra rate since you're sending a live package.\" You stick your tongue out at Whitney and cause her to glare at you. \"I don't care about the extra rate,\" says the rhino giantess to the banshee. \"Just get him to Screamtown. Hopefully it'll do him some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banshee takes your jar and puts it in a postal box before using her long fingernails to poke holes in the box so air could get in. You're banging on the jar and yelling angrily but it's of no use and you're soon shipped off on your way to Screamtown, grumbling all the way. At that time, Whitney and Xander decide to drive away. \"I hope I'm not making a terrible mistake,\" says Whitney. \"After all, Noreen is the most even tempered of the family. It shouldn't be a problem.\" \"Relax Whitney,\" says Xander. \"I would've suggested sending him to your folks.\" Xander then turns away before speaking under his breath. \"But I would not wish Susan on my worst enemy.\" \"What was that Xander?\" \"Oh, nothing dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes an entire day for the postal truck to get to Screamtown and you're gasping for air and starving. Screamtown must be really far away from Terrordale and Fearfield. Soon, your package is delivered and you're placed in a mailbox that looked like it had a door shaped like a skull. It isn't long until you hear the stomping footsteps of a particularly heavy monster, you're guessing Whitney's sister, Noreen. The door opens and reveals a thick skinned hand that appears to be wrapped in a black and dark pink fingerless glove that pulls your package out of the mailbox before taking you inside a Gothic looking house that looks like something out of a Tim Burton film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe package opens up and you look around to see that the place looked darker and more goth like inside. The rug looked like a giant spider web and the windows appear to be painted a sickly green that made them look like they were even glowing. Up above there was even a chandelier complete with candles that looked like they had anguished faces on them. There was even a shelf that had some rather spooky looking stuffed animals on it, including a stuffed skeleton of an elephant. You then look up and see that sister that Whitney mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked shorter than her older sister, but not by much. Noreen had dark a lost blackish gray skin and long black hair. She was wearing black lipstick and mascara and a pair of earrings that looked like alien skulls. Body shape wise, Noreen was just as fat as her sister and had enormous breasts to match. From the looks of it, she was wearing a black Gothic lolita style outfit complete with a large skirt with purple highlights, dark colored fishnet stockings and a black choker with a silver cross attached to it. She also had a pierced navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen looked at you with dull surprise before reading a note that Whitney left for her. \"Dear Noreen, This man is Wade Wilson, a criminal form Under Gloom. You remember my friend, Destiny? She is at her wits end with this lout and I volunteered to take custody of him. Xander figured that the positive environment of Screamtown will do him some good. Be warned, Noreen, this is a very volatile, rude and overall annoying creature. Do not let him out of your sight. Signed, Whitney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen just rolled her eyes. 'Well that figures.\" Noreen lets you out of your jar and you give a glare. \"Like I like this situation any better than you do, Shego!\" \"Well, at least somebody called me by the right name.\" Says the goth goddess. \"Listen here, you sumo-sized goth pachyderm!\" you yell rudely. \"You don't scare me like Demona and Fox did.\" Noreen just raised an eyebrow before realizing who you were talking about. \"You mean Destiny and my sister? You know, Whitney doesn't think much of human pop culture so you'd be wasting your breath with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blow out your tongues Noreen starts to walk away for something. As Noreen is walking away, you see her ass shaking and she was wearing blue panties with white ghost faces all around. You couldn't believe it. You didn't even get a rise out of her. You thought wererhinos were supposed to have hot tempers. You let out a scoff. You'll get out of here soon enough. No goth goliath was going to hold you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you grunt and look down to see you were being pulled by a strange blue vine of some kind that was covered in spikes. You turned your head and saw that the vine belonged to a giant potted plant with a large head that looked like a purple tulip with a large mouth that had two maws, several razor sharp teeth and a large green forked tongue. The plant lets out a shriek and you yell and try to get away. That thing was obviously a carnivorous plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how much you struggle, it's of no use as the plant pulls you closer towards its maw. But before it could eat you, Noreen returns with a water bottle and sprays the plant to make it let go. \"Delirium,\" she says. \"You're a naughty girl. Mr. Wade is our guest. You will treat him no different than any of our human friends in town.\" The plant lets out a slight purring growl as it pulls back its vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just turn and glare at the rhino girl. \"Your plant is mulch the next time it tries to chomp me.\" \"You don't have to worry,\" says Noreen apathetically. \"Delirium only eats bugs, lizards and the occasional fish. I have her on a strict human-free diet.\" You couldn't believe this. You were under the custody of a 950 foot tap gothic pachyderm who keeps a man-eating plant as a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window and you're confused. Outside the trees are covered in brown, yellow, red and orange leaves as if it were autumn. \"How long was I in that box?!\" you yell. \"It was Summer in Terrordale.\" \"Screamtown is split into five parts,\" says Noreen as she sits down and rubs her belly button. \"First is the center. The other four are split into Spring Street, Summer Side, Autumn Avenue and Winter Way. The town is split between the four seasons. Autumn is my favorite.\" \"That's great,\" you say rudely, I trade prison for crazy town. That's when you let out a gag because Noreen grabs you and stuffs you into her belly button as you stand on the piercing. \"What are you doing?\" \"Whitney told me not to let you out of my sight so I'm taking you with me on the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just terrific. Where was the goth colossus taking you as she walked out of the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Noreen steps out her door, you see sights that appall you. Everywhere, there were humans and monsters getting along. There was a female mandrake who was taking a nap as human kids played in her branches and from the looks of it, she didn't seem to mind it. Then you turn your head to see a bench with a werewolf, a kitsune, an orthrus and a were jackal playing a card game and from the looks of it, the werejackal had a human woman on his shoulder, apparently his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thoroughly disgusted. After all, the ideas of humans and monsters getting along was sick and wrong. You almost throw up in Noreen's naval as she walks down the street stopping as a male were lizard teenager skates by with a human girl on his shoulder. Then you notice the number of monster women. It would seem that in Screamtown, female monsters came in two types; first were obese sumo sized woman, some of which even heavier looking than Noreen as seen with a weretiger woman who was dressed as a steam punk mechanic, complete with a plumber's crack. The other type of women were muscle-bound amazons that put the Hulk to shame as seen with a yellow skinned argus woman dressed in a police uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Noreen walks through the center of the town, you can make out the corners in the distance. One corner looked like it was in perpetual winter and there were even some vampires skating on the ice as a frost giantess policewoman was on patrol. Another corner looked like it was in permanent summer given the beach and the large number of monsters in swimsuits. You hated monsters but you couldn't help but stare at monster girls in bikinis. There was one blue grootslang that looked like she was even bigger than Clover and then you turn your head to see a mixed human monster family. The mother and the oldest daughter were hellhounds but the father and the other children of the family were humans. It made you sick just watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked ahead to see where Noreen was heading. It was a section of the town that was covered in flowers and trees, obviously that was the spring section of town. There was a giant green minotaur woman tending to the flowers and a purple lou carcolh woman (a dragon/snail hybrid) delivering mail. As Noreen entered Springtime Street, you hear church bells going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in horror because walking out of the church is a newlywed couple. The groom was a human but the bride was an obese, five headed and pale blue skinned hydra woman. You look in disgust as all five heads of the hydra bride kiss the human groom. \"Ugh!\" you yell. \"What is wrong with people in this town?\" you ask Noreen. \"Why are there so many monster loving humans here?!\" \"Because in Screamtown,\" said Noreen. \"Monsters are forbidden from eating and otherwise killing humans. One of my closest friends is a wereboar with a human son and husband.\" \"A pig giantess?\" you ask. \"Figures that a Rocksteady like you would have a Bebop to waste oxygen with. What are we doing here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's flu season.\" Says Noreen. You scoffed. \"Do you have a section of town for that?\" Noreen rolls her eyes. \"Which is why we're both visiting Dr. Desdemona Weisman.\" \"Whatever.\" You mutter. But suddenly you realize something. The thing about monsters is that their names are usually a clue to their species. A name like <i>Desdemona Weisman</i>, practically screamed \"I'm a Gargoyle\". \"Oh, no freakin' way!\" you yell. \"She's a gargoyle, isn't she?\" \"Is that a problem?\" asked Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right it's a problem!\" you yell. \"I hate gargoyles! Of all monsters, they're the worst! I should know, a certain blue gargoyle makes my life a living hell every time she gets the chance!\" \"What's worse?\" asked Noreen. \"Grendel Flu or gargoyles? And F.W.I. Grendel Flu is no picnic for monsters, but it's even worse for humans.\" You stick out your tongue as Noreen walks into Dr. Weisman's office. You look forward to see a gargoyle woman refilling a syringe, most likely Dr. Weisman. Dr. Weisman was a pink skinned gargoyle who looked even bigger than Destiny and that was saying something. She was also <i>incredibly</i> ripped. You could still see she was a woman but she looked like she had more muscle on her body than the world's strongest human bodybuilder. Dr. Weisman also had long white hair reaching to her lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned around and you look in surprise. Dr. Weisman's face didn't look like any other gargoyle you've seen. Unlike Destiny's more humanoid face, Dr. Weisman's mouth was a large pointed beak, just like Brooklyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says the doctor. \"Hello Shego, you're the first one in today. This calls for my special needle.\" Dr. Weisman reaches into her drawer and you look in horror as she takes out a large syringe that appears to have several spikes going down it. She injected the flu shot into Noreen's upper left arm. Noreen didn't seem in any pain as the jagged needle went in. You're guessing that was a special needle reserved for thick-skinned species of monsters such as wererhinos like Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Dr. Weisman turned her head to face you. \"What are you looking at, banana mouth!?\" you yell rudely. Desdemona turns to Noreen who explains what was going on. \"This is Wade, Dr. Weisman. Whitney sent him to me as a favor for Destiny.\" \"Destiny?\" asks Dr. Weisman with a groan. \"You mean Destiny Sirtis. That grump. Mother Rigby, that woman is the biggest hothead I've ever met. I'm going to level with you, with her blood pressure, this woman should be dead. She's too stubborn to take time off from that terrible job of hers. One of these days, all that stress is going to eat her alive from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh but then Dr. Weisman looks down at you. \"Take a picture, Lady Brooklyn, it will last longer.\" However, Dr. Weisman gives a smirk and takes out a human sized needle but it looks elongated and the tip looks slightly bent. You gasp and try to run but the gargoyle giantess pins you down with her thumb and injects the needle into your ass as you scream in absolute pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doc lets out a laugh before pulling back the needle as Noreen smirks. \"Like it? That's my special needle for <i>patients</i> who try my <i>patience</i>.\" \"Screw you!\" you yell. \"Ouch!\" Dr. Weisman laughs again as you shake your fist at her. Noreen takes you before walking out with you. \"Thanks for the shots, Desdemona. I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a grumble. \"Who's the idiot who gave a gargoyle access to syringes. I'd like to shove that beak of hers in her ear.\" Noreen just lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere's the goth colossus going now?</span></div></div>",

I think that Maddie's place is open.\" You're too enraged to speak as you rub your backside. That shot hurt like hell. At least it wasn't filled with mutagen. Up ahead, Noreen is walking towards what looks like a monster bakery. From the looks of it the proprietress was a gorgon like Yuri. This gorgon girl was a chubby woman with purplish skin and lavender rattlesnake's for hair. She was wearing nothing more than an apron and a pair of sunglasses. However, unlike Yuri, this gorgon had no legs. Instead she had a thousand foot long lavender tail with a rattle at the end. From the looks of it, the gorgon woman was making a pie while there was a young human boy with dark colored hair and a slight scar on his cheek who appeared to be helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human and monsters in harmony,\" you scoff. \"Yeah right.\" Noreen ignores you and walks in the front door. The gorgon girl's snakes let out a hiss and clue the gorgon that she had a customer. \"Oh,\" says the gorgon. \"Hi, Shego. Who's your friend.\" \"He isn't my friend,\" says Noreen. \"My sister sent him to me.\" The human on the counter raises an eyebrow. \"Your mom must be real desperate for you to get hitched.\" You just stick out your tongue. \"Real desperate.\" \"I just came in here for two-dozen maple bismarcks.\" Says Noreen. \"Got it,\" says Maddie. \"I just made a batch. Help yourself Noreen... I mean, Shego!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were rhino places you on Maddie's counter and goes to place the bismarcks in a box as the human man walks up to you. \"I'm Rick.\" He says. \"Big deal,\" you scoff. \"Lardbutt over there told me that it was illegal for monsters to mistreat humans in this stupid town but here you are.\" \"What do you mean?\" asks Rick. \"That big fat gorgon,\" you say. \"Look at you, you're that snake butt's slave.\" Maddie's snake hair seems to hiss at you as Maddie is busy mixing pie batter. \"I'm not Maddie's slave,\" says Rick. \"I'm her employee. She pays me.\" \"Yeah right,\" you scoff. \"How could you work for that snake girl? The gorgon I know is a serial killer. One day your boss is going to chomp your bones.\" You grunt and hold your rear in pain. \"Damn that pink gargoyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desdemona?\" asks Maddie. \"Jeepers. I hope you behaved for my sister-in-law.\" \"Sister-in-law?\" you ask in surprise. \"That's right,\" says Rick. \"Maddie is married to Dr. Weisman's brother, Othello.\" \"Does she have another brother named Iago?\" you ask sarcastically. Rick shakes your head. \"Boy, you sure as nasty. Someone like you should be in prison.\" You then punch Rick and knock him to the ground just as Maddie continued to stir her pie batter. You're about to storm off, but you trip on the rolling pin the gorgon girl left out and you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wind up falling into the batter just as Maddie is it into a pie tin. You try to scream but the batter gets in your mouth. It tastes so strange that you have no idea what's even in it. As you're gagging on the batter, Noreen is too busy putting together a box of bismarcks to notice you. To make matters worse, Maddie is taking out a pie crust. You really hope that stupid gorgon sees you.</span></div></div>",

You're lucky Maddie noticed you before somebody ate you. At that moment, Noreen places two boxes of maple bismarcks on the table before she pays Maddie for them. \"I'm really sorry about bringing him here,\" said Noreen. \"He's kind of a pain in the ass.\" \"I don't mind,\" said Maddie pointing to her tail. \"I don't have an ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen takes you and her bismarcks and leaves the bakery as you grumble. \"That's a lot of bismarcks, fatass.\" \"I'm a wererhinoceros,\" said Noreen. \"We tend to have large appetites. You know, you were very rude towards Maddie in there.\" \"Go to hell!\" Noreen just rolled her eyes as she was walking back into Autumn Avenue. Along the way, she passes by an obese gray furred were cat in a gothic dress and ankh necklace with spiky orange hair. \"Hi, Shego,\" she says in a Cajun accent. \"Who's your friend?\" \"Not a friend, Crimson,\" said Noreen. \"He's trouble. My sister sent him to me to do a favor for that hot-tempered gargoyle she's friends with.\" Crimson just blinks a few times. \"Damn,\" she says. \"I hope that Susan doesn't find out about this.\" \"Blow me, Lady Garfield!\" you yell out towards Crimson. This actually irritates Noreen as she was walking into a fish market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a bad attitude, Wade,\" said Noreen. \"Even if Scream Town is a much safer environment for humans than the rest of the monster world, you're seriously pushing your luck.\" \"This town is a travesty,\" you say. \"It's unnatural. Humans working for monsters, humans dating monsters, humans <i>marrying</i> monsters. This town should be destroyed.\" Noreen just lets out a snort of annoyance. \"You know, a lot of these monsters even if they are friendly with humans, they're still carnivores so I'd watch it.\" You let out a scoff and notice that the proprietress of the fish market was a landshark girl resembling a megalodon with golden red hair. \"Hey, Nami,\" says Noreen. \"I'll just take some octopus.\" You give a gag. \"Octopus? Rhinos don't eat fish.\" \"It's not for me, Wade,\" says Noreen. \"It's for Delirium. You rather I feed her, <i>you</i>?\" You just give Noreen the finger, to Nami's surprise. \"When did you start dating?\" You give a gag at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Noreen walks out with her bismarcks and octopus as you're riding on her nose. As she walks by, she passes a magenta skinned mock turtle woman with a huge udder and reddish hair worn in a braided ponytail and a rather large shell on her back. You then turn your head to see another sight that disgusts you. There was a human young man proposing to his girlfriend, a titanic and obese Jersey Devil girl dressed in a gothic outfit with a pair of large horn-rimmed glasses. You're thoroughly disgusted. \"Oh my gosh,\" said Noreen. \"I had no idea that Leelee was getting engaged.\" \"What kind of an idiot would marry a monster woman big enough to swallow him whole? First that pachydermic Fox sister of yours and now an entire town that shares her insanity.\" \"It's perfectly legal for monsters to marry humans. Even in parts of the monster world where humans are normally considered food. One of my close friends has a human husband and stepson.\" You gag at that idea. \"I would rather be dead than a monster's husband.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen pays you no heed and unlocks the door to her house, puts her bismarcks in the kitchen and then throws Delirium the octopus she bought and the greedy plant sucks it down. Noreen then looks and sees that she has a message on her answering machine. \"Uh-oh, somebody must've called me when we were out.\" You couldn't care less, but Noreen presses the button on the answering machine and hears the message. \"Hi, Sweetie,\" says a female voice. \"Hope you don't mind, but your father and I are stopping over. Now that I'm off work for the summer, I've found some photographs of several eligible bachelors around Direopolis that I can't wait to introduce you to. Love you. See you soon.\" Noreen's eyes popped after hearing the message. \"Oh hell.\" she groaned. From the context, that had to be Noreen and Whitney's mother on the phone. You remember, Susan Steranko, that green-skinned blonde Sumatran wererhinoceros from that photograph in Whitney's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen let out a groan. \"I take it you're not pleased that your old lady is coming.\" \"Not in the least. She's always busting my ass to get married and become a mother.\" \"Well, you definitely don't have to worry about that happening.\" You say smugly. Noreen gives a grunt but then she realizes that her mom was going to be here soon. \"I definitely can't let Mom and Dad see you. With that, Noreen proceeds to shove you down into her panties and you gag as you\u2019re pressed against her large and thick-skinned love tunnel. Before you can complain there\u2019s a knock at the door. Noreen lets out a groan. \u201cBetter get this over with.\u201d Noreen walks up to the door and in walks Susan, her mother. From the looks of it, Susan seems actually taller than Whitney that made her tower over Noreen. Ironic since the Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest species of rhino. \"Noreen!\" yells Susan as she tightly hugs her daughter, unknowingly pushing you further into the tunnel. \"How nice to see you again.\" \"Hi, Mom.\" Says Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Susan walks in, next comes her spriggan husband, Grayson. While Grayson was a giant monster himself, he was less than half Noreen's height to say nothing of how puny he was compared to Susan. \"Hi, Dad.\" Says Noreen. Grayson doesn't say a word and just gestures a hello before he sits on the couch and snaps his finger to turn on the television. Susan lets out a sigh. \"Looks like it's another three months before I can return to work,\" says Susan. \"At least I don't have to worry about grading papers like those academic teachers. Now, Noreen, I'm sure there are a lot of eligible men, both monster and humans, if you're into that, in Screamtown, but you don't seem to be taking the bait. Which is why I figured that some men from Direopolis might be more your speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen rolls her eyes. \"This again, Mom?\" \"Well, it's not like I have any choice. Whitney is in a position where she wouldn't be able to take care of children and with Xander working from home, there's no way it will be changing anytime soon. Now, I've got a few men in mind.\" Susan then reaches into her cleavage for several photographs. \"First I have a were hyena comedian I found at the club. I know it sounds desperate but we have to work our way up to the top. Next, I've found a kappa lumberjack who is looking for female companionship. Oh, before I forget, I've also found a young up and coming software businessman who would love to be a father.\" You can hear every word Susan says as you're stuck in Noreen's private area. No wonder Grayson didn't speak. He couldn't get a word in edgewise married to this windbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen lets out a sigh. \"Mom,\" she says. \"This is getting out of hand. I'm not seeking a relationship right now.\" Susan let out a scoff. \"You expect the Steranko bloodline to die out so easily? You already have one carnivorous plant as a pet. If you don't get a man soon, I promise you there will be more where Delirium came from. Delirium just gave a hiss at Susan's words as Noreen tried to ignore her. However, at that time you were fighting to keep from sinking any further down Noreen's tunnel and your movement irritates the goth giantess as she groans. \"Noreen?\" asks Susan. \"What's wrong, baby?\" Noreen groans and feels her snatch area. As Noreen is scratching, you grab onto one of her black fingernails and she accidentally pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen and Susan both look in surprise. \"Noreen?\" asks Susan. \"Who is this.\" Noreen let out a groan. \"Mom, this is Wade.\" Susan then stares at you. \"What are you looking at, broccoli face?\" \"You dishonored my daughter.\" Susan then gives a smile. \"Noreen, where did he come from?\" Noreen groaned. \"Whitney sent him. He's a criminal from Under Gloom she took off Destiny's hands and sent to me to keep him from driving her crazy.\" \"Uh-huh,\" says Susan. \"Good old Whitney. Always looking out for her little sister. At least that blue idiot friend of hers is good for something. Congratulations, Noreen. I'll make plans for the wedding right away.\" \"WTF!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, those words cause the stoic Grayson's eyes to pop out of his head.. \u201cARE YOU OUT OF YOUR ****ING MIND, WOMAN!? YOU\u2019RE TRYING TO PUSH NOREEN DOWN THE ALTER WITH HIM!? THAT MAN IS A CRIMINAL FOR THE LOVE OF MAB!\u201d \u201cGrayson,\u201d says Susan as she looks down and stares at her much shorter husband. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin this. This could be our last chance to be grandparents.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding me, Susan?! That guy is obviously a child hater and I\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019s a woman hater too.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just being fickle. You weren\u2019t that happy when Whitney married Xander.\u201d \u201cXander may be a viper, but he\u2019s a much more decent son-in-law than that racist ne\u2019er-do-well.\u201d Grayson then grunted because Susan grabbed him by the wings and lifted him up. \u201cGrayson,\u201d says Susan. \u201cI think I know what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re doing, Susan! You never admit when you\u2019re wrong and this is the most blatantly bad decision you\u2019ve made in all the decades I\u2019ve known you.\u201d \u201cYou know, Grayson, I think I like you better when you\u2019re quiet.\u201d \u201cYou know what, Sue, fine! If you want to give away our youngest daughter to that... that... I can\u2019t even think of a demeaning enough insult, than do it yourself. I would rather eat Castle Wyvern brick by brick than watch a doomed marriage be born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Grayson angrily storms out of the house and slams the door. \u201cAt least somebody in this family has brains.\u201d You mutter to yourself. Noreen just lets out a moan. \"I hate mondays.\" She says. Susan is too too busy planning Noreen's wedding in her head to pay any head.</span></div></div>",

Destiny's frustration with you led to her sending you to her friend who sent you to her younger sister and now their busybody mother caught you in the act and you were engaged to a fat skyscraper-sized pachyderm goth. But as bad as you were taking it, Whitney didn't like it any better. Susan had called her first born to tell her about the ceremony and Whitney reacted the way you'd expect as she was speaking with her mother on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR ****ING MIND, MOTHER!?!\" Whitney yells sounding a lot like her father. \"WHAT THE *****ING SAM HILL ARE YOU ****ING THINKING!?\" \"Whitney,\" says Susan. \"This is a happy moment. Your sister is finally getting married.\" \"Mo-om! This is a very bad idea. You're hooking her up with a criminal! He set a woman on fire! Do you have any idea what he could do to Noreen!\" \"He's less than 150 times her size, Whitney. You're making a mountain out of a molehill. The wedding is this Friday and I expect you to come. Who knows? By this time, next year, you could be an aunt.\" \"Are you even hearing yourself! You've made some seriously bad decisions in the past but this takes the cake! This guy hates monsters, he clearly hates women and I'm pretty sure that he hates kids. He's only going to make Noreen miserable.\" \"You know, Whitney, you're being a hypocrite. Your husband is a human.\" \"Xander has never been arrested! Xander has a job! Xander is nothing like that son of a bitch. If you think that I'm going to sit idly by as my sister marries a colossal jerk, you have another thing coming! Good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney slams the phone back on the receiver and then pushes it to the ground before stomping it to pieces as she lets out a slight yell and pulls on her hair. Xander is on the coffee table as he looks up at his skyscraper-sized wife. \"Uh-oh,\" says Xander. \"Susan must've really done something stupid this time.\" Whitney gives a groan. \"My mother is setting up Noreen and Wade to get married.\" Xander gives a look of horror. \"Good grief. Son-in-law to Susan Steranko. I wouldn't wish such a horrible fate on my worst enemy.\" Whitney then lowers her head and glares at Xander who looks up in fear at the rhinoceros woman clenching her teeth. \"Brilliant idea sending Wade to Scream Town, <i>Xanatos</i>,\" says Whitney sarcastically in a vexed tone. \"Now my kid sister is going to be married to a viper.\" \"How was I supposed to know your mother was visiting,\" says Xander trying to hold off his wife's wrath. \"I couldn't plan for this to happen.\" \"And now my mother is planning my sister's doomsday. Considering who she's about to marry, I don't know whether to fit her for a wedding veil or a hangman's noose.\" Xander turned his head to whisper to himself \"She's too heavy for a noose to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney gives Xander a glare and is about to make another call, only to remember that she destroyed the phone and go into the cupboard to get a spare phone to hook up. Once she has it ready, she decides to call Destiny. At that time, your gargoyle nemesis was in the kitchen cooking hot dogs. \u201cHello?\u201d asks Destiny as she answers the phone. \u201cDestiny,\u201d says Whitney. \u201cYour trash is poisoning my family.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cI mailed that nasty piece of pest to my kid sister in Scream Town.\u201d \u201cWhat did Noreen do to you?\u201d \u201cShut up and listen, you blue asshole! My mother was visiting and now she wants Wade and Noreen to get married.\u201d Destiny actually drops the bun she was holding into the hot dog water before bursting into hysterical laughter. \u201cOh good,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a more fitting punishment if I tried. Wade hates monsters so much that the worst thing that could happen to him is to marry one.\u201d Destiny keeps laughing but Whitney is not amused. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Destiny! That monster happens to be my little sister! I don\u2019t want that creep driving Noreen crazy.\u201d \u201cRelax, Whitney,\u201d said Destiny. \u201cAt least Noreen will show him who rules the roost.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe you! I hope you choke on those frankfurters, Dominique!\u201d Destiny lets out a sigh and rolls her eyes. \u201cThe insult you\u2019re looking for is Demona.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care! I\u2019m not taking this laying down!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney then hangs up and then grabs Xander as he grunts before shoving her tiny husband between her breasts. The rhino woman then takes out her cell phone. \u201cHello, Kaguya. Sorry, I\u2019m gonna have to take a week off. I\u2019ll explain later. For now, I have to save my sister from making a horrible mistake. Goodbye.\u201d Whitney hangs up and stops out the door to turn her car on. \u201cWhitney,\u201d said Xander. \u201cYou forgot to turn off the lights.\u201d Without even turning off the car, Whitney goes back in the house, shuts off the lights and then drives away to head to Scream Town.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*<i>THWACK, THWACK, THWACK</i>* Noreen's head banged against the wall again and again, her horns scraping the black paint off as she pulled back. The wall was starting to show a dent, and the headbutts were making the punk band posters she had on the walls rustle. As you watched from your perch on a black-painted bedside table, you couldn't help but laugh at the scene she was making....even if you were in the same mess Noreen was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween impacts she ranted, \"I! Can't! Believe! This! How can! Mother! Be this! Pigheaded?!\" With one last <i>*WHAM!*</i>, harder than the ones before, she finally stops trying to give herself a concussion, resting her head against the wall with a sigh. \"She just seizes on the first excuse to marry me off to some guy...was she even <i>hearing</i> Dad when he stormed out yesterday?! And just because she thinks I got 'dishonored'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch at the memory of how Susan discovered you. \"Not like you helped your case by <i>shoving me in your snatch</i>, Goth Green Giant! What did you THINK would happen when you pulled me out of that death pit in front of your mother?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>thought</i> about just shoving you in my pocket or sitting on you, but with your loud mouth I was worried you could still be heard,\" Noreen snarks, pulling her head back from the wall. \"Besides, I had to think fast, and putting you...<i>there</i>...was all I could come up with. And seriously, 'Goth Green Giant'? What are you, twelve years old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stick your tongue out at that, making Noreen roll her eyes. Damn, this girl was hard to rile; you almost missed how easily you'd gotten Destiny to flip out with just her hated nickname. \"Whatever...so why not just tell Mumsy you don't want to go through with this? I don't think even an idiot windbag like her could force you into a wedding.\" Under your breath you add, <i>\"Not like you'd ever get a boyfriend anyway.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl escapes the pachyderm giantess's maw at the insult towards her mother, but she quickly deadpans. \"You think I haven't, Wilson? Every time she just shrugs it off: 'Oh, he'll change his attitude after the wedding!' or, 'If he causes trouble, you can just sit on him!'; and, 'Don't you know what a hellhole Under Gloom is? You're saving him!' UGH! It's like she's ignoring me completely! Even if she does see reason she'll just try and set me up with one of the guys on her hit-list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou belt out an acidic laugh at that last one. Not only for Noreen's imitation of her mother being pitch-perfect--you almost suspected she was lip-syncing to some hidden recording--but for the idea of this stupid wedding being a relief from Under Gloom. Ha, yeah right! Stuck in this stupid town of idiots and married to this big green bint? It was even worse than prison! At least there none of the monsters pretended to be anything but the man-eating sadistic scum they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a muffled <i>beepbeepbeep</i> starts up, making both you and Noreen flinch. She fishes her cell phone out from a pocket in her tight black pants and glances at the screen before sighing. \"Aaaand now it's time to meet Mom and her friends at the dress shop. Of course it is. Come on, squirt.\" She thuds over to your perch and snatches you up between two fingers before you can protest, then tosses you between her colossal breasts as she makes her way out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, you let loose with a torrent of profanity and slurs. Words so horrible, so utterly hateful and vile....that somewhere in hell, Satan sharpens his pitchfork and politely addresses one of his minions: \"Do me a favor and let me know when THAT guy gets here. I have a special eternal punishment in store for him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour unholy rant is cut off when Noreen suddenly squeezes her cleavage together, cutting off your air for a second and giving you a face/mouth full of rhino-boob. She looks down at you and scowls like she'd found gum on her shoe. \"...For your sake, I hope Mother comes to her senses.\" </span></div></div>",

As she is walking by, several people who know her walk out and seem to already know the news. The first is a giant cobalt-skinned wereboar. She resembled a titanically fat warthog with four tusks and long blonde hair. She looked like a porcine version of Storm and she smiled at Noreen. \u201cHello, Shego,\u201d she says with an African accent and a snort. \u201cI heard you were getting married this Friday.\u201d Noreen gives a nervous smile. \u201cYou know how pushy my mom can be, Ororo.\u201d \u201cAnd I hear that it\u2019s a human of all things. Good choice. I\u2019ll see you at the ceremony.\u201d The boar walks away and then another giant woman comes forward. This one is a huge pink mock turtle resembling a minotaur with a tortoise shell, long pink hair and a big udder. \u201cCongratulations on getting hitched, Shego,\u201d says the mock turtle once again calling Noreen by her nickname. \u201cPlease save me a slice of cake at the wedding.\u201d As soon as that giantess has her back turned, you give her the finger. \u201cHow the **** do so many people know about the wedding so fast?\u201d Noreen lets out a sigh. \u201cWord travels fast in Screamtown. Especially when Mom is involved. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen soon reached a shop in Summer Side that read Urameshi Bridal and outside Susan was waiting with another monster. First of them was a bright blue-feathered stymphalian bird with bright green wings and aqua-colored. She was very obese and had a scar on the edge of her beak and resembled a macaw. \u201cOh, Noreen,\u201d said Susan. \u201cYou\u2019re here. You remember my old friend, Cotton don\u2019t you.\u201d Noreen smiles and waves her hand as the Stymphalian bird smiles at her. \u201cYou are very lucky, Noreen,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cScreamtown is the right place for a human-monster wedding. All of my children-in-law are humans.\u201d You stick out your tongue. Cotton finally notices you and then bites her lip. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d \u201cShut your beak, parrot-face.\u201d You say rudely. \u201cI\u2019m not a parrot,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cI\u2019m a Stymphalian bird. I just happen to look like a parrot.\u201d Susan lets out a laugh. \u201cWell, we mustn\u2019t keep the bride and groom waiting. Into the shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proprietress of the bridal shop was that hellhound mother from the other day. You take a closer look and see that she is a very pear-shaped woman with dark red skin and a skull-like face with sharp teeth and purple-red hair reaching down to her huge butt. The hellhound lady turns and spots Susan and is surprised. \u201cSusan?\u201d she asks. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in town. How\u2019s everything in Direopolis.\u201d Susan let out a laugh. \u201cOh not much going on. Trini\u2019s still working on that rocket she mentioned. In my opinion, it won\u2019t get off the ground. But enough about her. Noreen is finally getting married.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d yells the hellhound woman. \u201cOMG! I can\u2019t believe it. Who\u2019s the lucky man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan snatches you out of her daughter\u2019s dark gray cleavage and holds you up in front of the hellhound woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat are you looking at, Skull-Face?!\u201d you yell out rudely. The hellhound woman sounded shocked. \u201cReally?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat\u2019s who Noreen is marrying?\u201d Noreen lets out a sigh. \u201cIt was Mom\u2019s idea, Mrs. Urameshi.\u201d Mrs. Urameshi lets out a sigh. \u201cWhy am I not surprised.\u201d Susan just snaps her fingers. \u201cEnough with the chitchat. The wedding is on Friday and...\u201d \u201cFriday!? It\u2019s only Tuesday!\u201d Mrs. Urameshi then lets out a sigh, no doubt realizing how stubborn Susan was and gestured for Noreen to follow her to fit her for a wedding dress. \u201cWhy are you even bothering?\u201d you grumble. \u201cShe\u2019ll look butt ugly in anything you choose.\u201d Mrs. Urameshi then snatches you up and places you on Noreen\u2019s shoulder. Noreen gives a snort and then grunts as Mrs. Urameshi takes her measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Noreen is fitted with a long white wedding dress decorated with jasmines and bows. Noreen is grunting because it's somewhat tight on her. \"Now this one is a very popular dress style. I think the jasmines give it a nice touch.\" \"Does it come in black?\" asked Noreen under her breath. \"It looks like ****.\" You say. In response, Mrs. Urameshi snatches you and ties you into a bow on the end of Noreen's tail. \"There,\" said Mrs. Urameshi. \"Doesn't that look nice.\" \"I wouldn't know,\" you grunt. \"All I can see is rhino butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there is a loud stomping and then Whitney storms in unexpectedly and gives an angry snort. \"I thought I'd find you here already!\" yells the white rhinoceros giantess. Susan gives a smile. \"Good girl, Whitney. The wedding isn't until Friday and here's the best lady ready and...\" \"Have you flipped your lid?!\" yells Whitney. \"I've come to put a stop to this insanity!\" Susan just rolls her eyes. \"Whitney,\" she says. \"Please, do not ruin this. Your little sister is finally getting married.\" Whitney slaps herself in the face and grumbles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney then proceeds to stomp forward and sees you tied in the bow on her sister's tail. \"You little creep!\" yells Whitney. \"Don't blame me, Fox Xanatos. It was your husband's bright idea to send me to this hellhole freak farm town and get me engaged to this walking tank.\" Noreen actually laughs at that Fox Xanatos comment but her sister is less than amused. \"No. 1,\" says the albino rhinoceros. \"I DO NOT look like Fox Xanatos! What exactly is the resemblance? No. 2, you <i>will not </i> hurt my kid sister in any way. No physical abuse, no verbal abuse. I sure as hell won't sit by and watch Noreen spend the rest of her life with an asshole.\" \"Why not?\" you ask. \"She already has a rather large one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney snaps her jaw as her eyes glow red (though not as bright as Destiny's red eyes). \"You listen here, shorty. I might not be able to stop this dangerous and doomed marriage, but I can promise you, if you so much as call Noreen \"Fat\", I <i>can</i> be the worst sister-in-law you can imagine! If you make Noreen miserable, I will make <i>you</i> miserable!\" At that moment, Xander is in Whitney's ear and crawls deeper to speak with his wife. \"I'm pretty sure Susan doesn't need any help making him miserable.\" \"Shut up, Xander! Don't think I've forgotten whose fault this is!\" Whitney then gestures that she's watching you and then walks out of the store. \"If anybody needs me,\" says the rhino giantess. \"I will be taking out my frustration with this bad situation on the nearest donut shop.\" Whitney slams the door on her own tail and then grunts in pain before opening the door, pulling the tail out and then slamming the door again. Susan shakes her head. \"That girl has quite a temper on her. I think she's been hanging out with Destiny too long.\" Rangiku nods her head. \u201cNow,\u201d said Susan. \u201cOn with the show.\u201d You let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time in Direopolis, there were two teenage monster girls in a restaurant with a gothic loxodon in the background taking the order of a weredolphin dressed as a Texas Ranger. They consisted of a heavy hourglass-shaped Jersey Devil who looked like a pink and white striped quagga with talons for feet, fangs and leather wings who was chowing down on garlic pizza and her friend was a big butted nue with the limbs of a white tiger, a snake for a tail, the body of a tanuki, the face of a lemur and cheeks of a baboon who was stuffing her face with donuts as she sat in two chairs to hold up her rear. The Jersey devil girl was reading a letter of some sort and gasped. \u201cOh my gosh! Juliana! This is a letter from Coach Steranko.\u201d The nue just waved her hand. \u201cScarlet, it\u2019s Summer. Coach Steranko isn\u2019t the big bossity boss of us until September. It\u2019s junk mail.\u201d \u201cJuliana, it says here that the coach\u2019s daughter is getting married. She\u2019s invited our entire class and anyone in Direopolis we can find to the wedding.\u201d Juliana jumps up and smiles. \u201cWell what are we waiting for? Wedding means party and party means dancing! And the dancing queen of all nue booty is so okay with that! Elisabeth! Perry! Akira! Come here!\u201d Scarlet gives a smirk. \u201cI hope the reception dinner has garlic shrimp on the menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, you have had to sit through Noreen trying on dress after dress and were quickly losing patience. \u201cCan\u2019t we get out of here already! Just pick a stupid dress!\u201d Mrs. Urameshi simply stared at Susan. \u201cSusan,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I\u2019m somebody who sells bridal gowns for a living, but I really don\u2019t think that it\u2019s such a good idea to let this marriage come to be.\u201d \u201cRangiku,\u201d said Susan. \u201cJust be patient. When are we going to get a chance like this again?\u201d Cotton just rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you really sure you want them to have kids?\u201d asked the bird giantess. \u201cWade would make an awful parent.\u201d \u201cThen I guess it\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s the size of an insect then.\u201d Rangiku let out a sigh. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling I\u2019m going to regret this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hellhound giantess then reached into her cleavage to take out a pair of photographs. \"At least Noreen narrowed it down to two dresses.\" The first photograph depicted a black and dark navy blue bridal dress that came complete with a tiara that resembled a bat. The frills on the skirt resembled bat wings The second photograph depicted a white and hot pink dress with pink designs made to look like stains of blood, a veil and skirt that resembled a spider web and a pair of opera gloves in the same design. \"Both look gorgeous,\" said Susan. \"And I think I hear the bride coming out right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow which dress did Noreen choose?</span></div></div>",

Noreen rolls her eyes and point to the blue dress. \u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with blue, since that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling. Besides, the bat tiara is a nice touch.\u201d You roll your eyes as Susan claps her hands and laughs.

The cake.\u201d You stick out your tongue. \u201cI\u2019ll bet it will be made out of moss and fungus.\u201d Noreen turns to face you. \u201cWould you stop your complaining, your unwilling bride says to you. I\u2019m in the same boat as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the bakery, Maddie and Rick had put together a rather large dessert that appeared to be made of pastry balls piled into the shape of a cone and covered in a thick caramel and whipped cream. Maddie places a cherry on top and smiles. \u201cThat has got to be the best croquembouche we\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Rick nods his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like Mt. Everest,\u201d he says to his boss. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what a croquembouche was.\u201d It was at the moment that the phone rang. Maddie hissed and then she slithered up to the phone. While she isn\u2019t looking, Rick takes out a tiny piece of the croquembouche, not enough to be missed, and pecks at it. The giant gorgon answers the phone with her enormous tail before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she says. \u201cMaddie\u2019s Bakery. What?! Oh my gosh! That\u2019s incredible!\u201d Rick out of curiosity jumps and grabs hold of Maddie\u2019s shirt before sliding down her tail before climbing up the other side to reach his boss\u2019s face. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d he asks. Maddie gives a gasp. \u201cFire?! Oh my gosh, did somebody\u2019s house catch on fire!\u201d Rick lets out a sigh. \u201cWhy me?\u201d Susan on the other line lets out a sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s no fire, Maddie. Rick. In case you\u2019re listening. Noreen is getting married.\u201d \u201cWhat!?\u201d yells Rick in surprise. \u201cShe is? Who is she marrying.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says Susan. \u201cHe\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but I\u2019m sure Noreen will show Wade who rules the roost.\u201d \u201cWade?!\u201d yells Rick. \u201cYou mean that jerk that was here the other day is marrying Noreen? Susan, you can\u2019t let her go through with that marriage. They\u2019ll drive each other crazy.\u201d Susan gave a scoff. \u201cThat\u2019s what married couples are supposed to do. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be more open-minded seeing that your parents are a monster human couple.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d says Rick. \u201cMy dad is not a monster-hating piece of trash. He and mom were married by choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan gives a snort from the other line. \u201cI didn\u2019t call for marriage advice, human,\u201d says the rhinoceros matriarch. \u201cI got enough of that from Whitney. You are a bakery aren\u2019t you? I need you two to make a wedding cake, one big enough for the entire town.\u201d \u201cOh my,\u201d says Maddie. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an order.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Maddie,\u201d says Rick. \u201cIt\u2019s Noreen who\u2019s getting married. She\u2019ll want black icing rather than white.\u201d Maddie hisses and nods her head. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be sure to ask my hubby to carve a the bride and groom to put on top. Of course, he\u2019ll need a magnifying glass to make the decoration for the groom. Now, what type of cake? I know Noreen hates coconut. We actually have a special on two kinds of cakes.\u201d Susan gives a blink on the other line. \u201cAnd what cakes would those be?\u201d Maddie paused and then placed Rick back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the choice. Chiffon or Red Velvet.\u201d Susan actually has to stop to think about what cake. \u201cHmm,\u201d she says. \u201cBoth are good choices. I\u2019ll ask the bride. Noreen, what type of cake do you want Maddie to make for the wedding.\u201d Noreen lets out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d she thinks. \u201cI already chose my noose, so I\u2019ll choose my last meal.\u201d Noreen then clears her throat and decides on...</span></div></div>",

You let out a yell and try to break out but the pie crust and the filling (that you can't identify) is too thick for you to burst out of. What's worse is that Noreen has already paid for her bismarcks and is leaving. The goth giantess rubs her chin before she speaks to herself. \"Hmm,\" she says. \"I can't help but feel as though I'm forgetting something.\" You try and scream as loud as you can as the pie gets hotter and you gasp and even grab yourself by the neck as you're choking. You're forced to eat some of the pie filling so you don't pass out. You can only hope that either that gorgon or the human working for her hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the oven, Maddie is trying to stir another batter and throws in some raspberries that Rick hands her. \"Hey, Maddie,\" says Rick. \"Why don't we cook some elephant ears?\" Maddie gives a look of surprise. \"I don't think Josephine would appreciate that.\" \"No, Maddie,\" says Rick. \"I mean the pastry kind.\" \"Oh,\" says the ditzy fat snake-tailed giantess. \"That makes a lot more sense.

It must not be easy working for such a ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Maddie takes the pie you're trapped in out of the oven and inside the pie, unbeknownst to her or Rick, you're panting and gasping for air. \"I thought I was done for.\" You groan. Maddie puts the pie right next to another one on the table and sniffs it. \"I must say, this is the best toadstool pie I've ever baked.\" You give a gag from inside the pie and your eyes water. \"Toadstools!\" you think. \"I just ate a filling made out of <i>toadstools</i>!?\" You hold your mouth but then you hear footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the bakery walks...</span></div></div>",

She had a bestial-looking face with a large beak filled with sharp teeth and leather ears that looked like bat wings. Her skin was bright red and she had long blonde hair with multi-colored wings and tail feathers. She was very obese with a huge protruding stomach and a massive rear and her hands had sharp talons. The harpy giantess resembled an anthropomorphic archaeopteryx, a prehistoric bird that lived during the age of dinosaurs. She was wearing a black business suit and tie like the kind a lawyer would wear and she also had a pair of sunglasses that looked like they were clipped onto a regular pair of glasses. She stood 1200ft making her even taller than Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick seemed to recognize her as he ran up as the harpy lady came up to the table. \"Hey, Mom,\" says Rick. \"How did the case go?\" You give a gasp. \"Mom!?\" you ask to yourself. \"That harpy is his mother!? There's got to be a mistake. Monsters eat humans, they don't raise them!\" The harpy lowers her head to get a good look at Rick before speaking. \"Everything went well, as always.\" The harpy then picks Rick up and gives him a kiss before putting him back down on the table. \"How are you and Pauline getting along?\" \"Great,\" says Rick. \"We've got tickets to a Vienna concert that's going to happen in a few weeks.\" \"Just don't stare at her too much. I don't want Pauline getting jealous. Besides, I don't think Vienna is into men.\" Rick's mother then notices the pie that you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" says the giant harpy woman. \"That's a very fine-looking toadstool pie. I think I'll take it. I promised I'd bring some of Screamtown's local cuisine back to the office.\" \"Got it, Kate,\" says Maddie. \"I'll put it in a box.\" You gasp as Maddie picks up the pie and puts it in a box as Rick's mother, who you know now is named Kate, pays for the pie before waving goodbye to her son and his boss and walking out with the pie, not knowing that you're inside of it. You begin to sweat. You don't know if this harpy eats humans or not. \"Too bad Jake doesn't like toadstools,\" says Kate. \"His distaste for monster food is why I'm so fat.\" Kate places the pie into her purse before opening up her wings and soaring into the sky thousands of feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out and can see nothing but her bright colored wings and long blonde hair. She flies for what seems to be 2 hours before you hear what sounds like an airplane. Kate appears to be landing and you hear a loud splash as her talons land in the ocean and she's up to her knees in water. You look out from your pie prison and are in disbelief. You see the Golden Gate bridge in the distance and realize that this monster lady has arrived in San Francisco. Kate walks further and steps into the city from the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kate walks further into the city, dozens of humans run screaming at the sight of a giant harpy stomping down the street. Kate lets out an indignant groan. \"Oh come on!\" she shouts. \"I've lived near this city for years! I don't even eat humans! You should be used to me by now!\" Kate grumbles to herself as she lifts the shades off of her glasses. Then you hear another stomping and from the other side of the city comes another monster girl who was as big as Kate. She was an enormous silver-skinned kappa resembling an archelon, a giant prehistoric sea turtle. This turtle giantess had large fangs protruding from the sides of her mouth and medium length midnight-colored hair worn in a ponytail. She was very heavyset and had a double chin with colored blue lips and a small nose that looked almost human-like. All she wore for clothing was what looked like a lei. From the looks of it, she was a friend of Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kate,\" says the kappa giantess. \"You're back early.\" Kate lets out a sigh. \"It was a pretty easy case, Leah.\" Leah gives a scoff. \"Hello! Every case is an easy case for you! I had to work my shell off investigating for the last client I was assigned to. It turns out that somebody tried to hide the evidence underwater. Not very bright when the lawyer you're up against is a giant sea turtle.\" You give a growl from inside the pie. Kate and her friend were <i>lawyers</i>. You didn't like lawyers because you could never find one that would help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah then eyes the pie and licks her lips. \"Is that one of Maddie's pies.\" Kate nods her head. \"Super,\" says Leah. \"Everyone else is busy with cases, but that doesn't mean we can't dig in.\" Kate and Leah stomp down the street and each one sits on top of a skyscraper as Kate holds out one of her sharp fingers to use as a makeshift knife. To your dismay, it's the pie piece you're trapped inside that is being taken out first. You let out a yell and fall back to see you were approaching a monster's mouth, but whose?</span></div></div>",

You have to move to the side to avoid being crushed by oncoming fangs big enough to destroy cars. \"I'll bet that stupid gorgon's stupid assistant never so this side of his so-called mother.\" You growl to yourself. \"I hope you choke on me, you birdbrain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that Kate didn't hear you and Leah is already chomping on some pie as Kate is moving around the pie in her mouth. \"That's odd,\" thinks the harpy giantess to herself. \"This pie doesn't have as much filling as Maddie's usual work. She has been putting on weight lately. Maybe she's been sneaking toadstools and not noticing it. She's not abusive to Rick but I wish my son's boss was much smarter. Ugh. This pie tastes a little gamey today. Perhaps I should've bought a cake, instead.\" Leah munched on the pie before speaking. \"What's the matter, Kate? Got a frog in your throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate didn't have a frog in her throat, but you were beginning to slip as the pie begun to slide down the harpy's football-sized tongue and towards her esophagus. Her uvula was in sight and you have to jump from bit to bit of the pie and begin to shout. \"Hey, you idiot! You've got a human in your mouth, you mutant turkey! If you dare eat me, I swear I'll tie your intestines in a knot! Hello!? I know you can hear me!\" But Kate doesn't hear you and you decide to take matters into your own hands. You look down to see the harpy giantess's tongue was enormous, thick like leather and appeared to be forked like that of a snake. You climb down and decide to bite Kate on the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does Kate feel you?</span></div></div>",

Are you saying that kid is half monster!? That's disgusting! How is such a horrible thing possible!\" \"If you must know,\" says Kate. \"Harpies are all female, so we have no choice but to mate with other monsters or in my case, a human, in order to reproduce. Normally harpies only give birth to female offspring, but nature can have a strange sense of humor at times and I became the first harpy to lay an egg containing a human child.\" You stick out your tongue. \"That's revolting.

Rotten apples don't fall far from the tree apparently, because this creep committed a terrible crime against monsters. He set a mummy on fire and traumatized her for afterlife. I hear he was sent to Under Gloom, which doesn't explain why he's in a pie.\" Leah shivered. \"Under Gloom. Don't remind me. Warden Destiny <i>hates</i> you.\" Kate puts her shades back on before speaking. \"Wardens and lawyers generally don't like each other.

Except for one jerk who drives into Kate's foot and causes her pain. \"Hey, bird butt! Get out of the way!\" Kate in retaliation, picks up the man's car and places it on top of a skyscraper before walking away and then opening up her wings to fly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're beginning to wonder what could be so bad about Laurel. Perhaps she was a horrifying tyrant who conquered an entire human country and tortured her subjects for fun. Maybe she was such kind of gourmet who loves to fill her belly with people like you. Or perhaps she was another lawyer. You're wondering exactly what you're up against. Kate soon arrives near New York and lands right next to the Statue of Liberty. The passersby look up at her but instead of being afraid, they all groan. \"Oh no,\" says one young woman. \"Not another one.\" \"I heard that she had sisters.\" \"The last thing that we need around here is a duet.\" \"I wouldn't mind if she came to eat us, as long as she doesn't sing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're confused at first but then you hear a strange sound that causes everyone in the city to hold their ears in pain.

The sound is so painful that you scream and hold your ears. \"What is that awful noise?!\" \"Laurel is a canary harpy. Canaries sing.\" \"Singing?! That's not singing! It sounds like somebody is strangling a moose!\" You hold your ears in pain as Kate walks through the water and makes her way towards an island with a giant woman's house that was painted in bright colors that made it look like it came out of an 80s video. Inside, the house there was a shelf of records and a record that was playing. There were posters of 80s movies and rock bands on the walls and there was even a stack of pet rocks laid out on a coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel was singing (if you could call it that) to a record playing Kid Video music. From the looks of it, Laurel was a very fat and bottom heavy harpy with the wings of a canary, tanned skin and platinum blonde hair. She wore a black unitard with gray leg warmers, making her look like Black Canary. Her warbling filled the air and made you wish you were dead as Kate entered the house and then waved at her sister. \"Katie!\" yells Laurel as she stops singing and hugs her sister. \"How are you, Big Sister? Where's Jake and Rick?\" \"I didn't bring them,\" says Kate. \"But I <i>did</i> bring somebody to act as an audience for your musical talents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel gives a squeal as she looks down at you. \"Cutie.\" She says. You give a glare at Kate. \"Take me back to Under Gloom,\" you mutter. \"That singing is more evil than any torture that Demona could come up with.\" Kate gives a smirk. \"Believe me, Wade, if anyone deserves this, it's you.\" Kate places you on the table and then runs out as fast as she can to get away from her sister's singing.\" Laurel tuns off her record player and then walks up to a nickelodeon before taking out a nickel and going through the songs. \"Now,\" she says. \"My little karaoke machine, which gem from the 80s should I sing first for my guest. Whatever it will be, it must be truly, truly, truly outrageous.\" The harpy laughs as you try to get away. Unfortunately, Laurel anticipates this and places a glass over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this glass is soundproof.\" You say. At that moment, Laurel's machine picks a song for her to sing.</span></div></div>",

I hope you can swim.\" You give a look of confusion before Kate stuffs you into her purse before she opens her wings and flies up into the air. Along the way, she drops feathers as big as buses, forcing traffic to a halt. One man in a car shakes his fist at Kate as she flies away. You give a growl. First Destiny hands you over to Whitney who delegates you to her sister Noreen in Screamtown who then leaves you behind at a bakery where you are made into a pie and bought by this fat archaeopteryx and now she was going to send you to one of her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you mutter. \"Another archaeopteryx.\" \"Pele isn't an archaeopteryx like me,\" says Kate. \"She's a pelican harpy. Funny thing about harpies, our genes have a good memory. The daughter won't necessarily be the same type of bird as her mother. Our own mother is a robin harpy.\" You roll your eyes. \"By the way,\" says Kate. \"Pele suffers from Glutos Syndrome, so don't you dare make fun of her.\" \"Glutos Syndrome?\" \"It's a condition that only female monsters get. It causes their butts to grow to an immense size that dwarfs the rest of them. It's not contagious but it can't be cured.\" You stick out your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate flies over the ocean and sure enough, she arrives at what looks like a gigantic yellow houseboat that had a metallic hull. There was a mailbox at the side that was shaped like a pelican's mouth and what looked like a satellite dish on the top of the boat. It looked like a floating mansion. \"That's where she lives?\" you ask. Kate nods her head. \"Pele is a diver by profession. Sometimes she finds buried treasure under the ocean.\" You give an evil smirk. If you play your cards right, you might to be able to milk this harpy for all she was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of the houseboat, Kate was in the kitchen cooking an eel that was bigger than a blue whale in a skillet. Pele was a pelican harpy with long aquamarine hair and the face of a pelican with an enormous blue beak. She had white wings with blue spots and blue webbed talons for feet True to Kate's words, her butt was so big that it look up most of her back and was almost touching her neck. She had the radio on as she was cooking and swaying to the beat right before Kate came in and turned the music off, startling her as she turns around, sitting on the stove in the process and burning her buns, causing her to jump forward and squawk. \"Kate?\" asks Pele. \"What a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kate hugs her sister, you look around and see that Pele had quite an opulent looking home. There were several expensive paintings hanging on the wall and a display case of all sorts of treasures including among other things, a shield made out of orichalchum, a golden dagger, a tiara shaped like a pair of dolphins and what appeared to be a black pearl that would be the size of a beach ball at human scale. The diving business must've paid off because this pelican girl was loaded. Perhaps it might pay to be nice for now. You then grunt as Kate grabs you and takes you out of her purse to show you to Pele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pele,\" she says. \"This is Wade. I've arranged for him to spend 7 days with each of my younger sisters and decided to start with the baby of the family, namely, you. After he's served his purpose, you can send him to Shanta. But for now, he'll assist you in your work.\" Pele picks you up and holds you in front of her beak as she squats down to rest her rear on the floor. \"Hello,\" you say faking being sweet. \"You must be Pele. Beautiful name for someone with the figure of a goddess. That is a lovely hair color. Is it natural? What a coincidence, pelicans happen to be my favorite animal.\" Kate gives a glare because she knows what you're up to and doesn't appreciate it. Pele however, doesn't notice your ulterior motives and just laughs. \"Nice try, casanova,\" says the pelican harpy as she lifts her enormous webbed foot and shows an engagement ring on one of her talons. \"But I just got engaged. My boyfriend and I are getting married as soon as the wedding dress is ready. It will be a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nods her head. \"I'll just leave you two alone.\" Kate flies off and Pele places you on the table before she takes out the eel from her skillet and places it on a plate before cutting it. \"So,\" you say as Pele hands you a piece of eel. \"You sure have a lot of valuable stuff here.\" Pele shrugs her shoulders as she plunks down in five chairs at once. \"You never know what you'll find underwater. I'm a treasure hunter by profession. Some of the treasures I keep, some I sell to museums or collectors. Sometimes its not exactly valuables. Sometimes it's just a matter of photographing rare fish, mining rare minerals, harvesting deep sea plants. It keeps me busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite into a piece of eel and gag right before Pele swallows her eel with one gulp. She seemed friendly enough. Or gullible. Whatever worked for you. If you played your cards right, you figured you could escape and steal something valuable from her house boat. It was at that moment.</span></div></div>",

Now you were alone with all this priceless loot. You looked around to see what was small enough for you to take. Before you could decide though, Pele came stomping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in the short time she had left, she had changed into a black, high-tech diving suit with an odd looking mask. You snickered as you saw the suit was extremely tight around her gigantic rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm all set. I've got a dive to do. There's a pirate shipwreck a couple miles out loaded with treasure.\" Pele said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes lit up. Maybe you could get this harpy to take you with her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Destiny keeps on flapping, you hang on tight to her skirt, but the wind is too strong. But when it looks like you'd fly off and then fall to your death, you see Destiny's pinkish red hair flowing in the wind above you and get an idea. You grab the hair and start to climb. Miraculously Destiny didn't notice you. As you're snickering to yourself about the irony of the situation, you grab hold of a gray hair, Destiny's been getting a lot of them since you came to Under Gloom. Maybe all that stress you throw her way will give her a heart attack. Wouldn't that be wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you feel wind on you and look up to see that Destiny was flapping her wings harder and flying downwards. She flew over several skyscrapers as she was making her way to the street where she spotted what appeared to be an old clock tower. Destiny nods her head and flies closer towards the the side of the tower and you reveal that surprisingly the tower looked like it had been modified into a small house. Looked sort of gothic in appearance, was this her place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to get your answer because Destiny walked right up to the door and knocked on it. You climbed up and stood on the back of her bra to maintain your footing. You took it this far and couldn't afford to let that big blue bitch find you now or you're dead meat. Sure enough the door opens up and another gargoyle walks out, as tall as Destiny. Except this gargoyle was considerably younger. She looked similar to Destiny except for her indigo skin and the fact that her horns were smaller, almost underdeveloped looking. The younger gargoyle was heavyset in appearance in contrast to Destiny's hourglass figure and had brownish blonde hair rather than Destiny's pinkish red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger gargoyle smiles at Destiny and gestures to her to come in. \"Hi Mom.\" She says. \"Mom?!\" you wonder to yourself. \"That must've been Fate.\" Destiny actually smiles herself as she kisses her daughter and walks in. You didn't think the old bat was capable of smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost weight since the last time I saw you Fate,\" says Destiny. \"Just don't go overboard.\" As you hang on tight to Destiny's hair, you hold your ears because the sounds of grinding gears filled the air. How could anyone stand living in a clock tower?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Fate as she scratches her large stomach. \"I see you're finally listening to the doctor.\" Destiny lets out a scoff and crosses her arms. \"What does he know? If you hadn't given me hell about it, I would've never agreed to this.\" Fate crosses her arms and gives her mom a glare. \"Well can you blame me? Since I hatched I can't remember a time when you took a day off from work. No one needs a vacation more than you.\" Destiny sticks out her tongue. Even when she's off work, that gargoyle is the most stubborn bitch you've ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't poke the bear Fate,\" says Destiny. \"Ever second that two-faced viper Belladonna is in charge worries me.\" \"Then why did you put that bitch in charge? She's after your job.\" \"What choice did I have Fate? She's the only one even remotely qualified to be my successor.\" Fate gives a smug smile. \"Successor? That won't be necessary. There's no way you'll willingly retire and you're much too stubborn to die.\" Destiny slightly scoffs at her daughter's joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate realizes that her mom isn't exactly in the mood for humor and lets out a sigh. \"Perhaps some tea will put you in a better mood.\" As Fate heads into the kitchen, you get a good look at her and you're surprised. Aside from the colors of her skin and hair and obviously her weight... no way. How ironic given your nickname for Destiny. It was outright hilarious. Except that in this case they're on the same side. Better be careful, Fate could be just as nasty as Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you turn your head and gasp because you see Destiny's blue, claw covered hand coming forward. You get out of the way as the warden scratches her neck and nearly feels you. If Destiny caught you out of Under Gloom, she'll hit the ceiling. You fall back on the top of Fate's couch and then make a run for the end to climb to the floor. As you pant to yourself, Destiny's ear twitched. \"What the hell was that noise?\" she asks. \"A mouse running up the clock?\" As Destiny turns her head, you hide under the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was too close, your most hated enemy almost saw you and you were in her daughter's house. If either of them saw you, it was game over. Destiny was going to check under the couch, but Fate saw what she was doing just as she put the kettle on. \"Mother!\" she yells out in an annoyed tone. \"Relax. What is wrong with you.\" \"Uh nothing sweetie,\" says Destiny. \"I just thought I heard Wade. That man is the bane of my existence. Making a mockery of the justice system, attempted breakouts, calling me Demona! I've never had a more troublesome inmate in all my years of security. If he was a monster, I'd strangle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's ranting, you secretly give Destiny the middle finger. \"Up yours Demona,\" you say. \"You're in for a rude awakening once your \"vacation\" is over. I'll be long gone jerk face.\" Wait, now's not the time to be insulting Destiny. If she or Ang...er Fate saw you, you'd be back to Under Gloom, or worse. Destiny calms down and sits on the couch as Fate shakes her head. \"I better get dinner ready. You're still on edge. It's always Wade this or Wade that. If you hate him so much, why don't you just squish him?\" It shocked you that the nicer of the two gargoyles casually suggested killing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely had to get out of this place. That's when you look forward and notice a back door in Fate's kitchen. If you could make it, you were home free. Of course, that would involve being in Destiny's line of sight. You were playing with dynamite today boy. But no matter, you inhale deeply as Destiny tries to calm herself by reading the newspaper and prepare to run for it. In an instant, you zip out from under the couch towards the kitchen, hoping for the best.</span></div></div>",

Fate at the time is busy with the oven when she hears her mother calling. \"What was what?\" \"I-I thought I saw W-Wade.\" Fate rolls her eyes and lets out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" she says. \"Relax. Wade is locked up in Under Gloom.\" The younger gargoyle shakes her head before she puts a pasta pot on the oven and starts to boil water. \"She's getting worse. That Wade is going to put her in the K.D.P. if this keeps up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, you're forced to roll out of the way just as Fate is about to step on you. You look up and have to cover your eyes as you gaze upon the biggest pair of panties you've ever seen. You shudder and avert your eyes, but you got enough of a glance to see Fate's tight black panties that looked like dental floss against her purplish skin. You feel like washing your eyes out given that was Destiny's daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't think of that right now, while Fate is busy chopping vegetables, you have to think of a way to get out of there As you ponder to yourself, you see an open window and there was a large tomato plant right next to it. \"Perfect.\" You say as you rub your hands. While Fate is busy with some peppers and humming to herself, you make your way to the plant and jump up to grab a leaf to climb. As you look up the stem, you see that the plant is just tall enough to reach the open window. Soon you'd be out of there and neither Destiny or her daughter would be the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you hear rumbling and hide behind the plant on top of a particularly large tomato. It would seem fate isn't on your side today (Literally) because Fate walks right up to the window. \"Jalape\u00f1o,\" the overweight gargoyle curses. \"I've got to remember to keep this window closed. It could let in those blasted pigeons.\" With that your window of opportunity is closed (again literally) and you groan to yourself and grab hold of your hair. Fate just ruined your escape attempt. You were starting to hate her as much as you hate her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think things couldn't get any worse, Fate turns to her tomato plant. \"Oh good,\" she says. \"They're just ripe enough.\" Fate reaches down and you begin to sweat because she's obviously decided to make tomato salad.

Just then, Fate grabbed the tomato you were on and as she lifted it up, you lost your balance and fell off it and headed head-first towards the floor. As you fell, you shut your eyes you couldn't believe this! You were gonna die like this! A bitter smirk made its way to your face...at least you weren't rotting in a prison cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the fall stopped abruptly and you landed with a WHAP! onto something large and warm...felt like skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute! You open your eyes and look up. You were resting in the palm of a hand...no a claw! and you look up to see who held you and you saw it was Fate. She'd caught you before you'd splattered on the ground. She raised you to her face and studied you.  <br>\r\n\"A human?\" she asked, as she carefully lowered to to her counter. \"Who are you and how'd you get in my house?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David Xanatos\" you said, saying the first name that popped into your head as you looked at this Angela look-alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate did something that shocked you at the false name: she giggled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, you were. But she didn't need to know that. You shook your head no at her question. \"Least I don't have a beard...the multi-billion cooperation would be nice though...\" you joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. \"Very! So...just how did you get into my place?\" the gargoyle giantess asked, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story, monster-sized pidgions...please don't ask. Thanks for catching me from that fall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate nodded at that \"Welcome.\" She said before studying you a bit. \"You know...if you're worried about things like that, my mom could probably help you, seeing as she's in law enforcement. She's here now, if you'd like me to take you to her. But she's really stressed out because of her job...some guy named Wade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you shout quickly, you couldn't let Destiny find you. Fate raises a brow and looks at you and you realize you need to cover your tracks, \"Er...a stressed-looking gargoyle muttering about humans is your mom? Given her mindset right now, she'd probably think I'm this \"Wade\" guy she's complaining about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate sighed and shook her head \"...I can believe that, David. Wade's got my mom half-dead from stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-dead? Good!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate looked in the direction of the living room, looking worried. \"You know, I hear this Wade guy is a real piece of work. It's lucky for him that Mom and I like humans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He'd be dead otherwise. But what I don't get is WHY this Wade guy hates monsters so much? We're not all bad. It varies with us as much as it dose with humans...why the grudge?\" Fate was pretty much talking to herself at this point, but you still heard her. With how she looked and what she was saying, she really did resemble Angela. It made you wonder (in spite of yourself) if her dad had a personality like Goliath or one like Thailog...personally you were hoping for Goliath, but oh, wouldn't that be ironic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought about that, You find yourself looking at the young gargoyle girl, you'd say in her twenties (though you knew absolutely nothing about how long monsters lived). She was the same size as Destiny and looked like her in the face except she had purple skin, long brownish black hair and smaller horns than Destiny's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I get it somewhat: he's a prisoner, she's the warden. They're not supposed to be on good terms, but why's he so out to get my mom killed by her stress? The break-outs are bad enough, but come on! Calling her that! Demona! Wade's not the first person to compare my mom to that fictitious maniac. Apparently they didn't know real gargoyles actually existed and happened to design a villain who turned out to look almost identical to somebody who was nothing like her personality wise. It wasn't very funny. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to know you look just like a cartoon villain? The closest thing to mom's current level of anger is a crocodile with a toothache being repeatedly poked in the eye with a stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate turned to you, \"David...you're human. Any ideas about this?\" she asked, making you want to laugh. She was talking to the one who was making her mother so mad and didn't even know it! You shrug \"Can't tell you what goes on in someone else's head.\" it was weird talking about yourself in the third person, but you couldn't drop the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and looked at you apologetically, \"Right...sorry.\" she smiled at you. \"Sorry...never really talked to a guy before.\" she sounded somewhat embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why not?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate rolled her eyes in exasperation, \"Mom.\" she said as if that summed up everything. Guess the blue bat is just as overprotective with Fate as she is nasty to you. She clapped her hands as if she just remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho, right...the Jalape\u00f1o tomato salad...need to finish that. Sorry for the sidetrack there, but I need to finish this first. Sorry David.\" she said and then went back to her cooking. As she did that, you look around for another exit besides the window that you could use since you were on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck. There wasn't one. Damn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate finished up the food, she pulled out something the size of a button, a human-sized plate, and set it in front of you and poured some of the freshly-made meal into it. You look at it, then up at her, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did arrive in time for dinner, David,\" she told you, \"if I can't at least introduce you and mom, I can at least offer my hospitality to you.\" Fate smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and thank her. Hey, it's better than prison food. You let the meal cool off as Fate loaded up two plates for her and Destiny, then took them out to her mom while you ate. Had to admit, Fate was a good cook. After a while, your hostess arrived and placed the dishes in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyed it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate nodded, pleased with the news. Then her eyes brightened as if she had just thought of something. \"Hey David, I need to head to work soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. What did that have to dooo...OH SHIT! If Fate left, you'd be stuck here with Destiny! Not good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate nodded at your look of panic, figuring out what you did. \"Yeah, mom'lol loose it if she finds a guy in my house, but don't worry.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, she didn't know you were the Wade Wilson who was causing her mother so much stress and it was kinda funny that the eggplant skinned marshmallow believed your lie about being David Xanatos, but being that close to your most hated enemy's daughter creeped you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited in the kitchen for Fate to get dressed for work, being sure to keep an eye out for Destiny. You don't know how she feels about Xanatos but you definitely know how she feels about you and would skin you alive if she caught you in her daughter's home. You hear tremors and hide behind a saltshaker before you see it was Fate entering the kitchen again. You look and see that she appears to be wearing a black shirt and pants like a security guard would wear complete with the cap and what looked like a taser and communicator in her belt. You look up at her name tag and it reads \"Security, Fate Sirtis\", making you laugh. Until now you had never heard Destiny's surname and oh the delicious irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, David,\" says Fate. \"Mom won't like it if she sees a guy in my house, so I have no choice but to bring you to work with me.\" You roll your eyes. But then you realize that you could always ditch the gargoyle giantess and make a break for it first chance you got. \"Proceed.\" You say. That was when Fate snatches you up and shoves you into her cleavage as you grunt. She shoves you in extra deep so there'd be no way Destiny would see you. You couldn't believe it, trapped between the boobs of your enemy's daughter. How humiliating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Fate is getting ready to leave and her mother stands up. \"I wish you didn't have a job where you had to work so late at night.\" \"Mom,\" says Fate. \"We're gargoyles. We're supposed to active at night. Some idiots probably think we spend the whole day as immobile rock.\" Fate lets out a laugh at that joke but Destiny isn't laughing. \"Just, please be careful. You and that lamebrain friend of yours, Beth, are the only guards at the Daily Tombstone.\" \"Don't worry, Mom. I'll be back home before you know it. Make yourself at home, relax and above all, don't think about Wade.\" Fate kisses her mother before walking out of the clock tower and spreading her wings to fly away carrying you between her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally surface and inhaled deeply as you grabbed your tongue. Your mouth tasted like gargoyle sweat. \"Sorry about that,\" says Fate. \"But you have to stay there until we land, David.\" You let out a laugh to yourself. The flying purple blob didn't know it, but she was about to help you escape. \"So,\" you say. \"What's your father like A... er... Fate.\" \"Heck if I know,\" says Fate. \"I never met him. He and Mom weren't even married and he headed for the hills the moment he realized she was pregnant.\" \"Sounds like the sap grew a brain.\" You thought to yourself. You can't help but wonder where the blockhead was now. Probably having the time of his life without Big Blue to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Fate arrived at her destination and you look up to see that it was an office building with the symbol of a gravestone on the side that appeared to have a bugle imprinted on it. \"This is it,\" said Fate as she took you out and placed you on her shoulder. \"The Daily Tombstone.\" \"A newspaper?\" you ask. \"Doesn't sound too exciting. Why would they need a guard?\" \"Believe me,\" says Fate. \"It's a cutthroat business. Just last year, I found out a leprechaun intern we hired was actually a spy trying to steal our byline. She wasn't feeling that lucky afterwards.\" Fate let out a giggle to herself at that joke. \"However, I have to warn you Mr. X, there are a few monster girls you should avoid. The first is Grace Bass, a werecheetah who is the food critic.\" \"So?\" you ask. \"Do you have any idea how many restaurants in Fearfield have humans on the menu.\" That was a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next monster you have to avoid at all costs is Aurelia, a werejackal that works as the handy woman around here. She'd love to chomp your bones. I know her personally since her wife works for my mom; she's married to a rather nasty hyena.\" Your eyes pop at that thought. \"Cree's married?!\" you think to yourself. Huh, a jackal and hyena couple. This is getting more and more ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially beware of Ari,\" says Fate. \"The meanest were sheep I've ever seen.\" You let out a laugh at that. Werewolves, werehyenas and werebears were something to worry about, but a sheep? What's she gonna do? Wool you to death? \"Don't laugh, David,\" says Fate. \"Weresheep are one of the top ten most predatory monsters in the world. The humans Ari doesn't see as food, she sees as slaves. It disgusts me. Above all, I want you to stay away from my boss, Lexi.\" \"What is she?\" you ask sarcastically. \"A werehamster?\" Fate gives you a dead serious look. \"Lexi's a sphinx. If she catches you, you'll have to prove you're David Xanatos, because if you can't answer her riddle correctly, you'll get a full tour of a winged lioness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was terrific. You grab your hair. Escaping from this dump would be harder than you thought with at least four predators to worry about. But at least it was better than Under Gloom. Fate walks into the building's garage with you on her shoulder and the first monster you see is a fat yellow orange furred wereboar girl in black leather polishing a motorcycle with a warthog's head at the front. \"Harley?\" asks Fate. \"What are you doing here? I thought your shift was over hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, the wereboar girl, lets out a snort before answering Fate. \"Emma asked me to give her a ride home,\" says Harley in what sounds like a Brazilian accent. \"Her license was revoked.\" \"Big surprise.\" Says Fate sarcastically. As Fate walks forward, a were bear approaches her. This bear was as big as Ursula but unlike Ursula, she was a polar bear and had blonde hair. The way she was dressed she looked like a furry version of Emma Frost. \"Hi Emma.\" Says Fate. Emma squints slightly and smiles. \"Oh, hey Fate.\" Emma walks up to a potted palm tree and tapped it. \"Come on, Harley,\" she says. \"I'd like to go home some time tonight.\" You look in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma's blind as a bat,\" says Fate. \"And yet she refuses to wear glasses.\" You can't blame the arctic fleabag. You didn't like the idea of looking like a nerd any better than she did. That was when you hear stomping and soon Fate finds herself face to face with a chalk white skinned vampiress, pear shaped in appearance with long blonde hair. She was wearing purple jeans that were tight on her fat ass and a bat girl T-shirt. You look up and gag. One side of her face was hideously scarred with charred skin, exposed muscular tissue and missing lips. It looked like half her face was made out of rancid bacon. It makes you want to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blind as a <i>bat</i>!?\" yells the vampiress. \"Are you implying I need glasses Fate?! Is that it, you fat purple church warmer!?\" Fate lets out a sigh. \"Tara,\" you say. \"Lighten up. It's a figure of speech. You're the most paranoid vampire I've ever met.\" \"Not to mention the ugliest.\" You think to yourself. Tara hisses at Fate before she gets into her car and drives away. Fate shook her head. \"Tara was once the most beautiful reporter at the Daily Tombstone until half her face was caught in the sun. Any longer and she would've turned to ash. She's been in a rotten mood ever since. Oh. You better make yourself scarce. Here comes Cleotiti.\" \"Who?\" you ask. \"Our fashion columnist,\" replies Fate. \"The sweetest girl I know. Cleo used to love humans, especially human children. But when she was in the Van Nuys, some jerk set her on fire and traumatized her for life. Whenever she sees a human she panics and throws a screaming fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes popped. That sounded familiar. You look forward and your jaw drops. \"Oh hell.\" You mutter. The mummy who walked forward was pear-shaped and was wrapped in bright yellow gauze up to her neck. She had dark skin with scarab shaped earrings and long green hair worn in a ponytail. You recognized her right away. That was the same mummy you burned! Just your luck; one of Fate's coworkers was the monster that put you in Under Gloom in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti walks forward and you grab some of Fate's hair in an attempt to hide. \"Hi Cleo.\" Cleo walks up to Fate as you begin to sweat. Will that mummy see the very man who scarred her for life and blow your cover?</span></div></div>",

If she saw you and threw a tizzy, Fate would know you were lying and you'd be back to Under Gloom, or worse. But surprisingly, the mummy giantess just waves to Fate and you let out a sigh of relief as she walks away. As Fate walked into the building you begin to laugh to yourself. From the looks of it, everybody is already leaving. It must be around quitting time for everyone else. After all, Fate is the night guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll have the place to yourself tonight.\" You joke. Fate shrugs her shoulders. \"My job is to make sure nobody suspicious gets in after everyone else has already gone home. But sometimes the others stay late.\" Fate points to a were jackal woman that was busy repairing a hole in the wall. You gulp and see that the were jackal was an hourglass shaped, teal furred jackal with one normal eye and one disfigured eye and for clothing she was wearing a necklace made out of human skulls. That must've been Aurelia. So that's the monster that married Cree. Well, she definitely looked crazy and brutal enough to be soulmate to that horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Aurelia?\" you ask Fate as the gargoyle places you on her shoulder. \"Yep,\" says Fate. \"She and Cree have been married for ten years now. I'd stay away from her if I were you. The one thing they have most in common is their bloodthirsty appetite towards humans.\" You shiver but when you look closer, you see Aurelia is more focused on repairing the hole in the wall. \"Where the hell did that hole come from?\" Fate lets out a sigh. \"Tim. Our photographer. The guy has more bad luck than a hellcat. That's why we had to hire Aurelia to undo the damage he did to the place.\" \"Sounds like a real klutz,\" you say. \"What kind of monster is he? A minotaur?\" You let out a laugh. \"See what I did there?\" Fate just let out a groan. Guess the purple bimbo inherited her mom's sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim isn't a monster. He's a human.\" You almost have a mental stroke. A human working for monsters?! What kind of traitor was he? \"You've gotta be kidding me?! A human in a work environment like this. That's stupid. The idiot could get himself eaten. I thought you said your boss was a sphinx? Why doesn't she munch him.\" Fate let out a scoff. \"You don't know how sphinxes work, do you David? Lexi can't eat him. He answered her riddle, so she gave him a job instead. Once you answer a sphinx's riddle correctly, you're off limits to her stomach.\" You roll your eyes. Regardless of how it happened, in your mind, Tim's actions were treason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate walks forward, you see several of her coworkers who were still working late. One was an obese and naked weretigress wearing jewelry that was ironically made of tiger's eye. Another one was an elderly looking Chinese dragon with green scales and a Chun-Li style hairdo. Third was one just getting ready to leave. She was a fat black furred wererat with bluish black hair. She was wearing a gray shirt with blue jeans and a red jacket. On her shoulder was a goofy looking blond human boy wearing a green jacket, black shirt and a bow tie with cargo pants. That must've been Tim. Looking at him, you find it hard to believe the guy outwitted a sphinx. He looked like a real doof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat giantess noticed Fate and smiled. \"Hi Fate,\" she says. \"Who's your friend?\" \"He says his name is David Xanatos.\" Says Fate. The wererat girl just rolls her eyes. \"My condolences.\" She says. Apparently she doesn't think much of your fake identity. The rat girl walks forward with Tim on her shoulder as Fate lowers you to Tim's level. \"Hi, David,\" he said. \"I'm Tim. You know, I kinda pictured you differently.\" \"Idiot.\" You think to myself.\" Tim then gestures to the wererat carrying him. \"This beautiful mountain of rodent is my girlfriend, Mazee.\" You have a mental heart attack. GIRLFRIEND!? The rat was his girlfriend. The idea of a human monster romance disgusted you. And of all monsters, he had to be dating a skyscraper sized sewer dwelling vermin that eats toxic waste?! What is wrong with this guy?! Of course, the fact that she was named Mazee, only added to who her appearance reminded you of. If only it was spelled differently, it would add to the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't your boyfriend is he, Fate?\" asked Mazee. \"Your mom would have a cow.\" You feel sick. The idea of being Fate's boyfriend frightened you. You have no doubt Destiny would be a horrible mother-in-law given how she treats you now. Fate just shakes her head. \"Nuh-uh,\" she says. \"A pigeon dropped him in my kitchen and I took him to work because Mom's stress has reached a boiling point. She'd blow her top if she saw a complete stranger in my house.\" \"So she's finally taking a vacation?\" asks Tim with a laugh. \"That Wade must be a real jerk if he's got her so mad. Willa said the last time she visited Under Gloom, the old girl was spitting nails due to Wade blowing up the septic system in a misguided escape attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't amused. Destiny made you clean up that mess all by yourself. If you it weren't for monster baking soda being more potent than normal baking soda, you would've been freed. Fate just let out a sigh. \"Don't remind me. Wade has stressed my mother out so much that one more outrage could give her a heart attack.\" You smile at that. Just one more? You hope Fate's not exaggerating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Mazee. \"Tim and I have to get going now. See you later Fate.\" \"Bye Fate.\" Says Tim as he waves away. \"Bye Xanatos.\" \"So long, dummy.\" You think to yourself. It isn't long before Fate makes her way towards the guard room. Inside, there was another guard getting ready to leave. She was a brown haired monster resembling an enormous tan-yellow hippopotamus, except her skin looked like that of a dragon or a dinosaur. She was wearing a white version of Fate's outfit and from the looks of it, there was a tattoo of a skull on her right butt cheek sticking out of her crack. \"Running late are we, Fate?\" asks the pachyderm giantess. \"I had some expected company, and unexpected company,\" said Fate. \"David, this is my friend Beth. She's the day guard.\" Fate holds you up in front of Beth's hippo-like snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" says Beth. \"Looks a bit feisty, not up to my standards but he's definitely perfect for you.\" You step back in Fate's palm. \"What the hell kind of monster is she?\" you ask. \"A werehippo?\" Fate lets out a snort. \"What, haven't you ever seen a behemoth before?\" \"What's a behemoth?\" you ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a land based creature from biblical mythology,\u201d says Beth. \u201cCompare the leviathan. I hate leviathans. Well, nice meeting you David.\u201d Beth starts to walk away and you keep looking to see her rump shaking and get a closer look at that skull tattoo. \"I'd be careful around her,\" says Fate. \"Beth has a fetish for dominating human men. The last time she had a crush on a human, she broke him.\" You let out a gulp before Fate puts you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate takes her seat you look up to see tens of monitors from security cameras. And to think, Fate has to look at all those screens every night. You'd hate to have that kind of job. But at least Fate didn't know who you were. Speaking of which, she seemed to have her eyes glued to the screens. This could be the perfect chance to get away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since Fate is distracted, you have your perfect chance to escape. You see the gargoyle giantess's tail wagging and jump out to grab it to swing down to safety. \"Heh, heh,\" you laugh to yourself. \"Eat your heart out Xanatos. Boy would Demona's face be red if she knew her dimwitted daughter helped me escape.\" You laughed it up as you ran into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and rub your hands as you look further down the hall. This was your chance to escape and then you make a run for it. You thought that you'd be out in no time. But you forgot one thing about these news studios. The way they were designed was like mazes in order to confuse criminals, like you. After half an hour, you let out a grunt. \"Well, with any luck, Angela hasn't seen me. I doubt those cameras were designed to spot something as small as me. There's gotta be somebody who hasn't left yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You make your way to a desk near a door that read \"Editor in Chief\". At the desk was a sleeping tanuki woman who from the way she was dressed, was obviously the secretary. \"Do tanukis eat humans?\" you ask yourself. \"Well, maybe she knows how to get out of here. \"Hello!\" you yell. \"Hello!\" However, the tanuki woman just snoozed away. \"Hello!\" you yell. \"You lazy fatass! Wake up!\" You let out a groan and then notice the tanuki woman was wearing earplugs. You slap yourself in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a door opening and out walks a giant violet furred sphinx with long gray hair and large feathered wings. She was wearing a lavender business suit and a pair of glasses. However, what was really bizarre was that instead of walking on only two legs, she walked on all fours. Unlike other monsters, sphinxes walked on their hands and feet just like animals. Freaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember something, that must've been Lexi, the sphinx boss that Fate warned you about. You step back as Lexi turns to her secretary. She shook her head. \"Asleep on the job again,\" she complained. \"If good secretaries were easy to find, you'd be so fired Kiki.\" That's when Lexi sniffed the air. She turned around and saw you trying to sneak away before she let out a purr. \"Well what do we have here?\" asked the sphinx. You try to run but Lexi jumps out and lands in front of you before licking her lips. \"Crap!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi begun to circle you like a shark as she begun to drool. \"I haven't eaten a live human for some time. But, that means I have to ask you a riddle. Tell me, what's your name?\" Lexi licked her lips. You couldn't tell her you real name. Perhaps if you continued the masquerade, you'd be able to intimidate Lexi into leaving you alone. \"I'm David Xanatos, bitch.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lexi gives a smirk that makes you shiver and shake. \"Xanatos eh?\" she says. \"If you're really David Xanatos, you should be clever enough to solve my hardest riddle.\" \"Crap.\" You groan. Lexi smirked before she extended her claws. \"I'll make a deal with you, Xanatos. You know, a lot of monsters, especially gargoyles, aren't particularly fond of you. But I'll make you a deal. Answer my riddle correctly and I'll let you live. Answer incorrectly and you become part of my thighs.\" Lexi grins and shows you her razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gulp. Destiny may be a bitch but at least she doesn't try to eat you. You should've stayed with Fate. But you stare down Lexi and grit your teeth. \"Hit me with your best shot Hello Kitty.\" You say rudely. Lexi smirks before asking the riddle. \"There is a place where I see everything, it's the very same place where I hear every ring. This place I retreat to all of the time, is the very same place where I thought up this rhyme. Where is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sweating bullets as Lexi wags her tail and looks at you with hungry eyes. It's now or never.</span></div></div>",

This place I retreat to all of the time, is the very same place where I thought up this rhyme...where could that be? Her office? Since she was there all the time, it made sense, but you weren't sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unsettling enough with this jigsaw puzzle of an old lady looking down at you and licking her chops. But this just had to be the hardest Riddle she knew! Riddles made your head hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're head?\" you say, asking it more like a question. Crossing your fingers that you were right. You didn't bust out of prison just to get eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant violet furred sphinx blinked and then scowled. \"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWha...? Did that mean you? YES! You resist the urge to taunt Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi regarded you, looking annoyed. \"Well, guess you are who you say you are, Xanatos We sphinx have a very specific code we have to follow with human prey: we can only eat those who get our riddles wrong, if we don't limit our human prey to that...\" she shuttered, then begrudgingly jerked her head in giving you permission to pass her.  \"Since you got it right, I'm not allowed to try eating you from this point onwards...you're free to go. Also, be careful of some of the employees here, human-eaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, feeling smug. You loved ticking off monsters. Maybe that was why you even enjoyed your failed attempts to escape Under Gloom: making Destiny crazy. You walk past the Sphinx. Feeling you were on top of the wold right now. You were out  of prison, and had gotten out from under Destiny's nose later because of her own dimwitted daughter, and you had just outsmarted a monster that planned on eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn you felt good! Now all you had to do was find the way out of here and you were set! After a few hours of wandering around, you spot what looked like a door leading out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of how good you were feeling as things going so smoothly crashed to the ground when you failed to notice a huge shadow pass over you and you suddenly crash into something and fall on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, what have we here?\" a huge voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up, you see what you hit was a giant foot. One of the monsters that worked here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question was, who was it? As much as you hated her species, you actually hoped it was Fate.  That would be the best option for your safety, but you REALLY hoped it wasn't Cree's....ugh!...wife, Aurelia!</span></div></div>",

Like the shadow of Anubis, Aurelia, Cree's were jackal wife is looking down on you with hungry eyes... er... eye. and drooling. \"Looks like Mazee isn't hear to save you now, my little... hey, wait, you're not Tim!\" Aurelia squats down to get a closer look at you as you step back. You're betting that Cree told her about you, but with any luck Aurelia wouldn't recognize you. But then she'd probably still eat you. Aurelia tries to focus her good eye on you and then you run to the side with her maimed eye before Aurelia lets out a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up ahead but Aurelia jumps in front of you and growls, prompting you to run to the side. Unfortunately, Aurelia leaps in front of you again and gives an evil laugh. As you keep trying to dodge Aurelia she keeps easily keeping up on you. \"Damn!\" you yell. Aurelia was way faster and more agile than Cree. Then again, it made sense since she didn't have several thousand tons of lard weighing her down. Aurelia licks her lips as she looks down on you. \"You might as well give up,\" says the jackal giantess. \"I'll be eating you soon my salty boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to sweat and then you notice a hole in the wall and bolt just as Aurelia is about to grab you. The Anubis-like titaness lets out a growl and tries to run after you, but you hide in the hole. She lowers her head down and you get a good view of that messed up eye. You wonder why she'd use her blind eye to look in for you but then again, she was probably trying to scare you. You don't see it, but outside, Aurelia is cracking an evil smirk. You look out and then look around and see that jackal is nowhere in sight. \"Stupid dog.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out immediately thinking that you've won, but then you gag as a furry hand grabs you. You look back to see that Aurelia was squatting on a chair that she placed over the hole in order to fool you.

What if Lexi or Aurelia were to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scoff. \"No sweat. I already out smarted that oversized pussycat.\" Fate just gives a smile. \"I should've known you of all people shouldn't have any trouble with riddles. But I better take you back to the guardroom to keep a closer eye on you.\" You want to complain but you remember you have to keep up the ruse of being Xanatos. Otherwise Fate will realize something was up. As much as you hated her for being A) a gargoyle and B) Destiny's daughter, you had no choice but to be pleasant with her. And that was going to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the guard room, Fate places you down and continues to watch the security screens while sipping from a cup of coffee. You see a photograph of her as a child with Destiny and even then Destiny has the same stern gaze you've grown used to. Not surprising given that she had to raise Fate alone and was working at Under Gloom even then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" you say to Fate. \"Your mom sounds real uptight to me.\" \"Unfortunately,\" says Fate. \"Mom has always had trouble with stress. Which leads one to wonder why she chose to work in a prison of all things. But that's gargoyle instincts for you. Most of us get jobs in law enforcement or rescue work. It's that desire to serve and protect that has etched itself in our genes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B.S.\" You think to yourself. Then you clear your throat. \"Is anyone else in your family that messed up.\" \"Actually,\" says Fate. \"No. Well not really. Mom's sister, Fortuna is actually the exact opposite of mom, temper-wise.\" You gag. Destiny actually HAS a sister? What an ugly horror she must be.\" Fate then gives a laugh. \"Ironically, Aunt Fortuna has a husband who is also named David. Kinda funny. Mom of course doesn't like him that much but she at least tolerates him. After what my father put her through, she's become the biggest misandrist I know. If she's told me once, she's told me a million times, \"Men are Poison\". By the time I'm ready to date, she'll be dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh at that but you figured at much. There had to be a reason why Destiny gave you the hardest time of all. You start to think that no man would get near Fate if it meant having that barracuda as a mother-in-law. \"Does your Aunt Fortuna have any kids?\" \"Just my cousin, Pearl,\" says Fate. \"Pearl seems to have inherited mom's temper and then some. The thing is, you've probably noticed that gargoyles are among the biggest monster species in existence.\" That you knew. Destiny was the biggest monster you've ever met. Fate then sighs again. \"Pearl is an exception to the rule. She was born with a growth disorder and is abnormally short for a gargoyle. She's less than half my height and she's already old enough to drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally laugh. Sounds like a female version of Lexington. It also sounded like Pearl was much like one of those annoying chihuahuas. It's always the smallest dogs that had the big bad attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you say. \"You have a cousin but what about brothers and sisters.\" \"Just one half-sister.\" Says Fate uneasily. You raise an eyebrow. \"After my dad abandoned my Mom, let's just say history repeated itself with another gargoyle and that resulted in my younger sister, Bona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly that name rang a bell. \"Bona?\" you ask. \"As in Bona Fete.\" Fate groaned and anxiously bit into a donut. \"Don't remind me. That girl is the most reckless, ill-raised gargoyle I've met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this. Fate's sister was Bona Fete. Bona was the most vicious bounty hunter in the monster world. She was a loose cannon who wouldn't hesitate to kill her targets whether or not their crimes were even that serious. She was a muscular gray skinned gargoyle with black hair and dressed up like the Punisher. Her arms were covered in tattoos, each one for a criminal she killed. You really hope that Fate and Bona weren't that close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now...?</span></div></div>",

She wore a chest plate with a Punisher-style skull on it with kevlar pants and combat boots and had black hair. Tattoos covered her arms that looked like the faces of a family tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona Fete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo SHIT! That loose cannon bounty hunter who was known to kill any target no matter what their crime was! Destiny had called in that psychotic bitch?! Ho, you didn't think it was possible to hate Demona any more than you already did, but this takes the cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she doing here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate, looking at you, followed your line of sight and when she saw the screen you were looking at. When she saw who was being shown on it, she paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...wha...wha is SHE doing here!?\" Fate sputtered, then looked down at you. In seconds, before you know what had even happened, her hand had swooped down and she was holding you in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David...for the record, I'm really sorry!\" she said before stuffing you down her shirt and between her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you shake off the vertigo and realized where you were, you felt disgusted. But you hear the door to the guard room shatter as the sound of a gunshot rang through the air. Ho right...the alternative was WAY worse than Fat'es cleavage. As much as you hated it, you were safer here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Fate! How's it goin'?!\" Bona said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bona...you...you just SHOT the door off the frame! You could've used the doorknob!\" Fate shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona scoff, \"Too boring. Anyway I got something to show you.\" she said they you hear something rumaging from a bag and Fate lept back with a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...wha...what the HECK is THAT, Bona?!\" Fate cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head of a Laistrygonian Giant that was caught littering rather than tossing a gum wrapper in a trash can. Should've SEEN how much blood there was when I put one in the bozo's neck to separate their head from the rest of their body! It was great!\" Bona said with relish to her half-sister. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou felt Fate shudder and you actually agreed, damn psycho! Hell must be freezing over, because you agreed with Destiny on something: Bona Fete was a menace! The fact that SHE wasn't in Under Gloom herself was a sign of just how messed up this was! No wonder Fate had hidden you in the first place she could think up on short notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...uh...that's good shooting.\" Fate said, trying to hide her Nashua at what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona smirked at her part-sibling, and then leans forward and licked Fate on the cheek, making her shutter. That was all it took for the earthquake-like vibrations, added onto the jerk backwards from earlier, to send you tumbling out of Fate's shirt and you hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the more deranged gargoyle noticed you first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What's with the bug?\"  Bona asked, seeing you.  She squinted and leaned over you to get a better look, \"Ho...human, same difference.\" Then she grinned and raised a foot over you \"STOMPY-STOMP TIME!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Fate screamed, and tackled Bona, shoving her away from you and they both fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. Did Fate just...save your life? No way! Monsters DON'T protect people! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...as you hide under the desk, and watch the two gargoyles wrestle, you found yourself worried about Fat's well-being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho come one! Its just a human! There's tons of the things!   They populate this world in great numbers, thriving regardless of the circumstances or conditions and are incredibly resilient. However, unlike ants, humans are greedy, selfish, backstabbing liars who would sooner kill you than help you-especially if they thought doing so would benefit them. What does it matter if I kill a few hundred, or even a few million of their kind? They'll grow back soon enough!\" Bona shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but wince at that. The psycho bounty hunter had unknowingly pegged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're WRONG! That's not how humans are! Besides, you kill anyone over anything just to make a few bucks! You're hardly one to talk! And you call yourself a gargoyle?!\" Fate shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw you  out of the corner of her eye, \"Run, David!\" Fate shouted as she grappled with her half-sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it made sense, but it didn't seem right to leave Fate to deal with this freak on her own.  Wait...it doesn't seem right? Since when did you worry about that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get help!\" you promised and bolted out the ruined door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did so, you thought the world must be going mad. You? Help a monster? And Destiny's daughter, no less! Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few tense moments of fruitless searching...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see a shadow and realize that there is somebody in the hallway. Unfortunately, that somebody is Aurelia and she appears to be growling with hunger. \"Oh goody,\" says the jackal giantess as you scream. \"Fresh meat!\" You immediately run the other way with a scream as Aurelia chases after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! Crap! Crappity crap!\" you yell. Unfortunately for you, Aurelia is much faster than Cree is, mostly due to weighing far <i>less</i> than Cree. \"You don't smell like Tim,\" says Aurelia as she comes forward. \"But I'll enjoy devouring you, nonetheless.\" You jump as Aurelia reaches down to growl when you see the broken down door to the guard room and then slip inside the guard room as Bona and Fate are still fighting. At this point, Fate has pinned Bona to the ground and Bona is struggling under her much heavier sister just before spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Bona is still holding onto her gun and then she smirks as she points it at you. \"David!\" yells Fate. \"Get out of the way!\" You step back as Bona manages to roll over and pin Fate before taking aim at you as you scream. At this moment, you hear Aurelia's footsteps. \"You gotta be kidding! How did Tim break this door down? I'm gonna have to stay here extra hours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aurelia walks in, Bona raises her hand slightly, obviously mistaking her for an enemy and fires her gun as Fate gasps. The next thing you hear is Aurelia screaming in pain before a loud thump that creates an earthquake that sends you tumbling across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll across the floor and look forward to see Aurelia unconscious on the ground. Fate looks up in horror as Bona gets up off of her and bites her lip. \"Oh dang.\" \"Aurelia!\" yells Fate. Fate runs up to the unconscious werejackal and then feels her pulse. \"She's still alive,\" she says. \"No thanks to you, Bona.\" \"Come on,\" groans Bona. \"You are not blaming this on me, Sis.\" \"It's COMPLETELY your fault, you trigger happy creep!\" yells Fate. \"I'm calling an ambulance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate takes out her phone, you come to a horrible realization. You just got <i>Cree's</i> wife shot. When she hears about this, you're dead. You look and see that Aurelia's bullet wound looks dangerously close to her spine and she appears to be bleeding rather heavily. This was so not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Fate as she's on the phone. \"That's right,\" she said. \"We're at the Daily Tombstone. One of my coworkers was shot by half-wit half-sister when she tried to go after a human. We need immediate attention.\" You couldn't believe this. You actually hope that Aurelia recovers. Imagine how dangerous Cree would be if she was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, you hear more footsteps and a familiar looking obese shadow comes forward. \"Aurelia?\" asks Cree. \"Are you in here Aurelia?\" You start to bite your nails nervously because there is absolutely no way that this could end good. Cree walks into the guard room and steps in some of Aurelia's blood right before she looks down and looks in absolute horror at her unconscious wife. She has a look of genuine fear and you can even see some tears of despair in her eyes. \"Now, Cree,\" says Fate. \"Remain calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AURELIA!\" shouts Cree as she lifts Aurelia off of the ground. \"Aurelia!\" You never thought you'd see Cree cry. It was kind of scary looking at her when she was like that. \"Stay calm, Cree,\" says Fate. \"Help will be on its way.\" Cree lays Aurelia's unconscious body on one of the chairs in the guardroom as she continues to cry. She then turns around and gives Bona a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree growls and is just about to attack Bona but before she could do anything, Fate grabs hold of her. \"Cree! No!\" Cree lets out a growl. \"Let me at her, Fate,\" says the hyena giantess. \"I'm going to murder that trigger happy creep who hurt my wife!\" Cree is snapping her jaws at Bona as you nervously try to walk away. \"Whatever,\" says Bona as she walks out of the room. \"I'll just leave you to take care of the jackal girl. I actually came by since there was a bounty head in the area. See you later, Fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona walks out the door just as Cree lets out a snarl. \"Let it go,\" says Fate. \"The important thing is that Aurelia is still alive.\" Cree looks at Aurelia and is deeply worried. But then she notices you and then her eyes pop out. \"You!\" she yells. You scream but Cree runs in front of you and lets out a growl. \"I'll bet that you're just as much responsible for this. Fate raises a brow as she sees Cree zeroing in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two know each other?\" \"Know him?!\" yells Cree. \"That's Wade!\" You gasp because it seems the cat's out of the bag. \"Wade?\" asks Fate. \"But he's locked up.\" \"Locked up?! Fate, you idiot, he's standing right here.\" \"No,\" says Fate. \"That's David Xanatos.\" Cree just looks in disbelief. \"David Xanatos?\" she asks. Fate just crosses her arms. \"I'll admit, Aurelia chased him into the guardroom. That's why she got shot. But don't you think that with your wife in mortal peril, you wouldn't be trying to make an excuse to eat a human.\" Cree gives a growl as Fate leaves the room to wait for the ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate leaves, Cree grabs you and squeezes your body. \"You little bastard,\" says Cree. \"You nearly got my Aurelia killed.\" \"Lighten up you dumb cretin! It's your bitch's fault for running after me.\" Cree certainly didn't like that bitch comment and digs her claws into your side. \"Listen here, Wade,\" says Cree. \"You're going to go into that wound and take out the bullet because if you don't, I'll tell Destiny about your little escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. What a revolting development that this turned out to be. Cree places you to the wound and you shiver in place. You almost decide not to go in, but you hear Cree growling and it looks like you don't have any choice in the matter. You crawl into the wound and react in disgust as you crawl through the blood stream. \"Gross, gross, gross, gross.\" You groan as you move through jackal blood.\" You soon reach the bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem is that the bullet is the size of a truck and you have to get behind it and push, all while Cree is holding Aurelia's hand. This just plain sucked. You were now forced to go inside the wound of a giant unconscious werejackal all to extract an oversized bullet. It takes a lot of effort but eventually, you manage to push the bullet out and then you gag before you slip and fall all the way back down deep into the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're looking around in disgust, you hear the sound of Fate coming with at least three monster paramedics. \"There she is,\" said Fate. \"That's her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you get yourself into these messes?</span></div></div>",

Three of Fate's coworkers stayed after hours after all. Tara the Two-Faced vampiress, Harley the wereboar biker and Emma the polar werebear. You let out a yell to get their attention. Emma squints slightly as she spots you. \"Tim?\" asks Fate. \"I thought Mazee took you home already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma,\" says Harley. \"Get your ojos checked. That's the human that Fate was carrying around.\" Tara just gives a hiss your way. \"Good,\" she says. \"I need a snack.\" \"Fate's in trouble!\" you yell. \"Bona Fete is in the guard room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BONA FETE!\" all three of them yelled at once. \"Aye carumba!\" yelled Harley. \"That gargoyle is loca!\" Tara hold her head. \"Why isn't SHE in Under Gloom.\" \"We'll worry about that later,\" says Harley. \"Andale!\" Harley picks you up and places you on her shoulder before running on all fours as Tara and Emma follow her. You hold on tight to the wereboar woman's fur and start to gag. Harley smells absolutely horrible. You doubt she's taken a shower in the last ten years. Then again, she's a pig so the smell shouldn't be a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bona Fete is nightmare incarnate,\" said Emma. \"I heard that she killed a hydra for armed robbery and ate its tongues in shish kebob.\" \"She's Fate's half-sister right?\" asked Tara. \"Si,\" said Harley. \"From her no good papa that left mama Destiny holding el huevo.\" Emma let out a growl. \"Congratulations,\" she said. \"Now the womanizer has the daughter he deserves. I wouldn't be surprised if the little horror hunted down and turned the bastard into a fountain of blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the three of them reach the guard room, Bona has Fate in a headlock and Fate is biting on Bona's arm. \"Get your teeth off me you purple fatty!\" \"You're the one who started the fight you sick bitch!\" yells Fate as she tries to break free of her half-sister's grip.\" Harley then lets out a snort and loud oink as she tackles Bona and knocks her off of Fate. This knocks you onto the floor with a grunt before Emma lets out a growl and charges forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma tries to grab Bona but due to her bad eyesight, she grabs Fate by mistake and pins her to the wall. Bona gets up and Tara hisses as she flies into the air and kicks the gargoyle to the side. \"Emma!\" yells Fate. \"Get off of me! It's me, Fate!\" Emma gets off of Fate as Fate gives a glare. \"Wear your glasses you silly old bear. That's what the doctor told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona turns her head and faces Tara before gagging at the sight of her half-burned off face. \"Ugh,\" she says. \"What happened to you? It looks like a Midgard serpent ate your face. Tara hisses and bites Bona in her wrist to make her bleed as Bona yells. However, Bona counters Tara by holding a gun and spraying water into her eyes. Tara screamed and held her eyes. \"My eyes!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you say. \"Must've been holy water.\" Bona scoffed. \"You're not the first vampire to try and sink their teeth into me,\" she says as she turns around and reveals a tattoo of a dying vampire on her back between her wings. As Tara is in pain, Harley jumps up and lands butt first in Bona's face. But then Bona grabs Harley's curly tail with her teeth and then jerks her head to slam the boar giantess into the wall. Harley oinks loudly and then Emma puts Bona in a literal bear hug and drives her claws into the gargoyle's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bona slaps Emma to the side with her wings and then whacks her in the face with her boobs to knock Emma on top of Harley. \"Try that again,\" said Bona. \"And I'll tear you up into a million pieces of ugly bear and then sew them back together to make a rug.\" Then Bona sees you trying to walk away and takes out her gun as you gasp. \"Don't think that I forgot about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as Bona shoots at you and nearly blows you to pieces with a bullet. \"Dance bugger dance!\" yells Bona as she fires too more times and you have to run down the hall as the giggling giantess follows after you. \"Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!\" you yell as you dodge gunfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're screaming in the hallway, Fate realizes you're in trouble. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said. \"Bona is going to kill David Xanatos.\" Harley oinks in confusion. \"How is that a <i>bad</i> thing, chic?\" Emma let out a grunt. \"I'd hate to be a human right now. Fate, where are you going?\" \"She's my sister. Maybe I could reason with her.\" \"Bona Fete is madness,\" says Tara. \"You can't reason with madness. You lure it in the back of your truck and shoot it! Sometimes I can't believe the two of you are even related!\" \"But she's right,\" said Emma. \"Come on!\" As the girls rush off, Tara lets out a grunt. \"I hate humans,\" she said. \"Why am I doing this? And for Xanatos of all people? I should have my head examined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona keeps shooting at you and even breaks a few windows. \"Haven't you heard of overkill?!\" you yell. \"No,\" said Bona with a slasher smile. \"But it sounds like fun.\" It isn't long before Bona has you cornered and you scream. You have your back to the wall as the gargoyle stomps forward and has a smile on her face that spells out death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you,\" you say trying to intimidate Bona. \"You don't scare me. I'm David Xanatos.\" Unfortunately, Bona is anything but intimidated. \"Ooh,\" she says. \"David Xanatos? That's gonna look good on my resume.\" Bona lowers your gun and you're now scared for your life as she points it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a miracle could save you now.</span></div></div>",

You immediately make a run for it as Fate tries to hold down her half-sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Bona bites Fate's finger and makes Fate groan in pain before Bona steals Fate's taser and uses it to stun Fate. \"Protecting Xanatos?\" asks Bona. \"You oughta have your head examined, sis. Oh well, time to kill the human.\" Bona fires at you several times and manages to shatter the windows as you're screaming to get away.  \"What is wrong with that woman!?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona runs after you again and then she takes out what looks like a grenade and throws it in your direction as you hide under a cubicle. The grenade goes off and blows the cubicle to bits. You're sent screaming into the air as Bona flies up and then snatches you up in her claws as you grunt. The gargoyle giantess squeezes you tight and then smiles viciously as she holds the barrel of her gun to your head. You're now legitimately afraid for your life and bite your fingers as Bona swings the barrel on her gun. \"Any last words, Mr. Xanatos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\" You say weakly. That's when Bona stops and smirks. \"Good idea.\" Bona puts her gun away and then she takes out a cordless drill that she turns on. You let out a scream because this was obviously going to be way worse than being shot to death. You even begin to cry because it looks like Bona would kill you. You couldn't believe this, you broke out of Under Gloom just so some psychotic gargoyle bitch could kill you in the most vicious way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and wait to be drilled to death, but suddenly there is a loud THUMP noise and Bona drops the drill to the side as she collapses to the ground still holding onto you. It looks as though something or someone knocked Bona to the ground. \"You damn bounty hunter,\" says a familiar voice. \"What the hell are you doing here?!\" You gasp because you recognize that voice and don't like the person it's attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Destiny of all people looking down at Bona and you begin to sweat and even try to grab some of Bona's hair to hide yourself from your blue nemesis. If Destiny saw you out of Under Gloom, you were in big trouble. \"Geez!\" yells Bona. \"Don't have a minotaur, Demo...\" Destiny then stomps on Bona's back before she could finish her sentence and causes Bona pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Causing all this trouble in my daughter's workplace,\" says Destiny. \"I ought to lock you up. I could see the gunshots from the clock tower. Half-sister of hers or not, if you've harmed her in any way, I swear....\" Suddenly Destiny spots you hiding behind Bona's hair and gets curious. She then lifts Bona's hair up and realizes what's going on. She snatches you up and gives a glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade!\" she yells. \"I'm gonna...\" Before Destiny can harm you, Fate walks in. \"Mom?\" she asks. \"What are you doing here?\" Destiny turns and faces her daughter. \"Fate,\" she says. \"Thank goodness I'm alright.\" \"You can thank him for that,\" says Fate as she points to you. \"He got Emma and Harley to help me when Bona went berserk.\" Destiny was actually surprised upon hearing that and then stares at you. You lower your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fate,\" says Destiny. \"This is Wade.\" Fate looks in disbelief. \"Wade? Mom, you've been working so hard that you have Wade on the brain. He told me his name was David Xanatos.\" Fate is shocked to hear that and you can briefly see a flash of extreme anger on her face before she returns to her surprised expression. It seems that Destiny couldn't believe that you of all people would save her daughter from that psychotic bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you get yourself into these messes?</span></div></div>",

Even YOU had to admit it sounded like a joke, and you'd just done it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do we do with the trigger-happy demented bitch?\" you ask once you three all calm down, looking at Bona Fete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock, Destiny actually nods in agreement with your opinion of her bastard child, \"I've got a Cell in the Dark Side of Under Gloom that she's gonna go in...should've crammed her into it a long time ago, now that I think about it.\" she grunts, then smirks \"maybe I'll give her Wade as a cellmate...those two'll be a match made in Hell, but I'd find it funny to see Bona end up falling for him and forcing him to marry her in prison like that!\" Destiny cackled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale for two obvious reasons at that, 1) the idea that Bona would consider you her type and marry you, and 2) Destiny finding out you'd busted out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Fate snapped, then smacked her mother across the face, \"nobody deserves that! You're starting to loose it with how Wade's been making you crazy! Besides, you're scaring David!\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny looked at you \"Sorry,\" she relented, \"and trust me, I know...the idea that there's somebody that could pass as Bona's type <b>IS</b> frightening.\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Destiny stuffed you into a pocket on her shirt, then she starts bending down, only to stop when Fate got her attention. \"Actually, mom...could you give me David back? I don't want him near Bona.\" the benevolent one of the sisters said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clred\"><u><i><b>\"WHAT?!\"</b></i></u></span></font> Destiny shouted at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...seeing as how he got Emma and Harley to help me when Bona went berserk, can you please just give the idea of a guy being around me the benefit of the doubt, just this once?\" she sighed, sounding tired. Clearly, this \"no guys\" thing was an exhausted topic between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny sighed, then pulled you out of the pocket and dangled you in front of her face, \"All right, Fate. But one thing I want David here to know...you try ANYTHING to my daughter, and you'll wish I would've let Bona finish you off, got it?!\" she snaps at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that stupid!\" you yelp. Sheesh...this angry/protective mom-mode is scarier than any fit you'd ever caused Demona before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny smirked, \"Good then, we understand one another.\", with that you're transferred from one gargoyle to another before she bends down and hauls Bona Fete over her shoulders and drags the psycho out.

Belladonna then grit her teeth nervously. \"Aren't a lot of inmates here in Under Gloom <i>because</i> of Bona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bona was recovering in her jail cell, it was revealed that she wasn't alone in her prison cell. Behind her, there was a female vampire with glowing gold eyes and gray hair worn in a crescent moon shaped mohawk. She spotted Bona and hissed. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I've been waiting for this, you tattooed piece of trash. After you humiliated me and nearly killed me outside of the Terrordale First National Bank.\" The vampiress tried to strangle Bona, but Bona gave a smirk, turned her head and bit her cellmate's thumb right off as she shrieked. Bona spat the digit at Belladonna and Destiny's feet before smiling evilly at the vampire criminal. \"Need I remind you who put a loser like you in here,\" says the bounty hunter. \"While I'm here, I might as well do some damage control so Big Blue doesn't have to spend the whole government budget feeding society's trash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gave a grumble and grabbed herself by the face before she turned to Belladonna. \"Belladonna,\" she said. \"Please sedate that maniac before she kills all the other inmates.\" Belladonna nodded her head and stung Bona to make her fall to the floor in pain. \"Cree!\" yelled Destiny. \"Clover! Get your butts down here! We have a new inmate for solitary confinement!\" While Cree and Clover were dealing with Bona, Destiny was walking down the hallway, growling to herself as Belladonna followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are flustered, Destiny,\" said Belladonna smugly. \"Might I recommend yoga?\" \"I'm not in the mood for snarky poison lionesses, Belladonna,\" warned the blue gargoyle warden. \"Fate is out there with a boy.\" Belladonna let out a laugh. \"Oh boy, I wouldn't want to be him. Didn't you chase away the last boy to try and ask Fate out with a gun? Why aren't you giving this one a hard time?\" Destiny let out a growl. \"Because he saved Fate's life. But I can't help but think that guy was Wade trying another escape. But Wade would never risk his neck to save a monster, especially not a gargoyle and especially not if that gargoyle was my daughter.\" \"Huh,\" said Belladonna.\"What was his name.\" Destiny gave another growl. \"David Xanatos.\" Belladonna looked in confusion. \"Isn't he already married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Destiny could say another word to Belladonna, she looked into your jail cell to see Lockette looking nervously. She tried to look further in and Lockette tried to obscure her sight but Destiny eventually grabbed Lockette and held her down as she inspected the cell. It wasn't long before she blew her top. \"Where's Wade?!\" she yelled. Lockette looked nervously at Destiny as her eyes glowed bright. \"I don't know,\" said Lockette. \"I haven't seen him since last night.\" Destiny roars in anger. \"I knew it. That was Wade back at the Daily Tombstone! That little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Destiny could finish her sentence, her eyes popped and her eye twitched before she let out a muffled scream of pure frustration. \"What's the matter now, Blue Lips?\" asked Belladonna. \"Wade or no Wade,\" said Destiny. \"He still saved my daughter. I... I... I can't even figure out what to do. I can't... I...\" Destiny then slapped herself in the face and grunted. \"Well,\" said Belladonna. \"Think about it this way. Once you're his mother-in-law, you can torment him whenever.\" Destiny legitimately didn't have any idea what to do and Belladonna wasn't helping. She was about to deck Belladonna, but instead punched the wall and let out a groan. \"Belladonna,\" she said. \"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we cut to you and Fate...</span></div></div>",

Lexi shows you her claws as she gives you a smirk. \"So, my little morsel,\" she says. \"What is it going to be, Xanatos.\" Lexi snaps her fangs and smiles evilly at you.\" You don't have time to think about the riddle so you just have to hope for the best. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Your office.\" You smile nervously and cross your fingers, hoping that that is the correct answer. However, you look in fear as Lexi breaks into hysterical laughter and even holds her chest. A laughing sphinx is never a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought Xanatos would be smarter,\" says Lexi with an evil smirk. \"You have answered poorly.\" You gasp and Lexi laughs wickedly as she licks her lips. \"You know what that means don't you?\" You gasp as Lexi lets out a growl and starts to inch closer to you. You couldn\u2019t believe it! You were going to be eaten. Dammit. You broke out of Under Gloom and hitched a ride to an escape by manipulating Destiny\u2019s own daughter, only to wind up being cornered by a giant and hungry sphinx. This was not happening, this was not happening. Lexi even let out a sinister laugh as she closed in on you. \u201cYou know,\u201d says the sphinx. \u201cI don\u2019t get to chomp a human that often so I think I\u2019ll have some fun, Xanatos.\u201d She said that last part mockingly just before she gave a nasty giggle. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a minute\u2019s head start. Good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time running as Lexi wags her tail. You run around the corner as the sphinx is looking at her wrist watch and smirking. \u201cTick tock, tick tock, tick tock. The clock is ticking.\u201d \u201cDamn!\u201d you yell. You run down the hallway into a cubicle area that fortunately for you was empty. You hide behind a cubicle and pant. As you stop to catch your breath, you look and see Lexi\u2019s shadow. The sphinx was coming and because she never stood up, she was closer to the ground than other monsters and could catch you easier. Lexi licked her lips again. \u201cI wonder what Xanatos tastes like,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019ll be spicy. Look out specky, here comes Lexi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you try to slip out. As much as you hated to admit it, you hope that Fate shows up. As much as you hated gargoyles, you had to admit that their drive to protect humans from actual threatening monsters made them tolerable. But then again, this was no ordinary monster you were hiding from. This was Fate\u2019s boss. Lexi nearby is sniffing around for you. \u201cNow,\u201d she says. \u201cShould I eat him here or take him back home to cook him. I haven\u2019t had grilled human for ages.\u201d You had to get out of here so you look back and run around the cubicle to the next as you maneuver through the office maze. Unfortunately for you, news buildings were designed like mazes to confuse criminals that came in so you don\u2019t know whether or not you\u2019re safe. You soon find yourself drawn in a corner and your only escape has a shadow approaching. It could\u2019ve been Lexi but what choice did you have. You ran out and sure enough the monster in front of you was....</span></div></div>",

Once Fate leaves the kitchen you begin to shake and hope that she comes back soon. You do not want to be stuck here with Destiny. She hates you enough. If she caught you in her daughter's house she'd be furious. Heck, if she found out you saw Fate's panties, she'd put you through a shredder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do was lay low in the kitchen. Suddenly you hear stomping. \"That was quick.\" You say as a shadow appears in the room. The good news was that it was a gargoyle's shadow but unfortunately it was too skinny to be Fate and you quickly realize who it is and gasp. As Destiny walks into the kitchen, you quickly hide behind a swimming pool sized sugar bowl and she passes by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stops in her tracks and you take a deep breath as her ears switch and she turns her head. You begin to sweat as Destiny gives a skeptical look, but fortunately she turns her head back. \"I could've sworn I heard something,\" the blue gargoyle giantess says to herself. \"I highly doubt Fate has a rodent problem, so maybe it's... easy Destiny, get a hold of yourself. That Wade has halfway driven you off the edge.\" \"Good.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny groans and holds her head. From the looks of it, she had a migraine. Since you came to Under Gloom, she's been getting enough of them to put Rita Repulsa to shame. The next thing you know, Destiny is brewing herself a cup of coffee and while the percolator is running, she rummages through one of Fate's cabinets and takes out a bottle of what looks like aspirin. \"WTF?\" you ask to yourself. \"Who keeps <i>aspirin tablets</i> with their food?\" That was practically asking for trouble but given how stressed out Destiny usual is, Fate probably prefers to keep some headache pills handy in every room. You lean back to try and get a better look at Destiny so as to avoid being seen but then you slip and grunt as you fall into the sugar bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Destiny hasn't seen you yet and once the coffee is ready, she puts two aspirin tablets inside and sniffs it. \"Could use a little sugar.\" The giantess says to herself. SUGAR! Oh, that was bad. Without even looking, Destiny reaches into the sugar bowl, forcing you to try and get out of there just before...</span></div></div>",

Since you had neither, you never got a visitor. But this gave you an idea. You could hitch a ride on one of the visitors and get out that way. Smiling, you head to the visitors center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visitors center was surprisingly empty. Usually is was packed. You hid behind a trash can and looked. You could only see three visitors: a vampire talking to Darcy, another kitsune talking to Elaine, and a blue succubus sitting in front of an empty booth. Deciding the first two would get you spotted, you went for the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to her and start climbing up her shoe, which thankfully had an untied lace. You were almost to her ankle when you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you'd show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the succubus staring at you. You gulp. You're up s**t creek without a paddle now. She bent down (not easy, since from the looks of it, she had Lactose Overload Syndrome) and picked you up. She set you down on the counter and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caught me. Big whoop. So what, you gonna turn me in?\" You ask, angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not just yet. I actually came to visit you.\" The succubus replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were honestly surprised. \"Really? I never get a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here because I have a deal for you. I can get you out of this prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped. She could do that? You'd be free? \"How?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I'm a succubus. So I can use magic to give you whatever you want. But I'll want something in return, at a later date. Just say the words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely finished her sentence before you spoke. \"I want Destiny to let me out of this prison. I want her to decide I don't belong here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus smiled and snapped her fingers. \"Done. In a few moments, you'll be a free man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost jump for joy. Finally, you'd be out of this hell hole. You were so happy you didn't care that the succubus had told Cree, who was nearby, you had escaped. Cree walked over and picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so happy?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer you both heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, Cree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both turn and see Destiny in the door.

You mentally vomit and glare at that succubus as she gives a laugh and then teleports away. You're too incensed and horrified to even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Belladonna is walking by and then gives a smirk.

By the way, I'm punching out early today. You're in charge for the rest of the workday.\" Destiny hums to herself and leaves Belladonna utterly confused.

The manticore dropped the bottle on the ground and held her head. \"I must be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny at that time reaches the outside of the prison. You rub your hands. This was it, you were finally out of Under Gloom. Now, you just needed to find a way to get away from Destiny. But before you do so, Destiny squeezes you and giggles as she pulls you up to her smiling face. \"Hold on tight, Wadey.\" Destiny then slams you between her massive breasts and you grunt as she opens her wings and jumps off the ledge to fly through the air. You give a moan. \"I think I liked it better when she hated me.\" You mumble to yourself. You try to wiggle your way out of Destiny's breasts but it's futile and you're in too deep. It was just as well. You look up to see that you were hundreds of miles above Fearfield and the fall from that height would kill you. But is it any worse than having to deal with a lovesick Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny squeezes her breasts and lets out a giggle before she swoops down and lands in front of her house. Your jaw drops in horror. \"Oh ****.\" You mutter. Then you gasp because you hope that Destiny didn't hear you and get any ideas. \"Here we are,\" says Destiny in a singsong voice. \"We are going to have SOOO much fun.\" You grunt and try to break free but Destiny squeezes you out into her hand and takes you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Destiny lays you on a table, she uses her tail to shut and lock the door before she walks around humming happily. You look around for any sign of a way out but it's completely useless and then to make matters worse, Destiny pulls down the shades on the windows and laughs to herself. You really wish that you never met that succubus. \"Wait right here, Wadey.\" says Destiny as she shakes her rear in front of you. \"I need to slip into something more comfortable.\" Destiny blows you a kiss before retreating upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny walks upstairs and you begin to dread what's coming. \"Damn that succubus,\" you say. \"If I ever see her again...!\" Before you can say anything else, things get much worse as....</span></div></div>",

Now, you have to find a way to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWade Wilson- The main character. You. You\u2019re a human who was exiled to Fearfield and thrown in prison for setting fire to the skirt of a harmless monster visiting the human world. You hate monsters and will do anything to get out of this nightmare of a jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockette Ness- Your cellmate, a 500ft purple skinned Loch Ness Monster girl. Resembles a humanoid plesiosaur with a long neck, long indigo hair and fins for ears. She was imprisoned for aiding and abetting a smuggler. Unlike the other monsters, she\u2019s friendly towards humans and would rather pay her debt to society than try to escape. Tries to warn you not to escape, but you never listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Prison Staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarden Destiny- Your worst enemy and the biggest monster in the entire prison. A cyan skinned gargoyle with long pink reddish hair, four horns on her forehead and a generous hourglass figure. Destiny takes her job as warden very serious. Nobody has escaped Under Gloom since she took over and she intends to keep it that way. She despises you because you have tried to escape more times than anyone else in the prison\u2019s history and her patience with you is wearing thin. However, this attitude isn\u2019t out of prejudice against humans. Destiny bares a slight resemblance to Demona and hates it whenever someone points out how she looks like a cartoon character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelladonna Solanaceae- The vice warden. A 700ft yellow skinned manticore with a scorpion\u2019s tail and three sets of sharp fangs. Belladonna is Destiny\u2019s second in command. However, she is also after Destiny\u2019s job as warden, basically the Starscream to Destiny\u2019s Megatron. Destiny is aware of this ambition and the two of them don\u2019t get along well. Belladonna might just let you go to get Destiny in trouble, if she doesn\u2019t decide to eat you first. Belladonna's tail venom is lethal enough to kill a dinosaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris Potter- A giant gryphon who always wears a leather mask. Doris is the prison's executioner and whenever she appears, it means that a prisoner is going to be put to death. Destiny only calls on her when one the worst criminals in the prison is due to die, but if you keep misbehaving in Under Gloom, you might see her soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris Carumba- Iris is a red cyclops with a blue tattoo over her eye and long red hair. She's a special type of guard Destiny uses as a parole officer to check on prisons lucky enough to be let out of Under Gloom. However, Iris is as hard as parole officers come and likes to keep a close eye on the released prisoners under her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor (real name unknown) - An 800ft tall living mannequin who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Her skin is red plastic. She has long, blond Nylon hair and green glass eyes. She has a slim figure with slight curves. She has doll like joints, which gives her mechanical, stiff movements. She wears a lab coat and glasses. Very little is know about Under Gloom's doctor. Even her real name is unknown, so everyone simply calls her The Doctor. She is very good at her job, but she is also know to be emotionless. This makes it very hard to get to know her. She speaks in a British accent, so people often tease her by making Doctor Who references. She tends to ignore them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guards- Destiny\u2019s prison guards are mostly sadistic thugs that brutalize the prisons. While Destiny has forbidden them from killing the monster inmates, humans are fair game. There\u2019s a rumor that most of the humans that get sent to Under Gloom are eaten by the bloodthirsty guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree Macbeth-Nile- A titanic 800ft tall werehyena, obese in body shape. She prefers not to wear clothes, but she can get away with it because of her fur covering her body. Cree is the most sadistic of the guards and a borderline sociopath who takes great enjoyment in the pain of the inmates. Unfortunately for you, humans are her favorite food and she always has her tongue sticking out. She has told you several times she looks forward to swallowing you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover Marathon- A giant grootslang, a type of reptilian monster resembling a green scaly elephant with the hood of a cobra and a snake like trunk that acts as a second mouth. While not as hyperactive as Cree, she is still just as bloodthirsty as she is when it comes to humans. Clover has somewhat of a rivalry with Cree and the two have challenged each other to see which one eats you first. Resembles a monster version of Clover from Totally Spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone Sarutobi- A giant Nue girl. Basically a baboon with tiger arms and legs and a serpent\u2019s tail. Simone is mute and only communicates through monkey like noises. However, she rarely eats humans and is far less sadistic than the other guards. She\u2019s more likely to report you to Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy Coldwind- A giant hourglass shaped roc harpy with an owl like beak and bright blue feathers. Icy is the newest addition to the guards and is somewhat clumsy and inept. But just because she\u2019s young, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s harmless. She enjoys the taste of humans just as much as Cree and Clover. She can also create ice and snow by flapping her wings. Ironically, she\u2019s cousins with Elle from Monster Arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria Spectra Tazel - An 980ft tall Japanese Onryo who is an O.C. of the 12th Doctor. Aria has long, black hair that covers her face and pitch white skin with black eyes. She has an athletic build, but due to her macromastia, she has ZZ-Cup breasts. She wears the usual Under Gloom guard uniform tailored to fit her chest. When she was alive, Aria was a serious cop. After dying in a firefight, Aria came back as an Onryo to take revenge against the gang, which she got, but she then learned that she was permanently Earthbound. She moved to America and got a job at Under Gloom as a guard. She is cold and serious, never letting her guard down for a moment. She prides herself on never letting ANYONE escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inmates<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel Wrench- A 300ft yellow-green skinned gremlin girl. She was arrested up for chop-shopping. She\u2019s good with tools and is trying to build a machine to help escape from Under Gloom but none of her inventions so far have been successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe Ladin- An egyptian looking Cheshire cat giantess. She was a jewel thief who was eventually caught and sent to Under Gloom. She was hourglass shaped when she came in, but she\u2019s been working out in the prison gym and has seriously buffed up, while still retaining her feminine looks. Despite your dislike for monsters, Bebe is very attracted to you and you might be able to use her. Destiny had her fitted with a collar to cancel out her invisibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla Toben- A pudgy palish white skinned orc sorceress. Priscilla is skilled in potions but was imprisoned for practicing medicine without a permit. Priscilla is still trying to work on a spell or potion to escape, but hasn\u2019t had luck due to limited materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy Fenton- An odd giantess boggart. She resembles a green gaseous ghost with plants and grass growing out of her back. It\u2019s unknown what she\u2019s in for because she never speaks to anyone and just stares off into space. The walls of the prison are specially designed to prevent creatures like her from ghosting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia Ojo- A titanic Argus, a monster with one hundred eyes all over her body and silvery skin. Cornelia was arrested for illegal gambling. You\u2019re the only one who knows it but Cornelia is Destiny's personal prison snitch and your last three escape attempts failed because she ratted you out to Destiny. Needless to say, she\u2019s one of your least favorite monsters in the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine Sarah Cotonza- A 750ft kitsune who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Elaine has long red hair in a ponytail and red eyes. She has an houglass figure, though her incredibly large breasts are augmented. She has 8 fox tails, fox ears, and sharp teeth. She wears the usual Under Gloom inmate outfit. Destiny put a collar on her to cancel her shape shifting, though she can still change her voice.  Elaine is a shape shifter who was arrested for Identity Theft when she tried to steal Destiny's identity. She had managed to take millions of dollars before she was caught and bought many things, including incredibly large breast implants. In Under Gloom, she's a fairly sociable prisoner, trying to get along with other inmates. She has a thing for muscular women, so she has a crush on Bebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice Carver - A 844ft succubus who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Janice's face is split in two due to her accident. The right half has snow white skin, long, straight black hair, and a green eye. The left half is horrifically burned, with short white hair and a milky white eye, both ruined in the accident. She has Lactose Overload Syndrome, her breasts being the size of beanbag chairs. The rest of her is slightly chubby. Her left arm is as badly burned as the left half of her face. Her clothing reflects this, being half sexy, half modest. Janice is a very broken woman. Thanks to her accident (which no one is sure of the details) she has become angry and violent at the world, thinking it as vile and cruel. Due to her now resemblance to him, people have nicknamed her Lady Two-Face. She also shares a quirk with him, though she had it before her accident: she can't make a choice without a flip of her silver dollar coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dark Side Inmates- There is a hallway on your level called the Dark Side. The Dark Side is where they keep monsters who committed crimes so heinous, they\u2019re locked up for life. No human that has crossed into the Dark Side has ever come out alive. You only know of five inmates here but most of the monsters in this area are carnivores that wouldn\u2019t think twice about eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah Dark- A giant centaur with the lower body of a quagga (an extinct relative of the zebra). She was imprisoned for rape. The woman is so raunchy that she doesn't even care which species she attacks. You don\u2019t know what she thinks about humans but being in her cell would be a horrible mistake. But you do know she only grabs male humans and you've yet to see one of them escape her clutches. Though you do hear a lot of screaming coming from her cell on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula Minor- A titanic grizzly werebear with a hatred against fairies and similar monsters. Ursula led an anti-fairy riot against the governor that failed. She\u2019s easily recognizable by her missing left eye. Like most monsters in Dark Side, she is predatory towards humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone Howler- Alias, the white werewolf. A curvaceous albino werewolf girl imprisoned for cannibalizing other monsters. She\u2019s locked up in her cell 24/7 because otherwise she\u2019d attack the other inmates and has even gone after the guards. Persephone considers herself a gourmet among cannibals and was known for cooking her victims. However, she won\u2019t pass off a yummy human. Persephone is a cousin of Lupa from Monster Arms and April from Monster Shores that neither of them like to talk about. Because of her vicious appetite, Destiny put a muzzle on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArethusa Dragneel- Alias, the doomsday dragon. A European dragoness with orange brown scales, ram like horns and long blonde hair. Arethusa was imprisoned for manufacturing deadly bombs that were used for murder. She\u2019s very reclusive and will breathe fire on anyone dumb enough to come close to her cell, even the guards. (Note: she has a dragon's face, not a humans. I'm getting sick of those models of dragons)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri L- A titanic obese gorgon with blue pythons for hair. Yuri is the most dangerous monster in the entire prison. A deranged serial killer who abused her gorgon eyes to kill over one hundred monsters so she could mutilate their stone corpses for her own twisted amusement. Upon her imprisonment Yuri was fitted with a visor to negate her petrifying gaze. As sadistic as she is towards monsters, Yuri has been known to grab any human unfortunate enough to get close to her cell with her snake hair to either eat or torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya- An addition by UltraGTS. Sakuya is a black spider drider resembling a pale skinned child despite being an adult. Sakuya committed every crime known to monster and human alike, but instead of giving her the death penalty, she was attached to a machine that puts her in an endless coma so she'd live out the rest of her natural life dreaming. However, the device can attach to humans to put them in her dreamworld and dying in the dream means dying in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline Liza- A red haired hourglass shaped fairy. Jacqueline is the governor of the tri-city area of Horrorville, Terrordale and Fearfield and Destiny's boss. Sometimes she visits the prison to inspect it. You're not sure what she thinks of humans or if she knows a human is in the prison. She's deathly afraid of Ursula because the werebear made an attempt on her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona Fete- An addition by Anonymous One. A 950ft tall muscular and gray skinned gargoyle bounty hunter who filled most of the cells in Under Gloom with captured criminals. She mainly wears a chest plate with a Punisher style skull on it with kevlar pants and combat boots and has black hair with tattoos covering her arm for everyone she's ever killed. Bona Fete is a loose cannon bounty hunter who will kill any target no matter what their crime was. Destiny doesn't like her much both because Destiny isn't fond of bounty hunters and because Bona is the daughter of the man who impregnated Destiny and left her. Regardless, if you do manage to escape, Bona might be sent to bring you back to Under Gloom Dead or Alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSekushi Kami (nickname Shi) - An 850ft Hari-onago who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Shi's most notable feature is her immensely long, black hair, which ends in barbs. Her hair seems to be longer then she is tall. She has grey eyes and grey skin. She has above-average breasts, a slim waist, and a massive butt. She usually wears skimpy clothing to show off her curves. Shi can be described as a massive flirt. She loves women with a passion. Even if they are married, she'll \"put the moves on them\", flirting and showing off her body as much as possible. Her favorite targets are ghosts and women with ludicrously large chests, though anyone is fair game. If it's somebody who meets both of the above, she'll drop everything and focus only on them. However, she won't go after men or people under 20. She can control her hair, using them like extra hands. Lately, she's been going after Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to end the story too soon<br>\r\nAll monsters are giantesses. Normally 300ft is the minimum but many monsters in the prison exceed that height.<br>\r\nNo toilet stuff<br>\r\nFantasy monsters only. No mechas or mutates.<br>\r\nNo underage monsters. It\u2019s a prison for crying out loud.<br>\r\nThis is a woman\u2019s prison so male monsters are to be kept to a minimum. Male humans in the prison are fine.<br>\r\nNothing heavily sexual. Keep it PG13<br>\r\nPlease no Male Preds or any interaction with Male Giant privates! I thought I didn't have to say it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease also be willing to read and add to my other two monster giantess stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Shores<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Arms<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial thanks goes to Spiral-And-Twist, Anonymous One, Ultimate Neo, Infinitebull and CrimsonFreak<br>\r\n</td>",
