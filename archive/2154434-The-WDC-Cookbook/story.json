(Cilantro is nice, if you like a little spice.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Optionally, if you really enjoy a nice spicy kick, add some diced jalape\u00f1o as well, when adding salsa.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelt butter over medium to medium high heat in a medium sized skillet. While butter is melting, place a flour tortilla on a microwave safe plate (x2). Split a slice of cheese in half and lay one half in the center of the tortilla beginning at one edge, then place the other half in center as well, but going further into the tortilla. (leave about 2\" of opposite edge bare.) Repeat with second tortilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPour beaten eggs into melted butter in pre-heated skillet. Add salt, pepper, seasoning of choice then stir frequently to prevent over cooking. When eggs are almost set, add the salsa and sausage or crumbled cooked bacon and fold in. Once cooked and set, remove from heat and equally divide between the two tortilla's, placing egg mixture over the center on top of the cheese. Take remaining two cheese slices, break in half, and lay over egg filling on each tortilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicrowave each tortilla separately for 30 seconds or until cheese begins to melt and tortilla is soft and pliable. Wrap in the customary burrito style. Lay seam side down and allow to cool for 30 to 60 seconds. Enjoy! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This usually takes about 30 minutes, so starting this early is a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut your chicken in a relatively deep skillet (because we're going to be putting sauce in there too), and turn the heat up to about halfway. Sprinkle a pinch each of salt, pepper, and garlic powder and cover with the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the chicken is cooking, take the remaining ingredients (brown sugar, hot sauce, honey, and teriyaki) and mix it all together in a bowl. Set aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurn your chicken over and sprinkle again with spices. Cut the chicken open, to ensure it is cooked through, and then cut into smaller, bite-sized pieces. If some of the pieces are still looking a little pink, put the lid back on a let it cook a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're satisfied that your chicken is thoroughly cooked (white on the inside, not pink), dump your sauce mixture into the pan and mix it all around so that all of the chicken gets covered in some of the sauce. Bring the heat down to low for about 5-10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken and stir occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your rice is done, serve it up in a bowl and spoon the chicken onto the rice.

Even vegetable scraps that would normally be thrown away are saved for making homemade soup base. During the Great Depression and before soup bases could easily be bought at the local supermarket, this is how soup bases were made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the month, all vegetables cooked, save all of the peals and ends that you would normally throw away. Always make sure they are washed well before peeling. I keep a plastic baggy in the freezer for which I keep adding veggie scraps throughout the month. By the time I make my soup, I have a variety of vegetable scraps that includes tomatoes, onions, squash, asparagus, celery, bell pepper, Brussels sprouts, and carets. All vegetables are good to use, except for potatoes. Your broth will be much different than mine, but that is alright. Just make sure that you have a variety of vegetables in your base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\">Homemade soup base</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoil at least four cups of vegetable scraps in twelve cups of water and a tablespoon of salt. Once you bring it to a boil, simmer it on med/low heat for a few hours. When vegetable parts are mushy and the broth is not clear, strain the liquid using a colander into another pot. Toss the soggy vegetables into the trash and only use the broth for your soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor beef soup, when you boil the vegetables, toss a raw beef bone into the pot of veggie scraps while boiling. For chicken soup, toss raw chicken bones into the pot of veggie scraps when you boil them. This base is also great for making a vegetarian soup. So, if it is meatless, do not use any meat bones in the base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also make this base ahead of time and freeze it for later use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes a great base for any soup, but below is a variation of one of my soups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\"><br>\r\nBeef refrigerator soup </span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n12 oz can of stewed tomatoes <br>\r\nTablespoon of basil (fresh is better if you have it available)<br>\r\nteaspoon of salt (little more if you think it needs it)<br>\r\nPinch of thyme<br>\r\ntwo large cloves of garlic, minced<br>\r\n1/4 cup of diced white onions<br>\r\n1/4 cup of chopped celery<br>\r\n4 pealed and sliced carets<br>\r\nhandful of fresh green beans snapped and cut in half<br>\r\n1 cup of shredded cabbage<br>\r\n10 Small organic purple and red new potatoes cut in half (if you can't afford organic, just use regular new potatoes)<br>\r\none lb. raw beef sliced into half inch pieces (any except for ground beef) <br>\r\nHomemade beef and vegetable base<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd all ingredients in a single pot. Boil and simmer for approximately an hour. After tasting if you feel it needs more salt add it. Pepper to taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this soup you can experiment with other vegetables if you like. Just make sure that you always use onion and celery. The other vegetables can be changed. You can also supplement the potatoes with pasta, but if you do, make sure to only throw in a few handfuls of raw pasta. Yes, raw, do not throw it in precooked. Well, you can, but it tastes better when the pasta boils in your soup broth, because the noodles absorb the flavors in the soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Allow the machine to do its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. When the timer beeps, allow the chicken to remain for 5 additional minutes during the natural release process. Then do a quick release of the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Remove the drumsticks and place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Hit the saute button so the sauce boils and starts reducing.  Preheat your broiler. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n8. Broil the chicken drumsticks for 2 minutes on each side (or more if you'd like). Meanwhile, leave the sauce on the instant pot so it keeps reducing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Remove the chicken from the oven and place the drumsticks on a platter. Pour sauce over and serve. This is great with white rice, brown rice, or cauli rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
