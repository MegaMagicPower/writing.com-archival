As Derek\u2019s only real job was patrolling and fighting off the usual forces of evil sent to destroy Beacon Hills, it had left him with very little to do. Exercising all day had become increasingly redundant, so his workouts were now limited to maybe an hour. If he felt like it. The pack had been slowly talking him into adding more and more furniture \u2013 he now had an almost fully-furnished house, complete with the biggest flat-screen TV they could find. It seemed like an unnecessary expense at the time, but now that Stiles and Scott had gotten him into terrible reality television shows, Derek appreciated the big screen. So much easier to get hooked into the drama that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Derek was currently on the seventh season of his <i>Survivor</i> binge, when his stomach started growling. Getting to his feet, he headed into the kitchen for something to eat. Unsurprisingly, the fridge and cabinets were empty, save for a few boxes of a cereal, a couple of apples, and some gelatinous milk. He felt no motivation to head to the grocery store, or even to call in a delivery order, so he sat back down on the couch, turning the TV back on and promising he would go out and get something for dinner instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he settled down on the couch, an ad popped on the screen. A group of little gray blobs with smiling faces and wide eyes were clustered together, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You don\u2019t look busy, so we felt it wouldn\u2019t be rude<br>\r\nif we took a moment to intrude.<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve noticed you have nothing to eat,<br>\r\nSo let the Munchies perform an amazing feat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The screen shut off right after and refused to turn back on. Irritated, Derek got to his feet. Might as well go get food and hope the screen came back on. On his way to the door, he stopped. He was suddenly salivating with the sudden overwhelming aromas of food wafting out of his kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the scent, he found his entire kitchen bursting with various kinds of food. A pan of lasagna and loaves of garlic bread were cooking in the oven. The fridge was loaded with different cheeses, huge portions of ready-to-be-heated casseroles or macaroni, along with bakery boxes of cakes, pies, cheesecakes, and dessert bars. Even the cabinets had been refilled with chips and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little gray blobs were sitting on his kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek growled, backing up instinctively and grabbing for his phone, halfway through sending a text out to the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Awww why are you in such a bad mood?<br>\r\nLooks like someone needs some food!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Derek lied. He flushed when his belly started grumbling loudly again, followed by a sharp pang of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We promise that the munchies mean no harm,<br>\r\nreally there is no cause for alarm.<br>\r\nWe saw you were out of food, our friend,<br>\r\nso we\u2019ve made you a feast that will never end!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Derek put the phone down on the counter, eying the meal cooking in the oven. A few bites wouldn't hurt, he didn't smell wolfsbane or any other poison, and he could easily squash these \"Munchies\" with a fist.  Really, nothing felt threatening about these little creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better leave after I eat,\u201d he told them. He pulled the lasagna and bread out of the oven and took a seat at the table as the Munchies watched him gleefully, giggling to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of them jumped off the counter and then scurried back, presenting Derek with a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don\u2019t worry about manners, why get a plate,<br>\r\nnot eating it all would be mistake!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek took a hesitant bite. The sauce was rich and flavorful, the pasta smothered with layers and layers of cheeses. It tasted even better than it smelled. He started taking greedy forkfuls, setting a brisk pace, his mouth constantly chewing. Occasionally he would pause and tear off a chunk of bread, shoving it in his mouth before turning back to the pan of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since we want to see your weight increase,<br>\r\nwe\u2019re throwing you a gigantic feast!<br>\r\nFood is always better with fat and grease!<br>\r\nHow else will we make you grow so obese?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir words made Derek pause and look up. He had eaten more than he thought - a loaf of garlic bread and over half of the lasagna, but didn\u2019t feel nearly as full as he should have been after such carb heavy food.  He pushed himself back from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m done eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLies!\u201d The Munchies cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What\u2019s the harm in one day to cheat?<br>\r\nYou deserve to have a treat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the fork again and the Munchies cheered. Derek\u2019s mind felt clouded by the overwhelming hunger he felt, but their logic did make sense. He had been working out the last few weeks, one day of indulgence wouldn\u2019t do any harm. These\u2026creatures likely didn\u2019t know he was a werewolf. All this food wouldn\u2019t affect him as much as a human, he could easily burn it off in a few workouts. With renewed gusto, he finished the lasagna and garlic bread. Before he could take a pause from his last bite, the Munchies had brought Derek over more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d He struggled to his feet. His stomach was rounded, pressing uncomfortably tight against the waistband of his pants. \u201cI need something to drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit! Sit!\u201d The Munchies demanded. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gallon of milk appeared by his side. Derek immediately brought it to his lips, taking a few, long chugs, before he set it back down. He leaned back in his seat, reaching underneath his swollen gut to undo the button of his pants. Despite the huge meal he had just eaten, the hunger pains still hit him. He was desperate for more, all the food spread out in front of him on the table looked luring him in.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We know you can handle so much more,<br>\r\neat until your belly\u2019s sore,<br>\r\nyou can stop when you don't fit through your door!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek reached out for the next dish in front of him, a plate piled high with lemon bars. Once he had finished that he moved on to the bowl of macaroni and cheese. He started eating more greedily as he went, shoveling food into his mouth to try and satisfy his ever-growing hunger, one hand rubbing his bloating stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost track of time and how many dishes he had consumed. It seemed for each one he finished, two more were brought in his place. Finally, his belly was at the point of being painfully full, sitting in his lap, hugely inflated with food. His shirt had risen up, barely stretching over the top of his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. I \u2013 urp \u2013 no more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get to his feet, panting and burping as the weight of his tummy kept him solidly in the chair. Derek shifted into a more comfortable position, deciding he would sit there and digest first before he started moving\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He woke up on the couch, the television still running. Sleepily, Derek reached for the remote and turned it off, before lazily sitting up on the couch. He faintly remembers having the most bizarre dream, only to look up and see the gray blobs from his dream watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Derek made up his mind to:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the hunger gone from his mind, he could suddenly think clearer. Whatever enchantment or curse or spell the Munchies had put on him had worn off. It had left its mark, however. Derek\u2019s abs were completely gone, covered by a sizable potbelly. Even his chest had gotten softer, and his lovehandles were spilling over the waistband of his still unbuttoned jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Derek heaved himself to his feet. He swayed slightly, unused to having weight around his middle. He fumbled for the button of his pants, trying and failing to even get the two sides of them close enough to fasten with his belly spilling in-between.  Giving up, he pulled his shirt to try and cover it. It barely reached the bottom of his belly and was clinging tightly to his new flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe all that bread and pasta and sugary sweets put you in a trance.<br>\r\nAfter eating all that there\u2019s simply no chance<br>\r\nyou\u2019ll ever be able to button those pants.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Derek growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have to admit it was great<br>\r\neating until your cleared the plates!</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nDerek had his claws out and with one swipe, sliced through the group of blobs on his kitchen table. They shrieked and then went silent, oozing together into one big mess that sizzled and seemed to evaporate. Satisfied they were gone for good, Derek looked around for his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Awww come on, take a seat,<br>\r\nsure we can\u2019t tempt you into one more treat?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Munchies were back on the table, still smiling at Derek.  He refused to even look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI ate plenty last night. I\u2019m not eating more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, Derek, you can\u2019t beat us<br>\r\nwhy are you trying to make such a fuss?</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nA group of them brought a chocolate cake over and set it on the table. It was Derek\u2019s weakness. Rich, moist cake, three layers high, covered with chocolate ganache, and so big it obscured the plate it was resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was rumbling. Derek determinedly kept looking for his phone, trying to ignore the cravings for more food. It was no use. The smell of the chocolate was so strong, he may as well have been bathing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOnce slice,\u201d he told them, fangs dropping and eyes flashing. The Munchies looked unperturbed by the threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Derek used his fingers to take a small piece of the cake, planning to only try a little. The small bite was it took. The hunger came back will full force and suddenly he couldn\u2019t get enough of it. He started taking gluttonous handfuls, cramming as much of it in his mouth as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Munchies watched him eat, gleeful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Big, bad Alpha thinks he\u2019s tough?<br>\r\nHe can't fight when he\u2019s stuffed.<br>\r\nAll the food in his belly will be rough<br>\r\nits sure to make him huff and puff.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDerek barely heard them. He was moaning with pleasure, each bite of the cake better than the last. It was gone before he knew it. Panting, Derek looked down at his belly which was distended and bulging, jutting out a few more inches to sit further on his thighs. He felt heavy, bigger than he had ever been his life. Briefly, he wondered how much further he could take this. How much more these little things would feed him, how much more he could possibly eat, how fat he would get before he finally had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThirsty once more, Derek braced himself on the table and pushed himself to his feet. He shuffled over to the fridge, one hand cradling his belly. He bent down, soft gut hanging out the bottom of his shirt. There was no way he should be this ravenous, but his stomach still felt empty.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo cheers from the Munchies, Derek pulled a two-liter bottle of soda from the fridge and started to frantically guzzle it down, hoping something would finally fill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI..need..more,\u201d he gasped, taking a few seconds before returning to gulping down the soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> All that soda down your throat<br>\r\nlook at how your belly bloats</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDerek tossed the bottle aside when he was done. \u201cUrp. I\u2019m so \u2013 urp \u2013 hungry.\u201d  His gut was becoming almost comically spherical, too full to do anything but stick out, perfectly round and expanding wider and wider as it was filled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe started going through cabinets. A box of Twinkies. Three packages of cookies. Chips. Poptarts. Everything Derek could quickly tear open and shove into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Look at you, we\u2019re very proud,<br>\r\nyou've eaten 'till your almost round. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Too full and overstuffed to stand any longer, Derek sank back on the couch, both hands rubbing his massively engorged belly. He was not as opposed to the feeling as he thought. It was a satisfying fullness and he felt almost pride at how enormously fat he felt. <i>I can do better</i>, he thought. <i>I\u2019m the Alpha. I should be bigger\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by his phone ringing from somewhere in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since this meal will never end<br>\r\nmaybe you should share it with a friend\u2026</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tossed his phone to him on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You\u2019re going to be here for the long haul,<br>\r\nso we\u2019ll let you have this one phone call!</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek reached for his phone to see who was calling him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Derek groggily made his way to the kitchen, once again feeling ravenous, following the wafting smell of bacon. The sun was rising, usually signifying it was time for his morning run. Any motivation, however small, to go running was completely gone when Derek saw the massive spread of breakfast sitting on his table. Scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles and pancakes smothered in butter and syrup and whipped cream\u2026so many portions of food sat in front of him, enough to serve a large pack of hungry werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn\u2019t wait to start eating. Derek was at least 90% sure he was still asleep and dreaming. Considering how miserable most of his dreams were, he would gladly take this one. That was the only logic explanation. His pants were still undone. Derek tried to fasten them, his gut no longer bloated, but last night\u2019s feast had settled into a layer of fat around his waist and belly, sticking out over his waistband and refusing to allow his pants to button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek gave up with a shrug. It was his dream, who really cared? He tugged his  shirt down over the curve of his belly and took a seat at the table, greeted by the Munchies\u2019 giggling as they started pushing dishes towards him. If it was a dream, he was going to make the most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We hated to wake you from your slumber,<br>\r\nbut you need to pack on much more blubber!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek grabbed the plate of bacon, eagerly digging in. The last time he had eaten a proper, full breakfast like this had not been in over a decade, not since the fire had he eaten so well. He almost felt bad, if this wasn\u2019t a dream, for not inviting the others. But then again, he was the Alpha. Scott and Jackson\u2019s strength was increasing, Derek would have to work hard to maintain his status as the biggest and strongest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eat up, hurry, don\u2019t delay<br>\r\nwe need you stuffed through day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to pass away as Derek ate. The Munchies watched in delight as the Alpha started to fatten before them, consumed by his gluttony.  Fistfuls of bacon. Once the plate was finished, Derek paused only long enough to wipe the grease off his hands before he reached for another plate. Scrambled eggs, piled high with bags of shredded cheese. Derek\u2019s gut was bulging into his lap, werewolf healing frantically trying to catch up with his consumption Chocolate filled croissants. Bagels slathered with cream cheese. His shirt was riding up the increasing curve, resting right below his belly button. More bacon. An entire ham, which the Munchies considerately sliced for him as he gobbled it down. Derek pulled his shirt down, struggling to stretch it over his belly, which was resting heavily in his lap. A seam split down the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since you think it\u2019s just a dream,<br>\r\nwhy not go the extreme?<br>\r\nHere - guzzle down this heavy cream!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek took the challenge. He reached down the table, struggling with the weight of his tummy blocking his way, and pulled the waffle towards him.  Between bites, he stopped to chug down a glass of the thick cream. Towards the end of the waffles, his pace started to slow. He was, taking smaller bites and breathing heavily as he leaned back in his chair. His stomach had reached almost full capacity, rounded out so wide Derek couldn\u2019t wrap his arms around it, instead trying to relieve the pressure by rubbing the sides of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can\u2019t stop now, you\u2019re so very near<br>\r\nto having eaten this whole table clear!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek groaned in response. \u201cIn a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Aren\u2019t you the Alpha? Big and bad,<br>\r\nthe amount you\u2019ve eaten is rather sad<br>\r\nWe know you can handle so much more<br>\r\nafter all, you belly hasn\u2019t touched the floor!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is big enough.\u201d He pats his gut, stuffed so solid it didn\u2019t wobble. He let out a few small burps and went back to rubbing it. It felt good. Heavy. Derek lifted it up, feeling it\u2019s weight, before belching and letting it fall back against his thighs. He knew it was only so heavy because of all the food he ate and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed by tomorrow, he would only be left with a few extra pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Even though your belly aches,<br>\r\nwe insist you try a few pancakes</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pancakes were all that was left from Derek\u2019s breakfast feast. The table was littered with crumbs and stacks of plates that Derek had polished off. He had come this far\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. That\u2019s \u2013 uff- more than enough food for the day.\u201d Derek leaned forward with a grunt. His belly came between him and the table, making it impossible to simply lean over and pull the food towards him. The Munchies brought the plate over to him balancing it on his belly, before reaching out with their tiny hands and starting to feed Derek chunk after chunk of the butter and syrup soaked pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s your reward for getting big,<br>\r\nwe won\u2019t make you do a thing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek mindlessly chewed and swallowed, the plate of pancakes seemed never-ending and he started to lose focus, overwhelmed by his fullness and greed. Eventually, Derek nodded off, arms resting on top of his gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen he woke up, the Munchies suggested he:</span></div></div>",

He got into the shower, quickly washing off before toweling off. Standing in his bedroom, and feeling more awake after the shower, Derek spend a good ten minutes examining his widen figure, softened by at least thirty pounds. His belly had taken most of the weight, protruding out and spreading to the sides to form wide love handles, resting beneath his softening chest. Thicker thighs, a butt that was threatening to jiggle as he walked, and the hint of a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n None of his jeans fit. Derek had tried every size in his closet. The tightest ones barely pulled up his thighs and the ones that he did wiggle up further wouldn\u2019t stretch over his generous rear. Looking at the pile on the ground, Derek picked back up the largest, most flexible pair he had. Only by laying on his bed, sucking in his gut, was he able to fasten the pants. The waistband cut painfully into his stomach and made his hips look even fleshier as they spilled over the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt situation was no better. Even the largest Henley Derek had clung to him like a second skin, highlighting his moobs and belly. The tightness of the clothes only served to truly show off his growth and make Derek look even fatter, his fat squeezed and bulging out of his outfit. There was no way he could go out like this and the idea of walking into town held no appeal for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not to worry, pretend it\u2019s a dream,<br>\r\nno one will notice when you bursting at the seams.  </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can order lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We brought five foot longs from the deli,<br>\r\n but we know that's not enough to fill your belly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a much more appealing solution than going out. Derek happily settled himself on the couch next to five feet of meatball subs. He happily gorged, grunting and groaning as he his swelling belly pressed up against his already too-tight waistband. After the third sub, the button on his pants gave up the fight and burst off. The Munchies cheered. Derek put  a hand on his belly, massaging the red marks, but kept eating. Once all the sandwiches were gone, he sat back like a sated, full predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don\u2019t let that hold you back<br>\r\nthose sandwiches were just a snack.<br>\r\nCome on, come on, we have to go<br>\r\ngive the town such a show<br>\r\nwatching you eat and eat and grow!</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek decided to go:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was his name and his address.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiots.\u201d Jackson muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t order this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, checking to see if any of the neighbors were watching. There was no way he was going to let anyone think that Jackson Whitmore cheated on his diet and workout regime. Satisfied no one would see him, he brought the box inside. There was a note written on the top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We know you\u2019re always at the gym,<br>\r\nworking hard at staying slim.<br>\r\nSo have on us a little treat,<br>\r\nthere\u2019s plenty more you need to eat! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a little suspicious. Jackson opened it, standing as far away as he could. It was an innocent, unassuming chocolate silk pie. There was a second note inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dig in, enjoy, and eat away,<br>\r\nyou deserve a few cheat days!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson preened a little bit. This must be a gift from someone at the gym. He did work extremely hard to maintain his figure. It was about time someone noticed and they weren\u2019t wrong \u2013 he did deserve to have a cheat day. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a quick shower, toweling off and pulling on some designer jeans and a button-down shirt before heading into the kitchen. He took the box with the pie, a plate, knife, and a fork to the living room and settled himself down in front of the television. Jackson cut himself a slice and started mindlessly eating as he flipped through a couple of shows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson had very high standards of food. Having grown up with only the best and finest gourmet cuisine, and the money to sustain the habit, Jackson plainly refused to eat anything less than quality. Whatever bakery the pie was from, those chefs knew quality food. Jackson cut himself a second slice. And then a third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so busy moaning softly, his eyes fluttering with each rich, chocolatey bite; he failed to notice the little gray blobs watching him. When Jackson reached for another piece, cursing under his breath when he found the tin empty, the creatures started cackling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are sure you have your doubts,<br>\r\nbut we saw you pigging out.<br>\r\nNow the Munchies are here, not a moment too soon<br>\r\nso they can help you really balloon!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson tried to leap to his feet. Instead, he belched and fell back into the couch. Just bloated he told himself, trying to ignore the way his toned stomach had puffed out to form a full, swollen gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you are, but I\u2019m allowed a cheat day,\u201d Jackson told them snippily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One cheat day turns into seven, <br>\r\nand then you\u2019ll be in a food-filled heaven.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no. <i>One</i> cheat day means just that. <i>One.</i> I have a figure to maintain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go ahead and scoff, <br>\r\nif you really think you can work it off,<br>\r\nthe Munchies will be very nice<br>\r\nand offer you another slice!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the blobs crawled over with another pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d Jackson snarled. The creatures only cackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d He reached for the pie tin, setting it down on the space on his lap his belly did not take up, and grabbing the fork. \u201cWhy not? It is my cheat day. I\u2019ll go the gym tomorrow and burn all this off.\u201d <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nSadly, we just don\u2019t agree,<br>\r\nand very soon you\u2019ll come to see <br>\r\nthat life is better when gluttony is set free.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting myself go and I certainly will never get fat.\u201d It was a less credible statement considering he was shoveling pie in his mouth as his tummy slowly rounded out. Jackson surprised himself by how quickly he finished it. Two pies in and he barely felt any more satisfied or full than he was after the first one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy?\u201d Jackson huffed. \u201cI finished it. Now leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Only two? That\u2019s rather small,<br>\r\nhere we thought you could eat them all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch next to Jackson was suddenly filled with boxes of various pies. His mouth started watering with the different scents that started wafting towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then why don\u2019t you take a break?<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve brought you plenty of protein shakes. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Munchies pushed a jug of thick cream over to him, along with a filled glass. Jackson guzzled it down, then greedily grabbed at the jug and poured himself more. He sat back, bringing up a fist to stifle a belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. One \u2013 urp \u2013 more. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward to cut himself a slice of the third pie. The button on his pants flew off, clattering against the tile floor. His gut surged forward, resting against his thighs. The Munchies started giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were cheap pants. I knew I should stick to Armani.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once you finish all those pies,<br>\r\nthey won\u2019t make clothes to fit your size!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jackson rolled his eyes. \u201cI have a personal tailor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He continued plowing through the pies. The third pie slowly turned into his fourth, and then his fifth. The buttons on his shirts were desperately clinging on, huge gaps were visible between them as Jackson\u2019s belly kept widening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho makes these? Not very \u2013 ooof \u2013 filling.\u201d he struggled to sit up on the couch, rocking back and forth to try to get the momentum to move. As his jelly jiggled with the movement, the buttons on his shirt gave up, flying off across the room. He gave up, resting the remaining pie on his swollen gut, which was so heavily stuffed it made a perfect shelf. Jackson finally felt like he was getting full, but there were only three pies left. Those stupid creatures had challenged him to finish them and he refused to be beaten by some stupid little balls of grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Another piece, are you sure that's wise?<br>\r\nLook at the size of your belly and thighs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson stubbornly kept eating, one hand having migrated to his belly, massaging it as he ate. \u201cI told you,\u201d he panted. \u201c \u2013 I can eat anything I want on an \u2013 urp \u2013 cheat day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every bite was now followed by a moan or burp as he kept forcing more pie in his belly. His stomach was forcing to lean progressively further back against his seat, grunting and breathing heavily as he reached for more. When he had finished that one, he managed to swing his legs up so he was laying on his back. He wrapped his arms around his enormous belly, planning on sleeping off the massive bloat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Way to go! You\u2019ve finished eight!<br>\r\nIt\u2019s made quite an impact to your weight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden knock at his door. The Munchies eyes lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgnore it.\u201d Jackson muttered. \u201cNo one is seeing me like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We wonder who is at your door<br>\r\nMaybe they\u2019ve heard you\u2019re greedy for more! <br>\r\nThey want to see the greedy slob<br>\r\nwho\u2019s made eating his new job!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Munchies all jumped on top of his gut, jostling Jackson\u2019s poor, swollen belly. He belched, loud enough for the person at his door to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJackson?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d The Munchies cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho entered the room?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He may as well have shouted the question - whispering around wolves was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson was a few paces in front of them, rolling his eyes without looking back. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you still believe in Santa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles scoffed, which finally made Jackson stop walking and look around. \u201cDude, werewolves.

They had been walking around in the cold for a few hours now, patrolling different neighborhoods for any signs of the intruder. The Christmas trickster had been sneaking into houses in the middle of the night and kidnapping children, planning to sacrifice them as a Christmas ritual. The pack had discovered the terrified children in the woods, trapped in a cave and returned them to their families. This was the last night for the creature to collect enough children from the ceremony and the last chance the pack had to eliminate it before it went into hibernation for another year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had seen nothing so far and as Christmas Eve\u2019s went, this had to be one of the worst. Another forty-five minutes went by before Derek held up a hand, eyes flashing red as he gestured to the roof of a nearby house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanta \u2013 the Krampus \u2013 was on top of the roof. He looked like an ordinary human to Stiles. Wide-figure, white hair and, although his back was turned to them, Stiles could only imagine a white beard to match, black boots, red pants and jacket with a thick, black belt\u2026he definitely seemed more like Santa Claus then a monster here to kidnap children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026who wants to go on the roof and kill Santa?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Also, this is an AU, so a good chunk of canon stuff is disregarded or changed as needed.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beacon Hills lacrosse team was on a long bus ride to what was supposed to be a week-long training camp for lacrosse...  The place was pretty well out of the way, nestled in a well-forested area, so no one was particularly suspicious when they didn't recognize where they were going as the bus twisted and turned along a road lined with almost nothing but what seemed like an endless amount of trees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the bus suddenly broke down after an hour of uneventful driving, that was when they realized something a bit odd was going on.  Not only had there been absolutely no prior indication that anything was wrong with the bus at all, but they realized that the bus had somehow stopped only meters away from what seemed like the wide, dirt-path entrance to a lacrosse camp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was pretty sure there was something slightly off.  It didn't have the name it was supposed to, instead there was simply a huge sign reading \"Camp XXXL: Bring Out Your <i>Fullest</i> Potential\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something told them to at least go in and try seeing for themselves what was going on, so they all filed off the bus with their bags and things and headed into the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome boys, especially the werewolves, started to feel slightly strange at the entrance, but not necessarily in a bad way.  It was more like a brief moment of vertigo and brain-fog that quickly vanished, giving way to feelings that were actually rather pleasant.  If anything, they suddenly felt like the place was somehow comfortingly familiar, even though they had never been there before.  It was a feeling somewhat like nostalgia... not to mention how they could all suddenly smell some faint but absolutely delicious aromas wafting through the air, even the players who weren't werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome boys began to salivate a bit, suddenly hungry.  Both the hunger and familiar, comforting feeling worked to start rapidly pushing away any doubts they had, replacing them with attempts to defend the place instead.  Maybe they just remembered the name wrong, or there was a miscommunication.  Maybe they just made a mistake with the GPS.  Maybe the bus did already have something wrong with it, it's not like it was an exceptionally new or fancy bus anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very attractive, curvy, blonde woman came out to meet them in figure-hugging jeans and a \"Camp XXXL\" t-shirt.  \"Welcome to Camp XXXL, everybody!  I'm the head supervisor here!  Sorry if this isn't quite what you were expecting, there must have been a couple of mistakes in setting things up... But I promise, you've all been accounted for, and we already have everything ready for you, so don't you worry!\"  Her voice and appearance immediately had an unusually powerful calming and charming effect on the boys, even the ones who didn't prefer girls.  Outside of just sex appeal, she had an aura like a trusted big sister, or a very charismatic hostess of some sort.  It was actually rather odd, but no one noticed.  Even as she gave an odd grin and her eyes briefly flashed with green light, no one really noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a handsome, beefy, black-haired man who looked to be in his early to mid-twenties walked up beside her, she spoke up again.  \"And this is Derek, a new advisor here!  You'll be seeing a lot of him!\"  she said, prompting Stiles, Scott, Ethan, Aiden, Isaac, Jackson, Theo, and Liam to all ponder and quietly talk amongst themselves about their utter surprise that Derek had somehow started working at the camp too, not even sure how and why he was qualified to... But like most of the camp, they didn't really question it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was given a tour of the camp, the attractive woman chattering at a mile a minute as she showed them the lacrosse field, the gym, gave them their keys and room numbers for all the cabins, and showed them the buffet style cafeteria...  which served to make everyone realize they were even hungrier than they already thought they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place looked clean, well funded, and incredibly inviting, not to mention the heavenly smell.  Rather than usual hard benches or normal chairs, all the seating in the cafeteria looked incredibly plush and comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're all hungry!  Well, we can't have that!  We plan to keep you all very well fed here.  There will be no restrictions on the cafeteria, and you can come eat whenever you want...  You all look way too skinny, after all, so it's no wonder you're hungry.\"  she said with a giggle.  No one thought anything of it, since it seemed like a harmless joke.  \"And I bet you wanna get more muscles on you too!  So this is your perfect chance to relax those diets and do a little bulking, if you want!  To start with, everyone can head to the table over there, we've got ready-made subs to hold you over for the rest of the tour, and while we talk more about what exactly will be going on here,\" she explained, pointing to a long table off a bit behind her that did indeed have dozens of footlong subs stacked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the subs not being made to order, everyone somehow managed to easily find their favorite kinds on the table...  Of course, they were all high-calorie and generous with fatty toppings, but they were all so spectacularly delicious that no one cared.  As the tour continued, everyone dug into their subs, and found themselves finishing faster than they even realized.  Were they all really that hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could question it too much, Derek was already passing out more subs, and absolutely no one turned down seconds.  Pretty much everyone devoured them just as rapidly as the first, and as soon as they were starting to realize that they were pretty thirsty after the subs, Derek was also handing out big 32 oz bottles of soda...  With none of them being diet soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though everyone knew on some level that athletes should avoid soda, those concerns were forgotten as they all drank it like their lives depended on it, leaving their stomachs gassy and even more bloated... But several boys even wanted thirds on the subs, including nearly all the werewolf boys except for Jackson, who was the most accustomed to eating right and had at least a little more self control, but not enough to realize anything particularly odd was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time the tour and questioning periods concluded, and everyone was settling into their cabins, all of them were already completely full, if not outright stuffed.  They'd been told it was okay to just relax for a while, and nap for a bit if they wanted, so many of them were preparing to do just that.  Still, it didn't go unnoticed that their cabins seemed to be just as high-budget as the cafeteria, and very cozy and relaxing.  Even though they were assigned three people to a cabin, they didn't feel crowded at all.  They even had their own fridges and cabinets, already stocked with lots of appealing snacks, protein bars, and surprisingly high-end looking protein and weight gain powders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you get the weird feeling that this place might be a lot better than we expected?\"  Stiles said to Scott and Isaac as he laid down, since he'd been assigned to room with them.  He was so stuffed and comfortable that he wasn't even the slightest bit suspicious, so he fully meant what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely\" Isaac said with a smile, settling into his bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this place seems like heaven so far,\"  Scott replied from his own bed, before he suddenly unwrapped and took a big bite of what looked like a protein bar from the cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dude, you're <i>still</i> eating?  I saw you ask for a third sub!\"  Stiles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, so?  I am pretty full already, but the food here is amazing!  This is literally the best protein bar I've ever had,\"  Scott said.  He hadn't paid attention to the nutrition facts, which would've also told him it was 750 calories, weirdly high for a protein bar...  although it did actually have more protein than usual too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft.  You're gonna blow up like a balloon if you're not careful.\"  Isaac joked, although he secretly wasn't exactly opposed to the idea of Scott putting on a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's only gonna be a week.  Besides, I think that lady was right about the bulking thing.  I think I'd be happy adding about 20 or 25 pounds of muscle, especially if I want to look more like an Alpha\"  Scott said, not realizing that he was in for much more than '20 or 25 pounds', and not just muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the head supervisor was in her own room, plotting the course of how the remainder of camp would go as she held up a cupped palm with perfectly manicured nails, and a ball of bright green magical power materialized in it.  After all, she was a witch, not just a supervisor.  She wanted the boys huge, not amazing at lacrosse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough everyone's appetite, metabolism, and general body chemistry had already been mildly altered just by arriving, it still wasn't all that far outside of normal.  She surmised that everyone could eat a rough average of two times more than they could before, and their metabolisms were about 30% slower,  but everything varied quite a bit between each individual boy.  But as she cast the next spell, she knew it would have far more potential...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be powerful weight gain magic that would have far more potent effects on the biology and mental state of everyone present, allowing them to eat and gain at completely impossible rates for just a one week stay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it could be potent time magic, greatly prolonging their stay while the outside world remained blissfully unaware, and also keeping the slight enchantments on their appetites and bodies intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it could even be a mixture of the two, or something else entirely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what is it then?</span></div></div>",

It started off bright green when it first escaped her fingers, but rapidly faded to become totally invisible.  It stopped right around the perimeter of the camp, creating a special barrier that ignored matter, but twisted how time worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with the spell in place, time in the outside world would continue at the same speed, so that the boys communicating with anyone outside of the barrier wouldn't cause any strange instabilities or paradoxes, but the outside world was now in a time loop.  The week where all the boys were supposed to be in lacrosse practice would happen over and over again, without anyone thinking anything strange was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the bubble, there was no time loop.  Everyone would experience time as normal, but since the outside world was looping, the seasons still wouldn't change.  Although the witch was certain they would still be perceptive enough to eventually realize that time had changed somehow, she wasn't too worried about them actually doing much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enchantment on the camp was designed to make everything feel more like a good dream than actual reality, making everyone increasingly unlikely to question or worry about anything, and lower their inhibitions and suspicions.  The effect would be more than strong enough to keep them complacent by time the first week was up.  Not even most supernaturals were resistant.  Eventually, it'd get to a point where she could openly admit her true powers and identity if she wanted to, and no one would even mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the time spell successfully set up, the witch could relax for a while, and just watch her plans unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what boys will we be focusing on the most right now? (Note that this can of course be changed freely as things progress, and it's merely about who's at the forefront, not literally restricting things to only those boys) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After everyone's nap, most of the boys decided to hit the gym, some of them still feeling a twinge of guilt over how their first meal hadn't been particularly healthy or restrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott wasn't one of the guilty ones, even though he ate one of the largest amounts.  But some, like Theo and Jackson, were really feeling the guilt and bewilderment at what'd come over them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the cabins and cafeteria, the gym also looked high-budget and very welcoming, despite the witch's actual goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was still providing a functioning, effective camp gym due to certain rules of her magic... Namely, that it was much easier to keep people under her spell when they were happy and not too stressed... and she could heavily influence the boys and reduce their inhibitions, but she couldn't change their minds about things too suddenly or forcefully, or fully mind control them.   There had to be at least some kind of willingness to cooperate, even if it was buried deep down inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, it was in the witch's best interest to still let everyone exercise.  She'd even made it faster and easier for them to gain muscle, just like she'd made it easier to eat and put on fat.  Muscle tended to come on much more slowly, but with the rate boosted, they would be able to gain muscle much faster, although still only at about 1/3rd the speed of fat.   Muscle would also help them counteract the downsides of their weight gain, and knowing they were getting stronger would make them both more willing to gain and more willing to trust her.  She didn't really worry that anyone could exercise enough to keep themselves from gaining, since they'd be too hungry and lacking in self-control to manage that.  Just to be sure about that, the exercise equipment was also enchanted to push their appetites a little bit further and cause a small increase in post-workout hunger, further ensuring they would never burn more than they were taking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, to be extra sure she got her way, there was always a simple but relatively effective tactic... Misinformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs boys worked out, she'd come by and give them half-true or at least seemingly clever advice, which was made easier by how they were already more trusting and gullible from her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, she leaned down next to Scott as he lifted and spoke encouragingly.  \"Keep yourself full of high-calorie foods whenever you're building muscle.  Don't limit anything.  Muscle takes a lot of energy to make and maintain, so your body limits the speed it can grow for safety.  If you keep eating and staying full, your body stops thinking it needs to limit the speed, so you gain muscle much easier that way, even if you don't eat very healthily.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an ever-so-helpful team captain, Scott told everything she told him to everyone else, making him one of the most efficient boys to give advice to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the first two weeks, everyone eagerly listened, always eating as much as they could, no longer caring about restraint or trying to make the calories \"healthy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the witch accelerating muscle gains too, her advice bore physical evidence for everyone's already gullible, magically-influenced minds, and she ended up looking like a genius to them despite her misleading advice.  Nobody actually looked too remarkably different yet, since it'd only been two weeks, but they were definitely showing better results in the gym... and just like she expected, all of them had started gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was usually about about a dozen pounds per human boy, but in some cases it was more exceptional.  Delightfully, the powers the werewolves had seemed to make them better gainers, always well above the average.  She had to admit, even though it was pretty easy for her magical senses to detect that there were werewolves, she wasn't originally sure if werewolves were going to be better or worse gainers than humans. It was predictable that they were good at gaining muscle, but the issue of fat and how fast their metabolisms might be had been more ambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was actually a bit of an outlier even among the werewolves.  He had already gained thirty pounds, even when weighed first thing in the morning, enough that his changes were already starting to get more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were already looking somewhat thicker and beefier, thanks to his werewolf abilities healing his workout strain better, which in turn made his muscles grow a bit better than just the witch's enchantment alone.  And with the healing also giving him more energy and protecting him from most post-workout soreness, he was also more willing to go to the gym in the first place, helping him stay devoted.  His belly had a permanent layer of new squishy softness over a tight, heavily swollen bulge containing the latest meals he'd pigged out on, and his thighs were a little beefier as well.  Along with his thighs, his ass had grown pretty well, both with the fat covering it and the muscle beneath that, meaning that he'd already started to develop a respectable bubble butt.  Plus, he wasn't sure, but he also thought his chest was already looking a little wider and more powerful, even if his pecs were getting a little softer.  At 5'10 and about 185 empty, he was actually already a little overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he particularly minded.  In fact, it actually felt good.  He'd never been able to make such amazing progress before, and he loved all the carefree pigging out, and the lack of homework, deadlines, or anything terrible and dangerous going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were all going to bed one night, he noticed his sleeping clothes actually getting rather snug, even though they were loose and comfortable when he arrived... But he wasn't the only one who noticed, since Isaac came over to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you blew right through that 'twenty or twenty five pounds' you were talking about when you got here.\" Isaac innocently teased, poking Scott's belly in his tight grey t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you grew too... looks really good on you, actually,\" Scott said.  Isaac had grown by a solid twenty-two pounds, but he worked out the least out of all the werewolves, so it was mostly fat.  His belly already looked nearly as big as Scott's, and his chest was a touch softer, but his arms hadn't really gotten much thicker, and his butt and thighs hadn't grown as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Looks good on you too...\"  Isaac said after a small pause, as he looked away for a moment with slight redness on his cheeks before turning back to Scott and speaking.  \"You should keep getting bigger, actually,\"  Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, yeah!  Think about it.  This place feels really safe and fun, but if we're ever in danger again... you don't actually like fighting unless you have to, and you definitely don't want to kill anyone. But the bigger you are, the less anyone wants to mess with you, right?\"  Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point,\"  Stiles chimed in.  \"I mean, True Alpha even sounds stronger than a regular Alpha, but you don't really look that tough at a glance.  It makes perfect sense to bulk up some more and match that title outside of just personality. And this is your chance, since it looks like you're actually pretty damn great at gaining weight when you try, and this place has all the food you could ever want.  You've literally gained three times more than me,\"  Stiles concluded, since he was indeed only ten pounds heavier than he started.  It was only even noticeable when his shirt was off, and it was just enough that his stomach still bulged slightly when empty, and his jeans gave him small lovehandles when he wore them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you end up fat too, that could still be a good thing,\"  Isaac said.  \"Werewolves don't have to worry about fat making them unhealthy, it'd just make you look bigger.  Plus, since we're more durable, the fat could act like extra cushion if you get attacked.  Not only that, but there are a bunch of football players and power-lifter guys who are pretty fat, so even from a human perspective it's not all that weird,\"  Isaac explained.  Part of him could hardly believe he was being bold enough to flat out say that Scott should not only bulk up, but still keep getting fatter.  Still, since the magic had lowered his inhibitions a bit, it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right...  I think I'll go ahead and work on seeing how huge and strong I can get, might as well.  I'd just be miserable trying to control myself with unlimited delicious food here.\"  Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac found himself oddly thrilled by that declaration, but before he could even stop himself, he ended up blurting out something else in the heat of the moment...</span></div></div>",

Thanks, that sounds great! ...But how exactly were you planning on doing it?  Do you like, know what food I should be eating and stuff like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, sorta...  Plus I could like...  Bring you food, and cheer you on...  and feed it to you, and rub your belly to help make room?\"  Isaac said, even though he was feeling weirder about it by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...R-rub my belly?\"  Scott said, blushing slightly.  Something about the thought sounded oddly appealing to him, but he wasn't quite sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's weird, you don't have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, those all sound like great ways to help!  Thank you so much, Isaac!\"  Scott interrupted almost too quickly, as he stared straight up at Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles simply sat struggling to keep himself from laughing as he listened to the conversation, mainly because it was so blatantly obvious that both of them were more into the whole situation than they were letting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that day, Isaac diligently kept up his end of the deal.  He and Scott would not only spend lots of time in the cafeteria, but he'd also bring food back from the cafeteria whenever Scott was back at the cabin.  He thoroughly encouraged Scott in the gym as well, even making his protein shakes and packing his protein bars for him.  The camp had barely any real schedule structure at all, letting the boys make all of their decisions on their own.  This only made it far easier for Scott and Isaac to fully focus on their new goal of bulking Scott up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott expected that he might have to start dealing with negativity, especially because most of the weight was piling on as fat... But he was wrong.  Everyone seemed fascinated by how much Scott was getting bigger and stronger, and the unbelievable amounts of food he could put away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo and a half weeks passed, making it just over a full month since they'd all first come to the camp.  With Isaac's help, Scott gained an astonishing 50 more pounds, bringing him up to 235. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fat wasn't the only thing being added.  Scott literally got stronger by the day, and although his gains were still mostly fat, his arms had avoided enough fat gain that it was obvious he was putting on muscle too, even more so if he actually flexed.  With both the witch's enchantments and his own werewolf powers in place,  he'd already gained almost thirty pounds of muscle in one month, which was utterly astounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Scott's belly had developed a hefty layer of jiggly fat, and it was surprisingly soft, being mostly subcutaneous fat.  In fact, he was actually developing an overhang instead, paired with steadily developing rolls and soft lovehandles instead of a slim, tapering waist.  His thighs rubbed together, and his ass was fatter and bouncier than ever.  The fat and muscle combo made both his arms and legs look handsomely thick and meaty.  His shoulders were wider too, and his pecs were big, but definitely softened by fat, to the point they were starting to get a bit jiggly.  Meanwhile, only a bit of fat had even affected his face at all, making it look just the slightest bit softer but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's growth was especially obvious because the only new clothes anyone had access to were clingy jean shorts, equally clingy spandex shorts, and \"Camp XXXL\" t-shirts that seemed to naturally fit a bit snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Scott was far from the only one growing impressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average gains were up to eight pounds a week instead of six...  Which was enough to start making a noticeable difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Isaac was focused on getting Scott bigger, even he saw a bit of a gaining speed increase, having gained 29 pounds while still hardly working out, meaning it was almost all fat.  At 6'2, he'd reached 216 pounds.... but being four inches taller than Scott, and having less underlying muscle to thicken and broaden his frame, the weight difference between them seemed like a lot more than nineteen pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's fat was particularly loose and jiggly, and he'd developed a very flabby little gut that was already making a slight overhang and creasing in the middle a little.  His ass and thighs weren't nearly as impressive compared to some others, especially not Scott's, but they'd definitely grown too.  He was getting quite the flabby pair of manboobs as well, although they weren't too big just yet, and his arms were getting soft and plush with nothing but fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott's best friend, Stiles had started gaining faster too, while also not exercising much just like Isaac.  As was the average for human boys, he'd put on twenty more pounds, enough to become overweight and enough to start looking it too.  The outline of his starter gut was always visible under his shirt, and he'd become a little softer all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for other werewolves, Liam, Ethan, and Aiden had all become inspired by Scott's gain and hard work in the gym too.  Liam had gained another 35 pounds, up from 25 in his first week.  It wasn't that much faster than Isaac on paper, but considering he was a good seven inches shorter than Isaac, and he'd actually been working out? It was definitely impressive, and it looked like a lot more on his frame.  Meanwhile, the twins had also worked out and still gained 40 pounds each, way up from only 20 each the first week, thanks to being able to help each other eat and exercise...  Plus, Ethan had Danny's support too, and Danny was getting chunky himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, after a long day of gorging, Scott was sprawled out on his bed in exhaustion, letting Isaac rub his huge, protruding, heavily stuffed gut...  After all, exercising but still gaining about three pounds a day required a ludicrous amount of food.  Just looking at his belly jutting up in front of him like a mountain, packed with rich comfort food and loads of greasy meat, Scott felt like it should've hurt... But it actually didn't, thanks to his werewolf healing and durability.  It just felt incredibly tight and heavy, but also very warm and almost relaxing.  It'd been hours since his last gym visit, but he'd eaten so much it was like another workout, leaving him still a bit sweaty.  Scott figured the steady warmth was from more blood and metabolic effort being directed to his stomach and digestive system to properly handle the sheer amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked out the window as he rhythmically rubbed Scott's gut, and Scott belched powerfully every now and then, mind drifting off as he just enjoyed Isaac's touch... But something about the sky got Isaac's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, the moon!\"  Isaac said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What about it?\"  Scott said sleepily.  \"I feel like I swallowed it whole right now.... Uuurrrrrppp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, it's full!  And I just remembered it was full the first night we were here too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always been either full or a waning gibbous the whole time we've been here...\"  Stiles pointed out from his own bed.  Having a werewolf best friend meant he knew quite a bit about moon phases \"But every time a week passes, it somehow becomes full again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say you noticed sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured if it wasn't doing anything bad, I didn't need to,\"  Stiles said with a shrug.  \"Everyone seems so happy lately, and this place is great.  Why get worked up over the moon acting weird here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...  I feel so relaxed here, and no one makes us do anything...  And I know we all eat like pigs lately, and we're getting fat, but it feels so amazing I'm starting to forget why it was ever a bad thing.\"  Isaac responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it might actually be a good thing.  I mean, look how fast Scott's been growing, and how much he can eat.  Isn't it amazing?\"  Stiles pointed out.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... it really is...\"  Isaac said, glancing at Scott and immediately seeing how handsome he was, even sleepily sprawled out in bed.  \"I guess you're right.  It's nothing to worry about, and it's probably good for us anyway.\"  Isaac said, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was that, thanks to everyone's suspicions being inhibited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the witch was in her own cabin, and she could hardly believe her luck.  Not only were the werewolves better gainers, but people were already fully giving in and admitting they liked gaining!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she noticed that she'd happened to make the time loop start right on the day of a full moon too, and she pondered how it would be affecting the werewolves in camp in the future, since they didn't loop with the moon like those in the outside world.  Already, it'd probably been having at least some effect, but she knew it'd been long enough that it'd kick in a lot harder for them very soon.  She knew it wouldn't necessarily be just like a super moon, which delivered more power all at once.  It would just be delivering the usual amount of power at once but far more frequently, which could potentially have a completely different effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the witch could've been thinking one out of a few different things:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt could be that the weekly full moon would act like an upgrade to the werewolves. Their muscle gain and stamina would see benefits, their powers would work better, they'd have bigger appetites, better digestion, and they'd be even more resistant to negative weight gain effects.  Some of them could even get taller, and they'd all get better at handling and controlling the lunar energy after so much more exposure.  Perhaps they might even develop brand new powers, depending on the wolf...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it would work more like an overdose, putting more continuous stress on the bodies of werewolves and actually make them lazier and weaker, with all the extra lunar energy also lowering their calorie requirements.  But if they didn't want to exercise anymore, they'd probably spend more time eating instead... (This can also be optionally used to switch to pure fat gain rather than fat/muscle gain)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she was thinking of something completely different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which one was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, the unnaturally common full moon would most likely be upgrading the werewolf boys...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as another week passed, and the effects finally started hitting harder, people started realizing it was true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was practicing lacrosse with Jackson, Danny, Liam, and the twins. A lot of players had pretty much stopped practicing, preferring to eat and relax more.  Scott didn't really think it was worthy of blame or criticism though.  Even he was only practicing when he wanted to.  The only reason he could even practice that much was that he was resistant to post-stuffing discomfort, and even then it was awkward to try and maneuver with such a full gut to lug around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he'd reached 255, already a full 100 pounds heavier than he started... Technically more, if you included his stomach contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe practice was pretty intense for a short while, but then Aiden suddenly paused, not sweating or breathing hard but simply looking like he'd lost interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm done for now...  Gonna go get more food,\"  Aiden said, slapping a hand to his rather impressive gut, which strained his uniform and made it ride up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you're actually hungry...\"  Jackson said in minor irritation, looking at how obviously bloated and overfed Aiden was.  His gut was totally round and quite firm, but there was still a jiggly little patch of softer fat padding the underside of his stomach, and it wobbled slightly when his palm struck his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, but I still really want some rare steak right now.  And it's unlimited free food, might as well eat as much as you want, right?\"  Aiden responded, not the least bit ashamed.  Liam seemed like he was going to agree, but Jackson spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no.  You don't see me making some <i>hog</i> of myself,\"  Jackson said with a grimace, half-right and half-wrong about the hog bit.  In comparison to other werewolves, he'd definitely gained the least, even being out-gained by some of the human boys...  But he was still 30 pounds heavier than he started, and gaining a little under a pound a day even while still exercising was definitely not restrained eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're just jealous 'cause of this,\"  Aiden said with a smirk, as he flexed a bicep.  Sure enough, there really was a huge, impressive muscle there, since Aiden had already been pretty buff...  And although gaining muscle was supposed to get much slower as you went, that didn't seem to matter in Camp XXXL, so both he and Ethan had added about 30 pounds of muscle each since first arriving, along with about 55 pounds of fat each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gained the same amount of weight in solely muscle that Jackson had gained in total, and having already been somewhat beefier than Jackson when he started, the fat didn't hide that Aiden's biceps had gotten huge... and Jackson couldn't hide that he actually was sort of jealous.  Unfortunately for him, muscle could be gained so much faster in Camp XXXL that controlling his eating a bit more than the others also hampered the speed of his muscle growth, leaving him only about eight pounds more muscular than when he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no good comeback after getting his ego wounded, Jackson's eyes briefly went piercing blue, and his wolf fangs came in as he gave Aiden a snarl warning him to not rub it in any further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Aiden to respond with his own snarl, which looked and sounded much more threatening... and most surprisingly, came with the addition of bright red eyes.  Jackson not only immediately shut up, but took a couple of steps back, eyes wide with shock and a bit of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you weren't-  You aren't supposed to be-\" Jackson started, grasping for the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Aren't supposed to be what?\"  Aiden said confusedly, as his face went back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had Alpha eyes!  How'd you do that?!  You didn't kill anyone, and only Scott is supposed to be a True Alpha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden seemed surprised, before briefly turning to look at Ethan.  Already knowing what he wanted to see, Ethan flashed him his werewolf eyes, and Aiden flashed his at the same time... Sure enough, both of them had bright red eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\"  Aiden said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did it come back?!\"  Ethan asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know,\"  Aiden replied with a shrug.  \"Just more proof this place is awesome... anyway, wanna go get that steak now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, could use that extra fuel for this Alpha power,\"  Ethan replied, before motioning to Danny to join them as well, with a smug grin.  Danny gladly jogged over to his side, looking strong and chunky as well.  With Ethan's help, he was one of, if not the best human gainer, and he'd packed on a total of 55 pounds since starting.  He gave Ethan's round, wobbly, well-fattened ass a good slap and a squeeze, and Ethan responded by kissing him passionately, not caring in the slightest who saw.  Once Ethan and Danny were done, the three left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the others were pretty much completely used to the PDA, they were still in total shock over the returning Alpha status, and Scott quickly left the lacrosse practice to go find Stiles and Isaac, who were among those who'd stopped practicing, at most just coming to watch sometimes.  Liam quickly tagged along, knowing Scott had a way of getting to the bottom of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was already starting to think that there was a good chance the unusual moon cycles were what restored Alpha status to the twins, but he needed other opinions on the matter.  They could find Derek too, maybe he knew a bit more about what was happening as an actual employee... although even he seemed to be able to mostly do what he wanted, and Scott still had no idea how exactly he got the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jackson stormed off, head swarming with thoughts.  Why were Ethan and Aiden getting their Alpha status back?  Was it because he used to be an Alpha, or was it just because of the camp's effects?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of Aiden's huge biceps and commanding red eyes filled Jackson's head, causing him to grit his teeth and threatening to make him bring out his claws and fangs.  What gave Aiden the right to be so much stronger than him?!  They both exercised, the main difference was that Aiden and his meathead of a brother just ate like fatass hogs.  It wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite his anger, Jackson kept coming back to a specific question, more important than anything else...  If it was merely the camp's effects that made it happen...  could <i>he</i> become an Alpha without killing too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will the focus be now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't particularly hard for Scott to find Isaac, Stiles, or Derek.  Isaac was taking a nap, while Stiles and Derek were in the cafeteria, each drinking huge milkshakes and apparently already talking about something before Scott came in with Isaac and Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Scott saw Derek, he was blown away by how much fatter Derek was than when they all first came.  He was probably the only one who'd gained more than Scott overall, and it showed.  He didn't seem like he'd already gained /that/ much more, probably just about 25 or 30 pounds compared to Scott, but it was still startling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProportionately, more fat seemed to go to Derek's belly than it did for Scott, creating a considerable overhang at the cost of a  slightly smaller proportion everywhere else, but there was still so much weight that his thighs and ass were about as thick as Scott's, and his arms were huge with both fat and muscle, seeming to be a bit bigger than Scott's and packed with fantastic strength.  His face was fatter too, already sporting some roundness and a double chin, although he still looked incredibly handsome. Plus, he was still just overall wider and thicker than Scott.  His clothes were a terrible fit too, but he didn't even seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was at a loss for words, having trouble understanding just how Derek was so big.  Scott had Isaac's help, but Scott hadn't seen anyone helping Derek gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derek?  How'd you get so big already?!\"  Scott asked, momentarily forgetting his original concerns.  \"Weren't you still thin when we got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just keep eating, that's all.\"  Derek said casually, patting his huge, partially exposed gut and making it wobble a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about getting full?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about this place makes it a lot harder to get full...and I think it hit me especially hard.  At first I hoped I'd be more resistant, but whatever's going on here actually seems to cooperate with our powers and our strengths instead, so us being stronger just makes it work better.  I have the most experience being a werewolf, I've had to regenerate from a ton of things, and I can become an actual wolf, so my body is especially used to handling huge changes.  With all that in play, I'm giving the magic a lot to work with.  Of course, this is all just my theory... but besides that, I really can't explain why I'm getting bigger so easily, even if I did stop fighting it pretty quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a pretty good theory...\"  Scott started, before Liam suddenly elbowed him in his stomach... which wasn't that painful, but was enough force to cause a quick belch from Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what we're really here for.  We're here because Ethan and Aiden both got their Alpha powers back, somehow, and we were hoping you knew something,\"  Liam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean like this?\"  Derek said, before flashing everyone his fangs and blood red wolf eyes, startling all of them.  Derek simply chuckled at the response before reverting his face back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?!  And you didn't say anything?!\"  Stiles said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want anyone getting too worked up or suspicious about it, especially considering what you normally have to do to be an Alpha.  But now that I know it's happened to others too, I'm not too worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, I guess that makes more sense.  Plus, you've always been kinda crappy at communicating anyway...\"  Stiles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can communicate just fine!\"  Derek said, glaring at Stiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anyone vouching for you,\"  Stiles said with a shrug, as he sipped his chocolate milkshake.  Derek just silently mouthed a couple of swears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, do you know anything about why this is happening, Derek?\" Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This kind of situation barely happens, especially not with the actual moon... but I have heard stories and legends about spells or potions that replicate the effect of being under a full moon unusually often...  As long as the magic is done right, the effect is usually like a werewolf supercharge.  Your body not only gets saturated with lunar energy, but since its long term, you can get much better at manipulating that lunar energy and your body's own processes.  Unfortunately, it always takes at least a few weeks to fully kick in, even longer to fully train your upgraded body, and all of the magic can be difficult and tedious, or just plain impossible under most circumstances.  That's why you barely hear about it even though there are plenty of power-hungry werewolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But most importantly, we have nothing to worry about, right?\"  Scott asked, feeling rather defensive of his happy, comfy, danger-free life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.  Like I said, the effects are always positive as long as the magic is done right.\"  Derek said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with knowing that they could mostly just continue on like before, everyone decided to sit down for a hefty meal, since they were already in the cafeteria anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also turned out to be a great way to see how Derek could eat up close, filling Scott with both awe and a bit of envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could eat significantly faster than Scott usually did, and he'd gotten to the point where he didn't even ask for just plates anymore...  He would have a whole cart of food filled up just for him, and then bring it to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLasagna, creamy mashed potatoes, meatloaf, pizza, steak, pulled pork sandwiches, buttered rolls, bratwurst, fried chicken...  All of it disappeared into Derek's mouth with breakneck speed.  His powerful jaws and throat could both chew faster and swallow bigger pieces at once, and the others swore even his cheeks had gotten more flexible, all the better to let him cram more food in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott tried to keep up with him, eyes wordlessly challenging him, and Derek seemed to silently accept the challenge as they each raced through their own cart of food.  But still, although Scott had surges of speed and determination where he seemed to hold his own very well, he just couldn't keep up overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter perhaps an hour,  Scott looked ready to explode, periodically belching and resting his hands on top of his completely stuffed, pulsing tummy.  The familiar feeling of unusual warmth quickly arrived, and he let out a moan, reclining back in his seat a little.  His shirt had food stains all over it, his face still had traces of crumbs and sauce, and Isaac was steadily massaging his belly to help him out, while Liam just stared transfixed, and moderately stuffed after quite an impressive feast of his own.  Stiles had eaten a lot as well, but still the least, and he seemed to be at a total loss on which over-bloated, totally spherical gut he should ogle more between Scott's or Derek's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... how do you...  Uuurrrrrrpppp... do it?\"  Scott asked Derek through labored breaths.  Derek seemed much more comfortable, and he was actually still finishing up, boasting more empty plates than Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest...\"  Derek started.</span></div></div>",

But it's about strength and skill, not just effort, so don't be surprised if you don't get it right away,\"  Derek said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  Scott asked, leaning in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried controlling my regeneration and body processes to will myself to digest faster, or will my stomach to stretch, but both of those things are complicated enough that I couldn't make a big difference...  But now I've found a compromise...\"  Derek said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others just stared impatiently, waiting for him to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, speeding up digestion is hard...  It requires a lot of things breaking down really rapidly, getting absorbed properly, and you can only make certain enzymes work so fast.  But there are two options that are a lot more doable...  One is that you use the power of your stomach muscles to compress your food as tight as you can.  The problem there is that there's a lot of water and fluid in your stomach, making it hard to compress it too much.  Luckily...  Making yourself absorb extra water and fluids faster is more doable.  And when you absorb the extra water from the compressed food, it gets easier to pack it all in tighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach me!\"  Scott said immediately, completely taken in by how promising it all sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"  Liam chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but you have to do what I say, no whining and getting frustrated if anything goes wrong.  I said it was doable, but I never said it was easy. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\"  both Scott and Liam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... now, just close your eyes and have all the muscle in your abdominal area squeeze in as tight as it can.  Keep the pressure even, and imagine it pressing it on all sides, and imagine it getting tighter and tighter.  If you focus hard enough, you can actually make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Liam obeyed, wincing a bit at their first attempts... But sure enough, their stomachs noticeably got a little smaller and more tightly packed, and they both started to belch repeatedly, squirming in mild discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going.  Squeeze hard, and get all the gas out.  It might make you nauseous, but just focus on adding more pressure, and ignore the discomfort.\"  Derek instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac and Stiles just watched a bit worriedly as Scott and Liam continued, panting and belching and sweating a bit as they applied enormous amounts of pressure to the food in their guts, almost feeling like they were going to make themselves burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, imagine your body drawing in water, imagine your cells bloating up with it.  Think about how much you want to relieve the pressure.  It's kind of like healing.  Make your body do what it has to to relieve the pain and pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Liam obeyed, after some struggle.  There was the strange sensation of their bodies feeling a bit more bloated and waterlogged overall, and not just in their stomachs, as fluids were drawn out of their stomachs and into their bloodstreams and other tissues with incredible speed, especially whenever they managed to push any fluid into the small intestine, where it was easiest to absorb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several arduous minutes, but the others could actually see both Scott and Liam slowly shrink their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time they were done, they still looked obviously full, other parts of their bodies had gotten a little puffier looking, and they were sore and completely exhausted, but their stomachs had gone down considerably in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually a lot better than I expected for it being the first time either of you tried it...  It must be because of all the magic and unique conditions going on here.\"  Derek said.  \"Nice work.  But still, you're going to have to practice that multiple times a day if you want it to get any easier or more efficient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Scott and Liam groaned, feeling like their stomachs were full of lead even though they'd gotten smaller in diameter, since they'd packed the food so much denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  It hurts now, but it should still be pretty easy to use the bathroom, since all that water didn't actually leave your system.  Your body will be able to guide it back to where it's needed.\"  Derek said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Liam panted out their words of thanks in spite of the discomfort they were in, since they were the ones who wanted the secret, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had to help them up, but nonetheless, they kept practicing diligently over the next two weeks, spending significantly more time together to help and motivate one another.  Isaac was free to learn too, but he didn't seem as interested, not wanting to have to strain himself so much just to get bigger.  He was mostly just there to keep providing the gluttonous wolves with more food, and help them push their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every day, the process got a little easier and less painful, and they were able to complete the process more quickly too.  Scott tended to be a little better at it than Liam, but Liam was never far behind.  They could pack in far more food than before, making their weights experience a surge in progress as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just how effective is the new technique really?  How many pounds did they gain in two weeks?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In this world, werewolves lived alongside humans. <br>\r\nAt first there were some issues, mostly for the younger wolves who were learning control and use their powers. <br>\r\nSo that\u2019s why in most countries children were separated until high school where they shared some classes. Well, of course there were still some classes for werewolves and classes for humans. Especially P.E and sport teams. <br>\r\nWerewolves, even bitten ones, are of course stonger, but also way taller. For example when Stiles\u2019s best friend, Scott, got bitten, he put on 7 inches in a week. There were no male werewolves under 6\u20194\u201d. So humans could not rival them at lacrosse or any other sports. Stiles could not imagine being tackled by his best friend. His 147 pounds body would be literally crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deal made with the werewolves was not to bite humans. Of course there were exceptions. Scott was one with his severe case of asthma. In exchange, werewolves had a particular stature in society: one county, one pack. In Beacon Hills county the Hales were the werewolves. They were really present in the organisation of the town even if key jobs such as the Sheriff or the mayor\u2019s office were occupied by humans. <br>\r\nThat\u2019s how Stiles knew the Hales. His dad was the Sheriff and worked closely with Talia Hale, the Judge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greatness of werewolves was also celebrated with many town gatherings where humans mostly provided food for the wolves. It was tradition. The wolves could eat a huge amount of food. And it showed. Stiles studied werewolf biology in middle school and learned that male werewolves\u2019 bodies easily stocked calories. That\u2019s why most of the male werewolves were big. It didn\u2019t change their capacities, reflexes or health, but they were just fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the case of Scott, a few weeks after the bite and his growth spurt, Stiles noticed he was gaining weight. He remembered poking at his little belly. Scott told him it was something his wolf liked and that his appetite was basically bottomless. Now Scott was pushing 350, one of the biggest wolves of the school. He was also mostly with his pack. He took some time for Stiles but less than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles was not really a big fan of his new pack mates. First there was Isaac Lahey. Another bitten wolf and maybe the smallest. Well if you consider being 6\u20196 for 280lbs small. He was beautiful but he had the nasty habit of stealing Scott from Stiles. Plus he was a bit arrogant. Well all werewolves are, and he was certainly much less arrogant than Jackson Whittemore. Urgh.. that one was an idiot. Born with a silver spoon, or many, in his mouth, he was walking as if he owned their poor human lives. He was also a bit of a bully with Stiles, even if he stopped, thanks to Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one Stiles swore he\u2019d never like was Derek freaking Hale. If Jackson was acting like a spoiled prince, Derek Hales was the freaking Queen of Sheba. Well granted the city belonged to his family. Granted he was the heir of the Hale pack. Granted he was the biggest man Stiles had ever seen (almost 7 feet and an astonishing 400lbs). That was not an excuse to act like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStiles\u201d called his gentle giant puppy, pulling him in a McCall signature bear hug. He took a deep breath of Stiles\u2019 hair. That was a common thing. Mostly every morning actually. A wolf thing that Stiles accepted. \u201cGot my morning treat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles rolled his eyes. \u201cAs if I could forget. Just once I forgot it and I had to suffer with your pouting face all day.\u201d He answered pulling out a box of donuts for Scott. It was customary for humans to give food to wolves to show their \u201cgratitude\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was salivating. \u201cYou\u2019re the best bro.\u201d He said finishing in a bite the first donut. \u201cI was so hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you always?\u201d Stiles snickered while poking at Scott\u2019s massive belly. He growled playfully at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like it bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Stiles could answer, they were interrupted but the other three wolves. Stiles sighed at that. He knew that the wolves knew he was not a big fan of them. And now they were crowding him by his locker. Isaac was eyeing the half emptied box in Scott\u2019s hands trying to pick one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles exclaimed. \u201cThose are for Scott!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do Stilinski?\u201d Whittemore sneered. \u201cFight us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he felt the bulk of Derek Hale on his side. \u201cCalm down Jacks. Obviously Stiles has a favourite wolf.\u201d At that Scott looked at him surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Stiles said as he tried to go past them. A bit difficult with these four huge bodies. \u201cLemme go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring me food?\u201d Hale asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to be Alpha someday. Everybody gives me what I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t. Scott is my best friend and he is nice to everybody. He doesn\u2019t remind me how weak and pathetic I am because I\u2019m human. He\u2019s not arrogant. And he doesn\u2019t walk around like he\u2019s the freakin Queen of Sheba!\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t know what happened. He was yelling at a werewolf. Something you didn\u2019t do. Because, hello they\u2019re werewolves they could destroy you in less than a second. And knew everybody in the hall was looking at them. And looking at him with pity in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Said Hale. His eyebrows were raised and Stiles understood he annoyed the wolf. He had to find a way out. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rang to announce the beginning of first period. As the teachers entered the hall, he thanked all the gods for his luck. And he could be safe for at least three hours with his werewolves-free classes.<br>\r\nHe was so infuriating.</span></div></div>",

Whereas his morning classes had all been werewolf-free, the rest of the day was decidedly not, and that started with lunch. And lunch meant seeing Scott...and dealing with the rest of his pack again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lunchroom, there was a definite divide between werewolves and humans. Not that it was based on animosity, but it\u2019s hard to focus on eating your lunch with a bunch of hungry behemoths looming over you. Scott and Stiles had been the singular exception to this rule. When Scott had been bitten, Stiles had been determined that their friendship wouldn\u2019t change. And though becoming a werewolf meant that Scott now had to spend a lot of his time with the Hales and his new pack, Stiles wanted to make sure that he and Scott still had some bro-time. And that meant lunch together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the lunch line, Stiles couldn\u2019t help but rhuminate over the events of that morning. Being teased and tortured by Jackson and Isaac hadn\u2019t been anything out of the ordinary. Even Derek had been his Usual smarmy self, though that was something of a newer development. Up until the last couple of months, Derek was aloof, like he was too good to talk to Stiles. It was a little crushing, but now Stiles would almost say he preferred it to the extra taunts and teases. Maybe that\u2019s what had set him off? Or maybe it was something else. Whatever it was, that surge of anger...it had been a rush. Almost like something he couldn\u2019t control, which was not a good thing to happen in front of a group of werewolves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that worrying thought, Stiles quickly paid for his lunch and made his way toward the table he and Scott had sort of claimed as theirs, Scott\u2019s larger, reinforced chair next to Stiles\u2019s regular-sized one. As Stiles had almost reached the table...</span></div></div>",

But, of course, Hale and Co ruined his day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two hours ago, and he was still mad. And right now his nerves would be even more crushed as Lydia Martin came to him during AP calculus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I heard you signed your death warrant this morning.\u201d She simply said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha!\u201d Stiles answered. \u201cDon\u2019t start me on this. He so infuriating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a werewolf trait. Pretty common actually. Most people just accept and enjoy it. It\u2019s tradition to wish to have strong packs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not most people\u201d Stiles grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia sighted and put her hand on his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStiles\u201d she said with that tone he hated. The kind of tone she used when she was giving true, excellent advices that made people question their sole existence. \u201cYou may not like them, but there are part of this city. Basically forever. So if you want to have a normal life here, you\u2019ll have to be at least civil with them. Especially with Derek. He\u2019ll be the Alpha after his mother. Or it\u2019ll be a living hell for you. And also for our dad.\u201d Stiles looked at her at that. He did not think of that. Lydia sensed that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm you. But just think about that.\u201d Stiles must have looked distressed because now Lydia Martin was looking comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, I know that the wolves don\u2019t really appreciate that. I mean Isaac just need and want to be wanted and loved. Natural after his terrible childhood. Jackson... well he ma be all arrogant and Le of himself, but he is truly looking for being accepted. And Derek, he\u2019d live like a failure to know that someone of his town doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it sounds like Stiles was at fault. As if the pack bad feelings were because of him. But no! Scott never had any problem with that. He would have told him otherwise. Stiles was pretty sure of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to much to think. He just grabbed his his bag and left the class. He ignored the teacher called his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at his jeep, he felt his phone ringing. Glancing at it he saw it was Scott. He would have certainly smelled his distress. Great!  </span></div></div>",

His dad didn\u2019t press, even if he suspected it was not the entire reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Stiles guessed it was Scott. Well usually Scott just opened the window and jumped on Stiles. But with the look on Scott face Stiles understood his friend was troubled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy\u201d he said casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you ignore me all afternoon Stiles?!\u201d Shouted Scott. \u201cWe were worried sick about you! You know you can\u2019t do that to me!\u201d He said as pulling Stiles into a hug, sent marking him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment we\u2019re both guys stayed still, Scott examined his friend. \u201cAre you okay? Are you sick or in pain? I can help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Scott. It\u2019s just... well it\u2019s stupid\u201d he sighted, sitting on his bed. Scott layed on his bed takin Stiles close to him. Well Scott always had the power to make Stiles feel better. He was currently enjoying Scott\u2019s huge belly as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t press if you don\u2019t want to talk. But for me nothing you say is stupid.\u201d Stiles melt at that. Scott was the most caring person of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know... it\u2019s just something Lydia said to me, that made me think a lot. I just needed to be alone I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you can always come to me.\u201d He said rubbing Stiles hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles smiled at that, relaxed, then he felt asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke twenty minutes later, he was alone in his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott must have left for his pack. His stomach rumbled and evening decide it was time to eat something, as he skipped lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived in the kitchen, he found Scott wolfing down on the pint of chocolate ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you would have found it.\u201d Stiles teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hungry. I didn\u2019t really ate at lunch. I was worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude... well then I should bring you to diner tonight then. If you\u2019re still hungry after so much ice cream of course\u201d Stiles proposed as he slapped Scott belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Be gentle with it\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Scott looked a bit embarrassed. \u201cWell I have already made plans with the guys\u201d, aka the Pack, \u201cpizza night at Derek\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of heavy silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great\u201d Stiles said smiling, even if he knew that he could not fool Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, they were worried about you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles sighted at that. \u201cWell they have a funny way to show it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStiles...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really. Being shoved and practically bullied every day is something really normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStiles...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, because they think  humans are only good enough to worship them and...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was grabbing him, clearly angry at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! Stop saying that. They are my pack, my family. I can\u2019t let you insult them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they can?\u201d Stiles looked at Scott in the eyes. \u201cWhat happened to being bros?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re challenging them, for god sake! You only bring me food and de y them that. That annoys our wolves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry that wanting to be with my best friend annoys your wolves.\u201d Stiles was stubborn.  Very stubborn. He was sad about this situation but also determined to defend himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should leave.\u201d Stiles said showing him the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott was mostly shocked about what his best friend was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the Sheriff came home and met the two teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Scott. How are you?\u201d The words were warm but the Sheriff could feel the tension between Stiles and Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was leaving.\u201d Stiles answered. He looked at his friend, defying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott shook his head before leaving the room. \u201cGoodby Sheriff.\u201d Warmly tone. \u201cStiles.\u201d Disappointed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his father looked at him wondering what happened between them, Stiles just shook his head before climbing the stairs to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just could think he screwed up. Massively. </span></div></div>",
