At least, that's my real name, but most people on this planet know me as Linda - or Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was a baby, my own planet, Krypton, was destroyed - I don't know how. My parents had constructed a life pod, capable of an extended spaceflight - at least the twenty year journey to the planet Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod was launched just minutes before Krypton exploded, and twenty years later, it crash landed on Earth. During the course of the journey, I developed, from a baby, to a young girl, teenager, and finally the woman I am today. The pod sustained me, protected me, educated me, but it was always lonely. I would often look out into space, and wonder if there was anyone else out there - or if I was the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI longed for a companion, a friend. As the years rolled by, I began to try to sleep as much as possible, to avoid the pain of being awake and alone - so when my pod eventually did crash land on Earth, I wasn't awake to feel the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I did wake up, I knew instantly what had happened. During my education, I'd been told that the radiation from the yellow sun of this solar system would endow my body with fantastic strength and power. I felt better than I ever had in my whole life. I'd been looking forward to this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew from my education that there was another Kryptonian on Earth, a man who had become loved among these people, and I was hoping to somehow find him. My parents knew what would happen to my body, and my mother had made me a costume so that I could be a superhero too. It's all I have of my home. I put it on, and tore my way out of the pod, unprepared for the blast of water that hit me full in the face as it flooded in. The pod had apparently landed in a river, and had already sunk to the bottom, but I got free and escaped to the surface, where I tested my new abilities for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd landed near a beautiful forest - my first taste of freedom. It's so big, everything seems to go on forever. I could hear and see and just sense far more than I'd ever been able to. I ran through it, testing my superspeed and just enjoying my freedom. I was flying, and I didn't even realise it, and then when I did realise, I could have cried with joy - I could fly! I took to the air, hurtling and circling and laughing in sheer delight at this amazing ability. I'd always looked forward to the day when I would gain my powers, and my freedom, and when I finally got them I hardly knew what to do first. Eventually, I landed back in the forest, and walked through it on foot - I wanted to savour every moment, every inch of my new surroundings. I was finally free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wandered onto what I now know to be a road, I wasn't really thinking about anyone seeing me. I'd been alone all my life, and I hadn't really thought about what I would do when I eventually did meet someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging them was not what I was expecting to do, but that was what I did when Nicola pulled up in her car. I was just overwhelmed by my first sight of another person - I needed to know that they were real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her who I was and what had happened - of course, I had to demonstrate my powers. Nicola is wonderful - she's my friend, and that's everything I've ever wanted. She took me in, fed me, sheltered me, and she's kept my secret. Nicola lives - lived - alone, and her house is out here in the middle of nowhere. I like being here for her when she gets home, and I like being with her. I think she likes me too - she takes me out, she buys me things, and she said I can stay for as long as I want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to repay her...we've talked about me having a double life, a dayjob...but at the moment I spend my days as Supergirl - saving people, helping people...and travelling. I've been here nearly two weeks now, and I love it. I can be in one country, watching the dawn of a new day, and then within seconds I can be on the other side of the planet watching the sun set. I just wish...Nicola could share it with me. I love her, and I wish she was like me...but how can I tell her, after all she's done for me? We're good friends...and, for her at least, that's where it ends. But I want more...I need to be loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've got another problem too...since I came here, my appetite has soared. I can't stop eating. I never had this trouble back in the pod...but now I always seem to be eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's showing. I've gained weight since I've arrived here - Nicola weighed me this morning, and I've gained nearly 100 pounds in 2 weeks, all of it fat. I'm looking at myself in the mirror now...shaking this belly I seem to have. There's a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, Nicola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola puts her beautiful head around the door. \"Oh, Kara! I'll close the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright.\" I'd forgotten I was naked. \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola comes in and closes the door, and I smile at her. \"Are you off to work?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I'm going to ask if I get you as my assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow...\"Do you think they'd let you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins. \"I'm the best journalist they have. If I say I need a photographer with me full time, I'll get it. And you will be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we can spend more time together!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. And I'll always let you go when you need to do your superhero stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Nicola, thank you so much!\" I grab her and hug her tightly, and she hugs me back. She glances over my naked body, and I sigh. \"I'm fat, aren't I?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes, you are. But there's nothing wrong with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...newspapers...don't seem to think so.\" I sit down on the bed, thinking about what had been written. Nicola sits down with me and puts her arm around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, don't listen to them. You have nothing to be ashamed. They do. They're the ones who see you flying around doing nothing but good, and they pick on you for your weight.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI glance at the Supergirl costume on my bed and smile. It's a little embarassing actually...the world seems to see me as this mighty invincible goddess...I'm just...me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not my fault it's happening.\" I say. \"I mean, I'm the one that's eating, but only because the hunger gets so painful. It's the planet...whatever gave me my powers has done this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well, maybe we should get you to a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...please, Nicola...they might suspect that I'm Supergirl. I'd have to leave if they did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"If you carry on gaining weight...it's going to get even more obvious that you're Supergirl...look, promise me you won't just leave me...I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile. \"I would never leave you. You're all I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug again, and then Nicola looks at her watch. \"Right, I'd better go or I'll be late - I'll see you later, Kara. Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Nicola!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm alone...I glance again at the Supergirl costume, and sigh. I can't stop overeating, but it'll only make me fatter...how much fatter will I get?</span></div></div>",

A burger or pizza?\" She said to herself,\" Burgers sound really good so ill make some of those\" she said as she started getting the ingredients for her meal.\" Time to eat\" she said as she got her burgers and went to the dining room and started eating.

Karas butt was pushing the fabric of her suit to its limit, now every time she walked her butt jiggled. Her breasts had started filling up with more weight in them and had begun sagging,\" there, that should do it\" she said as she pulled her suit over her belly. Then Kara heard a HUGE ripping sound, her suit now had a huge tear at one of her butt cheeks. Her face turned red,\" worth a shot, oh well guess I'll just go out there\" she said as she walked she found it a little harder in the suit since it was so tight on her big body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara arrived on the scene trying to keep her backside hidden so she wouldn't be the laughing stock of Metropolis. She found an attack squad of gorillas and attached them like they were ants. Her belly started to slow her down, then a gorilla jumped on her from behind and picked her up by the leg,\" I don't think so\" she said as she grabbed the gorilla by its leg and threw him into the water. Kara had to take a break, ever since she started gaining she's had to take breaks,\" well now that's taken care of....\",\" Supergirl is starting to look a little fat I see\" someone said behind her.\" Can't even fit in her suit anymore \",\" Grodd\" she said,\" now lets end this quick or you can surrender and be my lovely prisoner who becomes the thing she dreads....... Fat\" Grodd said as he challenged Kara to a fight.\" Bring it on chimp\" she said. Grodd took the first strike and rammed straight into Kara, she went flying,\" ok my turn\" she said as she dashed back and landed two punches on the gorilla before getting tired again,\" awwww is supergirl too tired to fight\" Grodd said trash talking,\" I am supergirl I won't let you win\" she said as she flew at the speed of light towards Grodd and hit him in the face, but he caught her punch,\" How?\" Kara said, then Grodd punched her in the belly and it was all over.... Kara had lost to Gorilla Grodd.\" You thought you could beat me?! Hahaha time to take you to my home so will be my lovely prisoner\" he said as he picked up the female kryptonian and returned to gorilla city.</span></div></div>",

Not pausing, she raised a chubby hand to her mouth and took a giant bite out of the turkey drumstick she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting naked in bed, Wonder Woman had gone from svelte, sexy amazon to big, bloated whale. Her breasts, once double D's at least, were now twice the size and were spread apart by the dome of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thights likewise were twice as thick as before and jiggled with every microscopic movement she made. Thick cankles had formed long ago on her legs. Her flabby arms had developed enormous amounts of hang, almost like wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman's sausage like fingers reached over to the nightstand and grabbed a slice of cheesecake. Practially inhaling the tasty cake, Wonder woman moaned as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily the most impressive feature on her was her fat gut, now so large that it covered her privates and prevented her from seeing her own feet. Her belly button was lost among the folds of soft, squishy fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana hadn't taken the death of Superman well. Since Clark was killed by that bastard, Doomsday, she'd taken to fighting crime and food as comfort. By day she'd make criminals lives a living hell and by night she'd eat enough for a whole dinner party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining nearly two hundred pounds in fat hadn't stopped her from serving justice. Only last week she'd defeated Lex Luthor and Gorilla Grodd single handedly. She'd also beaten nearly to a pulp several corrupt business men who were stealing from factory workers pensions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still as strong as ever, but it was taking a toll on her endurance. She could kick the Hulk's butt but she couldn't run more than ten seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks ago, the Joker had been unfortunate enough to make a crack about \"Miss Piggy,\" for that the Joker was now being fitted with dentures to replace his missing teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Wonder Woman sat up and started to drink from a big jug of sugary punch. Tomorrow she'd clean the crumbs out of her bed. Her three hundred and fifty pound body made the bed creak. </span></div></div>",

When Diana stopped she noted now tight her costume felt as her breaths threaten to erupt from her chest, while her butt and gut stuck out between the armor.

In recent years, it had been a city of peril, of ruins and wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more and more heroes poured into the city, driving out the criminals, monsters, and madmen that had infested it, allowing the city to clean things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Paragon was a shining beacon to the world, a perfect example of what a city should be.  The villains were still around, but they were all driven underground, forced to work in secret.  Battles still raged daily, but the people felt safe to walk the streets again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis frustrated Paragon's criminal element to no end.  Add into that the occasional losers with unusual, near-uselss powers or technology that tried to get into their organizations, and you could understand their frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one 'loser,' in a hidden laboratory deep underneath the city, wouldn't tolerate being treated as such.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those fools...\" grumbled the skinny, emaciated man in the labcoat as he tinkered with the shimmering, golden box that floated in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't understand my greatness.  This device will effectively eliminate half the hero population!  All I need to do is hit one woman with this, and she'll become so ravenously hungry that all she'll be interested in is eating eating and eating!  She'll also get fat three times as quick, becoming an immobile blob in days!  And best of all, this effect spreads to other women at the slightest touch!  All the superheroines in Paragon will be fat masses, and there won't be a thing the heroes can do about it!

Bella was annoyed, but used to it--the envy and admiration came with beauty.  And beauty was her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually an effective deterrant to crime.  This had surprised her.  She'd moved to Paragon City, five years ago, to find work as a model.  She had been enthusiastically signed, of course, but fired again almost as quickly.  She was tall and slender, with a perfect waist, butt, breasts, lips, hair--she seemed to have strolled out of a Mucha painting, only with the slimness that is so fetishized in the modern world.  Everything about her, taken separately, seemed to demand to be objectified, but when she took her turn on the catwalk or in front of the camera, her beauty seemed to flash out from her eyes like lightning and strike the photographers, the fashionistas, the oglers.  They could DO nothing with it--could not possess it, could not package it.  Rather, it possessed them, and they could only stare like dead men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried to look uglier for a while--but smearing the lipstick looked sensuous on that mouth; mussing her hair made it look alluringly tousled; covering up looked coy or classy, and her pose always had the same lightning-bolt effect on men.  One magazine after another fired or refused to hire her, and, in the end, she had nowhere to turn, but the Academy, where, as we all know, the second-best superheroes--those with somewhat more...offbeat powers than flight or strength or invisibility are trained by some of the more eccentric and mysterious of the superhero populace.  After graduating, she took the name Freya, after the Norse Goddess of love and beauty (she was hardly gifted with originality in anything besides her beauty), and began fighting crime as well as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been about a year ago.  She was still self-conscious about her beauty when she walked down the street, as other people are of a deformity, but making friends and rooming with other superheroes did much to lessen her feeling of freakishness which had not gone away even in the world of modeling.  She--the most beautiful woman in the world--had been unable to meet men, for they would only gape at her, and lose the power of speech.  Her roommates, Blur and Lantern, often commiserated with her, though one frequently had dates, and the other a fiancee.  It wasn't fair, she thought, as she walked down the street--all eyes on her.  Those other women--the ones who stared at her with hatred--could go to hell, if they thought this was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patrolled, dutifully, during the day.  It didn't work as well at night, when whatever villain she was after couldn't see her to be stunned by her.  It was just as well.  She didn't have the luxury of an alter-ego, as a few of the stranger superheroes apparently did.  \"Bella\" and \"Freya\" were interchangeable in the tabloids, which never had anything very juicy to report about her, unless they were lying.  She was, after all, perfect.  Even her crime-fighting career had been a moderate success so far.  She had managed to arrest a gang of three men (who were, ironically, in the process of raping someone), and, even, single-handedly stopped a supervillain who was, after all, as vulnerable as any other man in THAT way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thinking of none of this--save her loneliness--as she walked down Thomas Street, past the garage and into the shadier part of town.  \"These damn ugly cows,\" she muttered, encountering more disapproving looks.  \"Do they really think I'm after their men?  Even if I could get a man, I wouldn't go after...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion.  Underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplosions were not her thing.  She could tackle people, provided they could see her.  But Lantern or Blur's powers would have been much more well-suited.  This was their beat too, of course, but the two of them, Bella remembered as she reached for her cell phone, were gone for the day--Lantern with her fiancee, and Blur to her mother's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit.\"  Smoke came from a subway entrance nearby.  Bella bit her perfect lower lip and pulled down on her summer dress.  This could get ugly.</span></div></div>",

No time to waver.  There was time to push past the flocks of frightened people who issued from the metro and stared at her like she was crazy.  No time to be afraid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, not until she was in the metro.  She raced toward the source of the smoke, inhaling prayers and exhaling the phrase, \"Stupid Bella, Stupid Bella...\"  She really could get killed.  A piece of debris, landing on her, would smash her as surely as it would any normal-looking woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes adjusted and watered as they searched for the source of smoke.  She coughed.  Then--she could almost swear it--she heard...voices?  She forced another cough down and listened again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices.  Someone was trapped, all right.  Somewhere.  Sounded like they were--\"Oh shit!\"--they were on the other side of the tracks, weren't they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to hesitate.  She took a deep breath and prayed, prayed, prayed, jumped lightly in her yellow summer dress into the trench, prayed, prayed, ran, prayed, prayed, climbed up the other side.  Coughed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListened again.  Yes.  Voices rose and fell, as if in conversation, coming from...aha.  Only a few meters away, there was a door, which had been partly blown open in the blast.  She ran to it, swallowing down her brain's protest of \"Stupid, stupid, stupid.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were corridors behind the door, as if in a hospital.  The smoke was here as well, but the voices were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices of the LOST.  She nearly walked into the three forms that squatted over the pieces of what had once been a man, talking pleasantly--dinnertime conversation.  She stopped and stared, transfixed by their hideous faces as they, looking up at her, were transfixed by her unearthly beauty.  She began, tremblingly, to move despite her horror.  They had no such freedom.  They were, at least, male LOST.  Taking out her cell phone, Bella dialed the first superhero's number she could find.  Shitshitshitshit.  No dial tone.  Of course, Bella.  Now what?  Oh god, they were hideous.  Now what?  If she even turned away for a moment, they might snap out of it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bright flash.  Another explosion.  Bella screamed, and she was knocked off her feet by light.  She sat up, shaking her head, and while she was still shaking with fear, she felt something else as well...something quite strange.  She could feel the light still, all over her, though she could not see it.  Her body felt warm as she stood up to leave, and she could not shake the feeling that something was different.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The LOST still stared up at Bella, still awed by her beauty.  But a queer expression was coming over their--faces?--as well.  It was one of...interest?  Why were they watching her as if there was something strange about her now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her bare, scraped, slender feet and legs, her torn summer dress draped over her breasts and poetic waist.  Nothing here seemed out of order.  Not to her eye.  But, now that you mentioned it, she did feel rather...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OoOoOOh,\" she suddenly cried, leaning against a wall to prevent a second fall.  There was no pain, but the warmth she felt over her body was increasing, and it was as though all of her muscles were twitching rapidly.  She glared at the LOST.  \"What did you...?\"  Then, suddenly, to her horror, and in a way that certainly did not suit a superheroine...she began to giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could NOT help it.  And she was glad none of her colleagues was there to see it.  The twitching in her sides, in her--breasts?--were there muscles there?--in her thighs and...and...everywhere, was unbearable.  \"Ahhahahaheeheehehheh..\"  She began to collapse, still leaning against the wall, and as she clutched her sides, she realized something was very, very wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like feeling someone else's stomach.  Her fingers felt--rather than the expected toned muscles beneath the dress--small rolls of excess flesh.  She instantly withdrew her hands in shock, and looked down.  As she did so, she noticed that her chin, disconcertingly, rubbed against itself.  She also saw that her breasts had swollen to twice their size.  And behind them, slowly, a heaviness grew, and she watched in horror and fascination as a belly--so alien to her!--rose behind them like a yellow sun behind mountains.  Her stomach and chest were continually expanding as though she could not stop breathing in, exhale though she might.  In an entirely new mode of panic (though still unable to quell the giggling fits that accompanied multiplying fat cells), she felt her face.  It now possessed a triple chin, and not even a trace of the once-austere cheekbones.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaughing past all control, she looked at the LOST who now looked--if it were possible for spooks to be spooked--horrified.  \"K-killl m--\"  She began to say, but was suddenly overwhelmed with a real, sharp pain, and aware of the fact that she could no longer breathe. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRealizing her bulk was now straining the limits of her little yellow dress, she swung her arms (flab now hanging off them) behind her to her imprisoned back, and desperately grappled with the zipper for relief.  But her expanding body did not wait for her clumsy, fat fingers, and, suddenly, --Shhhrriipppp--the cute little sun-dress was demolished by her widening ass and bursting tummy, and hung in yellow ribbons between folds of fat.  Bella cried out, as though in labor, then lost consciousness.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was awakened, very shortly thereafter, by a sharp tooth entering her right flank.  Grunting, she sat up, gasped and bellowed.  The LOST one, suddenly overawed, backed away quickly as Bella stood to her feet with less difficulty than she would have anticipated.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe 250-pound woman bellowed again, like an animal, then, coming to her senses, cried out, \"YOU!  YOU did this to me!\"  The LOST cowered before her--this time, not before a stunning beauty, but rather as before a more primitive, shapeless, nature-goddess of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy God, a part of her thought.  Are they actually afraid of me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a threatening step toward the crouching shapes, to see.  They were, indeed, afraid of this unpredictable and suddenly monstrous woman, but rather than running away, they sprang on her like cornered animals.  Just fantastic, part of her thought, as one fastened itself to a new fold of flesh on her side, and another began to claw at her back.  Now I am nude, obese, and fighting off ghouls in a subway.  Good move, Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the larger part of her was incensed, as only a goddess can be.  \"How DARE you?\" she screamed, despite realizing that she had, only moments before, ASKED them to kill her.  She found--the surprise of it would sink in later--that she could move quite freely, despite her new body, and in a rage she picked up two of the LOST, and hurled them against the wall.  And suddenly, despite her bulk, she felt marvelous; euphoric--if still wrathful.  Was it--was it adrenaline, this new strength that filled her body as surely as the warmth and fat had?  She turned on the remaining member of the LOST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what you have done to me, creature\"--she spoke in a husky, dangerous whisper--\"For what you have done to me, I will hunt down you and your kind.  I will destroy every last one of you.\"  The ghoul's face contracted in what--possibly--was relief at the mercy shown to messengers.  It turned to scamper away, but was seized by its leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say,\" laughed the goddess, \"I didn't say I was going to let you warn them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had been on the street above, in a rare silent moment, you might have heard the faint yet bloodcurdling cry of a ghoul being torn apart.  If you had waited on that same street until nightfall, you would have seen emerge, as inconspicuously as possible, a rather obese woman with a construction-site tarp pulled about her naked form for modesty's sake.  But if you had approached the woman to ask her what in heaven's name she was doing, you would have been struck, like lightning, by the wild beauty of her eyes and tousled hair, the merciless grimace of a full mouth and clenched, perfect teeth, and--probably--by a plump, bloodstained fist jutting out from between the folds of tarp.  \"I'm doing my job,\" you would have heard a husky, yet alluring voice shout, as you coughed and wheezed.  Then, a little further off, you would have, possibly, heard giggles and sobs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's been beautiful her whole life.  This will build character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesca, sitting on the sofa of the living room, looked incensed and scandalized.  \"Madonna, Fay-leese, how you can say that?  It is a gran tragedy!  She was soooo beautiful, an' now!\"  Tears filled the empathetic Sicilian's eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh,\" returned Felicity.  \"She's fat, but she's not deaf, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sleeping,\" said Francesca.  \"Is very sad.  Maybe we help her loose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can, but only if she wants us to.  I can offer to run with her in the mornings, but I think right now is too soon.  I think she's still pretty sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can' jus' say nothing.  Madonna!  Act like everything is just normal?  The poor girl!  We gotta talk to her.\"  Francesca, known as \"Lantern\" in the superhero community, was growing progressively darker as the night wore on, and Felicity knew what that meant.  Francesca's moods, which ranged from euphoric to deeply depressed, usually corresponded with her power, the ability to absorb or reflect light.  She was, essentially, at 23-year-old mood ring.  At the moment, her hair was jet black, and her skin looked deeply tanned, almost African.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lantern, it's too soon to help her find solutions.  It happened like two days ago.  Let her grieve for a bit.  I've been a few pounds overweight myself before, and it wasn't terrible...I just had to learn to be disciplined and rely on mys--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fay-leese!  It's notta the same thing at all, an' you know that!\"  Remembering herself, this time, Lantern quieted down.  \"She gain what? Sixty-five kilo--sorry, hundred fifty pounds?  In less than a minute, an' you think that a normal?  None o' her clothes fit no more!  None!  An' you say discipline!  What would you really do if that was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity (called Blur because of her powers of speed) pursed her thin lips uncomfortably.  Fine.  She'd never admitted it when the girl still had a perfect figure, but she'd always been a bit jealous of Bella.  Francesca seemed to be the only one who never was--Francesca, who, while pretty, was neither as thin or as gorgeous as either of them.  And Francesca was probably right.  \"Shit,\" said Felicity.  \"Yeah, you're probably right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Course I'm right.\"  Large, black eyes flashed with anger.  The negative emotions were beginning to come on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right,\" sighed Felicity, standing up, and turning off the television which had provided some level of camouflage to their conversation.  Let's go check on the girl.  You realize we're probably only waking her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, she need us.  She need somebody.\"  They walked down the hallway to Bella's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity raised her fist hesitated a moment before knocking, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've been talking about me,\" came a muffled voice from behind the door.  It still surprised both girls how rich the voice now sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we have,\" said Felicity.  \"Can we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open.  Both girls, if they didn't gasp, at least hesitated a moment, a bit stunned.  They had expected to find their roommate lying in bed, surrounded by tissues, or with the covers pulled over her head and ample body.  They'd expected her eyes to be puffier than even the excess weight had made them, and her hair to be disarranged, without a trace of makeup.  So what they saw, understandably, took them by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir roommate, Bella, was standing up, on her two legs, each--now--as thick around as her entire body had been three days before.  They were surprised, first, that she was wearing boots, which had a slight heel and were laced up, but looked hardy enough for any outdoor hike.  Above these, her exquisitely tanned but huge legs were bare, up until a kind of black leotard, which covered her bulging upper thighs, butt, tummy and prodigious breasts, ending at her neck.  Painted over the leotard, stretched over her belly and breasts, was the image--a logo--of a sun shining.  Her full face--still oddly beautiful and full of energy, like the faces in a Rubens painting, or a heavier version of Mucha's \"Ivy,\" was made up, and she was, at the moment, gathering her golden ringlets from around her golden shoulders, and putting it up in a ponytail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freya!\" exclaimed Francesca.  What you wearing?  What-a-you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Freya anymore,\" said Bella, grimly checking herself, just for a moment, in the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are you doing?  And what are you wearing?\" asked Felicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my new costume,\" chirped Bella, in a voice that approached cheerfulness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice,\" said Felicity, tentatively.  \"Umm...why are you wearing it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you don't patrol at night.  You never did, even when you...had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have new powers now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?\" Felicity's voice sounded worried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Bella straightened her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella turned from the mirror, and walked up to Felicity, who backed away unconsciously.  Bella got closer, until she was in Felicity's face, her belly touching Felicity's toned abs.  \"To get really annoyed at skinny little bitches who think being fat builds character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felicity could back away, she felt herself being lifted--easily--by the former beauty goddess, scraping past belly and breasts, until she was held over Bella's head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freya, put her down!\" screamed Lantern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed.  \"My name's not Freya anymore, Francesca!  You can call me the Amazon.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Felicity felt herself tossed lightly into Bella's bed, as the Amazon slammed the door behind her.  She heard Francesca cry out, \"Bella, eh, come back!  Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Fran,\" came Bella's voice, further away.  \"I have a new mission now.  I've finally found my place.\"  And the Amazon was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Fay-leese?\" cried Lantern, coming to the side of the bed, where the girl was slowly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" answered Felicity.  Might have pulled something, but I'm okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should follow her, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

A large, dark form, with bare legs, arms, and blonde hair made its way down Thompson, toward the metro, toward the last place she had seen the LOST.  Hopefully, she thought, the few people loitering on the street would not recognize her as the same superheroine.  Hopefully there would be no pity or attention paid her.  If she had her way, she would not often be above ground, anyway.  There was a war to wage down there, in the sewers, metro systems, in the dark places of the earth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rounded a corner.  She was in sight of the metro station.  It wasn't that she wanted revenge.  Well, maybe it was.  Be that as it may, she had always been...unsure about her status as a superhero before.  She had not been sure what her \"mission\" was, or how well her powers complemented her vocation.  But now, it all fit.  She had come to the city, trained as a hero, lost her figure and her beauty because...because it was her destiny to destroy the LOST.  It of course helped that the vampiric creeps had apparently rigged up a machine that had caused her to gain (what was at last count) 175 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever their motives behind doing it, though, they had, apparently, not foreseen the superhuman strength and agility that would come with the weight gain.  She wondered how much of her sizeable body was made up of excess fat, and how much was pure muscle mass.  She was in the subway now, and over the pathetic bars that were designed to keep pedestrians out.  As if the threat of being eaten by the LOST was not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made for the alley where it had all gone down.  She didn't expect to find any more LOST there, but where else was there to start?  At the moment, most in the city were even afraid to go out at night because of their activity.  Once she rid the metropolis of them, then she, who had been so disliked while she was beautiful, would be beloved by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gosh.  She stopped.  But it was creepy down here.  Really creepy.  She looked around and felt, despite her size, suddenly very small.  She'd planned to go down there like a primordial goddess of light expelling the darkness from beneath the earth, but at the moment she felt like nothing more than a fat girl underground.  In a silly outfit, to boot.  There was that creepy passage, up ahead.  Ugh.  Her steps slowed, and she realized that thundering through the hallway--or anywhere--was probably not the best idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, the door to the passage was now bolted shut.  Oh well.  We tried, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, she heard a sound on the other side of the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doorbell rang.  Dr. Gerard, one of the many biologists specializing in metahuman sciences in Paragon City, looked up from a book that even he found boring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one in the morning,\" he mused, rubbing the back of his neck as he sat up.  He walked to the kitchen pantry of his house, which doubled as a security station, and looked in the monitor.  \"Hmm...wow, rather...largeish...woman at the door.  Don't recognize her.  Better bring the gun, just in case.  One never knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was technically summer, but the air was still cool at night, and the woman, to his surprise, had nothing more on than a swimsuit-shaped leotard and boots.  She looked oddly familiar, and--despite her weight--oddly beautiful as well.  My god, what eyes.  How strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, miss?\" he asked, after staring for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dr. Gerard,\" said the young woman, her ample cheeks turning slightly red.  \"Do you mind if I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I'm sorry ma'am, but I don't just let strange women...wait, do I know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Gerard!\"  The girl was visibly distressed.  He looked at her again.  Those amber-colored eyes, the golden ringlets, the perfect teeth and lips, it couldn't be, but it couldn't not be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella?  Oh my gosh, Bella Hauge?  What--what happened, girl?  Come in, come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Bella was drinking tea, and, despite herself--with increased weight, it seems, really did come increased appetite--eating most of a tray of ginger cookies Dr. Gerard had set out for her.  He had been her favorite professor at the Academy, though they had only, until now, communicated by e-mail due to the odd affect her powers once had on all males.  She had always harbored a secret crush on the man, who was only just into his forties and had all his hair, unlike most of the professors at her old school.  She tried to sound intelligent and brave, as they had their first face-to-face interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so, after that,\" she concluded, \"I went back home, bought this costume online, and I really think it is my destiny to take on the LOST.  And to repay them for what they did to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor seemed lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, I changed my name to The Amazon.  Because I'm strong now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor still didn't answer.  He stared, absent-mindedly, down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was wondering if you could help me, because you've always known more about the LOST than most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's jaw tightened, as if he was thinking deeply about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Gerard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, my dear!  Just...lost in thought, like we absent-minded professors tend to be.  Where did you say this place was, that you saw the LOST?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella patiently repeated the description of the laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what...did the man look like, who you saw them attacking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, I am not so sure that your...vendetta against the LOST is well-founded,\" said Dr. Gerard, after a moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was not surprised.  \"Look, Dr. Gerard, I really appreciate your concern.  But I need to do this.  I really...for the first time, I feel like I know what I'm supposed to do as a superhero.  It's...it's all I have...now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, she thought.  I'm crying.  If I were still Freya it would look cute, but who wants to see a whale like me crying in his office.  I wish my stomach and damn CHIN would not jiggle like that every time I sob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said was, \"...I--I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was shocked to feel his hand--surprisingly rough--stroking the tears back from her cheek.  And his voice--surprisingly soft--soothing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bella...Bella...look at me.  Don't cry.\"  With a start, she looked up, and saw he was right next to her.  My God, had he always been that cute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I meant,\" he said, \"was that your vendetta is not justifiable, because, one, the LOST didn't take everything from you at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no?  Well, look at me, Dr. Gerard, I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice shook a bit, with passion, \"--YOU are every inch as beautiful as you ever were.  Never has a more beautiful woman crossed this threshold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you JOKING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any IDEA,\" he said, \"how hard it is to keep from kissing you right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second of all,\" he said, \"I am not so sure it WAS the LOST who did this to you.  There was a man I knew, who--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was his turn to be surprised, as she stood up, pressing all of her against him, filling his mouth with hers.  Maybe it was stupid, they both thought, but I need this right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanity kicked in before they consummated anything (and indeed, her costume was incredibly difficult to get off, unlike her hair-band), and for a moment, they lay on the floor of his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste like ginger cookies,\" he said, still dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you taste like science,\" she responded.  \"Hey, what was it you started to say before?  About the man you knew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's expression suddenly changed.  \"Bella, you'd better sit down.\"  His face was conflicted, as if he was struggling against something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...had a friend,\" he began, \"and we worked on some projects together...projects having to do with...the metabolism of metahumans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had her full attention now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had very...interesting plans, I guess you might say.  Both of us were a little obsessive about our subject.  As you have realized by this point, we both preferred the...rounder, softer kind of figure on a woman, and we were...disappointed that so many superheroines were...well, far from our ideal.  It may have been wrong, but we aimed to change that.  After a while, I, however, was hired by the Academy.  I got a new lab, and, increasingly, the work that Abraham--that was his name--and I were doing, was pushed to the side.  He called me a traitor, and when I got a new lab with my Academy paycheck, and started to work on my own...he swore never to work with me again.  He was, by that point, on his way to discovering some...ray...that causes fat cells to multiply in the female body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" was all Bella could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I stopped checking in on him at our subterranean lab, after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  This was more than she could have thought possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...so...you're an expert on THIS?\"  She dug her hands into her belly, pulling at two fistfuls of flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem so,\" said Dr. Gerard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,\" she said, calmly, \"you can...you can help me get back to...to normal, then, can't you?  I mean, you can find a way to reverse it, if anyone can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up.  \"Bella.  I certainly could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much!\" she almost screamed in relief.  \"Oh, I'm so glad I came to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an odd look on his face for a moment, but he smiled all the same.  \"Just...let's go to MY lab.  I'll fix you up with the right pills.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was beaming.  \"Oh, thank you so much, Doctor.\"  She walked ahead of him, down the corridor of the house.  Thank God.  It was all going to be fine.  Everything was going to be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, the sound of a stun gun.  Everything.  Goes.  Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, feeling began to come back into her arms and legs, and she managed to stand, holding on to the table next to her at first, then, like a toddler, one step at a time, she approached the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, she realized, even more beautiful than she had been previously, despite the paleness that attended her unconsciousness.  How had he done it?  She turned her head, searching for any sign of her previous plumpness, but nothing of the sort was to be found--where there had been a double chin and swollen cheeks, there was now a slender neck, visible cheekbones...it was as though her more fleshy self had all been a dream, and the fat had simply melted off in her sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked from one side to the other, then in the corners of the room for any hidden cameras, and she easily slipped off the black suit with its symbol which now had little meaning for her.  Here, at last, was her body--gloriously trim and yet voluptuous...and without so much as a stretch mark.  Her tummy was tight, her breasts, legs and buttocks, firm and toned, with just the right amount of softness.  Her skin, she noticed, was softer than it had ever been before--almost tender--and it seemed to glow pink in the light, rather than tan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed, suddenly, threw the suit back on--now large enough for two of her--and ran out the door into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, suddenly, she stopped.  Before her, Professor Gerard stood, staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring, like every man stared, at her \"perfect\" body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped they would still be able to communicate, like they had before--the night before, when there had been ginger cookies and witty conversation and love.  She tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Gerard, look!  I'm back to my old self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared.  Her heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared.  Fighting back tears, she walked up to him, and kissed him, long and hard.  He didn't respond, comatose on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the house, clutching her clothes tightly about her in daylight, Bella walked right into a slightly rounder girl in the shadows--or, at least, a girl who seemed to gather shadows around her, even in the middle of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey, watch where you going, Miss!  Can't you see I'm standin' right he--Bella?  Madonna, Bella, is that you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francesca!  What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We follow you, Blur and me.  We figure you are all right because you at Dr. Gerard's house, but we wanna make sure, so we take it in shifts to stand guard here.  Bella, you thin again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know!\" said Bella, trying to sound more enthusiastic than she felt.  \"I can't believe it.  Dr. Gerard did it...somehow.  I'm not sure how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask...oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he no talk-y.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make funna my accent jus' now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella had forgotten how Francesca--Lantern--got when she was in her dark mood.  \"Let's go on back to the house, huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesca complied.  \"You make fun o' me, Bella.  Nobody take me serious.  Also, now I'm the fat one again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great.  She had heard this speech before.  There was no reasoning with Lantern during either stage of her energy cycle.  She sucked the positive energy out of the atmosphere immediately around her during the first phase, looked, talked, and was powerless like, any human being during the second phase, and was manically happy and--literally--radiant during the third--shooting energy at anyone and everyone.  Bella held her arm, which felt a little like dry ice, as they walked together down the street and past the metro that had started it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francesca...speaking with authority as someone who actually WAS fat...there is NOTHING wrong with your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesca, of course, didn't listen, and continued to complain--though she couldn't have been more than 145 pounds, thought Bella--that she was, in fact, monstrous compared to her two roommates, and that she can just tell that her fiance, Jack is turned off by it, and what if she keeps putting on weight and ends up completely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella looked around as they talked.  More glares from other women.  More stares from men.  For some reason it bothered her more, now, the effect her stupid powers had.  And she thought of Dr. Gerard.  How he had held her.  How he had kissed her.  How he hadn't cared that she was...was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat.  Ev'ry day, I jus' feel fatter,\" Francesca was crying, now.  Soon, Bella knew, the negative part of the cycle would be over, and the girl would be laughing and thoughtful again.  Meanwhile, Lantern had Jack, and who did Bella have?  What boy, anywhere, in the world, was capable of having a relationship with her?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the days and weeks that followed, even as she found satisfaction in looking at the pink, taut skin of her new/old body, and trying on cute outfits at department stores...she often found herself touching her lips, and holding her own arms, and missing the--for her, new--feeling of being embraced by a man.  What was the use of a perfect body if there was no one to hold it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into her room on a sunny, but depressing day, worn out from the isolation which cut into her like a cold win, beautiful Bella looked in her dresser mirror where she had once seen an angry, massive version of herself--but one capable of being loved--and she came to a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna die alone,\" she said to herself.  \"Unless something changes, I'm gonna die alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

That was good to know.  Though she didn't anticipate coming underground again anytime soon.  Soon, though, she would be far enough away from them that they could no longer see her clearly, and her spell would lose its effect.  Perhaps her pheromones would linger in the air, for a while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also, however, felt something warm and active lingering deep within her, as though a fire had settled in her stomach.  It felt very odd, but not unpleasant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay back,\" she shouted at the ghouls down the corridor, in what her roommates had once termed \"The goddess voice.\"  She could no longer see them.  That made her nervous.  She was out in the metro tunnel now, which was full of smoke, but also (comparatively) of light.  They probably, at least, would not dare to come out here during the day, but she did not want to take chances.  Turning on the heels of her now-badly-scraped and filthy feet, she ran.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hate this city, she thought, as she emerged from the tunnel, squinting green eyes, and noticing that, as usual, men within a ten-foot radius were staring at her, women frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" she mumbled.  \"My feet are bleeding and black with dirt, nails broken, my dress is torn, and my hair is in a ponytail, for God's sake.\"  What she said aloud was, \"Uh...citizens...has anyone seen my shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of searching (they were her favorite pair), the heels were recovered, and she walked back toward her apartment, the warm glow still crackling inside her.  Suddenly, she realized she was terribly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing in the fridge, she thought.  Nothing good, anyway.  Just vegetables, fruit, a few flavor ices.  Milk.  She would have to go grocery shopping, she realized with dismay.  She felt so hungry she was trembling, a little, as she walked up her street now, which was wickedly slanted.  And sitting there--on her own front porch--she suddenly noticed a young man.  He looked up at her, expectantly, in the midst of fidgeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Bella Hauge?\" he asked, looking up.  He was olive-skinned and hairy, but had elegant cheekbones and long, graceful limbs, like her.  He was not handsome--not conventionally, anyway, but there was a beauty about him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" said Bella.  \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman O' Lymp,\" said the man, grinning a bit and looking her in the eye.  \"I wrote you on craigslist yesterday.  Tried to call, but it went to voicemail.  Are you still interviewing roommates?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was dumbstruck, because Herman didn't seem to be.  Every man--EVERY man--with whom she had ever attempted conversation--save for her own father--every man, since she had turned fourteen--had been unable to utter more than a few coherent syllables in her presence.  But this man had looked her in the eyes and answered, with perfect poise, \"I wrote you on craigslist.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit,\" she said, \"I'm--I'm sorry, I totally forgot.  Hold on...uh...come in.  She fidgeted with her keys.  Sorry, what was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman,\" said Herman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bella.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" said Herman, smiling again.  Shoot, she looked like an idiot.  But a man was talking to her!  Actually...wow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me show you around.  This is the living room, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech was suddenly interrupted by a terrific noise, issuing--to her horror--from inside her stomach.  It had tried, hard, to be patient, but it could not endure any longer without nourishment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit--I mean, uh--excuse me, I'm just really, really hungry all of a sudden.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  So you're mortal, after all?\" he said, graciously dismissive.  \"Are utilities included in the price?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, except for--\"  Again, there was a loud growl, and she felt suddenly that she was about to pass out.  \"I'm so sorry, Herman, um...look, would you be okay having this interview for dinner--I mean, over--dinner?\"  She realized to her horror that she was asking him on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to suggest that,\" said Herman.  \"I'm pretty hungry as well, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, great.  Um...I'm just going to go change out of this.\"  She showed him the frayed end of her dress.  \"And wash off a bit.  Just feel free to look around while I do.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly ran to her room.  What was wrong with her?  More importantly, was there anything--anything at all--in her room to eat?  She ransacked her portmanteau, her stomach crying like a baby all the while.  This had never, ever happened.  In a bottom drawer, mercifully, she came across her salvation in the form of a few oatmeal cookies, which trembled in her hands as she crammed them into her mouth.  The acidic complaints in her stomach turned--for just a brief moment--back into the warm glow, which spread through her body.  It felt--wonderful.  She stripped off her dress, and looked--approvingly for a moment--at her golden skin and hair in the mirror.  Her mother had been Italian, and her father, Norwegian-by-way-of-Minnesota, and the most desirable genetic traits of each race had blended beautifully to produce blonde ringlets, a honey-colored complexion, and a perfect body that was slender without looking barren.  She had a single freckle on her shoulder, perfect lips, and eyes which were, at some times, piercing green, and at others, the color of coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelax, Bella, she thought.  How could he not love this?  She told herself she wasn't being vain, just honest.  It was her power, after all...which didn't seem to work on him.  That was very, very strange.  She stopped thinking to wash her feet in the bathtub, arrange her hair, and pull on her favorite pair of jeans--low-cut, slender.  Over her well-filled bra she slipped a lovely little green shirt that did not quite fall to her navel.  She examined herself again, fastening earrings, but was disturbed, again, by another slight groan from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was indignant.  \"I just gave you some food,\" she said, aloud, looking down at her perfect navel.  \"And I let you out.  You have to behave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of her room, to find Herman looking at a few of the pictures on the wall, and straightening them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" he said, looking at her, appreciatively but guardedly.  \"Where would you like to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" she shrugged.  Her stomach grumbled at this, and she almost slapped it.</span></div></div>",

You don't LOOK Italian.\"  Herman stirred his coffee, and looked her in the eyes--again!--it was almost impertinent the way he did that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, staring down at the single bran muffin she had opted to buy.  She had been the one who suggested the bakery.  Why?  It was this damn man who had thrown her off her guard.  There was nothing even particularly attractive about him, other than the stormy grey eyes and curly black hair.  His nose was too large, and he was, she thought, much too hairy and skinny.  Yet she hadn't been able to focus since she'd seen him, sitting on her doorstep, straightening her flower pots and grinning saucily up at her.  Though maybe it wasn't entirely his fault.  The events of the day had not exactly been typical.  And the hunger she felt, it was not exactly typical, either.  Huh.  Shoot, she realized.  She should say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he said, beating her to the punch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" she said.  \"Sorry.  I've had a bizarre day.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you care to share?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered at the thought of the LOST.  \"No, not especially,\" she said.  \"I'd rather not talk about it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I always prefer to talk about shallow things, anyway.\"  He grinned with half of his mouth, and fixed the collar of his small shirt.  How was he so fidgety, but so confident at once?  \"So...take two.  Your name is Bella.  But you don't look Italian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly don't look Irish, Mr. O'Lymp.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever say I was?\"  He flipped half of his collar up again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ara--Middle Eastern?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" he said, very loudly.  A couple at the next table looked over.  \"Sorry,\" he said to them.  \"No, Bella, Bella, I'm Greek!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit embarrassed, at first of her faux pas, but even moreso because of this dark stranger's behavior.  Maybe he wouldn't be an ideal housemate although, admittedly...she was attracted to him.  She felt her stomach rumble, and decided to put him on the defensive before he could hear it.  \"Huh.  Weird last name for a Greek--O'Lymp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman shrugged.  \"Yeah, well...weirder for a Turk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella could feel her stomach begin to rumble again, and she slurped some coffee in an attempt to cover the noise.  She wanted to annhilate that muffin stump (it mocked her!), but she did not want to eat faster than Herman.  It was agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, Herman,\" her teeth chattered, as she began to shake, she hoped, imperceptibly, \"So, Herman, do you think you could really put up with living with THREE girls?  That's a lot of drama.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Greeks invented drama,\" he said, eyes shining, pleased with himself.  \"You should see how it is in my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, relaxing a bit.  \"Well, that's good.\"  Then, automatically, before her brain was aware of it, her hands stuffed the rest of the muffin past her glossy lips and into the oblivion of her mouth and stomach.  What the hell?  She thought.  Nice, Bella.  Now he'll think you're a--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\"  Herman crowed, and to Bella's mortification, the occupants of three tables looked at them--him, juggling rolled-up straw papers, and her with a mouth full of bran muffin.  \"It's so refreshing when a pretty girl isn't afraid to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes, she had heard this from too many guys.  'It's nice when a pretty girl isn't afraid to eat, provided she stays unrealistically thin all of her life.'  There's the rub.  She swallowed, took a sip of coffee, and started to say so, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was distracted from even the boy in front of her.  It was a GOOD muffin.  It was the best muffin, in fact, that she had ever tasted.  The warmth within her surged and she had to stop herself from groaning in pleasure.  She was still so hungry, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" asked Herman.  This was, she realized, probably the weirdest \"date\" the poor boy had ever been on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just haven't eaten all day,\" she lied.  \"Um, I'll be right back.\"  She rose, thanking God that the pastry counter and bathrooms were in another room of the bakery/coffee-shop.  As she strode toward the counter, she realized that she'd somehow given herself a wedgie.  Her pants felt strange, as well.  She would adjust that when she got to the bathroom, she thought.  Right now, she did not have the patience even to look down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista gave her an odd look.  \"Hey, up here,\" she said, impatiently.  \"One cookie, please.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, miss.\"  The barista--her name was Alaina--looked at her again.  \"Will there be anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since she asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.  Could I also get three cinnamon buns, two pieces of strawberry cheesecake, and, uh, four muffin tops.  To take home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlaina the barista charged Bella for the pastries and handed her the box.  Bella almost ran across the store, and into the bathroom.  Yes, she would share these with the roommates, of course, but...she needed to have just one or two muffin tops before resuming her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was full of saliva and her stomach full of groaning as she locked the bathroom door.  \"Now!\" she whispered to herself, in the mirror as she dug into the box, \"now for a muffin...top...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands froze in horror, as she caught sight of her midriff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans of the lovely blonde looking back at her were about to unsnap.  They held her thighs and waist tightly like an ambitious seatbelt and over them spilled--yes, spilled--a perfectly tanned excess of flesh, folded in the middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" she screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it a trick mirror?  Couldn't be, those were FOLDS of flesh.  How did that...she began to turn to survey the damage to her backside, when she caught a whiff of pastry from the box, and her belly shook with the growl of her stomach.  A stream of drool burst from her mouth, and suddenly, she lost all control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Five minutes later, Bella raised her sticky, powdered face from the pastry box.  \"Oh...oh, God...\"  she said, dreamily, eyes still closed.  She had always known she was beautiful.  But now she really felt it.  For the first time, she was tasting, digesting the beauty itself with which she was clothed.  The warm glow sang inside of her, a tune of many colors, as stomach, heart and lungs provided rhythm and harmony.  \"Oh, wow...\"  She had never liked being full before.  It had always made her feel uncomfortable.  Now, it felt right.  It all felt right, and beautiful, and she had a sense that, no matter what happened from here on out, everything in the world was right...everything was ordered, and surely, pleasure was at the center of the earth, of the universe, and nothing could ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her brain woke up, and realized that the other part was babbling.  It also realized that, every time she breathed in, harmonizing with the universe and what-not, she was hurting herself, somehow, as if there was a stitch in her side.  She opened her eyes, and began to steady herself as she stood.  Suddenly, she screamed, for someone's hand, on her right, reached past her, and touched the ground.  She had locked the door.  Had someone broken in?  The barista, perhaps?  But the hand was too plump to be Alaina's.  She looked behind her, and screamed again, seeing no one.  Someone must have come in, though, perhaps a meta-human with invisibility or teleportation, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right in there?\" came the real barista's voice, from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...fine...\" called Bella, staggering to her feet.  Her voice did not sound normal to her.  It sounded....larger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  My.  God,\" said the voice, now, as emerald eyes opened wide with astonishment and a full, full mouth, caked with powdered sugar, hung open.  Dimpled hands clasped full, round cheeks, which concealed any trace of once-austere cheekbones, and pulled at the chins that ran smoothly into a plump neck.  In the mirror, the hands of the fat, surprised-looking blonde with the powdery face did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  My.  God,\" said Bella again, as the hands tremblingly continued their descent into hell, green eyes following.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands grabbed two overripe and floppy grapefruit, which pushed mercilessly against the inside of the tiny green shirt.  The hands pulled them up, then let them drop again, against a belly which now hung entirely out of the shirt.  The hands reached below the swollen gut to unfasten a pair of too-tight jeans, but realized, tremblingly, that they were too late.  There was no button there any longer.  It had flown off into some dingy corner of the bathroom while the think in the mirror was filling its mouth, grunting in ecstasy.  The zipper had broken, as well.  The hands traveled downward, downward, as the heart of the ringleted whale-maid in the mirror correspondingly sank.  She thought of the Greek sailor in the next room, who could not now love her, ever.  Everything--everything--had betrayed her.  She did not turn to see her backside, but she could guess enough from the huge legs, which turned denim into spandex...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shape,\" the perfect pink tongue tapped against straight white teeth, barely above a whisper,\"A shape with shapeless body and the head of a woman...A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun...Is moving its slow thighs, while all about...  Oh God.  What is that thing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith effort--it was suddenly so hard to move!--she stepped toward the heavy shape in the mirror, which, of course, did the same, its stupid face, which might have been beautiful in another age, still covered with powder.  Bella bent down--as did the reflection, its belly folding into four neat ripples of golden flab--under the sink faucet, splashing her globular cheeks with water until sugar, honey, syrup, crumbs and makeup were washed out of her hair, out of every dimple, off every chin.  Bella again looked at the image in the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last...Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat girl in the mirror ran her fingers through the mass of wet golden hair, cleared tears and water from a Bella's puffed cheeks and bright eyes, and answered herself, soberly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.  \"Miss, are you all right?\"  Came the voice of Alaina.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bella Hauge--Freya--the most beautiful superheroine in Paragon City, was halfway down the metro stairs, her curls halfway into a ponytail, her heart halfway into her mouth, when she realized she was being stupid, not heroic.  She stopped on a landing between two flights of stairs, and looked up, out of the metro, to see if anyone was watching.  Long, tanned legs pivoted on perfectly-arched feet, and a small, bright yellow butterfly of a dress floated out of the subway as its owner tossed her hair back around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen stared and women glared at her as she walked back up Thomas Street, and she, as usual, ignored them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Freya!\" bleated a woman's voice.  She kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Freya!\" said the voice, more loudly than ever.  \"Aren't you supposed to be a superhero here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya turned around.  The voice belonged to a plumpish woman just past her prime, holding the hand of a man who was--like every other man on the street--watching Freya's perfect figure without the slightest interest in anything else.  The woman was dressed in a checkered black number, which was embarrassingly too tight, and she wore nice earrings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my type of thing,\" said Freya, dismissively.  \"Let the cops deal with it, or another superhero.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman let go of her awestruck husband's hand, and placed two balled-up hands on her sizeable hips.  \"So, Miss Freya--and that's a ridiculous name, by the way--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--It's Norse mythology--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it, now?  You're very well educated, I can see, so maybe you can tell me WHY I pay taxes so that a little hussy posing as a superhero can prance around, giving my husband a hard-on when he was taking ME out for our ten-year anniversary?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, not this.  Not again.  She tried to keep her anger in check.  She'd stopped feeling sorry for these petty older women a long time ago.  It was hard enough not being able to talk to a man without every woman hating you for making them feel bad about themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...I did stop the Evil Dr. Rupert from taking control of the city several months ago, actually,\" she said, ending on a slightly aloof note.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gee, I didn't hear about that on EVERY front page!  'Newsflash!  Sluttiest, laziest superheroine actually foils one crime!  Glad she finally did SOMETHING so we can use her little half-naked ass to sell more papers than Penthouse!'  Stop LOOKING, Kevin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor bespectacled Kevin, to his credit, managed to flex a neck muscle, but his eyes remained glued on Bella's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife continued, \"How did you manage to 'foil' the evil doctor's plan, anyway?  Did he groan it all out into your ear while you moaned back like the whore you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Bella's eyes smoldered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many of these criminals,\" she whispered, coolly now, \"how many criminals are behind bars now, swapping stories about tearing off that little yellow dress?  Maybe when they're not trying to break out of Guldhelm, they sketch maps of your cavernous--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You frumpy, old, dried out, FAT bitch!\" screamed Bella.  But the woman was clever.  She couldn't win any battle of words (what was she going to say, other than calling names?  'Your dress is too tight'?), and she couldn't strike her, so she did the one thing she could think of.  \"Come here, Kevin!\" she whispered seductively, and, drawing his poorly-shaven, pale chin towards hers, she kissed him, shoving her tongue into his mouth, where his lay, inert.  Her hands began to roam, over his shoulders, down his back...and, suddenly, she realized with some embarrassment, she felt a little bit attracted to the paralyzed man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off my husband!  Get off my husband!  Get off my husband, you stupid slutcow!  You get off him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's plump fist landed a blow in Bella's taut stomach, causing her to pull out of Kevin's mouth, drawing out their mingled saliva in a string as she doubled over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kicked her face, bloodying her nose.  \"You stay away from him!\"  The woman shook with rage and heartbreak.  \"You stay away, f**k you, or I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella stood up and, making sure the woman saw her laugh--though she didn't feel like laughing--she continued to walk up Thomas Street.  \"Go buy a new dress that actually fits,\" she yelled, when she was a safe distance away.  Hot tears came.  I am pathetic, she thought, ashamed to death of feeling, momentarily, turned on by a middle-aged man.  She wiped the blood from her nose with a bare fist, like a child.  She was twenty-five.  It had been her first kiss.</span></div></div>",

She didn't recognize the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\"  A man's voice on the other line.  It sounded slightly nasal, but confident.  \"Is this Bella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" she asked, annoyed at the breach in phone protocol.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Herman O'Lymp?\"  The voice sounded less confident now.  Was there a hint of a foreign accent there as well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, uh, e-mailed.  You have the ad for a roommate on craigslist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\"  She'd forgotten.  He was going to come by today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering if today was still fine for me to come see the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  I'm close by now, so I'll be right over.  432 Aiken, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat.  She had never lived in the same house with a man before, and the prospect of someone gaping at her as she came out of the shower, did her laundry, or, hell, sat in sweatpants watching the History Channel, did not please her in the least.  And what kind of a name was Herman O'Lymp?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even going to be able to show him around,\" she suddenly thought.  \"He'll just freeze and goggle, like all these other men...shit...\"  She forgot this, sometimes, on the phone and the Internet, where she was able to talk to men as any other woman would--provided she didn't post her picture or tell them who she was.  She had had a few Internet boyfriends--especially back in the days of dial-ups, when she was fourteen, and chat rooms seemed entirely novel.  But every time--through e-harmony, match.com, craigslist--every time she met them in person, all the personality they'd shown just drained out of them, and they stared.  \"How can he find out anything?\"  She picked up her cell phone.  \"I'd better tell him to come back when Blur or Lantern are--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.  Walking down the wooden hallway, she peered through the peephole (it was the only way, outside of TV, she could see what men were like before they saw her).  She saw curly black hair and a mass of eyebrows, and a huge nose.  Oh great.  It was the ugly ones that were smitten the hardest, usually.  She opened the door, noticing at once that he was not that ugly at all.  She addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman?  I'm sorry, but you probably want to come back later.  See, I have this power, and men can't usually talk with me easily.  Anyway, you have a great day, and come back tomorrow, if you'd like, or I can interview you over the phone, if you'd prefer.\"  There.  Polite enough.  But wait...the hairy man in front of her--who had, she noticed, finely sculpted features and lean muscles under a small, collared shirt and skinny jeans...had his mouth closed.  In fact, he was even looking behind her, into the house.  Then, he did something that no man, other than her father, had ever been able to do in her presence.  He spoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, think your nose is bleeding.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Bella gaped.  \"Um,\" she said.  It wasn't the nosebleed that broke the spell of her face, she knew.  She had tried all manner of disfigurements in the past, but they had either immediately healed, or made her look somehow more comely, if more pitiable.  \"You--you are talking to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.  I do believe that it's important to speak, dear girl, particularly during an interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you come in,\" forgetting to make her voice rise at the end of the question.  Now she was the one having trouble talking.  Also, she realized he was actually not so ugly at all.  And he had nice grey eyes.  Sailor's eyes, she thought.  Like in that song by Looking Glass.  \"No harbor was his home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the little house, and the man touched everything, straightening out magazines on the coffee table, smoothing out sheets on his prospective bed, walking up and down the stairs.  \"It's great.  It's really great,\" he kept saying.  He was attractive, all right, in an odd way, AND he was capable of actually talking to her--but he was annoying her, a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you sit down,\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you haven't offered yet,\" he smiled, his grey eye twinkling.  The strange thing was that though he was incredibly fidgety, he was possessed of an extraordinary cockiness and confidence that threw her off-guard.  Not that she needed much to throw her off-guard.  A man was TALKING to her!  Looking at her, breathing in the pheromones she apparently sent out, and talking to her like she was no one special.  She was suddenly aware of her own heartbeat.  But perhaps she could throw HIM off, as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she began, \"you possess a speed-related power of some kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you,\" he answered, \"possess keen powers of perception behind all that beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how to respond to this.  Was he trying to charm her?  \"Uhhh, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very fidgety.  And you got here so...fast.  Do you have...any other powers?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you were right about speed, and now we're on to other powers?  How do you know I have any powers at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you can TALK to me without drooling, she thought, but what she said was, \"Ordinary men don't typically volunteer to live with meta-women.  It feels...emasculating.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Herman.  \"Yes, I suppose it must be, for them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" said Bella, triumphantly.  \"See, you ARE a meta-human.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT,\" shot back Herman, sounding...insulted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're fine with moving here, even though you might feel...emasculated.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Herman, a bit excitedly.  \"Now we come to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to what?\"  She was feeling a little exasperated, now.  Was this what all men acted like, in person?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't offered me anything to drink.  Where I come from, that's bad manners.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I come from,\" she rejoined, rising from the table, and opening the fridge, \"it's bad manners to point out someone else's bad manners.  We have milk, water, and diet grape.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet grape?  Are you kidding?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not.\"  Francesca--Lantern--had a sweet tooth, but also a two-piece picked out for her upcoming honeymoon.  Magnets had been fastened to the fridge, holding pictures of models with her Sicillian roommate's face glued onto them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" guffawed the man, seeming very sailorly indeed.  \"If you have no wine, diet grape will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did this Herman O'Lymp think he was?  She poured a glass for him--and one for her, lest he be under the delusion that she was used to serving men--and sat down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she began, \"you were saying?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked uncomfortable for the first time.  \"I was saying,\" he began, \"that I did not actually come to see the house.  I came to see you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been able to feel it when she blushed, but never like this.  At first, she felt extremely pleased, if terribly embarrassed.  Next, she realized that this might not be an ideal situation.  Here was a strange man who had her, alone, in her house, and she, apparently, had no power over him.  She began to think about where in the house the knife was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" Herman began, taking a sip of diet grape, and then grimacing, \"As I was saying, I am no meta-human.  But I am also no human.\"  He took another sip.  \"Kinda grows on you, I'll admit.  Anyway, I am a god.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, thought Bella.  I've been falling for a crazy man who is about to rape or kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't come here,\" said Herman, \"about your house.\"  He waved his hand, dismissively.  \"I came for you, because YOU, Bella, are a god as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose, walking across the kitchen slowly, to where the knives were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think, Bella,\" continued Herman O'Lymp, his mediterranean brow looking like a cloudy sky just before lightning.  \"Think about it.  You know you never made a very good human, OR a very good metahuman.  Your place is with us, with the gods.  I was sent to find you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed against a drawer, which she slid open, quietly, just like the desperate women in the movies did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and walked toward her.  \"Why do you think your powers don't work on me?  Because they're the same kind as the ones I have.  Not mere powers, but divinity!  God does not impress god, for we are higher beings than these...mortals (he gestured toward the picture-laden refrigerator).  You ought to come with me.  You ought to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...uh...probably ought to leave.\"  Bella's groping hand latched onto a knife handle behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman suddenly seemed very tall, but he smiled, brilliantly, boyishly, his black brows lifting under his curls.  \"Very well,\" he said.  \"But if you change your mind, you have my e-mail.  Really, you can reach me however you'd like.  I am The Messenger.\"  Then suddenly, it was as though he jumped onto the air itself.  His body, starting from his feet and head, glowed silver, and he began to run on an unseen floor--then suddenly, vanished with a blinding flash and deafening clap of thunder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Bella whipped out the knife, there was nothing to be seen of the man, but as she listened to the thunderclap echo in her head, she thought she heard the nasal voice say, with a laugh, \"And you are The Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood for a moment, speechless, trying to think of something to say that would ease the bizarre atmosphere created in her mind by the whole thing.  The best she could come up with was, \"Showoff,\" as she took a casual sip of his disgusting diet grape soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stopped.  \"The MOTHER?\" she repeated.  \"Ugh.\"  She drained the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her phone rang.  The display read, \"Flyboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this Freya?\" asked a somewhat panicked voice.  There was shouting in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is, Flyboy.  What's going on?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'd better come down to the metro station.  Bring your roommates.  We have a...um...situation here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're--\"  Flyboy hung up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" said Bella.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin cleared his throat and turned to his seething wife in the checkered skirt (who was named Janet).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still want to see a movie?\" His voice cracked, slightly.  He had been incapable of speech and movement for about ten minutes after that meta-woman--Freya--had kissed him.  What an anniversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife gave him a look.  \"What do YOU think?\" she said, icily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan, come on, it wasn't my fault.\"  He took her hands in his, beginning to massage them with his thumbs, which ordinarily she liked.  She pulled her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you didn't enjoy THAT at all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\" he lied.  \"You know she hypnotizes people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men.  She hypnotizes weak little men.  Thanks for dinner, Kevin.  Let's go home.\"  She started to walk toward the metro, forgetting the explosion and smoke that had issued from it only twenty minutes before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hurt, thought Kevin.  I hate it when she calls me by my name like that.  And I really tried.  Took her to a five-star, expensive restaurant, and watched her gorge herself with food and cake.  She's been overeating ever since we found out she couldn't have kids, but insisting on continuing to wear her old clothes, so that I'm half-embarrassed every time we go out.  But still, still I don't want to be with anyone else.  Have I said a word about her eating?  About her general bitchiness?  Despite all that, SHE'S the one, always has been.  \"Some guys,\" he began, catching up with her, as she started down the stairs, \"don't even remember their wives' birthdays or anniversaries.  Have I EVER missed ONE?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, halfway down the metro stairs.  The pasta, still tossing in her stomach, made her feel increasingly uncomfortable and irritable.  \"Don't you think,\" she said, \"I would rather you'd missed it than kissed another woman?\"  Great, she thought.  Tears were now visible in her eyes, which made her vulnerable to 'comforting.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...\" he tried to take her hands again.  But at that moment, they heard a strange, unearthly hiss in the metro below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God, we're stupid,\" exclaimed Janet.  \"We can't use this metro, remember?  We were so distracted by that little bitch that it almost killed us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet, I'm sorry,\" said Kevin.  Sex, he supposed, was out of the question tonight, but it hurt him to see those tears in her eyes.  She was a good woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about--\" Janet began.  But just as they began to turn to walk up the stairs, there was a blinding flash of light, and Janet fell forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan!\" called Kevin, and caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned on him.  \"Lightning from the metro?\" she grunted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably another explosion.  Come on, let's take a cab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...Kevin, I think something hit me.  I feel REALLY strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to a bench and sit down then.  I'll have a look at you.\"  He tried--and succeeded--to sound manly, and in-control.  He wasn't extremely worried.  He'd seen nothing hit her, just that flash of light below.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he became a little more worried when, as she leaned on him, he noticed she was having more and more trouble walking.  In addition, the amount of her weight that he was supporting increased.  By the time they reached the top of the metro stairs, he could barely hold her up.  He dragged her to the nearest bench, and took out his phone to call an ambulance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...no...\" Janet protested.  \"I'll be...\"  Suddenly, doubled over on the park bench.  He sat next to her, holding tightly to her hand, while he called 9-1-1 with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave their location information quite calmly, watching his wife the entire time.  Her hand felt odd--swollen, in fact.  \"Jan, are you okay?\" he asked.  \"Is the pain bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pain...\" gasped Janet, trying to sit up... \"it's just all very strange-feeling, she said, looking down.\"  That was when Kevin noticed something odd, as well.  His wife's already-round face was swelling as well--but it didn't look like the kind of swelling you got from a bee-sting.  It wasn't red or puffy, just...bigger?  Her dark eyes, wide-open in an expression of horror, began to look smaller and smaller behind ripening cheeks.  Her lips thickened, and below that, her chin and neck disappeared in folds of flesh.  She had been gaining weight, it was true, but now it was as if someone had hit fast-forward.  He heard the waistband of her checkered skirt snap, and it was as though a dam had burst.  Waves of pasty, white flesh overflowed her clothing, leaving only black and checkered wreckage in their wake.  He took off his jacket to cover her, and phoned the ambulance again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...some kind of allergic reaction...\" Janet had heard her husband say, before passing out entirely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, she felt hands on her wrist, checking her pulse.  To her surprise, she did not feel sick or injured.  She started to say, \"I'm okay, but the paramedic shushed her, pushing her fingers deep into Janet's now-fleshy wrist.  \"Your husband, I'm afraid, has also gone into shock,\" said the paramedic in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.  She was a cute little redhead, and Janet felt the normal surge of jealousy, which was exacerbated all the more by her present condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hang on, miss, and we'll try to get this stretcher under you, and...and...\"  Janet now saw a change in the paramedic's expression.  \"Guys, I feel really weird,\" said the girl.  She was beginning to look a bit weird, thought Janet.  Her petite, 22-year-old body, Janet noticed, was beginning to expand as well, and now her belly and boobs grew more pronounced within the constraints of the EMT uniform, until they seemed to hang over Janet.  The paramedic's hands went from Janet's wrist, up to her own face, and she shrieked.  \"OH MY GOD!\" as she felt new folds of flesh growing, multiplying.  Janet stood up, with some difficulty, and tried to offer the paramedic her hand.  \"You keep away from me!\" screamed the EMT, rolling on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet ran to another paramedic, and pulled her, by the hand, toward her colleague.  But when she turned around she saw that this girl, as well, was now having trouble walking on now-plump legs.  \"I'm contagious,\" she whispered.  \"Oh my God.  I'm contagious.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to her knees, looking up into the sky, still clutching Kevin's coat around her 300-pound body.  And then she caught sight of a figure in the sky.  \"Help!\" she shouted.  \"Help us!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lithe young man, immediately, alighted on the park bench where Janet herself had doubled her body mass.  \"What's wrong, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...need...help...\" shouted the first paramedic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlyboy, a novice, at nineteen, couldn't think of what to do.  So he telephoned the senior superheroes who lived closest to Thomas Street.  First, Lantern.  Voicemail.  Blur?  Voicemail.  Freya?  Aha.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya's long, shapely legs pushed her down the street as fast as they could, and she was at the metro about ten minutes later, where she saw about five or so, very large women writhing on the pavement--one a policewoman, who had outgrown her unflattering uniform, one dressed in a tiny waitress outfit, two paramedics--and one!  One looked a lot like that woman--Kevin's wife--except--no, she had certainly not been that big!  Bella ran to Flyboy, who hovered above the mess.  \"What's going--?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" growled the black-haired woman, rising, half-nude and half checkered and coat-covered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bella could reply, she found herself in a sweaty, smelly, fleshy embrace with her former rival, her tiny body nearly enveloped by the mass of the other.  She tried to shake Janet loose, but the older woman clung to her until, Bella noticed, the tension between their two bodies grew.  Bella felt, horrified, her own breasts, her own stomach, arms and thighs, growing, pushing back against her rival's.  At last, she managed to throw Janet off of her entirely.  She could not catch her breath.  She struggled with the back of her dress, attempting to undo it before it choked her.  As she did, she felt it rip behind her.  Her bra was already broken.  She looked down in horror, at a massive tummy, gargantuan breasts, and huge thighs, which shed the broken yellow dress like a snakeskin.  Looking back up at Kevin's wife, she noticed a somewhat satisfied smile on her fat face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Janet.  \"At least SOMETHING good happened today.  I daresay, you're even fatter than I am now, you slutty little manatee.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella buried her face in her hands.  This couldn't be happening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Came the scornful voice.  \"Fat little Freya isn't crying, is she?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya heard Flyboy, above her.  \"Freya, listen, I was trying to tell you--whatever this is, it's very, very contagious.  Now that you've been infected, you need to stay here, and don't touch anyone.  Everyone stay where you are,\" he repeated, to them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a few of them didn't listen.  But Freya was among the fifteen-or-so ample-bodied women, who, three hours later, boarded an emergency vehicle, and were driven away, to a special infirmary floor on Guldhelm which had been cleared, temporarily, for the obese, hysterical, and very contagious, women.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bella turned over on her now-massive side, clutching her pillow over her head to drown out the sounds, all around her, of uncontrollable sobbing, fighting and snoring.  She wanted so badly to sleep--to be lost in oblivion, rather than in the padded room with white sheets and cots and huge crying women.  It reminded her of that horrific scene in Pinnochio, where the boys turned into donkeys and were trapped on Pleasure Island.  She was ravenously hungry, but, even more than that, thirsty.  There was no water in the huge room.  She envied the women who had not listened to Flyboy and the police, even if they WERE contagious.  Here, they were being treated like animals, she thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time she started to drift off, she heard the doors clang open and shut, and another sobbing woman or two--dressed, presumably in the oversized blue hospital gowns that all of them had on--would find space for her bedroll, and lie down as male guards gave orders.  She was surprised that she felt sorry for them.  She had been the really beautiful one.  She was the one to be most pitied, who had lost the most, wasn't she?  She started to resent them, then realized that, even before today, she was comfortable being a freak.  Beautiful freak or disgusting freak, what did it matter?  She did miss her roommates, but these women had husbands and lovers and careers that they were mourning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a little scream on the other end of her unit, accompanied by the sound of flesh being kicked and punched.  The scream rose to a wail, then was suddenly cut off.  \"That will shut you up, you ugly cow!  It was YOU who did this to us!  Don't think we don't know that!  YOU ruined our lives!\"  The thudding of a foot connecting with flesh, and Bella could hear the woman whimper, \"Kevin...Kevin...I want my Kevin, where...\"  Another thud, and then silence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled, turned over on her back again, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a few small protests being held outside of Guldhelm,\" stated the reporter on television, \"but most do understand that this is a temporary situation--a precaution against additional women becoming morbidly obese, as we try to understand the nature of the epidemic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinny little bitch, thought Bella.  I'd like to get a hold of her and teach her to talk so coolly about the situation.  See if she still has that reporter job when she's a size thirty.  This thought was echoed aloud by a number of the infirmary inmates.  Lights had come on at approximately 8:00 AM, and guards--with clubs, for goodness sake!  As if they were dangerous criminals!--had pushed out several carts of airplane-esque food and water, which the women--there were about forty of them now, Bella guessed--pushed and shoved to get to.  As they tore open the cartons, bypassing the plastic cutlery and literally shoving the food into their ravenous mouths, one of the senior guards repeated that the government did apologize for this measure, that it was only temporary, that the blue-clad inmates were free to watch television.  He was also making every effort to ensure that books would be brought up later today, and possibly a few computers to allow for Internet time.  They were also, he said, somewhat embarrassedly, looking into getting exercise equipment.  The women--they had been lawyers, housewives, doctors, nurses, waitresses--even, Bella recognized, one or two superheroines--made no reply--each, to a woman, was devouring her food.  Bella did not remember, five minutes later, what the food had been.  She took a long drink of water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" came a voice, close by.  \"It's happening, again!  Why is it happening again?\"  Bella watched as the billowy robes became a little tighter around each woman's body, including her own.  Her paunch and breasts protruded further than ever, and she screamed as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne woman--a doctor, Bella thought--stood up, her form still expanding.  \"Stop eating the food!\" she cried.  \"Somehow our bodies aren't digesting it right.  Everyone stop eating!\"  She was far too late, Bella thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all still hungry, and even moreso by lunchtime, but they didn't dare partake when the guards brought them their midday portions.  Bella clutched her gut--oh, it felt SO empty!--and attempted to distract herself with the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people are infected?\" queried the hated anchor, to some doctor or other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say,\" said the man, a clean-cut Hispanic official of some kind--probably of the State Department or Health Board.  \"Right now, I'm hearing hundreds, at least.  Paragon City is doing everything it can to prevent its spread to other parts of the United States and the globe.  Police--male police, as they seem to be immune to the effects, and superhero units--are busy rounding up everyone they can.  This is proving especially difficult in the case of female meta-humans who have caught it, but slowly we are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of laughter and shouting coming from a crowd of women who were gathered in the corner, Bella noticed.  Around someone, or something, it seemed.  She decided to investigate, and wedged her substantial behind between other heavy, standing figures who were shouting, \"Eat, eat, eat!\"  Kevin's black-haired wife, slumped on the floor, was struggling frantically, her fat arms flailing, her mouth being held open by two of the other women, who also kept back her disheveled mass of black curls.  Bella realized with horror--but also, she admitted, gratification--that they had already force-fed the poor woman about five of the dinners.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ringleaders, a girl with red hair, who might have been the paramedic Bella saw yesterday--was shouting down at her.  \"That's right, eat, you pig!  You know how every classroom needs a fat kid to pick on?  We've nominated YOU to be ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I'm s-s-sorr--\" Janet tried to say, but her mouth was forced open again, as a sixth dinner was forced into her mouth.  \"From now on,\" continued the redhead, \"you're going to be this class's pet pig.  You deserve it, for making us like this.  Look,\" she said, picking up a brownie,\" the guards left us some dessert as well.  Would you like some, pig?  Say oink!\"  Hot tears poured over Janet's monstrous cheeks.  Bella could see every fold of the poor woman's flesh behind the gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please stop...\" begged Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stop,\" said the paramedic.  \"We'll stop, but SINCE you're the pet pig, I want you to say oink for us.  Give us a real piggy snort, and we'll think about stopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorr--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good enough!  Snort, piggy, or we keep stuffing this in your greedy little mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet snorted, sobbed, and snorted again.  It was, Bella thought, a fairly good imitation of a pig.  The women holding Janet erupted in laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, piggy, I don't want to see you walking around on your hind legs, the way we humans can.  Do you hear me?  A piggy as fat as you needs all four legs to trot around on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pl-please...\" begged Janet.  \"Please, I didn't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands and knees!\" shouted another girl, a brunette with darkish skin, who looked familiar to Bella.  Had she been a celebrity of some kind?  Janet complied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The piggy shouldn't wear human clothes,\"  said the Indian girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--\" began Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she wants some more!\" laughed the redhead, sadistically.  Bella was shocked to feel some pity for the woman who was responsible for her present condition--as well as some envy, she realized, that she was getting so much food.  The women held Janet's head back, and forced two brownies into Janet's mouth.  Then they ripped the gown off of her as her form exploded yet again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, trot away, piggy,\" laughed the Indian girl.  \"Trot away, and we'd better hear you grunt like a happy little piggy, or we'll think you're hungry for some more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humiliated, naked woman oinked loudly for the women's amusement and scrambled away on all fours, her bloated belly and breasts nearly scraping the ground, her bottom and legs two quivering crests of flesh.  Bella looked at her tormentors, suddenly feeling that they were not so fat after all.  Neither was she.  It was that pig, Janet, in the corner.  She was the fat one.  Nevertheless, though it made her feel better about herself, another part of her realized that they were all behaving like animals.  If this behavior went unchecked, she could be the next one who was picked on.  This place could be hell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television interrupted her reverie.  \"...also received word that meta-woman and superheroine Bella Hauge, also known as Freya, is among those who have been interned at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said the brown-haired Indian girl.  Bella ignored her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she repeated.  \"I THOUGHT that was you!  So, not so special now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither are you, apparently,\" retorted Bella to the former model-actress.  She recognized her now, as Rubiana Kumar, formerly of Bollywood.  \"Not that you ever were, over here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOooh.  Burned.  But that was pretty stupid, as well, Bella thought.  Rubiana seemed to enjoy quite a following in the infirmary, at least.  Rubiana did not show the slightest sign of anger.  Instead she cocked her head to the side, gestured toward a few of the other girls, and said, simply, \"You look hungry.  Our poor pig over there IS lonely.\"  Bella stood up at once, to fight, but was at once held down by the paramedic and the policewoman.  She screamed, but immediately food was shoved into her mouth.  God, but it was good.  And she was hungry.  One mouthful wouldn't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't do THAT, Rubiana,\" scoffed the red-head.  \"She's so BEAU-tiful, with her perfect curls and dark eyes, and golden skin...do you really want to ruin her beauty EVEN MORE?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, Roberta,\" retorted Rubiana, making Bella swallow another mouthful, rubbing it all over her face.  \"If her skin is so beautiful, shouldn't there be more of it...for everyone to see?  Piggy over there is so pasty, but this one...I think this one deserves THE REST of the food.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! cried Bella's stomach.  \"No!\" screamed her food-filled mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, past the smiling fat faces, she heard another, \"NO!  You get the HELL off her, lard-ass!\"  At once, Rubiana and Roberta were simultaneously flung across the infirmary by a familiar, if pudgy, bright-white hand.  The rest of the girls moved aside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella!  Sweet Bella!\" came a familiar voice, now more husky than she remembered it.  \"Are you okay, my lovely darling?  I'm so sorry, Bella, that the epidemic hit you!  Oh, sweetie, you look terrible.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella spat out a mouthful of casserole.  \"Francesca!  Lantern!  You're here too?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, hon.\"  Did she glow brighter now that there was more of her?  \"But it's okay.  Guess I'll have to find a new wedding-dress, though,\" she chirped.  \"And forget all that nonsense about the two-piece.\"  She clasped her hand over her belly and jiggled it, and for a moment--only a moment--a serious look came over her face.  Then, she laughed, and the light grew brighter.  \"Oh, Francesca, but I'm really sorry about you.  It's worse when someone as perfect-looking as you...well, anyway.\"  The Sicillian meta-human, despite being 5'2\" and (now) approximately 230 pounds, stood up tall and proud, and raised her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attencion!  Everyone!\" she cried, shrilly.  \"As of now, and until further notice, I, Lantern, am taking control of this floor.  The women shielded their eyes, unable to look directly at the bioluminescent energy shining from within Lantern's hospital gown.  They could barely, at this point, make out a face.  \"You will leave each other alone!  No more force-feeding.  And the two of you!\" she turned to Rubiana and Roberta.  \"You will take off your gowns.  You will give them to Janet, over there, and you will be cold and naked until the guards come back with some extra supplies tonight!  Shame on you!\"  Rubiana opened her mouth to say something, but hid her eyes and cowered, as Lantern grew even brighter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really is a marvel, thought Bella enviously and gratefully.  Most of all, she felt relief that she now had her friend with her.  But this was Lantern.  And that was a problem.  With her in charge, things in the infirmary would still be unpredictable.  She only needed wait a few hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards, at dinnertime, wheeled in a few computers, along with foods that they said, according to tests conducted on other infected women, did not produce further weight gain.  The women took them at their word, and devoured the soy-tasting morsels.  \"You will eat the food with cutlery, not like animals!\" cried Lantern, still sounding cheerful enough.  But Bella noticed Francesca's light was on the wane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were checking their mail, sitting next to one another, there was no glow at all, and Bella could perfectly make out Francesca's tanned, greasy skin, and the shadow of the moustache across her lip that she usually so painstakingly plucked, along with her eyebrows.  Her hair no longer glowed white, but was her usual glossy light brown.  This was not good.  The girl had used up too much energy taking charge.  A thought came to her, and she found, in her list of e-mail addresses, one hermanolymp@gmail.com.  She typed, \"Help us, please,\" into the message body, and clicked send.  Then she looked back at Francesca, who had just finished writing to her fiance, Jack Sawyer--that metahuman clown who called himself Jigsaw.  Francesca turned back to her, and said, quietly, clutching her hand, \"Bella...Oh, Bella, I don't want him to see me like this.  I want to stay here.  I'm so, so afraid he won't love me anymore.\"  Bella noticed the air around Francesca beginning to darken.  Ladies and...ladies, she thought, I present to you Lantern, the one and only bi-polar superheroine...  And she was in charge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got hard after Internet time.  Lantern began, slowly, to withdraw, her expression to cloud, and by nightfall, Bella could no longer see the girl distinctly--she was blue-black skin in a dark corner that she took wherever she went.  And she was sobbing to Bella, saying, \"So fat.  I'm so fat.  Jack said he loves me, but...who could love someone who looks like this?\"  Some of the girls, thinking their activities now beyond Lantern's awareness, took the opportunity to pinch Janet's fleshy stomach, whispering \"Piggy, piggy, piggy,\" into her ear.  Janet, who had become a little more like her old fiery self since being stood up for, pinched back.  Seeing this, red-headed Roberta produced a few brownies, leftover from lunch, and brandished them in Janet's direction.  Janet, horrified, cried out a little.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Roberta could no longer see Janet at all.  She could not see anything, beyond two eyes that glowed like demons' eyes from a jet-black female form.  \"Good,\" said an ice-cold voice, quite different from the earlier Lantern's, \"You have a brownie, I see.  Go ahead and eat it, I don't mind.\"  Roberta turned pale, and attempted to put the brownie away.  \"EAT IT,\" came the voice, again.  Roberta obediently took one bite, then another, until the food disappeared, and her body trembled, growing a little.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" said Lantern, clutching Roberta's arm with her indigo hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aieeee!\" screamed Roberta.  \"You're burning me!  You're hurting me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" said Lantern, wearily, and proceeded to leech energy from the girl's plump body, until it fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she dead?\" asked Bella, when Lantern had resumed her place by her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know and I don't care,\" said Lantern.  The effort had taxed her, greatly, but Bella knew that the energy she had taken from the girl would make her all the brighter and more powerful when her mood changed again.  She hoped Herman, or the Messenger, or whatever he was, had gotten her message.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drifted off, holding the dark, cold hand of the Sicilian bride-to-be beside her, as the latter cried herself to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awakened by her own snoring, and she sat up.  Then, suddenly, there was a man before her, not three inches from her face.  His powerful hand covered her mouth as she instinctively shrieked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a word,\" he breathed into her ear.  \"You stand up and come with me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about...\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, fatso\"--the white teeth grinned, sadistically--\"do you want out, or not?  The rest of them are not important.  They are not like us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't leave France--can't leave my fr--,\"  Suddenly, Bella was aware that the long, lean--but surprisingly strong--arms were holding her against a body which smelled of olives and the sea.  Herman O'Lymp, or The Messenger, or Mercury, or whoever he was, pressed his mouth against hers, clutching her to his heartbeat, massaging her arms, and sides, and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--\" she began, but was interrupted a second time, by alien lips and teeth, as, wrapping her flabby arms around his neck--who knew when this would ever happen again?--she kissed him with all her might.  And in that moment, despite her circumstance, she was a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embrace ended, and she, woozily, let Herman lead her toward the barred doors.  He snapped his fingers, and they opened at once, without so much as a clang.  The snores of the other women echoed across the room, and she tried, again, to ask for mercy for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella,\" he whispered again, fiercely, into her ear, \"tonight is YOUR night.  Tonight is the night you come into your destiny.  It is not Francesca's night.  You must let her go.  Besides, she is doing too much good here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella conceded that this might be the case, but could she really abandon her friend?  She looked at the door, which stood open.  Herman fidgeted, impatiently, with her hair.</span></div></div>",

My lips twitch, thirstily, remembering Herman's sweet kiss of the night before.  I hug my huge body, remembering leaner, stronger arms.  He had looked so sad.  Heartbroken, in fact, when I said I couldn't go.  I have no clue why--with this body of mine, why!--he would even want me.  But he clearly did.  No other man or meta-man would....perhaps he was a god...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he had whispered, slightly angrily, there at the door.  \"But I cannot come for you again.  Not here.  The Messenger comes only once, to the same person, in the same place, with the same message.  If she doesn't respond, well...that's her lookout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd kissed him again--boldly--there in the dark.  \"Herman, you have to believe that I want to.  But I can't just turn my back on my friend...not after she helped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you turn your back on me, instead, when I want to help you?\"  he had said again, almost choking on a sob, I realized!  \"When I tell you that I love you?  Fine.  You have your human rules, but I have mine, too.  I won't be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman, wait,\" I had called, but he was behind the barred door already, shaking his head, and it was closed.  \"Oh, Bella, Bella, thwarter of my love and your destiny,\" he'd said.  \"Don't you know I'm too impatient to wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss m--\" I'd started to say, desperately, but he had vanished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, lying here on the cot, looking across at Francesca, glowing and smiling slightly, in her sleep, I know I did the right thing.  My heart, though, feels even bigger and emptier than my gut.  Ugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesca opens her eyes.  \"Good morning, dear roommate,\" she beams.  \"I'm so glad you're here.\"  I grab her plump, hand, glittering with light, and smile as convincingly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm glad to be with you,\" I say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowers!  Thank God.  We stink.  It's bad enough that fat people are condemned to look like this.  But we have to smell, too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're taken, in groups of ten, to the showers.  Francesca goes with the second group, and she comes back, radiant, her brown Sicilian hair in a towel, her moist, glowing skin causing rainbows to spread over her thick arms and legs.  \"It's wonderful,\" she says, drying off her hair.  \"I didn't expect hot water!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Group three!\" shouts the guard at the door.  \"Rubiana Kumar, Bella Hauge, Janet Howard, Grace Henderson, Juana Jarvis, Roberta Arlington...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat.  Grouped in with three of my favorite people.  I line up behind poor, massive Janet, fatter and shorter than any of us, who glares at me, but who also looks pretty apprehensive about being in a shower with the bullies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't use these groups every day,\" I whisper to her, attempting to make peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope not,\" she echoes.  But her tone is a little softer.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm drying off.  God, there's so much more to dry, now, and our towels are less than twice the size of a washcloth.  I glance over at Janet, who is having twice the difficulty of any of us.  As it turns out, we didn't need to worry about Rubiana and Roberta, after all.  When we arrived at the shower room, filing past where the guards were allowed, we noticed the two of them whispering something to one of the guards.  They were both smiling in  a very...contrived way.  Then, the guards closed the doors to the shower room, but just before they did, I saw Roberta's hand touch the guards face in an...indiscreet...way.  The two of them never rejoined us.  I have a fleeting, ridiculous thought that they are trading favors in order to get better showers.  That's stupid, I think.  Anyway, who would want them?  But then...Herman wanted me, I suppose.  I reach toward the dispenser.  There's no proper deoderant in the place, but there is some powder, at least, that I can shove up under my deep armpit.  Hell, I should apply it everywhere, in fact.  All kinds of...pits end up stinking on this body.  I think, not for the first or the last time, that there has to be a way out--of this prison--and more importantly, of this body.  But it's likely that the only way out of this body is through this prison.  Could there have been another motive to my staying, besides pure loyalty?  The scientists must be coming up with something, even now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast.  I sit at one of the fold-out tables they've now brought up--next to France', as always.  She is talking excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, the scientists have--the guards told me, while you were at shower, that the scientists believe they can cure this, at least in metahumans.  They think they can help me--can help us!\" she laughed, her mouth full of the bland, wafery stuff that doesn't cause us to gain weight.  We eat it, morning, noon and night, and I wouldn't take another bite if I wasn't so hungry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful,\" I manage through my own mouthful, hope soaring.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" she beams, literally.  \"They're going to bring me to the doctor in about an hour, they said.  I might get to keep that wedding dress and two-piece, after all!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a laugh from a few tables over.  Rubiana and Roberta are talking loudly.  I'm not sure about what.  They seem more careless than they have for the past day or so.  They had returned, just before ten o' clock breakfast, looking clean and fairly pleased with themselves--touching the arms of the guards who escorted them.  This could be a problem, I think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n1:00 PM.  I choke down lunch by myself.  I haven't seen France' since she left at 10:45, light radiating from her face, as Rubiana and Roberta snickered.  I hope she's okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:00 PM.  More white stuff for dinner.  I'm sitting alone, again, growing more and more worried about France'.  Did they just cure her and let her go?  Did she forget, in her manic state, to tell them about me--that I'm a meta-human?  Or was, anyway.  God, I used to be so, so beautiful.  Herman, my love, I miss you.  Please take me away, if you can hear me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is BlubberGirl blubbering?\" asks a rude voice, tinged with an Indian accent, next to me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can it, Rubi,\" I say.  \"I don't want trouble.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just bet you don't,\" laughs Roberta, next to her.  \"I just bet you don't, now that your GIRLFRIEND isn't here to save your lard ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fatter than me, Roberta,\" I laugh, but I'm a little nervous, now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll soon fix that, won't we, Rubi?\" asks Roberta.  \"We have friends now, on the outside,\" she said.  \"And these friends are so wonderfully helpful.  Not only did they help your poor friend Lantern get out of here, no questions asked, just like that...but we also told them about how HUNGRY you were, and they gave us some real food to feed our new favorite prize Pig.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up, alarmed.  \"You fat-assed, whoring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down!\" she shouts, and then, to my horror, I see a few of the girls, chuckling, as a bucket of what looks like pancake batter is brought in my direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piggy Number One!\" Rubiana calls to Janet, \"I want you to come here and slop our NEW piggy for us.  Janet, to her credit, looks defiant, though only for a moment.  \"Piggy Number One...you'd better come here, NOW, because this slop has to be eaten by SOMEONE.  Janet's eyes glance mournfully down at her wrecked form--any more, and she'll die--and she strides, thighs rubbing, to where I am.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no point in fighting.  I am surrounded by at least ten girls, each of them afraid of being the next victim.  France', Herman...someone...help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet scoops a cup of batter out of the bucket, and her eyes glisten with hatred.  Fear has made her crueler.  \"Well, well.  Bella Hauge, the Belly Hog.  Say 'Oink!'  I'll teach you to kiss my Kevin, you corpulent whore!\"  The rest of the girls laugh, holding my arms, as I choke on the thick stuff.  Perhaps I can struggle free, for now.  But is there a point?  </span></div></div>",

Kevin's wife was right.  I've got to have the most absurd power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't strictly true.  There had been a metahuman at the Academy who was able to produce radioactive mucus at will.  That was more ridiculous.  Not to mention disgusting.  But still.  When she couldn't answer a call about problems at the metro because she knew a male superhero would be there...that was stupid.  Maybe that Messenger had something, after all, with his whole, 'You're not like them,' line.  Maybe, on the other hand, he was a freakish exception to the way her power interacted with males, and he was using that line to get into her pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a BAD thing?\" she said out loud, suddenly covering her mouth.  Yeah, she wasn't going to be easy...maybe Kevin's wife was right about that, too.  She thought about Herman's smile.  Then she stood up, and went to her room, where her ancient laptop hummed at her desk.  Here goes, she thought, or something equally cliche.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo: hermanolymp@gmail.com<br>\r\nSubject: Re: your message<br>\r\n<br>\r\nText:  Herman,<br>\r\n         No idea who or what you are, but I _would_ like a better idea of what I am.  Would appreciate if you would meet me so we can talk further about whatever opportunity.  Call or something.  I don't know.  Talk to you later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(She hesitated a moment, her perfect face blushing beneath the golden tan)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Love (backspace) Sincerely (backspace) Yours truly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Bella/Freya<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, closing her eyes tightly, she hit \"send.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to the living room, plopped back into the couch, and turned on the television.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen flashed, and then, suddenly, a silver humanoid form leapt out of it, across the living room, and on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, but it sounded something vaguely like, \"Mmmffmm!\"  Suddenly, she realized, she was receiving her second kiss of the day, this time from a more willing partner than Kevin.  Surprisingly strong arms (they smelled like the ocean!) held her perfect body up to a lean, long-limbed one, and a part of her said, Let him, Bella.  Let him...you like him, and he is like you...her emerald eyes, open in astonishment at first, began to close.  But who was he?  A part of her said, it doesn't matter, Bella, he likes you, and he is doing something about it...just enjoy...this part of her was very convincing, and even persuaded her to run her delicate fingers through his curly black hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another part of her persuaded her to kick him, hard, in the crotch.  Herman Olymp rolled off of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!  What was THAT?\" cried the boy, rocking on the ground.  \"Gods can hurt there too, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said at first, then, \"but even 'gods' should know better than to just start kissing a woman like that.  You scared me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman smiled, despite his pain.  \"So!\" he said, triumphantly.  \"You're coming with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, yes,\" she shrugged.  \"I don't think you're right about my being a god or goddess, or 'The Mother,' or whatever...but you're right about one thing--I'm no good at being a superhero.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" said Herman.  \"Conditional surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, you should know, you crafty moron,\" she managed, with a little more spunk than she normally mustered around him, \"you should know that I read a lot of literature.  When you're too beautiful to get a date, you find more solitary ways to pass the time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" he said.  '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get what your silly name means--Hermes, the Olympian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bravo,\" he clapped, sarcastically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't REALLY think that's who you are, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not exactly,\" said Herman, uncomfortably, scratching his neck.  \"But it is a big part of who I am--just not everything.  Divine identity is a little more...fluid than that.  But, don't take MY word for it.  I'm just the Messenger, after all...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he grabbed her hand, and, before she could resist, she was being pulled across what felt simultaneously like water and rock, and through many, many doors.  She began to pass out, but before she could, she was sitting on a sofa in a cold room.  Five figures stared down at her.  It was dark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman?\" she called.  What had happened to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a child approached.  \"Welcome to Paragonia,\" he said.  \"The heart of this city--of reality, in fact.  I am called The Emperor.  He bowed to her, and Bella noticed that his left eye was glass.  Also, his hair was prematurely grey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother form approached--a very tall man this time, and very handsome, she realized.  \"I am called The Sun,\" he bellowed, and bowed, very low.  Next, a woman of about thirty-five, with olive skin, black hair, and an elaborate headdress.  \"I am called The Polis,\" she said.  A fat woman, rather old, curtsied at her.  \"The Moon,\" she cackled.  Her laughter was joined by a rumbling guffaw, as another giant strode toward her.  This one had silver hair, and looked quite a bit like Herman.  \"I am The Wild,\" he said.  \"And I believe you've already met my dear son, The Messenger.\"  Bella nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child approached her again.  \"Please stand up, woman.  We will not hurt you,\" he said, giving her a look that was half-contemptuous.  \"Everyone,\" he said, \"I am pleased to introduce to you all the seventh member of our 'little' band.  Please bow to The Mother.  They all did, and Bella turned around to see if there was a way out behind her.  She could see nothing besides the eerie faces.  Either, she thought, they really are...gods...of some kind--though God knows what kind--or this is all some elaborate trick.  At once, she felt that her arm being taken by Herman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of want to go home now,\" she whispered to him.  \"This is getting really weird.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be really rude,\" he whispered to her.  \"We still need to celebrate.\"  Then, louder, for everyone, \"To the mead hall!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant, the light increased, and the seven of them were at a large table, in the middle of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to T.G.I. Friday's, my name is Pauline.  Can I get you all a drink to start you off?\" asked a shortish waitress, covered with buttons.  She was bending over a table where all seven of them sat, talking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get anything you want,\" said the grey-haired kid.  \"It's all on me tonight.\"  They did.  Two beers, two cherry cokes, a diet, a milkshake and a red wine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the seven of them drank anything, they flicked the side of their glasses, causing them to ring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transforming them!\" said Herman, when she asked what they were doing, \"Into ambrosia!  To your health!\"  He swallowed the wine.  \"Here, I'll do yours too,\" he said, flicking her beer as well.  She, meanwhile, worked out a theory.  They were a particularly nerdy and off-beat group of meta-humans--teleporting ones--who compensated themselves for their lack of social skills by pretending to be...but then, they could still talk to her, even the male ones...that was the thing...  She took a gulp of beer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay.  She DID feel different.  She took another swallow.  She could feel strength, or life, or immortality, or something.  Why gods would haunt T.G.I.Friday's was beyond her, but either this was ambrosia, or it was the weirdest beer she had ever tasted.  She took another sip, and everything was a blur of eating, dancing with the long-limbed Messenger, exulting in mutual immortality, and the smell of the sea, and her yellow dress going bye-bye as she let herself be, just, happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up to the sound of the television, stretched--then suddenly noticed, horrified, that she was naked, and buried herself under alien covers.  She looked around her.  \"Oh, shit!\" she said.  She had been a fool.  At the foot of the bed, she could see Herman's hairy, naked back, his face, apparently, entirely engrossed in the television.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around at once.  \"Beautiful!\" he crowed.  \"Good morning, my lovely one!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...good morning?\" she tried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a good night?  Your first night as a goddess?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyeah.  Um.  Question.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has many different names,\" said Herman, grinning, ignoring her obvious distress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman, or Hermes, or Messenger, or whatever the hell you're called...IT'S called date...rape!  You slipped me a roofie...or...or something!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, no, no, no, no,\" he said, sounding slightly irritated.  \"It's called getting drunk on sweet LIFE itself, and making wild, passionate love, god-to-goddess, the way it should be.  You remember enough of last night to know you were conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.  She had to give him that.  Even if barely conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ambrosia is strong, is all.\"  He dove across the bed toward her, and she jumped up, pulling the covers around her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my dress?\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come here and look at this, on the television,\" he said, in an amused voice.  \"Look at what those mortals have gone and done to themselves.  It's hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reporter on the television was talking.  \"--condition is highly contagious, and we urge all citizens--particularly female citizens--not to leave their houses until it is over.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Anne,\" said an anchorman.  \"Again, for those of you just joining us, an epidemic of obesity appears to be sweeping through the city, as of yesterday evening.\"  Bella sat down on the edge of the bed, making sure she was holding the blanket well over her perfect breasts and legs.  The anchorman continued.  \"The epidemic spreads very rapidly by touch, so it is very important that no one touch anyone who looks as though they may have this disease.  It occurs as fat cells multiply--almost instantaneously--throughout a victim's body.  Investigators believe it was probably bioengineered, but it may also be the result of some as-yet-unknown superpower.  This footage from one earlier such incident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella watched the screen in amazement, as, on the screen, a beautiful, slender Indian woman--had she seen her before?  Hadn't she been in some movie?--began to scream, staring at suddenly-pudgy hands, which reached down to hold instantaneous folds of new belly fat.  The woman's face, on-screen, became contorted and monstrous, her eyes white and huge as, with a howl of rage, she turned her expanding rump toward the video cameras in an attempt to walk away on legs that had doubled in size.  \"That was former Bollywood star, R--\"  Bella suddenly realized, with a shudder, that behind the Indian woman was the metro station on Thomas Street!  Glad I didn't go there, she thought.  She hugged her graceful body, under the quilt, protectively.  Herman laughed.  \"Look at that!\" he said.  \"It's hilarious!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll continued to give you the details as we get them,\" continued the anchor, \"but now let's go to the camera crews, who are outside of Guldhelm, where victims are being contained so as to avoid further contagion.\"  Ah, thought Bella.  Good.  Godspeed to everyone who was rounding up these women.  It frightened her to no end to think that her own, perfect, body could somehow billow, like a sail, out of all control, just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  She felt slightly bad for the women who HAD been so unfortunate, but they couldn't exactly be free to roam around.  Also, she knew how vengeful less attractive women could be.  Let the fatties loose, and within a few days, the entire city would be full of morbidly obese women.  Hospital costs and insurance would rise astronomically, an economic and health crisis would ensue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman turned to her.  \"Good thing you're with me, eh?  Stay here, if you want to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said.  I think I might.\"  Then, at once, her blood froze.  There, on the television, she caught a glimpse of a familiar--and yet, unfamiliar--face.  Her roommate Francesca--Lantern--now fatter than she had ever feared becoming--was being herded, along with a number of other hulking women in blue robes--into Guldhelm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francesca!\" she whispered.  She thought, for a minute, that she should do something--protest, anything--to prevent her friend from being herded into the prison like some criminal.  But then she remembered the swelling body of that Indian woman, and peered under the quilt at her own perfect legs, stomach, and breasts, recently held by her first lover.  At last, she was loved.  She could not risk this--risk losing this--for the sake of a few unfortunate women.  Anyway, it was only for a few days, they had said on the news.  But just in case, all the same, she'd better stay away from her now-fat friend--even from their house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, would you really mind if I stayed with you?\" she asked Herman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, feigning annoyance.  \"I SUPPOSE that's okay,\" he said, taking her hand from the quilt, and kissing it.  Grey eyes met Hazel eyes, and he continued to kiss up her arm.  \"I don't think, though, my goddess-queen, that it's time for you to put that dress back on yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you?\" she said, feigning incomprehension.  And they were, at once, moving together, like thunder and lightning.  And this time, she remembered it.  Mostly.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Mother sat back on her throne, in her oaken room filled with picture frames--some full of beautiful children, some empty--and she pushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuunghh...where...is...Huuuhhhmmmessengr?\" she screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wrinkled, merciful hand cleared a little of the sweat off The Mother's smooth but beaded brow, pushing dark gold curls back out of her face.  \"Just concentrate on breathing and pushing, dear,\" said The Moon, sympathetically.  \"It'll be over soon.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooouuhhh....think....IIIII...dooooon't...knowthat?\" Bella retorted.  \"You think I haven't done enough of this by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Honey,\" said The Moon, looking away from The Mother and around the room at the pictures--of ten children, in all--\"I'm afraid you haven't.  Not yet.\"  The Mother groaned in pain and rage, then fell back on her pillow.  Only she, thought the crone, catching sight of the first tiny head, only she could possibly still look beautiful while in labor.  The triplets on the way would bring the total up to thirteen.  Thirteen perfect little ones, who would be strong, young gods--who would help the Seven rule the earth.  The idea was exhiliarating as it was frightening, for gods did not always cooperate.  But the earth badly needed ruling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harvest,\" spoke a sudden male voice, laughing.  As the golden-eyed little one began its scream.  \"She will be as fertile as her mother, and will bless the earth with crops and withhold them when needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harvest,\" repeated The Moon, enveloping the tiny, wriggling arms and legs in yellow cloth.  \"She's as beautiful as The Mother,\" she cooed to Bella.  \"Look.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messenger!\" screamed The Mother, pushing once again.  \"Messenger, WHY weren't you here today?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Messenger stroked The Mother's moist hair, and kissed her glowing cheek, but she swatted him off.  \"I am here, honey.  This is my part in it all.  Your part is the bearing, mine the naming.  This is the way--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice for you!\" barked The Mother.  \"This...unnghhh...isss....SECOND....TIME!\" she groaned, sobbing as she delivered her twelfth child.  \"The second time you haven't been here for the birth!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tiny cry, another godling in the arms of The Moon.  \"He is Wealth!\" shouted Hermes.  \"He will give or withhold good trade from humans and metahumans.\"  Finishing his pronouncement, he added, \"I'm sorry, Honey.  You know how busy times are just now...just so much administration has to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...ugnng...don't....CARE, Herman!\"  The Mother said, albeit in a whisper.  \"You....uughhh...are my hus.....band.  YOU....ghhhh....got me into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sweet.  And I'm not sorry, both because I love you, and because it had to happen.  To be fair, though,\" he smiled, slightly, \"while I certainly claim Wealth, I do think Harvest looks quite a bit more like The Sun.  And he is not here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly fell out off the birth throne trying to punch his face.  Moon pulled her back on, shooting a disapproving look at The Messenger.  \"Not now,\" she whispered to him.  \"Just keep pushing, you're almost done, honey,\" she said to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" resumed The Mother.  \"YOU are the one who tricked me into being part of this...this...SICK little arrangement!  ALWAYS being FUCKED and pregnant!  Always having children crawling out of me!  So you're DAMN right you're the one who needs to be here!  You son of a BITCH!\"  For a moment, she reminded the part of The Messenger that was Hermes of his vindictive stepmother.  He had seen it before.  But this passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, we've talked about this so many times,\" he said, taking her hand.  \"It's the only way to save the world.  You KNOW we need gods to take control of things.  The metahumans, the humans, the blobs and the LOST...they're out of control, and they need gods to rule them again.  And you KNOW you're the Fertility...the only one of us that can bear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I KNOW...all right.  And....unnghhh...I....don't....CARE!\"  Shortly after marrying The Messenger, she had been amazed at the suggestion that she should sleep with some of the other gods.  They had explained that it was important to maintain balance of power between them, but even so, she refused.  At last, when most governments collapsed, and the Seven became rulers of a very unstable world, she allowed artificial insemination, but a part of her hated all of them for not understanding how repugnant the idea was to a girl who had been human.  Everything was so crazy, now.  So wrong.  \"I want my old life!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hon, nobody has their old life anymore.  Everyone's 'old life' has been sacrificed.  I'm sorry for your sacrifices, but they need gods, they need rulers, so that we can restore some semblance of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK....THE....GODS!\" she screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see a head,\" cried The Moon.  \"This one's almost out!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck all of you....unnghhh....gods.....I...just...want...to.....aiighhh!...be humanagain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's out!\" cackled The Moon, gathering him up.  The Messenger tried to kiss The Mother again, but she turned her face away.  He stood up to make his usual birthtime decree\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is...\" he began, \"this one...is...huh.  This one is called...  Well, that's strange.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked The Moon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not sure why, but I can't find a name for this one.  It's a boy.\"  The Messenger sounded perplexed.  The Mother even thought she heard a note of resentment in his voice.  \"This one...very strange, but this one...might not be a god...at all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him to me!\" shouted Bella, with her remaining strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said The Messenger, relieving himself of the burden, and proudly taking up the other two children, one in each arm.  \"So strange,\" he said.  \"Honey, you were wonderful, as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mother did not answer.  She was looking down into a tiny red face, that to anyone else besides her and The Messenger, would have looked exactly like the other two--perhaps, just slightly, less perfect.  The Messenger, his father, had been clueless, but she had read plenty of mythology in her time, and she knew exactly what to name the child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, my little darling boy, to a crazy world\" she whispered.  \"A world you will never rule, and yet of all these children, you are the greatest gift to us, my little Prometheus.\"  She pulled up her shirt and lifted the tiny face to her swollen breast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling,\" said The Messenger, holding the other two, \"you don't have to do that, you know.  We have wet nurses.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she shouted.  \"This one is mine.  Go ahead and take the other two, if you really want.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Messenger shrugged.  Twenty-first century women, he thought.  There was a time, when a mortal girl would have been proud as anything to bear so many children, and to a god, at that.  Much less to learn that she herself was a goddess!  Especially when her children would save the world, as these two would.  He felt hurt by his wife, and distant from her--a distance which he would have gladly reconciled, but she held him away--had held him away for years, though she knew as well as he that times were hard, and required work on both their parts--he in naming, calling order out of disorganization so that communication between gods and men would be possible--and she in bearing, filling the chaotic void with teeming life.  Both of their parts were vital, and hers, he admitted, perhaps moreso.  They all knew that she was the most important one, and they treated her as such.  Why then, this resentment?  Was The Emperor right?  Was she merely spoiled, like so many of the young people of her generation?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been unable--utterly unable, as only a soft, spoiled, decadent generation can be (he had seen it, on a smaller scale, with the Babylonians and the Romans, with the Hapsburgs and the Ottomans)--to cope with the crisis of their time.  They had failed the test.  Even before the blob epidemic they were becoming soft and flabby.  Even before the LOST began their uprising they were walking about dead, anesthetized, apathetic.  Before the metahumans came on the scene, they were abusing their power at the expense of the weak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time--less than a second--that it took him to think about these things, he was already across the Courtyard of Ages (where his children played in the branches of the golden apple tree), past the Fountain of Youth, and through five hundred doors, there at the Mountaintop Palace at the Center of Reality.  Ah, his heart glowed.  The nursery.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo-year-old Rain, son of The Wild (and, technically, weirdly, his half-sister), was crying as usual, as Wind, her brother, made funny sounds with his mouth.  His oldest, Justice, was almost five, and was watching over his siblings with a precocious eye.  Genius and Craft, both four, were in the middle of animated conversation, even making puns in ways that did their father proud, as five metahuman nursemaids gave the other little immortals milk, burped and changed and played with them.  So these, he thought, would be the ones.  He would have to train them well, for they would again bring order out of chaos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been foolish, he thought, to laugh at the epidemic when it began.  Out there, in the world, he thought, terrible things were happening--things that even gods and goddesses would not be immune to, though there was cause to hope that their children--nursed with ambrosial milk from the time they were tiny--would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the government of what was, only five years ago! the United States, had done everything they could to contain the epidemic, it had spread like wildfire.  This was because for every four women who had decided to be honorable and turn themselves in or had been captured, there were always four who accidentally transmitted it to someone else first, and three who, driven mad by the loss of beauty, would deliberately pass the virus to someone--their husband's mistress, younger women, models--the more beautiful a woman was, the more quickly she was targeted--and the more quickly she willingly passed the virus on.  Glad he had rescued The Mother from any such fate, he'd laughed at the fact that within a week of the outbreak, there were no more professional models or actresses in the U.S.  He would not have laughed so hard if he'd realized that this would not be another mere disaster.  It was the spark that would soon cause the world to go up in flames.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks, twenty percent of the country's women were infected with the disease.  Prisons, hospitals and new \"containment centers\" swelled with enormous women, as students, wives, doctors, mothers, politicians and media personnel became unable to perform their respective functions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the LOST, a small, cannibalistic group of horrific creatures who had lived in obscurity in the city's metros, took advantage of the chaos to mount an unprecedented attack on humanity.  People who were bitten by the LOST turned into the hideous creatures, eventually and lost the ability to speak with all vestiges of their humanity, but for a few years they became thin, and sometimes darkly beautiful.  Once word got out about this, The Messenger was shocked to see thousands of obese women seeking out the LOST for cosmetic reasons, and the LOST were only too glad to help them, adding to their once-small number.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObese women--dubbed \"the blobs\"--who preferred their humanity to a nice figure, as well as the majority of the metahumans, realized that the LOST were becoming more and more of a threat, and they joined forces to fight the ghouls.  The close association, however, caused about ninety percent of metahuman superheroines to become obese, and therefore, far less effective fighters.  It turned out, however, that women who had become LOST were still able to be affected, moderately, by the epidemic as long as they still resembled humans, and a new strain of fat warrior women with indigo skin and gleaming fangs also, slowly, began to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower on earth was now split between the LOST, the blobs, the metahumans and ordinary humans, but because individuals often fit more than one of these categories, their choice of loyalties was often, seemingly, arbitrary.  Nevertheless, the earth had been drawn and quartered.  And they--the gods--multiplying slowly at the heart of their hidden citadel, thanks to The new Mother, would surely turn earth's most tumultuous age into its best.  The Messenger looked fondly at these children of the gods, more powerful than metahumans, unable to be affected by blobs or LOST.  There had been a verse in some ancient scripture, he remembered, about sons being arrows in their father's quiver.  So it would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen--suddenly--an earthquake.  Was it coming from the Courtyard?  Even as he wondered this, the Messenger was there.  It was twilight.  Then, bursting from the earth, he saw them--dark, monstrous flesh that defied definition, horrible white fangs and eyes.  They began at once to destroy the building, some pummelling it with rock-hard fists, some spraying fire, some working curses, uprooting trees with their mind.  He fought with them all, simultaneously, trying to undo the damage, taking the kids back to the nursery, trying to find the other gods as he traded punches with them.  But there was one he did not see, until she was above him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messenger!\" the voice hissed, and it took all of him there, at once, to see her.  The figure flying wingless above him seemed oddly familiar.  Her eyes glowed with golden light, but around her, or it, there was deep night.  For the second time that day--in his life--he had no idea what a creature was.  He could speak no defining word into the darkness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messenger!\" she repeated, in an odd accent.  \"I see you are confused, so let me help you understand what is happening.  We are the darkness that is behind every light.  We are the Chaos, the Titans, the Hundred-Handed, the Formless...and we are the unravelling of all your plans.\"   The Messenger looked around him.  By now, all the gods and their children--though he did not see Bella--had been gathered there by huge, super-powered women of the night.  He began to understand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand nothing,\" spoke the cold, oppressive, fleshy darkness above him.  \"YOU thought you were above US all this time.  You stood back and let our nations--our bodies--our very souls--go to waste, while you plotted to take advantage of it all, and impose your ill-conceived New World Order.  But though the darkness wrestles with itself, you should have known that it always gathers together against the Light.  Witness your enemies reconciled, contraries and lines blurred in massive dark bodies, filled with primal power equal to your own.  Witness your household captured and children scattered to the wind, your palace shattered and wasted.  We will not allow the gods to rule us again.  As you forsook us, we will forsake you, and you will never again limit, define or name--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francesca?\"  The Messenger heard his wife, and he was suddenly afraid for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe form above him became slightly less dark, and turned.  \"Who is that?\" called the icy, accented voice.  Was it--was it an Italian accent? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am The Mother,\" said his golden-haired goddess, serenely, queenly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you are the one who--wait--Bella?  Bella Hauge?  Is that you?  YOU are The Mother?\"  The Messenger could make out a fat, dark face hovering above him now.  It looked puzzled, though the other women--along with a few metahuman LOST males--continued to destroy the celestial palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francesca, what's happened to you?\" said Bella, approaching the form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella!  Stay away!\" shouted Messenger.  \"She can infect you, still!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can!\" laughed the form.  \"I can and I will, now.  How could you have betrayed your kind, Bella?  How could you have joined with these so-called gods?  I assumed you had died--we all did--all those years ago.  This is far worse.  You've betrayed metahumans--betrayed your own kind, scheming to lord it over all of us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella took The Messenger's hand.  Her own was still clammy from childbed, and it clutched his in its weakness.  \"I'm sorry,\" she said to Francesca.  \"I fell in love, and I was so frightened of becoming...becoming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe form lowered itself to the ground and The Messenger was surprised at how human the face now looked.  Also, how...understanding?  \"Of becoming like me,\" she said.  \"I don't blame you, but Bella, look at YOU.  They've made you stupidly, weakly dependent on them, dominated BY them, just as they plan to do to the rest of us.  Do not fear becoming like me; fear remaining like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella,\" said The Messenger, tremblingly.  \"Don't listen to her, it's...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Husband.  Shhh,\" said Bella.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" continued Bella's altered roommate, \"how heartbroken I was after...after THIS happened to me, the first time.\"  She gripped a fold of her fat between her clawed fingers.  \"Jack left me...left me just like that.  We were going to be married, you remember.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when that happened, I was inconsolable.  But slowly, slowly, I began to realize how WEAK I had been.  To depend on a man like that--I was so pathetic.  When I chose to become one of the LOST, as well, it wasn't so that I could be some man's toy again--some pathetic dropper of babies.  Don't you see,\" she said, fangs glistening in a smile,\"for the first time, women truly are empowered.  WE are the stronger ones, now, not the men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But society is coming apart...\" started Bella.  \"I've seen that much.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A society that was oppressive, perpetuating hierarchy, slavery and misogyny for thousands of years.  Now, at last, we are free of being sexualized objects,\" she said, stroking her enormous belly \"--to all but a few weird perverts, that is.  And we are free of domination, by men or gods.\"  Francesca held out a claw, glowing with cold darkness.  \"When I look at you, I see exactly the creature I would have--gladly, pathetically--become.  And here you are, popping children out--being used by these old, patriarchal gods to perpetuate their so-called 'order.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" but Bella was speechless.  Was it really possible that her now-huge, soulless, empowered roommate pitied HER?  She looked across the courtyard at her trembling children.  Who knew what would happen to them, and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, I don't blame you,\" said Francesca, \"because you said you fell in love.  When I was more naive, and...smaller...and the epidemic broke out, I would probably have made the same choice.  But now, you have an option.  Join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Bella.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up your so-called 'beauty.'  That standard is really just a need to be validated by men and gods, causing alienation--give it up, and become one with us.  Cleave to the Titans, the chaos, the darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella felt The Messenger's hand tighten around her own.  She pulled her hand away from her lean husband and took a step toward her hulking, former roommate.  \"I betrayed you,\" she said.  \"I'm sorry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the Chaos,\" said the fanged mouth.  We cannot offer you forgiveness or redemption, as gods claim to.  You cannot placate us.  You can only join us, and thereby be loved by us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, please!  Remember your children!\" screamed The Messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" said Bella, taking another step toward the LOST metahuman blob.  Toward Francesca.  She thought of the many, many children, whom she had borne, and barely known, for so many years.  Would the gods really do this--make all women mere \"mothers,\" instead of letting them have power, agency?  But then, she thought of Prometheus--merely human Prometheus--would the Chaos show mercy, in the end, to anything that did not join it?  Including mere humans?  She looked again at her tiny waist, a divine incubator, nearly perfectly flat already.  She looked at her husband, at all the gods, whom she so hated and loved.  She had never particularly liked the look of most of them.  She would, she realized, give up her body, surrendering to either fate.  But did both require her humanity?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was falling down, around her, but surely, if she chose him, The Messenger could help her escape.  Francesca, icily, said, \"The Chaos is hungry, always hungry, Bella.  You must stop thinking about your choice.  You must make one, now, or I will make it.\"  Saying that, she reached toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Messenger shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing tear-filled eyes, The Mother, Freya, Bella Hauge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...chose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she walked down there, she could die as easily as any other woman.  Probably more easily, if she wore these heels.  She was just about to make herself walk down there when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Freya!\" shouted one of the nearby women, holding the paw of a husband who stood staring stupidly, bedazzled by Bella's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...what?\" Freya shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do something, Miss Superhero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAren't you gonna check out the disturbance?

That you're some kind of slutty superheroine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't let them get to you, don't let them get to you, don't let them get to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face felt hot.  She was aware that the men seemed even more under her spell when she was angry, but she was ceasing to care.  Let them drool.  \"Yeah, whatever, ma'am.  Please excuse me while I save your fat ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Slutgirl, please do--don't let me stop you from making an actual CONTRIBUTION to the welfare of this city for a change--by dying.  What're you gonna do about an explosion anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go down there instead, then?\" challenged Bella.  \"If you think my job is so easy, why don't you go down there and risk death to save this ----ed-up city...\"  she was ranting now.  This was not wise.  She needed to just go.  But then she heard the woman shout back, behind her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, good idea.  At least I wouldn't be dying a virgin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya turned around.  The goddess was enraged.  Had she a cooler head, she would have pointed out the foolishness of making fun of her for both supposedly being a slut and a virgin.  But this was more than she could take.  The woman, short and squat, in a black-and-white checkered skirt, began to look slightly afraid, but stood her ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked for it, lady,\" screamed Bella, and tackled her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin thirty seconds, Bella was pinned down by the ample posterior of her checker-clad heckler.  The policewomen, however, picked up Bella.  It was a serious crime for any superhero to attack a non-powered citizen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was humiliated, and also deprived, more or less, of her powers in prison, which was of course not co-ed.  When she left two years later, it was with a few more bruises and hard knocks than she had had going in.  But also with a few new friends on the inside.  And so, the glamorous superheroine once known as Freya began her long life of crime.  But that's another story.</span></div></div>",

In that time, the world had become a very strange place indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that there had been a \"fat plague\"--a mysterious epidemic affecting only women and--at least in its initial stages--highly contagious.  It had ravaged the world, beginning nearly as soon as Bella had been put in prison.  Women who were infected had found themselves doubling and tripling their body weight in mere hours (or, in less extreme cases, mere weeks).  Superheroines, for some reason, were particularly vulnerable to it.  All that, of course, had been in the outside, where the government could do little to regulate the lives of free citizens, among whom the virus spread (thanks in no small part to the malice and envy of formerly-beautiful-turned-suddenly-obese women) quickly among the ranks of the most attractive girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrison, however, was a different story.  Here, control could be maintained, and all prisoners infected with the disease were kept well away from other prisoners--with the result that Bella was possibly the last beautiful woman and (former) superheroine to keep her figure.  And she intended to use that to her advantage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, not only were men--and superheroes--reduced to near-immobility in her presence; women would be quite unable to stop her as well.  She pictured her former svelte, health freak roommate, Felicity--Blur--weighing perhaps three hundred pounds, now, huffing and puffing as she tried to catch Bella after this or that theft.  Stopping for donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella took off her glove (she kept her entire body other than her face covered in order to prevent infection) and used her fingertip to open a search engine on her computer (which she had bought, along with an apartment, days before).  She could essentially take anything from anywhere now, and the only women who would have been able to stop her were, by this time, immensely fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her fingers on the keypad, she typed in...</span></div></div>",

An evil smile spread across her face as she looked through their whole inventory online, loving all the items she saw. Oh yes, this is the place for me to rob she decided. With that she logged off the computer, put her gloves back on. She didn't bother to put on a mask as everyone knew who she was and she loved to show off her beautiful face which she knew was the only left thanks to the \"fat plague\". She headed into the garage of her building, got into her pink bmw and drove off to \"Tiffany's Jewlers\". She pulled up in front of the store, jumped out, and headed into the store. She was glad that there was no customers there as that meant less people for her to deal with and less hassle. She also loved that all the workers in the store were men. She just looked over at them with a seductive smile, blew them a kiss, and they all feel to the floor temporarily paralyzed. With an evil laugh, she walked over to the guy that was a manager, pulled a key off of him, grabbed a bag, and then opened the cases. She then began rooting through the cases, filling her bag with all of the jewerly she wanted. This is too easy she thought to hereself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a voice rang out, \"I knew I would find you here\" an angry female voice called out. Bella looked up and nearly gasped before a big smile spread across her face. It was her former roomate Felicity known as the Blur. Her name really should be the blob now that she is so fat she thought to herself.  \"Wow Felicity, you got huge. You are a total fat ass, a piggy\" she teased with an evil laugh. \"I had heard that the 'Fat Plague' was making lots of women, particularly superheriones fat but never did I think it would make one as fat as you are\" she said. Bella know that Felicity had always been jealous of her and she had to admit that she was enjoying teasing her. \"I bet you really wish that you had my beauty and my perfect body now huh?\" she asked vainly as she spun around, showing her beauty and body off to make fun of Felicity before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always thought you were a god. You were too into yourself to be a good superione. I am so glad that you are now a supervillaness so I can finally kick your ass and put you in jail\" Felicity said. While she was hurt by Bella's words, they had also angered her and she was ready to beat up Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me laugh fat ass. You can't even catch me up\" Bella said with an evil laugh. \"In fact, I will give you a free shot to attack me. I will just stand here and see if you can run over to me\" she said knowing that in no way would Felicity would be able to run over to her in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew your being a dumb blonde would pay off for me one day, thanks. Prepare to get your skinny booty kicked\" Felicity said. She started into her superspped run but just like Bella had predicted she couldn't run. Not as steady on her feet as she once was now with all of this extra weight and paying more attention to Bella's smug face and not where she was going, Felicity tripped over one of the jewels that Bella had discared and fell hard on the floor with a a thud. She was so fat that the thun was pretty hard and shook the buidling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I knew it! Fatty\" Bella sneered with an evil laugh. She then bounced over to Felicity and began to run around her, doing a sexy victory dance that showed off her body.</span></div></div>",

Her mentor at the Academy of Heroic Arts had been one of those Yoda-Miagi types who insisted that they NOT use their powers whenever possible.  As a result, she'd been sent on many a training mission, expected to run, but not allowed to warp space while she did so.  She still thought the whole idea had been idiotic.  The result was, that, at the end of the year, she'd had no more control over her powers of speed than she'd had going in--even if she had lost the college fifteen--and then some.  On the other hand, she'd come to enjoy running--the normal, slow way--to the point where she was now addicted to that euphoric feeling you got after doing about a mile or so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone was going off.  She stopped, pulling it from her waistband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Feliss?\" came her roommate's voice.  \"It's Bella.  Um...there's something going on over here that you should check out.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some kind of disturbance at the metro on Thomas Street.  I'd go, but my powers aren't exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity rolled her eyes.  Bella called herself \"Freya\" after the Norse goddess of love and beauty.  Really, the only thing she was able to do with her power was cause men to drool and go momentarily comatose.  She was surprised she had ever graduated, and even more surprised that she had managed to stop a supervillain, once.  Felicity, called \"The Blur,\" had stopped about twenty-three, by contrast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Bell.  I'll be right over.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she thought, a quick change.  She loved her power, she thought, as a warp field formed around her, and immediately she was running up the street, opening the door of her house, washing her hair, (admiring--for less than a second--her lean, muscular figure, heart-shaped face with its thin, graceful lips, framed by long brown hair), sliding on her favorite jeans, sneakers and costume top (people only wore the leotards for photo ops), and now she was The Blur, speeding down Aiken toward Thomas Street, where her perfect, blonde roommate was waiting for her in a tiny yellow summer dress.  In all, the journey took about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kept you so long?\" teased Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.  What's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned if I know,\" Bella said, tossing her curls, dismissively.  \"Sounds explosivey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity looked over to the metro entrance.  People, spooked, streamed out, along with smoke, but no one looked injured yet. \"Hmm.  Looks explosivey,\" she said.  \"I'll be right back.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metro entrance, people and steps blurred past her.  The smoke seemed to come from a door somewhere beyond the tracks, which she was able to gain enough momentum to leap over.  She rocketed through the door, noticed, with a shudder, the crouching forms of the LOST crouching around a dead man.  She realized with a chill that they were eating him, but she still couldn't see what the source of the explosion was.  She raced past them, reluctant to turn her back.  She was in a laboratory of some kind, where a voluminous amount of smoke issued from an entire panel of machinery.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know technology still looked like that,\" Blur said.  \"I guess that's the answer to our riddle.  Now, I guess I'd better grab that poor man's body.  What was he doing back here?  What is this place?  And...what is that?\"  A bright light, issuing from one of the more odd-looking machines, seemed to be bouncing off metal walls.  And now, it came toward her.  Blur was fast, and though she could see light moving, it often moved quicker than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to run, she felt something strike her on the back of her head, knocking her over.  Getting up, she ran past the ghouls in the hallway, who were just turning their heads in her direction, out of the metro and into the sun.  </span></div></div>",

Then she recognized her.  \"Hey, aren't you that superhero...that fast girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now I'm your customer!  I need food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, no need to yell.  Um...would you like to supers--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity waited for what seemed to her like two days.  She was not hungry, particularly, but all she could think about was the texture of that burger as her teeth sank into it...  She knew it was all a little crazy, but she had to have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hon?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your order's up, hon.  Have a nice day.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyoubye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not wait the half-second it would have taken her to get home from here.  Immediately sitting on one of the plastic benches, she dove in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Rhonda saw and what Blur saw were two different things, of course.  Blur, impatient as she had never been before, ripping the paper off the burgers like a lover's clothes (and when that taxed her patience too much, simply biting into the burgers, wrapper and all), was still in warp mode.  Her eyes rolled back into her head as she took her first, second and last bite of the first big mac.  Oh God, it was heavenly.  Oh God.  Oh.  She felt, oddly, she thought, a tightness about the waist as she licked her fingers and prepared to lift another burger to her mouth.  She loved the feeling, the taste, she reached for a third, of the burger itself, in some way better BECAUSE it was--a fourth--cheap and bad for her.  Oh gosh, she thought, as the tightness persisted.  She reached down with one hand and attempted to undo the top button of her jeans.  She gasped a little when her hand grazed her midriff, and it was soft to the touch.  So I'll diet tomorrow, she thought, picking up two shakes and slurping them down at once.  She wiped her face, and was surprised to feel that it ALSO had an unprecedented softness.  In fact, the heart shape had filled out a great deal, and part of her shake was sliding down a second chin.  If she had been in her right mind, of course, she would have been horrified.  But as she was, she reached for another burger, and a few supersized packs of fries, and then another, and another, reveling, moaning, and--yes, she felt it, it was undeniable--growing.  Her sports bra was increasingly snug, and her breasts began to creep from under it onto a waist that was growing waist-less.  Had she not opened her jeans, layers of fat would be spilling over them, but as it was, a pot belly was growing under the table.  As she continued to eat, and her thighs and ass expanded, her belly pressed against the bottom of the table--encountering old pieces of chewing gum and graffiti.  She did not care.  She ate, ate, ate, groaned, and ate more.  Gone from her mind were preoccupations with being a superheroine; gone were all the insecurities, all the uncertainties.  She had found true love, filled with salt and fat.  Then she belched, loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Rhonda saw, on the other hand, was a tiny girl sit down at a table with a tray FULL of food, and in less time than it took Rhonda to blink, the girl and food were completely gone.  What was in its place was...a belching monstrosity.  A woman twice her own size (and she was no twig) who was covered with condiments and belching profusely, as she pushed back strands of brown hair away from her once heart-shaped face.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mm that was so good Felicity thought to herself as she laid back in her seat, gently patting her fat belly before letting out another loud belch. Wow that food was so good that I couldn't get enough. I really didn't know what I was missing. I definitely need to eat that food more often she decided. All that food was starting to make her feel sleepy now so with some effort she slowly got up and headed out of the resturant while patting her belly and letting out some more burps but ones that were not as loud. She decided to head back to the superhero building and go to bed. It didn't enter her thoughts about all the stares and questions she would encounter when she got home.  Rhonda watched with wide eys as the formerly thin superherione walked out of the building and a smile spread across her face. Oh how she had longed to see a superheroine get fat and now that she had, it was even better then she had imagined. She could tell that Felicity aka the Blur was now addicted to fast food and would be back. She would only be to happy to continue to supply Felicity with all the greasy and fattening fast food that she wanted, maybe even for free to turn her into the blob that she could sense that the Blur was on her way into becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity had gone only a short distance when she again spotted trouble. She was walking slower then her normal pace due to how full she was and how big she was. The Lost were attacking again civilians again. What is with them today? They have never unleashed these many attacks before. Maybe that explosion had something to do with it she thought to herself, getting back into superherione mode. She then heard and turned to see a young woman running from a pack of the Lost, screaming for help. She locked eyes with Felicity for one panic stricken moment, her eyes filled with fear before she continued running. Knowing she had to save this young woman's life, she started to go into superspeed but found she couldn't reach it, yet alone run. Her try had left her winded and she had to stop to catch her breathe. She watched helplessly as the young woman was caught and winced as she heard her screams as the Lost took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had Felicity lost before and this was a new feeling for her. She really felt bad and looked away. She had never failed to save someone before. How could I let myself get this fat she thought to herself as she bent over to catch her breathe. As she did so, the buttons on her jeans popped off. She then heard a rip coming from the back of her jeans and felt some air hit her butt. Oh no, how could I let myself get so fat I ruin my clothes. She slowly stood back up and gasped as she saw just how big her belly had gotten. She then heard the call of the Lost. She turned to see that they had finished their feasting on the young woman and were now coming towards her. Oh no, I am next. I am too fat to even run now, there is no way I am escaping. I am done for she thought as she closed her eyes and waited for them to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
