Unfortunately for you, being a young, twenty-something procrastinator, you had work to do for that one class you always seemed to just manage to forget about and put off doing homework for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sighing to yourself after looking out the window for the fifth time that day, you turned back to the open word document, the cursor blinking, poised and ready for this project to get underway. The dorm room you live in seems more like a prison of sorts, four white walls, sparsely decorated, a bed and a desk for writing. Of course, unlike a prison, you are free to come and go as you please, but you knew that work had to get done soon to save you from the doomed path of failure. You contemplate the idea of being rescued from this boring scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your eyes drift to the poster hanging just  to your left. An action shot of one of your video gaming idols, The Blue blur himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. You sigh with a smile as you imagine your hero coming to whisk you away from this place to take you on a fantastic adventure. Where would you go? What would you do? Your mind wandered with possibility as your eyes continued to drift over the poster, from his brilliantly green eyes, to his casually cocky smirk, and eventually working their way down to his sneaker clad feet. You chuckle to yourself, thinking back on \"those\" websites that you frequented, searching for art or stories about your hero and the devious positions that he would find himself in, mostly focusing on what was hidden inside of those famous red and white shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually you snap yourself out of the daydream that you are having and return your attention to the still-blank word document on your computer screen. Frowning, you begin to do diligently research the topic that you would be presenting and get into a groove. The work begins to almost pour out of you, the thoughts of Sonic are now only in the back of your mind as you focus on your research. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You keep at this pace for a good click, losing track of time. The click-clack of the keys keeps up at a soothing, rhythmic pace. You come to the end of the final paragraph of the paper and smile to yourself, proud of the work you have accomplished. You begin to prep for the next phase of your assignment and begin to re-read your work. You eventually get to the last paragraph and your heart skips several beats. The words \"The one, The only.\" repeat themselves for entire sentences. You blink and rub your eyes, surely they must be playing tricks on you. When you open them, you notice the paragraph begins to delete itself and types itself out in a blue font. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cblue\">\"It's time to play with the one and only.\"</span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panicking, you begin to try to delete it, but you feel your eyes grow heavy as a warm sensation washes over you. Your body begins to relax and you drift off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hours later, you open your eyes and hear a familiar voice say, <span class=\"cblue\">Hey kid.</span> Looking around you see....</span></div></div>",

How about the 2 of us play for awhile?\" The giant fox said as you were stunned at what he said. The same fox who sounded so nice turned into someone who wanted to have fun with you. \"Are you crazy? I can't be your toy!\" You said as Tails had a tighter grip on you. \"Don't worry I won't kill you.\" He said.

Meanwhile, you were getting saliva on your face from Tails making out with you. He then stopped and started to rip your shirt and then the rest of your clothes off. \"Aaahhh much better!\" He says and then proceeds to take one giant lick on your whole body. \"Mmm, you taste good.\" He said, licking you one more time. You felt a little bit turned on by this as Tails put you on the ground. Then he crouched down towards you at sat down. You were pinned under the Giant Fox's balls. \"MMMPH!!!\" You felt yourself being suffocated by the giant fox's balls while Tails himself was jacking off from you being under his balls. He then started smothering you with him balls while he continues to jack off. \"Mmmmm suffocate under me slave, you know you want to.\" He taunted as you were still suffocating under him. Luckily, he got up a little as he still wanted you alive. You gasp when he got up, having fresh air again. It then wasn't long till he sat on you again.

Either way, it made you hopeful that the gigantic fox boy would get up and finally spot you. But to your combined surprise and horror he resorted to a different solution to the curious feeling. \"It\u2019s probably nothing.\" His words echoed in your head. Without even getting up and looking to see what was down there, he simply decided to ignore it and stay seated. You struggled defiantly, trying to get him to reconsider, not wanting him to remain on top of you for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tell if your struggles were actually getting the fox\u2019s attention and they weren\u2019t doing anything towards helping you squirm free from this embarrassing prison. His body didn\u2019t budge an inch, however, the godlike fox did eventually react to your efforts. Though this response was not a reward for you by any means. Feeling that strange tickle picking up again, Tails shifted his rear back and forth a bit mashing you harder into the seat. Then without warning, he released a monsterous fart directly onto you. You were positioned right by the source of it all so when the hot, putrid has escaped him, you were hit with a majority of the blast. The heat seemed to sap your energy and the odor made you gag desperately trying to get air back in your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing no one was around to hear or smell that\" you heard him say to himself ina relieved tone. Tails felt relieved in many ways. The pressure from the gas was out and it seemed that that odd tickling sensation was gone as well. He figured the tickle was simply related to the fart building up and smiled happy to have that problem resolved. You on the other hand were completely and utterly devistated physically from that gas attack. Your mind kept screaming escape as a burning sensation filled you. Using what little energy you had remaining, you desperately tried to get out from under this titan one last time.  </span></div></div>",

The giant pondered for a moment before figuring that there was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT*  You barely understood what was going on as a second assault destroyed your pathetic form. The giant who you were trapped under had released a second blast of air, this one more powerful and horrific than the last. The thunderous sound deafened you as the violent vibrations shook you to your core. By the time the heat and smell started to hit you you could barely remain conscious for more than a few seconds. \"Aahhh...\" you heard tails sigh in relief once more as every distracting irritant seemed to vanish for the giant. Everything went black as the rancid air burned all your senses at once and you soon passed out underneath the unaware fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass before you awaken. Though you weren\u2019t sure how long you were out, you quickly noticed that the horrendous smells were still lingering causing you to gag and your eyes to water. As you struggled to get over the horrifying stench that seemed to stick to your form, you noticed something: the giant was gone. You were no longer being sat on. It was just you laying on his seat with nothing besides his lingering stench. \"I wonder where he went?\" you thought aloud, quickly shutting your mouth as you started to taste the foul air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you felt minor tremors signaling that the giant was returning.

Within the next few days a small planet was to appear in the sky over <b>Neverlake</b> and you weren't going to miss it this time!  You enthusiastically packed your things and set off, just brimming with excitement to see it. Thanks to the remote and almost unknown location, it took awhile to get there even with a car, especially since you had to navigate a few miles on foot. Despite the multiple hurdles both figuratively and literally, you arrived at the foot of the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After looking around a little, you found a satisfactory viewing spot and went back to get your things. But on the way back you noticed something across the lake, a bunch of machinery, small buildings, and a odd looking (mainly because it was shaped like a pair of glasses and a ludicrously long and bushy mustache) rock pillar. After gazing at it for awhile longer you came to the brilliant deduction that there were other people here, and not some coincidentally vacationing person or family either, but some kind of corporation or business. You groaned in annoyance now knowing that there were other people here besides yourself, but then figured as long as they stayed on the other side of the lake and you stayed on your side there'd be no trouble, considering you didn't bring much and would be hard to notice this far away. But you still found it odd that other people were here, especially what you assumed to be an entire business operation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You decided to ignore it until you saw something even stranger, some kind of cartoon'ish and animal looking machine hauling a bunch of smaller animals into one of the buildings. After some thought you decided to sneak around the lake and investigate what it or they were doing. You made your way around the mass of water being careful not to be spotted or caught and came up to the relatively small building, watching for any other machines to come by. Give or take an hour or so later, you decided the coast was clear and entered the building. Once inside you ducked behind some kind of console and slowly peered around the corner to see if anything was guarding the place. Oddly enough, there wasn't, just a lot of metallic junk you didn't understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly after you left your hiding space, you started to look around and explore more. You still couldn't find any trace of that machine or the animals, but you did find some weird looking devices. Letting your curiosity once again take over, you walked over to one of them and began to mess around with it. After pressing a few buttons, you were suddenly shot with a laser and fell backwards onto the floor. You immediately checked where you were hit to see if you were hurt or not, thankfully you weren't. You gave a sigh of relief then got up, eyeing your surroundings again you became confused, for some reason everything appeared bigger than before, a LOT BIGGER. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You soon realised you had been shrunk down and that the device that you just accidentally used on yourself was all the way back on the table. Seeing how their was no way to get to it, you started to panic a little. You started to frantically look around for something to help your current situation, but unfortunately everything that looked like it could possibly help was to high up for you to retrieve. Suddenly you started to hear the pounding of shoes in the distance coming closer, instinctively you start to run, though you soon stop, realising you were only going about a centimeter a step, and thanks to that fact you most likely wouldn't be able to outrun whoever was coming. So you dart around the corner of a table and hide, as the footsteps drew closer you also started to hear maniacal laughter coming from their source. After working up some courage, you looked back around the corner and saw what you presumed was the owner of all these machines and buildings. And damn, he was huge, and not just from your now small perspective and form, he was so fat that his torso formed a perfect sphere, somehow. He also had roughly the same face as the one you previously saw on that rock earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately or unfortunately, he didn't seem to notice you, he just grabbed something off the table and walked away. You watched him walk... ' wait what? ', you thought as you saw him step onto a circular platform and disappear. After some thought, you decided to follow him, thinking that you could explain your situation to him (leaving out the detail of seeing most of his work) so he might be able to help, it was probably the best option you had at this point so you went with it. Luckily the platform he stepped on wasn't too far off the ground, so you could get on it, you hesitantly made your way to it still thinking over this decision. After taking a big gulp, you stepped onto the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Almost immediately a blue flash engulfed your eyesight, and before you could rethink your decision you were in a completely different area. Besides a few metallic objects here and there you were surrounded by what appeared to be a grassland, but the thing was the \"grass\" was an unnatural color and all the flora looked alien. You quickly got off the machine and started looking for the man you just saw. Though you didn't see him anywhere, you noticed a subtle disturbance in the grace, leading off in one direction, assuming it was somehow made by him, you started to follow it. Though the grass was treaded upon, it was still difficult to navigate through it. It was like a jungle, the grass being like trees and the occasional insect like a beast, thankfully none of the \"beasts\" were interested in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually despite your effort, you became lost. You no longer knew where you were going, not that you knew that in first place, the disturbance left behind slowly faded away and now you were just heading in a certain direction. You had no map or compass considering you left them back at the lake side, nor any provisions. the only thing you did have were your clothes, so if you didn't find something soon you would expire. You soon stopped and sat down exhausted from your journey, your legs felt like they were weighed down and you were sweating bullets. You looked up at the sky, contemplating your predicament, if only you didn't become suspicious and investigate you wouldn't be in this mess, you wouldn't of died here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then something catches your eye, right there, up in the sky, there was the lake. Dumbfounded, you blinked a couple of times then rubbed your eyes, you looked back up and to your amazement, the lake was still there. You couldn't believe what you were seeing, how the hell did it end up there? Then you had the realization, you weren't just looking at <b>Neverlake</b>, you were looking at the earth... you were on the planet that appears over the lake! The realization hit you like a brick, you couldn't think of anything else or move, all you could do was just stare at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then suddenly you felt a small vibration, which you wrote off as an animal, but as it came closer it felt more rhythmic, like something... Walking? You snap out of your daze and get up, hearing where the tremors were coming from you got out of the assumed way, and not sure of what was coming, you hid behind a blade of grass and waited. For some reason unknown to you the tremors slowed then stopped at what sounded like mere feet away from your current position. You listened intentivly for another sound or movement, but besides the wind you couldn't hear anything but silence. You started to wonder why it stopped, desperately trying to come up with a reason or answer, you failed to noticed the rustling sound coming from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your panicked thoughts were soon replaced by simple fear as you felt a hot breath touch your back. You slowly turned around anticipating what you would be faced with, the first thing you saw was a pitch black snout, a mere centimeter away from your body. You then noticed the creatures massive eyes staring down at you, outlined by brown fur. Your fight or flight instinct immediately kicked in but you couldn't move, you were frozen with fear. Then suddenly the creature stood straight up, revealing that it was simply a squirrel, a enormous squirrel at that, and let out a loud squeak while remaining still as to signal something. The vibrations from before soon returned and stopped right behind you. Before you could do anything, you saw a massive gloved hand come down over the squirrel and pet it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look up and see the arm of whoever was behind you, it was furry and pink. You then saw another hand come down to your side and just lay there, almost like it wanted you to get on it. You turned back around to see the person, and to your surprise it wasn't a person at all. It appeared to be a gigantic pink anthropomorphic animal wearing an orange skirt overlayed by a green top, based on how it was dressed it looked to be a female. She stared back down at you seemingly happy and intrigued, you looked back at her hand then back at her not sure how to respond to her gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After thinking it over, you decided to trust her for now and hesitantly crawled onto her palm. She simply smiled before suddenly raising you high up in the air and forming a railing around you with her fingers to keep you from falling. The squirrel from earlier climbed up her other arm and ran across her shoulders, then it slowly and carefully  made it's way down her other arm to you. It started sniffing you which caused the pink creature to snicker a little before she started to walk again. After thanking her for her help, you asked where she was going, she...</span></div></div>",

Your memory of the past few days was hazy at best. You vaguely remember is walking down a path through the woods. After that, everything is a blank. Snapping back into the present. You could tell by the texture of the ground that you weren't in the woods. The ground felt different. Softer than the woods would be. Plus th odd fragrance in the air. As curiosity overcame your drowsiness, you finally opened your eyes to get a look at where you were. It took a few moments for your vision to adjust to the light, but when it did your senses were bombarded with something which convinced you that you were still dreaming. \"Why is everything so...\", you couldn't finish the sentence, but if someone else was there to hear you, they'd know what the next word would be... well probably. Everything, the ground, the sky most of your surroundings, were different shades of pink. The ground extended for miles of nothing but pink... grass? Wait, that can't be grass, it feels too different, almost like\" you paused as you looked around once more as you took in more of your surroundings, \"... a carpet.\" The ground certainly seemed like an endless expanse of pink carpet. If that was true, then the pink 'sky' must be the ceiling of a gigantic room stretching miles above you. \"Is that... how is... everything is so big.\" you stuttered. You looked left and right and realized that everything around you looked like the contents of someone's bedroom, a girl's most likely due to all of the pink. But how can something this large exist? Is the room really this big? Have you shrunk? This has to be a dream. You tried to wake up from this bizarre dream, pinching yourself and eventually resorting to a slap or two, but nothing worked, you remained right here in the giant pink room. Your mind struggles to process the possibility that this might actually be reality... somehow. Before you could ponder more on that thought, you noticed a large shadow being cast over you. Turning around, you saw a MASSIVE pair of red and white boots towering above you like buildings. Much to your relief, the boots had no wearer at the moment, though the thought of something large enough to wear them provided you with a new sense of dread. You had no clue what you could do, but you just knew standing here in the middle of this gigantic bedroom was extremely dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ground started to shake. The vibrations grew more and more powerful until you heard something trying to open one of the doors. The door opened the sight managed to shock you even further. The figure, and presumably the owner of this room, was a large, pink anthropomorphic animal. You weren\u2019t exactly sure what kind of creature she was, thouugh the spikes around her head were probably quills of some sort. Other features of note included the fact that she wore white gloves, a red dress and red boots exactly like the ones behind you. \u201cAm I even on Earth anymore?\" you asked yourself. What should you do now? Hundreds of questions flooded your mind as you stood there frozen in fear and confusion. Should you approach this giant creature for help? Can you trust her? The giant in question seemed to stay in place during your mental struggle before...</span></div></div>",

The only suitable spot to hide that was near you was the secondary pair of red and white boots behind you. \"I don't think that would be good idea...\" you said, completely aware of what happen when you try to hide inside one of them. Beyond them was a wardrobe of sheer size; you could try to hide underneath it. Suddenly, you felt a small vibration on the ground and realized that the giantess is now moving; it's time to move now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran past between the towering boots and right for the small gap under the wardrobe. Due to your size, this may take plenty of time and hopefully before the giant anthro could spot you.

Maybe she's mad that you snuck into her house. Maybe she'll crush you just to satisfy her anger. At this size she could do anything with you. You're utterly helpless. You cringe in anticipation of the end, the thought of your organs being reduced to a fine paste filling filling you with existential fear that shakes you to your core...\"What the heck is wrong with you?\" The pink leviathan suddenly exclaims. \"You're scampering all over the place when I'm trying to help you\". You slowly relax as you hear this jarring sentence, although you can still feel a tremor in your right arm. \"Y...You're not gonna crush me?\". \"What kind of silly question is that? Why would I crush you?\". You force out a weak excuse of: \"Y-you might have thought I was a bug?\". The pink giant snorted, but you couldn't tell whether it was from laughter or disappointment. \"Buddy, you'd be one weird looking bug if you were one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then where am I?\". That next question of yours leaves your mouth without you really thinking about what you're saying. The hedgehog raised an eyebrow. \"In general, or in terms of county?\". Wait. She said county. That must mean there are some human civilisations here. You cautiously ask the pink giant: \"Um..do you know what humans are?\". The giant looks thoughtful for a moment, as if unsure of what you just said. \"I'm guessing that you must be human then?\" she replied. \"Yes!...or atleast I think I am.

Thanks to the sweat that had accumulated between her boobs, as well as the body heat of the massive pink creature causing you to sweat a bit as well, your body as well as your surroundings got increasingly slippery as the mixture of sweat lubricated your tiny form. You soon felt yourself starting to slip deeper into Amy\u2019s cleavage. Amy didn\u2019t seem to notice your body sliding, or if she did she certainly wasn\u2019t reacting to it. You tried calling up to her to get her attention, but alas the volume of your voice was to quiet or too muffled by the flesh and clothing fabric for her to hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts shook a bit as she walked. Probably not too much for someone her size, but from your position, even the gentlest shake was a world shattering experience. Her massive breasts occasionally clapped together, squishing your head between them. Thankfully this would only be a brief ordeal. After a few seconds your body started to slide deeper once again. Within a few seconds you are ejected from the underside of her chest. You desperately try to grab onto something, anything to keep from falling to the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately (or unfortunately) for you her dress seemed to bounce your body back against hers just in time for your body to slide into the front of her white panties. You were relieved that you didn\u2019t end up falling to the ground with a painful, final splat. But this position was probably the last place you\u2019d want Amy to find you. Almost as if on cue, you felt Amy stopping dead in her tracks. Your fear rose once more as Amy clearly felt you down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Miss Rose was enjoying the scenery of her walk towards her friend\u2019s lab. She almost forgot about her little passenger... that is until she felt something bumping against a very VERY personal area. Once she got over the initial shock of the sudden feeling, the pink rodent\u2019s cheeks turned bright red as she quickly deduced what that feeling was and where her little friend got to. She stood still, looking around to make sure no one else could see her as she tried to process what was going on and what to do. Did her movements knock him down there? Was he a little pervert? Should she leave him in there for now? Should she be enjoying this feeling as much as she is? That last one lingered in her mind for a bit. Though shetried to move on from it the sensation of your tiny body against her was putting more than a few ideas in her head. She did her best to ignore the sense of pleasure and the naughty thoughts that accompanied it as she tried to resume clearing her mind and figuring out what to do about you. </span></div></div>",

Here she is with a shrunken person. A shrunken person who only she knows about and who is now trapped in her panties near her now excited sex. Almost as if fate itself was telling her not to give you up. After all, even if you were sliding down her body without trying, what were the odds of you falling inside there completely by accident. Evidence seemed to point towards you wanting to take part in this as well. She gave one final thought about continuing to Tails lab before finally giving into these thoughts. She was going to keep you and she was going to enjoy you. Looking around once more, she quickly moved back I to her room and rushed to the bathroom in order to get to the fun as quickly as possible in privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside You were desperately trying to escape this soft and increasingly musky prison. After a minute you see a small ray of light as her fingers poke their way inside the panties. As you watch her massive fingers coming towards you, you stop struggling thinking that she finally noticed you and was going to help. Indeed she noticed but to your horror the fingers didn\u2019t grab onto you to pull you out of here. Quite the opposite. Before you could do anything, the fingers pressed against you and started to push you deeper until your face was right in front of her gigantic slit \"say hello to my privates!\" She said gleefully as her finger pressed down against her panties pushing you facefirst into her crevice. You started to panic and flail around like a madman but this only encouraged her more giving her the idea that you wanted this to happen so she pressed your face into her vagina and started to moan with joy. \"I hope you like it down there!\" she said as your torso was engulfed, she headed back to her room and layed down on her bed her vaginal walls squishing and sucking you further in all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got undressed and looked down at you ( your legs being the only part of your body visible at this point) \" you look like your enjoying yourself in there how about I help out\" she moaned as she grabbed your legs and started to pull you out, thinking this was finally over you stopped struggling and let her pull you out. But in another turn of events she stopped pulling you out at about halfway and plunged you back in, she moaned loud as your body was thrust back in and out of her. This continued for a couple more minutes then an even louder moan echoed through her the emense pressure of her pussy muscles squeezing you stopped, you began to feel a tremor inside her then you saw a tidal wave of white liquid rushing towards you and before you could react you were pushed out by her climax onto the bed. You layed there exhausted from the experience in her cum, she looked down at you again also exhausted from it. Her hand came towards you and being to tired to move she scooped you up and held you in front of her face again, \" so did you like that?\" She asked with a both tired and lustful voice.

The movement seemed to take ages from your perspective but in actuality it was probably a few seconds. The Boot cast a massive shadow as big as a swimming pool wherever it hovered like a shroud of evil creeping it's way across the pink lands of this bedroom...Evil?...No surely that couldn't be right. This whole ordeal was getting to you. You needed to get a hold of yourself if you were to survive like this. You quickly weighed your options as once more time seemed to slow for everything around you. As you scrambled to your feet, you noticed a hard, cold feeling on your wrist. You were quickly drawn to it and saw a watch wrapped around it...a very strange looking watch. It didn't have a clock face at all. Just a blank screen with a circle in the middle. What was this? But you didn't have time to contemplate that mystery however as the boot of the ginormous pink creature thundered to the ground, causing the ground beneath you to tremour a bit. You had difficulty keeping balance but you managed to stay upright long enough for you to realise that the boot had landed just a few feet away from you. Thank heaven for small mercies I suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you realised something. The lip of her boot was pretty much level with your chest. You could easily climb up onto it and grab onto the fabric of her boot while it carried you around the house. But what if you fell off while it was moving and fell to your untimely demise? Could you even survive a fall like that? But you realise that there weren't many options for you to take at this size. Climbing a table leg was an impossibility and trying to get the attention of the pink creature was a nearly hopeless task. You figured that you might as well screw the odds and do something daring for once. You run up to the boot with great haste and quickly force yourself up ontop of it and quickly gripping it tight just moments before it lifted up off the ground again. A very forceful rush of air as the boot moved through the bedroom threatened to knock you off. As you looked down, you felt a bit dizzy from being so high up off the ground. The feeling soon came to pass however as the foot shortly began to descend once more towards the pink carpet. You braced for the impact and shut your eyes. You were rocked about like a ship in a storm out at sea. By all means you should have been knocked off...yet somehow you kept your grip. Again more questions entered your mind. But it looked like this giant was about to lift her foot again. Would you be able to hold on for this time? What should you do?</span></div></div>",

Yes! You swivelled you head back around to get a good look at the watch. The screen was still as blank as ever with that hollow circle sitting in the middle of nothingness, all alone. It looked so intriguing and tempting. The faded lines of the circle seemingly calling out to touch it. But you had no idea how you had even gotten this watch or if you even owned this watch in the first place. Besides, your hands were already full with the fabric of this massive boot you were currently trying to maintain your death grip on. It hurt your hands to grip so hard and you could feel your nails poking into you palms. Needless to say it was quite stressful. Then for a brief moment, everything seemed easy. You didn't need to grip your hands onto the fabric quite as hard and the forces pushing against you seemed to just vanish. Then you looked around and realised why. The boot had stopped in mid air.

Climb up the boot and try to reach the creature currently wearing it. Jump off the lip and almost certainly fall to your death...or...the watch once more caught your eye. The mystery of what it was and what it could do reared it's ever incessant head at you once more. You had to try it out. There was no reason not to surely? After all, what could a watch do that would make this situation any worse than it already was? But...what if the watch was a weapon of some kind. What if the button did something that would get you killed in a rather stupid way? All these questions and more kept running around in your head as the watch just lay there on your arm, silent, unchanging and unmoving. After a few seconds more of indecision you just decided to go with whatever was in your gut. Standing around listening to voices in your head all day wasn't a healthy thing to do. No the only way you would get results would be if you did something about this predicament. You breathed in deeply, and then...</span></div></div>",

Your finger fit perfectly inside the outline of the circle, almost as if it had been made for you. The screen suddenly began to pulse a faded white outward from the circle, but no sound could be heard to indicate any changes to it. You almost immediately began to feel dizzy and your vision started to blur. The world around seemed to be repeating in on itself and swinging like a pendulum through your eyes. You almost lost your grip on the fabric from the overwhelming assault of your senses...or rather lack thereof at this moment in time. Despite your vision being partially obstructed however, you could clearly see that your surroundings were moving but not how you would expect. They weren't moving sideways, they were moving up. \"Perhaps this thing finally put it's foot down?\" you wondered. But then as you turned to your left, you noticed that there was a lot more room to stand than there was before. You could not even feel your hands gripping the fibres of the boot anymore. You weren't one to question good fortune so you laid your back down on the lip and tried to regain your strength. After a few seconds your vision slowly returned to you and the situation became clear. The lip was definitely a lot bigger than it was before. And the fibres of the boot were now just a few centimetres thicker than your arm. You had shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly leapt back to your feet and frantically scanned your environment to confirm your suspicions. They had not been presumptuous in the slightest. What could previously have barely qualified as a ledge was now practically a balcony. This was all too incredible. How could this be? You suddenly remembered the watch on your wrist. You quickly whipped it around to find that the circle was still there, but the outline was fainter than it had been previously. Could this watch be the cause of his shrinking? \"But...how?...A watch can't change size...unless...\" You quickly began feeling along the back of your arm. You felt something running down it through your sleeve. Something long, stiff and rubbery. A tube of some kind. But connected to what? You felt around some more behind your back for any clue as to what the tube was connecting you to. This search proved fruitless as your back was completely clear of any abnormal extremities besides some more tubes that stretched downwards. Had you been augmented somehow? Were you the result of some kind of experiment involving shrinking? Is that why you couldn't remember? You shook your head firmly. You had no time to wonder about questions like this now. You needed a plan and fast. You looked around the blank space on the watch for any other symbols. Your search again found nothing. \"Perhaps it's just really hard to see?\" You pressed the area of screen outside the circle and the same pulsing white light appeared, but this time inside the circle. You felt your senses leaving this earth once more and your vision began to distort and spin. Your energy drained out of your body and you fell to the ground, breathing heavily and in a pained manner. You struggled to keep your eyes open but your vision was too distorted and colourful to comprehend now. You just had to wait until this was all over. All other thoughts became a blur along with your vision as you awaited whatever fate had in store for you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few more agonisingly long seconds of dizziness and blurred vision pass by you until you finally regain your senses. As your sight comes back to you, your vision is filled by the fabric of the creature's boot once more. Only this time It's smaller. You place your hand against the firm fabric of the boot and feel it's roughness. The strands of fabric are slightly smaller than your finger now. You grew! So you device can not only shrink you but grow you too. This is an amazing discovery. It means you can get back to normal size and find out what the hell is going on...but wait...if you're bigger than the last time...and the lip was little more than a ledge before-A sudden rocking causes you to lose your balance against the giant boot and you stumbled backwards off the lip. You reached forward as you tipped back, your hands reaching out to the lip hoping beyond hope to catch it. You only just managed to get a grip on the lip before you fell down to oblivion. Your heart rate sped up rapidly as the gravity of the situation was now leering's head at you. You were now dangling dozens of feet off the ground from a small piece of plastic on a boot bigger than your whole family if they were your size. <i>If</i> this was the normal size for humans here. You started to shiver slightly at the prospect of losing grip altogether. A small bead of sweat ran down your neck from your forehead. You tried to keep your erratic breathing under control. You tried to think of a way out of this...Then you felt your grip slipping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small yell as you felt your fate slipping ever closer from your hands. \"No...NO...HELP!\" You tried to call out to anyone who could hear you. But the girl above made no movement, no action, she just stood completely unaware of your existence. With every Centimetre of plastic you slid off, you could practically feel your life falling away from you. Your favourite TV shows. Your story. Your memories. Your friends. Everything that was you...gone in an instant. You felt tears begin to form in your eyes. Soon only your finger tips clung on for dear life. Slip went one. Slip went another, until finally...Slip...you couldn't hold on any longer...You lost your grip altogether. You watched as the monolithic boot attached to a sky reaching leg that seemingly had no end fell away from you. Everything slowed down in that instant. You thought of home. You thought of friends. You thought of family. You thought of school. You thought of your regrets. You shut your eyes and waited for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sharp pain in your back. This soon went away. You wondered if you were dead. Cautiously you opened your eyes. They were filled with a blinding white light from up above. You tried to shield it with your hands and then you realised things felt a lot heavier than normal. You turned your head to the right...and saw a flat pink ground before you. \"......what?\". You quickly looked around. The whole ground was pink. And that light was coming a ceiling lamp above the room. You wheezed with relief. You weren't dead...yet. You quickly caught sight of the massive looming darkness of the boot you had previously put your rock climbing skills to use on overhead. it wasn't that far above you. Then you looked towards where the leg was coming from. It was coming from the bed. This giant was sitting on it, waving her feet around absent mindedly above you. That must be why her boot was stopped in mid air. It also explained why you survived the fall. You weren't high enough off the ground to be crunched. You quickly climbed to your feet and another shiver ran down your body as you realised how lucky you had been. Now came the matter of deciding what to do next. You looked at your watch again. This time instead of just a circle, it had a red bar flashing at the top of the screen. \"Low on battery power\" you summarised. But surely every power socket was far too big for you to use now. You weren't even sure if this thing worked with a plug. What could you do?</span></div></div>",

You had no idea how you got there, but you weren't going to stick around to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many animals were quite interested in you. Most for food-reasons, but a few were... too interested in you for your own good. You even found a few robot animals. Most of those ignored you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you cam across a hut over the water. It had pink walls and seemed quite elegant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Finally, relief...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you headed to the hut and laid against the wall near one of the doors, passing out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\nSome time later, Amy came home carrying groceries and humming a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused when she saw a doll by her front door. \"Huh?

Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, thanks,\" You replied, getting a confirmatory nod from the pink Hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she headed over to... well, the living room spot and put you on the coffee table, right next to a bowl of fruit. She said, \"I'll be putting away my groceries and getting something for you to stay in.

There's my old Doll house. I might need to sew some soft mattresses and bean bag chairs for you to use. Not unless you don't mind sleeping on hard plastic,\" Amy said as she brought out the two items onto the table. She brought up the shoe box and said, \"And finally, I have a shoe box, one that I can use some glue, Popsicle sticks, and more shoe boxes to make a multi-level house for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked them over and made a decision.</span></div></div>",

She simply grabbed her hammer and hovered it over your body eclipsing everything else from your field of vision. Amy couldn\u2019t see you but she knew that you were appropriately terrified by this, more than enough to keep you in line while she sorted out what to do with you. Satisfied she grabbed you carefully and carried you over to her bed. \u201cI haven\u2019t used this in a while.\u201d You were confused at first until she pulled it an old cafe for mice or hamsters. \u201cBut this should make sure you stay out of trouble.\u201d You wanted to protest this, but as if she could read your mind, Amy repeated herself from before. \u201cLike I said, heavy restrictions while I determine if I can trust you.

Everything about the house was gargantuan; the walls, the furniture, most importantly the inhabitants. There were only two, a mature looking anthropomorphic rabbit woman, and her young daughter. The daughter also had a pet of some sort, but you haven\u2019t seen him in a while. You doubted it was dead since the girl wasn\u2019t mourning when it vanished, but you didn\u2019t really care enough to figure out the real reason. You kept yourself hidden as you would spy on the two, trying to learn about them and their habits to aid in your own survival. The mother seemed polite and proper most of the time, a trait which rubbed off on her daughter, though she still had some childish traits which come with her age. You actually considered revealing yourself to one of them, seeing if thy could help you, but the fear of being mistaken for a rodent or some other pest kept that idea at bay. Unfortunately, the rabbits were very clean which made it hard to get food most of the time. The daughter would sometimes have an accident, but you you would still need to act fast to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was not a lucky day. You haven\u2019t eaten in a while and we\u2019re starting to get desperate. You happened upon a mouse trap with food over the trigger as bait, staring hard at the trap pondering the risk and reward while your stomach growled. With little choice, you leaned forward and carefully tried to remove the food without setting off the trap. So far so good, but you soon lost your balance and fell forward, setting off the trap and feeling a large metal bar slam against your back painfully, holding you tightly in place. You tried to squirm free, but it was no use.you could only weakly call for help and hope whichever giant found you would be benevolent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps soon echoed as someone entered the room to investigate. The footsteps, while huge seemed a bit lighter than the larger being\u2019s. The daughter must have found you. You though you heard her mom call her \u2018Cream.\u2019 As her gloves hand lifted you up at dizzying speeds, you shuddered at the many possibilities that awaited you, quietly praying for the best as she removed the bar and inspected you closer.</span></div></div>",

She affectionately rub your head, which you silently found kind of funny in a strange sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here..\" She kindly said to you as she placed you back down on the ground. The gigantic rabbit girl appeared to be in deep thought while she absentmindedly took off her shoes and tossed them aside without looking. You could only marvel at just how small you were to your new friend as the shoe flew past your head missing you by inches and landing with a fairly loud thud. Cream was unaware of the danger she almost put you through as she tossed the other one to the side without looking and continued to think about whatever. You smelt a weird and strong aroma which seemed to be a mixture of flowers and sour cheddar. Your blush grew as you saw her young humanish four toed feet. Because she's rabbit, her feet were pretty wide and big, even by the standards of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked back up, you immediately heated up and felt like you were about to spontaneously combust once you saw her frilly panties. As luck would have it, Cream finally looked back down at you at this moment. You tried to regain yourself as she looked at you with blank, yet questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong mister..\" Cream softly muttered to you. \"Nothing.. sweetie.\" You said as a sense of regret, shame, and guilt grows in your heart. Cream gives you an more intrigued and curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

She then walked over to a table in the middle of the room and let you down on its wooden surface and said; ' wait here mister, I'll be back soon ', before leaving the room. A few seconds later you heard her voice call out for her mother. The idea of another giant seeing you and possibly mistaking you for a bug or another pest started to creep its way into your thoughts, which left you a bit on edge. But you soon figured that you'd probably be safer with an adult than a kid in this situation. And thanks to your previous observations, you knew that she was gentle and even kinder than her daughter. So for now that reasoning kept your anxiety at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon Cream returned with her mother, finishing her explanation as they entered. Once her mother appeared to get the gist of it, her gaze shifted towards you. At first she appeared a bit skeptical, but then surprised once she realized the situation. She blinked twice in disbelief, before getting closer to confirm her abrupt presumption. And sure enough, her daughter did find a small human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She started to hastily look you up and down, instinctively searching for any wounds or other threats to your well being. She immediately noticed how skinny you were and all the cuts and bruises you had, alongside all the dirt covering your frail body. This examination continued for about a minute or two before she darted across the room to a counter and started pulling various items out of the its cabinets. Meanwhile Cream walked back up to you wearing a timid, but curious expression. Although you heard lots of noises coming from where the older rabbit went, Cream's unnerving gaze demanded your attention. Though she appeared then proved to be nice earlier, your previous experiences with kids have shown they can be very... unpredictable. So you decided not to take your eyes off her, just in case her demeanor was misleading. But she only stared at you, not moving a muscle. You could only imagine what she was thinking, just like before paranoia presented itself to you, her stillness wasn't really reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before long her mother came back, and began to to clean off the dirt surrounding your cuts with a wet tissue. She then quickly but carefully took a drop of some kind of transparent liquid and gently pressed it on your multiple but minor gashes, of course it stung a little bit, but at least you were clean for now. She also brought along some cloth and cut up pieces of food to aid your situation. She started wrapping the cloth around your lesions while introducing herself; ' I'm sorry for the improper greeting, but taking care of your wounds took priority. Anyway my name is Vanilla, Cream's mom, may I ask what yours is?'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were about to tell her, but your stomach gave one last and really painful growl before you blacked out. You thought you were gonna die for the last few seconds of consciousness you had left before everything went black, but to your surprise you woke up, surrounded by white.

Cream giggled a bit more at the shy look on your face, but there was still a noticeable tone of nervousness on her end as well. You looked up at the bit bunny feet before you. The cream colored fur with white on the edges and toes, the exposed parts of her sole which the fur circled. You only blushed more as you saw it up close. Finally you leaned in and got to work pressing your hands against the sole nervously. Cream seemed to jump as you made contact, it probably would have been adorable if she didn\u2019t tower over you... actually it was still pretty adorable. Cream started to relax as you started to rub her sole. Blushing as she noticed how comfortable it felt. You saw her toes stretch as she tried to enjoy herself. You pressed your hands in a little more, catching a word of her soles. Since she takes very good care of herself, the soles were clean with almost no signs of dirt or grime anywhere. The sent of fruit lingered. Clearly she washed herself recently. It was an interesting experience to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued, Cream got more and more used to the treatment. She even started to visibly enjoy it more. You on the other hand still felt pretty shy about it. And the sight and smell weren\u2019t helping your case. You felt this strange subconscious calling for you to lean in and get closer. You tried to ignore it but it only got stronger. Finally you gave in and leaned in, planting a kiss on her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud gasp knocked you out of your trance as you looked up to a gigantic blushing bunny. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to -\u201c cream cut you off quickly not really hearing your attempted explanation. \u201cCould you... could you do that again.\u201d Wait WHAT!? You stared at her shyly, but that expression didn\u2019t lie. Despite the shyness, she was serious about you kissing her foot more. After some awkward silence, you nodded and leaned in closer once again planting another kiss on the bottom of her foot. She smiled up above as you planted another... and another. Before long you were peppering her sole with plenty of tiny kisses.</span></div></div>",

Stupid sexy bunny lady, and her stupid questions...<br>\r\nObviously they were perfect. Inconceivably astounding. So supple and soft, but also powerful and imposing-looking.<br>\r\nHer fluffy soles invited you to take a plunge, and get yourself lost in their alluring embrace, yet also scared you with the prospect of ending up underneath their indisputable might, squashed into a sad little smear like a bug, either unawarely or deliberately so.<br>\r\nOh, and that smell! So strong, so vivid, yet never unpleasant thanks to that sweet, strawberry note it carried. Down at her feet, you were in heaven... And you couldn't force yourself to say any of that. What to do, what to do!? Think, goddamnit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are... Uhm..\" you tried blurting something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what's this?\" she oh so rudely interrupted, waving around her sole a little, making you lose your grip, and your train of thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For crying out loud woman!</i> you thought, <i>Why are you making this so hard for me!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it, you had to somehow clear your mind, and from that perspective those feet were simply unbearable. You closed your eyes, and raised your head to the sky, hoping this will help you calm down you libido, and collect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it hit you. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bottom of Vanilla's middle toe hanged a little, inconspicuous glob of foot sweat. As your luck would have it, just as you rose your head up, it fell straight down at your unsuspecting little face. The droplet splashed all over your body, and most importantly found its way into your mouth. Trying to compose yourself, you lapped some of it up like a dog, wondering stupidly what it was, when it hit you again. Not literally though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste... So salty, yet so sweet at the same time. Once again, you were confronted with that strawberry tinge, probably a leftover from some lotion Vanilla uses on herself. It must've been something natural, because it didn't cause any negative effects... Other than the irresistible urge to taste it again. As luck would have it, you were in the perfect position to indulge yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla's voice boomed from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to be done with you. Answer me, or there will be consequences. What. Do you. Think. Of. My. Feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, they... They are, a-are...\" you started, each syllable spoken making you feel as if you were loosing your mind.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDon't do it</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are what?\" she spat out, clearly tired of you, yet still slightly amused by your stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-They are a-aaa...\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nPlease, don't do it</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaa-aaa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You must resist</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<i>Please, don't do it</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't-</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<i>Please-</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<i>You must-</i><br>\r\n<b>DO IT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DO IT!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shackles were finally broken. All that pent-up shame, regret, and worry has been scattered to the four winds. You were free to shamelessly indulge yourself, and you'd be damned if you didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw yourself at the mature rabbit's giant sole, ready to please yourself to kingdom come if you could. Your tongue lapped vigorously at the sweaty foot, collecting any and all droplets of sweat that marred its vast, furry expanse. With your nose buried into its flesh, you got to experience first hand the pure, unadulterated, mind-numbing scent of Vanilla's gigantic feet. As you lost yourself in their taste and funk, your arms continued to fiercely rub the rabbit's soles, as was her original command. You loved it, all of it, and you hoped she did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something in the back of your mind was telling you that this wasn't right, that something was wrong here. You wouldn't know what that was, until the blissful experience suddenly ended, as the giantess moved her feet away. You fell down on all four, panting like a dog, tired. You were absolutely drenched in sweat, both yours and hers.<br>\r\nThough it came with a small issues, you've managed to face the rabbit giantess, and look her straight in the eyes. From one mere glance at her expression, you were instantly to tell what exactly she was thinking of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla looked...</span></div></div>",

Disgusting little vermin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much time to react as the enraged giantess swept her leg across the table, sending the massive furry wall on a crash course with your small form. As her foot approached, you instinctively jumped on its side, seeing no point in trying to dodge or outrun it. Vanille failed to spot you clinging to her fur, and powered by her hate and disdain towards you, she slid her leg off the table, and sent it crashing down to the ground. Sadly, you weren't able to hold on to the falling paw, and upon losing your grip you were sent flying away from her, down onto the harsh floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact wasn't pretty. You somehow survived the fall, but you weren't sure just yet if it was a good thing, considering how freaking painful it was. You were effectively paralyzed by pain, your body badly bruised, and hurting all over. A trickle of blood ran from your mouth. This could be the end of you, if you didn't get help fast. Unfortunately, the only other person nearby wanted nothing more than to see to your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Vanille made sure you were nowhere near the table, she started looking around the room for any sights of your pathetic body. The rabbit woman located you quickly enough, her eyes locked onto you with a cold, distant glare, as she approached your beaten, bruised form. You could hear her heavy footsteps get louder and louder as she advanced towards you, a pair of giant paws rhythmically thumping loudly one after another, until they stopped right in front of you with two powerful stomps. As her shadow engulfed your form, you could only quiver in fear, unable to face her scornful, judgmental gaze. Vanille would have none of that, however, and with a simple nudge of her toe she flipped you on your back, hurting you badly. You shouted at her, begging her for mercy, for help, but she would have none of that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you?\" She spat at you with apparent disgust \"You despicable, pathetic little bug. After deceiving my daughter like this, and using her for your sick pleasure, you have the gall to ask me for help? Oh, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanille slowly rose her right foot above you, blocking your line of sight with the ghastly image of her sole. She dropped the heel of her paw to the ground, leaving the arch hanging above your writhing form. She was ready to end this at any second she deemed fit, crush you like a bug that you were to her, and rub your remains into the folds of her sole, to get rid of any trace of your accursed existence. Still, she had some more to say first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wretched kind is a disease, an infestation eating away at our peaceful way of life. I will not allow an insignificant pest like you to corrupt my sweet child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, her foot wavered. Vanille must've found it harder to keep herself from finishing you off right there and then... Or maybe it was something else. Doubt, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sigh</i>... The damage's been done already. I fear no matter what I say, she'll hate me for ridding the world of your filth. Still, it is for her own good. I... Can do this, even if it means...She'll... Hate? Me?... I... Can... Can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence. Could she be rethinking her decision? You were silently hoping, praying, begging for her to reconsider, and to give you another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw twitched. Vanille made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

Or maybe you could've waited a couple of days out as her pet before revealing yourself to her mother. Surely an adult would have been able to recognize you as a human and help you. The mother would've probably pitied you and washed you off. But this child didn't seem to have any of that in mind, her mischievous gave away that she had much more sinister ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! So there was a weird creature under our house like mom said!\" Her cute little voice squealed. \"And it's a lot smaller than I thought. Mom said that I shouldn't check the traps if I heard one because it would be gross, but this guy was so small he didn't even die!\" The fact that she could speak so casually about something dying at such a young age made the whole situation feel worse. \"I better reset the trap, otherwise mommy might learn about what I like to do with you guys.\" Okay, <i>that</i> statement made the whole thing even worse. What exactly did that mean!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the world beneath you shake so you dare to take a look below and immediately regret it.

Seeing the light fade away, you quickly laid down, knowing you had no room to escape the impending wall of flesh and fur which soon rushed over you, resting a massive damp sole right on top of your puny form.

Cream walked over to the tiny crib to watch her new 'baby brother' wake up with blissful smile on her face. You were still right where she left you, though not through lack of trying to escape. You tried to make your move five minutes after she left you alone, but Cream certainly wasn't stupid. She figured you'd probably try to get away so she took 2 precautions to make sure you stayed put. First, when she tucked you in, she wrapped one of the tiny blankets around you to restrain your arms and legs and tucked you into the main blanket nice and tightly so you were pretty much immobilized. And even if you did somehow manage to get out of that, she had the crib on top of  a table which offered you absolutely no safe way down without any help from her. You struggled for maybe 10 minutes before giving up. Cream had won. You were stuck here. Mixtures of anger, depression, and humiliation swirled around inside you. But for now, you did the only thing you could do: take a nap and wait for your Mo- for Cream to come back. You felt even more embarrassed that you almost made that slip. Still... you suppose it could be worse... somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened by Cream's chipper voice and blinded by the lights suddenly coming on, but as your vision cleared, you saw the gigantic rabbit girl smiling down at you. It seemed almost loving, though you did note the familiar look of mischief in there as well. \"Aww, you stayed put. That's a good little baby. I would have had to punish you if you didn't and we both know you don't want that. Cream said as she gently removes the blankets that had held you in place until now. \"I got something EXTRA special for the good little baby boy.\" Cream said cheerfully as she produced a jar of baby food from her pocket. \"Oh no. There is no way in hell that I'm eatin-\" you were cut off as Cream's gloved finger shoved a mouthful of the gooey slop into your mouth while it was open to complain. In all honesty, it didn't taste too bad, but the sheer humiliation that she was putting you through by forcing feeding you baby food was too much. There's no way she didn't know what she was putting you through. But then again you were basically a toy to her. Something to amuse her in whatever way she sees fit. \"Now eat up so that baby can grow up to be all big and strong like me.\" Cream says in her chipper tone as the finger pulls away to grab another scoop of food. \"What the hell is wrong with you? I'm not a damn baby! And I'm not going to eat any more of that!\" you shouted up to her, shutting your mouth just in time to avoid another mouthful and causing her finger to accidentally smear the baby food all over your face. Cream looked down at you sternly. </span></div></div>",

I'll bet you'll look sooooooo pretty afterwards!\" Obviously you were much less thrilled with this idea. You were about to voice your opposition to her plan, but you eyes quickly shifted to one of her feet tapping. Moving up and down against the ground providing a fun reminder of her grim warning from before. Though Cream wasn't doing this intentionally, it still reminded you of the position you were in. Taking a deep breath, you swallowed your pride and nodded. \"O-okay, lets just get this over with.\" you said reluctantly causing Cream to hop up and down clapping excitedly. The tiny hops created mini tremors for you which caused you to fall on your ass, but you knew this was nothing compared to the humiliation that the massive rabbit girl was about to subject you to. You began to pander if letting her step on you would be the preferable option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream quickly ran off to the bathroom without a word and soon returned holding a whole set of various nail polishes. Setting down the rainbow of colors before you she excitedly read off all the names of each color trying to see if you had a preference for any. Of course your preferred choice was to have none at all, but that certainly wasn't an option for you. After remaining silent towards every single option, Cream grinned and picked up a royal purple colored bottle containing similarly colored polish inside. Carefully removing the brush, the gigantic rabbit got a large glob onto the brush. To someone like her, it would perhaps be considered a reasonable amount, but to you it was enough to cake your entire body in colored polish. \"Now hold still while I do this.\" she commanded as she positioned the brush. You did as you were told, mostly out of fear. \"Please be easy to remove.\" you whispered to yourself as the brush came closer. Of course, given your size, Cream had a lot of trouble being precise with the brush. Soon your entire hand was covered in a messy layer of purple. You groaned inwardly to yourself as Cream giggled at her mess. \"Okay, not take off your shoes so that I can get your toes.\" Again you did as she ordered, getting some of the polish on the nice dress shoes Cream forced you into. Not that you cared. This was probably the closest to an act of defiance you could get away with so you might as well savor the thought. Cream was much more careful with the toes, having practice earlier, though she still ended up making a bit of a mess on both feet. By the time she had finished your entire hands and half of your foot was covered in a messy layer of purple. Cream put the supplies back and admired her work. \"You're even cuter than I imagined.\" she giggled, poking you with a finger and pinching your cheeks. You were humiliated. Your sole comfort in all of this was that she was the only person who could see you like this. Hopefully it stayed that way.</span></div></div>",

All I did was play video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter removing your hands from eyes, you looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that either you were either tiny, or you were in a giant's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls had several shelves, each holding either gems on pillows or small statues that held gems. There was a computer with an Egg chair, a flatscreen TV with some bean bag chairs around it, and a large bed. There was also some dressers, one of which was beside a door. There was also a table with various cleaning supplies on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an open closet, filled with various clothes. Some of which was a black bodysuit with a heart-shaped breastplate, with white boots that also had a heart on them. There were others, but most were a variation on the Black bodysuit with a heart on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" You uttered as you stood up and began to walk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared one dresser, you heard the door unlock. From under the dresser, you watched Rouge the Bat walk in as she carried a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nearly a bust. Barely got a few unpolished gems from the transport, but this baby made it worth it,\" Rouge said as she picked out a large gem from the bag. It was almost as large as her head and was kinda egg-shaped. She sat down at the cleaning table and put the large Gem on the table.  \"Mama's gonna give you a good name. If you're rainbow-colored, maybe Rainbow Egg? ...Nah, Eggman might want to steal you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what to do.</span></div></div>",

Good question that do deserve an answer,\" Rouge said, facing away from you as she began to clean up the large egg-shaped gem. \"But nothing valuable is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... What are you talking about?\" You asked, wondering if you made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My services tend to be quite expensive and I doubt you have anything valuable on your person to get me to help you in any way, short stuff. But do tell me your name,\" Rouge said, still cleaning the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is... (NAME),\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, (NAME), I guess I can tell you that I might need a partner for a few missions. I need to get something called Chaos emeralds, but they've all been put under heavy guard and little old me is having a bit of trouble getting inside. If you help me, I'll look into getting you back to normal and back home,\" Rouge explained as she stopped to look at you. She had a slight smile on her face. \"That is, unless you find working with me too good to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're having trouble, then what makes you think I'll be able to help?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been at the gem collecting game for so long, that I've become a bit predictable. But I doubt anyone ever predicted someone the size of a doll entering and taking the gems. I'll have to get you some gear, but that'll be easy,\" Rouge said as she stood up and began to saunter towards you. \"So... are you in or will I have to drop you somewhere to find your own way to get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think you might have a way to get me big again?\" You asked as Rouge stopped near you and bent down, almost sitting on the ground. You did your best to avoid looking at her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a secret. One you'd have to earn,\" Rouge cooed as she reached for you and... rubbed a finger against your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you responsible?\" you asked, too afraid to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same answer. You gotta earn the answer before I can tell you,\" Rouge replied. The smile was now more a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed before you gave your answer to Rouge's offer. You...</span></div></div>",

Was this all some accident? Did she happen to find you? Was she the reason you ended up shrunken and in her room? Was she actually willing to unshrink you after you got the emerald for her? None of them seemed to have a clear answer to you. But one thing seemed pretty clear, this gigantic bat woman did not seem trustworthy in the slightest. Her casual attitude towards your situation. How playful she is as she withholds pretty much every scrap of information. He\u2019ll you had some serious doubts that she really had a way to fix you. She was likely holding your obvious hopes over your head to make you more compliant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d You said in a serious manner. Rouge seemed to be caught off guard by your answer. She was certain that you would agree to help her in return for her aid. \u201cNo? Are you saying you don\u2019t want to find out how to get back to your old height?\u201d She asked, keeping that playful hint in her voice while she leaned in closer to you. Seeing the bat woman even closer was pretty scary, but you had to hold your ground. You couldn\u2019t show weakness now if you wanted her to take you seriously. \u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019re giving me no reason to actually trust you. For all I know you\u2019re just lying to me to trick me into helping you.\u201d <br>\r\nYou felt satisfied with how you handled yourself there. Unfortunately Rogue was less impressed with the show of defiance. With a disappointed sigh she stood back up to her full height, putting the jewel she was cleaning in a glass display before looking back down at you. Her towering figure mixed with the disappointed look made you second guess your decision to refuse. Not that it mattered now as her gloves hand snatched you up with lightning fast quickness. She certainly seems like a master thief. Problem is she gigantic, annoyed and holding you like a toy in her palm. You shivered slightly despite your attempts to keep your cool. This was enough for the bat to realized her attempt to intimidate you was working. A smirk started to form as the hand started to tilt. You tried to grab onto the finger but her action was too fast. You plummeted to the ground before landing roughly on a metal floor not to far away. Thankfully the drop wasn\u2019t too bad on your body, but looking back up, you realized that Rouge has deposited you inside an empty hamster cage. Now grinning at her captive from above, Rouge closed and locked the only exit, which was on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to help me then so be it. Since I\u2019m so nice I\u2019ll let you stay with me. Rent free even. Aren\u2019t I a generous gal?\u201d She laughed as she made a kissing motion and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say there in regret. Even if you didn\u2019t trust her, you should have at least went along at first. You probably would have had an opportunity to get some actual help. Now your trapped. A prisoner in her living room with no one to help. No one who would even know about your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later Rogue returned to check up on her new pet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being a spy for G.U.N. you've had your run-ins with terrorists, foreign threats, and other secret services before; and today wasn't anything special. Just another prevent *blank* from *blank* to preserve national security case. You didn't necessarily find this job boring or annoying, it's just that you've done this so many times before it just wasn't as interesting as it used to be. To sum up the briefing, you basically needed to steal or destroy some kind of device an opposing country had created along with any data and witnesses. You were of course also given your equipment with refinements and upgrades hear and there, not that it really mattered considering you probably wouldn't even use half of it. After a reminder of how important the mission was and the consequences of failure, you were given the location and were hurriedly escorted to your target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nothing worth noting really happened until you approached the building you were to infiltrate. Oddly enough, there were no guards on patrol, no lights or fences, and no defensive precautions at all. It almost looked abandoned, if not for how sleek and clean the area itself was. Out of suspicion you went back over your data, and sure enough, this was the right place. You carefully entered the building, cautiously scanning each hallway for anything that could trip an alarm or alert the guards. Yet again there was nothing but the dark, virtually nothing threatening to you or your mission. But you still stayed vigilant, you didn't need your training or years of experience to know this could be a trap. Soon you neared your objective, the device was on the other side of a rather normal looking doorway. You quickly checked your sidearm to make sure it wasn't jammed and slowly opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You aligned the barrel with your line of sight and searched the room for any hostiles, but once again there was only black. Still keeping your weapon ready in one hand you entered, and you almost immediately spotted the device. It was somewhat small and looked like some kind of firearm, but not like any gun you've seen before, most of its features looked alien. Suddenly the door behind you slammed shut, and you were ambushed by multiple men. It was too dark to make out any of them clearly, let alone tell how many there were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though they appeared overwhelming, you've come to far to simply let them stop you; even if they did, you weren't going down without taking a few of them with you. You responded to their abrupt attack by pulling the trigger of your pistol. With two clean  shots two of the silhouettes fell, before another kicked your weapon out of your grasp. In return you swiftly pulled out your knife and swung repeatedly in his general direction, on the second or third thrust you felt it hit its intended target. But apparently this one wasn't as easy to take down as the other two, instead of recoiling from the stab he almost embraced it to get close enough to disarm you. As soon as the knife left your hand another silhouette swept your feet causing you to hit the ground hard. The pain of your face hitting the ground without any kind of brace was cut short by a sudden blunt object hitting the side of your head, knocking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You woke up strapped to a vertical metal table with a few men standing in front of you, one of them being more distinct than the others holding the device. Said man was wearing a white lab coat. He quickly noticed you were awake and gave you an evil smirk before turning to face you. After a informal greeting he began to taunt you, mocking your capabilities as a spy, seeing how easily you were caught. You kind off tuned out during most of his speech, thinking of how to escape and then take the device. You also looked around the room, it appeared to be the same one you entered earlier but now lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Besides looking a little high-tech, the room was bland with no decorations or windows. You also noticed a clock on the wall near the door, comparing it to the time you started this operation, a few hours have passed while you were unconscious. You redirected your attention back to the man in front of you, apparently he had finished his explanation and was waiting for you to zone back in so he could demonstrate what the device did. He had one of his guards bring in a dog and told you to watch. After he fiddled with the device a little he shot the dog. But contrary to your expectations, he didn't kill the dog, he somehow... shrunk it? He laughed at your reaction and said the dog was fine before shooting it again. This time the dog grew back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Content with his example he turned and pointed the device at you. He explained that his scientists had never actually tested it on a human before, and unfortunately, you were going to be the first test subject. Before you could even say a word you were hit by it, and your body immediately shrunk down to a few inches. He once again laughed seeing how small and pathetic you'd become, before hastily ordering his guards to apprehend you. Even though you were now free and could run the guards apprehended you with ease and quickly slammed you down on the same table you were strapped to earlier, but now it was horizontal like a normal one. The two guards held you down while the man started to talk again, saying now that it worked, he had a lot of tests and trials to put your newly sized body through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His sentence was interrupted by an alarm suddenly going off. He barked at one of his free guards to see what it was, before skipping the rest of his speech and pulling out a large syringe. But once again he was interrupted, this time by gunshots coming from the hallway outside the room. The man dropped the syringe and unholstered a concealed pistol while ordering one of the guards holding you to grab his rifle and kill whoever was causing all of this. But before he could even level his rifle the door burst open and some kind of really fast creature not only disarmed but knocked out everyone in the room except you and that man. The bastard only got to fire twice before he was kicked to the ground and executed by the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that it stood still you could make out some of its features. It looked like a female G.U.N. agent thanks to her equipment, but what stood out even more was that she looked like a white animal of sorts, possibly a bat? After she stood up you could clearly tell that she was, a well endowed one at that. She pressed against her earpiece and reported that she had found the target and requested further instruction. After a few seconds she replied; ' copy that ' and walked over to...</span></div></div>",

And when you say gigantic you mean...gigantic. There was a gigantic, fancy looking bed, a gigantic chair, a gigantic door of in the distance. It felt like something out of Jack and the Beanstalk. You were a bit nervous by this, fearing that a giant would walk in at any minute. You had ducked down into a corner of the room, trying to be hidden and trying to get comfortable. You weren't going to let yourself be known if you could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this you heard a booming in the distance, rhythmic and getting louder, soon enough you were feeling the booms, and you knew that a giant was approaching. You did all you could to make yourself smaller in the corner, huddling together when the door opened, and you felt the wind move from it. In stepped an absolutely enormous...purple...cat? It looked like a her too. Just where the heck were you!? She was walking to the chair, and at this point the booms were making it hard to keep still. She didn't look at all in your direction as she sat down and it looked to you like she was looking over some papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered if you wanted to make a move at this point, she had left the door open, you could make a break for it.

Almost all the furniture had a gold trimming or rim, while others looked hand or custom made. The floor was made out of glossed over marble as well as having a few rugs covering most of it's surface.

She then hurriedly asked how she was supposed to start the process, the servant now regaining his composure said that she would have to gently slide you in and let her muscles pull you into her womb.

Suddenly you unconsciously rolled over and clung to her hand, she turned even more bright red before instinctively cradling you in her arms; though she had no idea why she was doing this, the sudden warmth she felt told her it was the right thing to do.

So she held your head up against her nipple and continued to let you nurse while purring; \" that's right little one, drink up, don't  stop until you're full of my milk \". Though you were unconscious, your body complied, it didn't stop drinking until there was a noticable bulge in your torso. Once full, your body collapsed back into her palm, not able to move in the slightest. The giant cat found you quite adorable curled up in her palm and just stared at you for awhile and tenderly petted you whenever you would stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon enough, she finished adoring you and began to lower you down to her vulva. With a quick but gentle push, she inserted your frail body into hers. She began to pur loudly as her vagina eagerly took you in, her cervix soon welcoming you into your new but temporary home. Then with one last pull the cervix shut, you came to rest in her womb, and her purring slowly calmed down. She then looked upon her abdomin, seeing a little, occasionally squirming bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She put one of her free hands on top of you and caressed both herself and you, smiling a bit. This simple yet odd act rather pleased her. Though she knew it was now a guarantee that your memory would be gone, the emense joy she felt along with the daydream of her happily living with you as her son swiftly overtook her worry and eventual guilt. Plus she was still technically saving your life, just not in a conventional way. After one last pat on her stomach she stood up, redressed, and resumed her day. After awhile...</span></div></div>",

She went back over what she said earlier ' if there is even the slightest chance I could save a sentient beings life, I would sure as hell try '. Those exact words lingered in her head, she said them so confidently and firmly, but was this going too far? She shook her head and immediately re-assured herself that she was both doing the right thing and her duty as the protector of her people. Although technically you weren't one, she still saw you as a person under her protection, your life was literally in her hands, and she couldn't just let you die for her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After taking a breath, she took one last you at you before saying; ' once this is over, you have some explaining to do ', before she began to open her vulva and gently push you inside. She almost immediately felt a wave of pleasure take over her senses, despite your size, you still managed to touch her sensitive areas causing a sensation of bliss for the massive feline. As instructed she didn't push you in any further, instead letting her vagina's constrictions naturally pull your body inward. Before you completely disappeared within her wet depths she could've sworn she saw you unconsciously smile, before her vagina fully enveloped your form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she let her two furry walls shut she looked at her abdomen, seeing a little, almost unnoticeable bulge make its way through her. She smirked, seeing your body up against her skin once again triggered the warm feeling she had earlier. She remembered the two most favorable outcomes her servant told her, though she would much rather have her body repair yours, the thought of you becoming her child started to not seem so bad. In fact she actually started to consider it, not only would you provide an heir to her throne, once you were old enough she could take you on adventures with her or stay to watch her kingdom while she took care of its problems. Either way she would still be true to her word, she was gonna save your life one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after she concluded that thought she started to feel you enter her most sacred chamber and couldn't help but smile.

Once she felt your body fully enter she carefully put her clothes back on and called her servant back.

Once she saw the ultrasound she was ecstatic, you were already growing patches of fur here and there, as well as forming cat ears; not to mention the fact your previously damaged lower half was repaired and converting to a cat's torso. But for some reason you were still as small as when she first discovered you, though she found that somewhat odd she was still glad to see you were well. After the good news she asked her servant about your memory, but he couldn't tell if it was still there or not until you were born. That answer once again forced her to contemplate your predicament, if you ended up retaining your memory how would you react?, would you run away like before?, even if you did stay how would you take the news?, not only were you unborn and turned into an anthropomorphic cat, the terrifying stranger you ran into earlier was now your mother?!, and she expected you to throw away your old life and become her successor? On the other hand if you lost your memory it would be like having a newborn child; plus it would go over a lot smother considering you probably wouldn't protest. But still, if that happened she would feel like she failed you, like she rid you of your soul; killing you in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite either outcome she would still be your mother, and if you did lose your memory she would do her damnedest to raise you from the ground up and ensure you had a better life than your previous one; that was the least she could do if that happened. That thought was soon interrupted by a weird sensation coming from her womb, she felt something pushing against her and moving. She became concerned and immediately asked her servant what was happening, he almost snickered at his majesty for not knowing before saying; ' he/shes kicking your highness, his/her body is getting use to its regenerated legs and developing their new bone structure. '. After hearing that she simply looked back to her abdomen and patted it, almost as if to soothe her kitten; before asking when you were due. The servant predicted roughly 2-3 weeks, considering your body was already formed before the process started the womb didn't require as much time as it usually would to procreate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She became both excited and concerned, she couldn't wait to give birth to you, but at the same time, she was worried about your memory, would you keep or lose it? Over the next few weeks that question haunted her, she really hoped you'd at least keep that part of your being if anything else. But that wasn't the only thing she developed over that time period, her emotions started to emerge, breaking her usual solemn character, and centering around you. Whether you would accept them or not in the near future, she loved you. Though she hadn't the slightest clue who you were, she felt that this was her fate, that that random encounter she had with you almost a month ago wasn't so random after all. No matter if you accepted her upon your rebirth or not, she fully accepted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the time finally came, she was happy, fulfilling both her sense of duty and her now common motherly instincts filled her with pride. But until she knew if your memory stayed or not this was confidential, not even her friends could know about you until this memory thing was figured out. Once she was ready she slowly but surely pushed you out, and surprisingly to her servant she took it rather well. Thanks to your size you came out rather smoothly, not causing her a bit of pain. As you were finally reborn you regained consciousness, you slowly opened your eyes only to be greeted by a blinding light, then a cloth wrapping around you. The servant handed you to your new mother and she gladly took then cradled you. As your eyes finally adjusted you...</span></div></div>",

Although they were probably too powerful for your small body, it appeared to be the better alternative; considering the other option didn't make any biological sense at all, and personally, it offended her. Once she clarified her choice to her servant, he began to explain what should happen; ' if this works he/she should fully regenerate, but it won't be without a risk. First of all there's the  obvious possibility that it won't work, instead of restoring him/her it could end up flaying him or simply make him combust from all of the raw energy released. And if it does work, it'll be similar to when you used them awhile ago to stop Nega. For a brief time he/she will gain roughly the same power you did, and combining that with how he/she might react not only to suddenly waking up, but seeing you again, we could only imagine what he'd/she'd do with all of it. '. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked at you again, now wondering if she should even try. If the process didn't work, instead of having a rather peaceful and painless death you'd burn or explode. That possibility kept her fighting between her morals, she actually considered letting you die instead of helping you as a mercy kill, but that decision was understandably hard to make. She really wanted you to live, but was it worth that risk? Her philosophical thoughts were soon interrupted by her servant; ' my majesty, I don't mean to intrude but he/she only has about an hour to live now. If you want to save him/her you need to get the Sol gems <u>now</u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After hearing that she suddenly bolted out of the room to retrieve them, during which she still had her doubts. Unfortunately by the time she returned you were already dead, as she entered her servant looked down while solemnly stating that you were gone. She reacted by closing her eyes and feeling a bit of sorrow, even though she had no idea who you were. She felt remorseful, feeling that she failed both you and her duty. She calmly walked over to you and put her hand on your body, she was about to close your eyes, before her own lit up. Seemingly out of nowhere she felt you struggle to take a breath, without a second of thought she immediately surrounded you and herself with the powerful gems. Her servant timidly asked; ' what about his/her own power gain?! ', she simply replied ' I'll handle it! ' before the entire room was engulfed by a blinding flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She now floated slightly above the ground with an aurora of fire surrounding her, she looked back at you and was waiting with anticipation. Your body was floating as well but you still didn't appear to be conscious. But she was soon reassured by the fur (hair) on your arms and scalp starting to glow yellow. She gritted her teeth, hoping the Sol gems would revive you and not kill you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Switch back to your p.o.v.) your eyes suddenly open as you take in a large gasp of air. You immediately notice you're floating above the ground and your hair was now yellow. You were about to question your situation before you looked up and saw the giant cat from earlier, only now she appeared way more threatening. Besides her size and her literally being on fire, the thing that scared you the most were her eyes. Granted they didn't have any negative emotions within them, they still appeared hostile thanks to her irises now being completely red! Though you were sure as hell scared for your life, you waited.

She new for a fact that her body did not posses the ability to restore you, and she honestly thought her servant was either stupid or had a few screws loose for suggesting that. She also knew the Sol gems wouldn't work either, they weren't some medicine that could be given to anyone in need, only a few could contain their power let alone wield it. Considering that not only were you human but your size as well, she knew that they couldn't help either. She was distraught, mad even, that not only she couldn't help you but her doctors and nurses couldn't help likewise despite how well they were trained and paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She asked her servant as well as her staff to leave the two of you alone, both out of respect and anger. Once she was alone she slammed her fist against the wall, before silently looking back at you. She once again thought about the two impossible options. She mentally cursed, she didn't know who to be mad at, you, herself, the Sol gems, or her practitioners. Then out of nowhere something in her head clicked, what if she tried both at once? She could channel the power of the Sol gems through her body and combine their immense regenerative abilities with her womb's while making sure most of the raw energy stayed in the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She knew there was still the risk of failure, but now she was more determined than ever. She picked you up and ran to get the gems, once retrieved, she ran back to her personal chamber with you in toe. After taking a deep breath she started removing her pants, than underwear. As she was about to start her thoughts interrupted her again, her initial thoughts were what would happen if this worked? She didn't get far beyond that thought before she felt your body starting to get colder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without another moment of hesitation, she plunged you inside her. She immediately started to purr, but this was neither the time nor situation to do what her body wanted. She pushed you in as far as she could before she tightened her muscles to pull you in quickly. She felt you suddenly enter her womb and yelped as you hit its wall. She then hastily surrounded herself with the Sol gems and absorbed a fraction of their energy. She focused some of the energy around her reproductive organ, while letting the rest slowly trickle in once the amount she concentrated burnt out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few minutes later she expelled the rest of the remaining energy to her womb and started to relax. She noticed there was now a small bulge in her abdomen, you must have grown! Her experiment seemed to work, she could feel you move a little signalling you were alive. She breathed a sigh of relief before patting her stomach to see if you would react, though you were unconscious, surely enough you moved; by kicking. She cooed as she felt your response, she wanted to savor each little movement you made; and keep you inside her. But her mind told her otherwise, the process obviously worked and she saved your life, she should take you out as soon as she can so her womb doesn't do anything to you, and so she could figure your situation out. But you felt so good inside her, it wasn't anything sexual, but whenever she felt your body move against hers a delightful emotion overtook.

But no worries, you're in safe hands now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little smile as you watched the enthusiastic raccoon gush all over you as if you were a fragile object. She was right, though you were fragile emotionally on the inside. Despite her friendly intentions, you still had a question burning in your mind, \"But what about that purple cat that was chasing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarine snickered a little at your question, prompting you to raise a concerned eyebrow. She saw your reaction and quickly contained her laugh to explain, \"You mean Blaze? She told me it was a plain ol' misunderstanding. She was only trying to help ya but you ran away. She's actually on the ship right now, taking over as captain while I take a look at you. She insisted that I was the one who checked up on you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms as she continued explaining, \"She reckoned you woulda believed me more than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis raised even more questions to you and you wanted to start quick firing them at her but before you could even utter another word to her, the two of you were swept of your feet by a sudden shake off the ship, a loud booming noise accompanying it. You gulped, having no idea what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marine!\" yelled a female voice that you recognised as your pursuer, coming from the deck above you, \"We're under attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crikey!\" Marine exclaimed, saddened a little that she only spent a little time with you, \"I better help Blaze! Matey, I'll be back quickly. Don't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she left you in that cage, leaving you with two choices now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first option was to try and leave the cage you were placed in. You didn't really trust Marine yet and you were scared that she might think of you as a plaything or worse... a slave. On the other hand, maybe it's safer if you stay in your cage. Well, the choice is up to you.</span></div></div>",

There appeared to be nothing inside the cage except for you and a few provisions, so you made your way to the metal bars to see if there was anything outside the cage that could help. But almost as soon as you got to the edge, a canon ball suddenly smashed through the ship and out the other side. Seeing that you paused for a few seconds out of shock, before feeling a sharp pain in your stomach. Your vision started blur, and as you looked down you discovered why. A large splinter of wood had impaled your torso, causing your clothes around it to start turning dark red. You wearily staggered back in disbelief, not knowing how to react to the abrupt situation; slowly losing your consciousness by the second. No longer being able to stand you fell to your hands and knees, further pushing the debris into you; and started coughing up blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then suddenly you heard an even louder boom than before, immediately followed by the ship violently shaking. Cheering started to erupt above you on the deck which made you come to the conclusion that the vessel attacking you was repelled. But at this point you couldn't comprehend anything else beyond that. You start to feel yourself losing your grip on reality, but before your body forced you to do anything else you heard footsteps coming down to your location. Simultaneously your coughing became worse, and you soon found yourself in a puddle of your own blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You soon realized that you were going to die, and oddly smirked. You thought to yourself that at least this way those giant creatures couldn't hurt you or keep you as a slave now. You actually started to laugh, even though you couldn't escape you still managed to allude whatever they had planned for you; seeing this as sort of a triumphant moment. Your laugh was gargled though, and actually hurt; even causing you to expel more of your vital fluids through your mouth and onto the floor. After a few seconds of this you quickly collapsed to the ground and struggled to take your last breath. As your eyes shut you heard the familiar voice of that orange creature gasp, before everything went dark and silent...</span></div></div>",

Sitting in this corner was damn safe at the moment though...but you couldn't do it forever. You felt your stomach growling and that's when you confronted the fact that you were also very, very hungry. \"I really hope she's nice...\" You muttered to yourself as you got up to make the walk towards her chair. It actually took you a solid few minutes to get there, and you took the time to observe your destination some more, she certainly looked important the way she was dressed, and she was completely silent, not a peep from her. Of course she thought she was alone so you supposed it was natural, but it felt...eerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you found yourself at the base of the chair, and you were looking straight at her boots. \"Hey lady! Down here! lady!\" You shouted, unsure if she would hear you. She looked like she had reacted though and heard her mutter \"Did I hear something...?\" The voice, though a mutter, was definitely above average in volume to you, which made you surmise that your voice was probably quiet or squeaky to her, even shouting. Still, you got through a little so you redoubled your efforts. \"YES! YOU HEARD ME! DOWN HERE PLEASE!\" You shouted at the top of your lungs and the cat lady gasped as she looked down. \"W-what the...? a tiny person, oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose from her chair, causing a cacophony of sound between the chair sliding back and her getting on her knees to get a closer look.

You considered opening it to see what it was about yourself, but before you could decide to open it or not, the royal cat re-entered the room. Although nothing looked different about her, her eyes immediately locked on to you, seeing you clearly. She walked back to the table and stood in front of you; \"so little one, would you care to explain yourself?\" she asked calmly. Although her presence was intimidating her voice seemed to calm your nerves and give you a safe feeling, so you spoke up again giving her your name and telling her you had no idea where you were and why you were this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow being able to hear you she calmly explains you were in her home within her kingdom while picking up her book. You found this odd, the world had no monarchy so how could she be royalty? you ask her this and she tilts her head in confusion in response; \"what do you mean? The royal cat family has ruled over this world for centuries.\" She found your question somewhat idiotic but since humans were a rarity here, she supposed where ever you came from they didn't teach you about her reign. You then asked her where the government was, what happened to G.U.N.? Her ears perked up as she heard your words; \"what government? There hasn't been one since before the end of the great war.\" you were now even more confused, this didn't make any since, after the aftermath of the war new governments arose all over the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radiation made it hard to rebuild but like blaze, mutated anthro animals arose and helped humanity rebuild from the ground up. For this, the almost rare intelligent animals were given equal rights and were accepted into society. There was never any monarchical system, you told blaze this and her confused expression changed to a face of slight annoyance. \"What are you saying?! That never happened! In fact that's the complete opposite of what transpired all those years ago!\" she replied with some noticeable irritation. You quickly shut your mouth and backed away a little, the limit of her intimidation had reached it's peak and scared the hell out of you, I mean one of her hands were on fire for f##ks sake! You hastily apologized and slowly backed away a little more, blaze was a little angry at you but didn't want to scare you so she turned away then said; \"I apologize for my temper but what you just said was so incredibly wrong it's an insult to are history, I don't know where you got that information but it is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand extinguished and she turned around back towards you, you stood absolutely still not wanting to provoke her any further. She sighs and sits in the chair beside you with the book still in her hand, she takes a minute or two to calm down then speaks again; \"look, let's just forget that happened and try this again, so you have no idea where you are which is very perplexing considering all the guards and chambers you would have had to pass to get her which should've clued you in that this is a palace. And you don't know how you got to that size, at least that I can understand.\" Blaze sat there for a moment theorizing what could've happened then asked; \"tell me, have you encountered any gems or a man named Nega recently?\". You never ran into any gems so you try going for the other possibility; \"who's Nega?\" you ask carefully still be cautious not to anger her again. Blaze then explains that; \"Nega eggman, or just Nega as we call him, is a mad scientist dressed in black that's bent on conquering our world and obtaining ultimate power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon think of a similar sounding person and hesitantly ask; \"don't you mean eggman?\". Blaze was getting sick of your seemingly dumb questions and started to grind her teeth exposing her fangs, you quickly dart behind the lamp on the table fearing for your life thinking you finally did it and made her mad. Blaze's eyes caught your movement and she stopped grinding her teeth; \"wait I...\" suddenly something clicked inside her head. \"Wait a minute, your talking about Dr. Eggman are you not?\", while still being behind cover you reluctantly respond with a yes. \"That's it! Your from Sonic's dimension!\" she said astoundingly, \"that means one of to things, 1. You were called here for a reason by the sol gems and shrunk for that purpose (although I don't know why they would call upon you instead of Sonic), or 2. Nega somehow finally made a portal connecting the two realms and you unfortunately were caught in the experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze suddenly stood up and opened her book again flipping to the last few pages...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In spite of what your mind was telling you, you decided to just lay there comfortably in the warm cushion as you waited for Blaze to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the cat came back in about 10 minutes later.

Looking a bit worried, her eyes scanned the room, hoping she didn't step on you in the way in while silently muttering how careless you were for moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(this is where the story leads to butt crush, anal vore, or unbirth.

Her brow furrowed as she leaned in closer to her a better look. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing on my chair?\u201d Her tone and expression seemed like she was both concerned and angry towards the tiny person who she almost sat on. She grumbles while giving you a stern look before her gloved hand reaches down and picks you up, holding you before her eyes. \u201cDo you have any idea how dangerous and reckless your actions were?\u201d She scolded you as the eyes focused right on you without blinking. \u201cI was worried that I stepped on you without knowing when I saw you moved from where I placed you. And really? My seat?! Imagine if I didn\u2019t find you there. You would have ended up under me without me knowing if I didn\u2019t happen to spot you just now. So again, what the hell was going on in your pea sized brain when you did that?\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent, both scared and embarrassed from everything to actually speak up. The cat girl was growing impatient with your silence before taking a deep breath and calming down. You watched her expression nervously, still worried about the immense and all-powerful cat lady getting angry with you. But thankfully that seemed to have passed. With you still in hand, Blaze sat down on the chair. \"I trust you heard me before and know who I am and my importance in this world.\" She said in a serious manner. You simply nodded in response. Thankfully she was able to see your reaction clearly as a small smile formed. \"Good. So now I ask you once more: who are you; why are you so small; and what were you doing in my private chambers?\" Of course you didn't have the foggiest idea about two of those questions. Still you had to tell her something. \"My name is (NAME) and... to be honest I don't know how i ended up here or how I got like this. I honestly just sorta woke up like this in here without explanation.\" Blaze stared at you with scrutiny in her eyes. While your response wasn't out of the question, it was one of the more convenient excuses. She would be a fool to simply assume it as true without question, but for now, she'll trust your story until proven otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze started to ponder what happened to you. Rambling off things like her gems and the technology of some mad scientist which caused her trouble in the past. You kinda zoned out as her descriptions of the intricacies went far over your head. You started thinking back to what she mentioned earlier. About her being the princess of the world. Such a concept seemed strange to you. You've heard of different kinds of governments ruling over parts of the world, but never of a monarchy that ruled all of it at once. By now Blaze stopped, noticing that you were in deep thought about something and not paying attention to her theories. \"Have you remembered something?\" she asked as her eyes had a spark of interest in them. \"No its not that. I was just thinking about before and... well I've been thinking about what you said... about being the princess of the world.\" Blaze's expression changed to curiosity. \"Yes. we've been through that.\" she said sounding slightly impatient that you were wasting time on that instead of what was important. \"But how could you be the princess of the world if there's no global monarchy in place?\" Your innocent question received an annoyed glare from the cat. \"Is this human so ignorant to the outside world that he doesn't know about it's rulers?\" she thought to herself. Then her eyes widened once more as a new thought and theory popped into her mind.  \"You aren't from around here. This area. This world even. You're from another dimension aren't you?\" she asked as if this was such a casual or easy question to swallow. You stared blankly at her. The idea seemed crazy... though you were currently toy sized and in the hand of an anthropomorphic cat woman claiming to be princess of the world. Maybe another dimension made the most sense of anything you ehard today. \"Similar occurrences have happened before. Born of technology... Though the culprit form those instances is currently in captivity... and those instances have never lead to peoples size being altered in the process.\" The two of you bounced questions back and forth trying to get to the bottom of this. Though you couldn't discover what caused it, it seemed like you were in agreement that you were from another dimension and somehow ended up here with Blaze. Blaze seemed intrigued by the conversation and the implications of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the cat's expression changed to a look of uncertainty. Curiosity. And... disappointment? \"Well with all of that out of the way I still wanted to know, why exactly DID you jump down onto my chair earlier?\" You looked up at her confused as well. Why did you do that? After some thought you came to a embarrassing conclusion. One that caused your face to turn red. You tried to look away quickly, but Blaze already noticed. She gave you a weird look unsure what you were doing when suddenly she realized what you was going on inside your head. You saw the confusion in her eyes shift to bewilderment and even a hint of embarrassment at the possibility as she quietly looked down at the person sitting on her palm. \"Did you.... want me to sit on you?\" her face was both perplexed and embarrassed as she asked you this. You hadn't really thought about this when you jumped down, but as she asked your mind shifted to the idea of being pinned under this gigantic cat girl's soft rear. You started to blush as well and nodded in silence. Blaze\u2019s eyes widened as she saw your response. She blushed slightly before the angry glare returned. \u201cYou actually do. Oh my god what is wrong with you.\u201d The massive cat spoke with disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn\u2019t believe the nerve and stupidity of this person. She tried to help him and provide some safety in his vulnerable state and he throws himself into harms way presumably to be a little pervert. She briefly considered giving you exactly what you wanted. Enough of her butt to enjoy for the rest of your life... all 5 seconds of it. But as she thought more about it, she calmed down a bit as curiosity and opportunity presented themselves to the princess. Though she has read up on the subject, Blaze was curious about the actual experience of sexual contact. And doll sized or not, she did have a willing participant right here in her private chambers. That aside, perhaps humoring some of your interests will lead to you answering some questions about your race to her. Humans were incredibly rare here. And questioning and studying you would certainly be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up nervously as Blaze kept to herself the past few minutes. Finally she looked back down with a somewhat reluctant expression \"Well... okay then.\" her tone was kinda cute given how imposing she looked a few seconds ago. Without saying another word, Blaze turned and headed towards another door with you in hand, While these were her personal chambers, she feared that some workers and servants may still enter to perform their duties such as cleaning and tending to the princess' personal needs and wishes. No, if Blaze was going to do something like this, she was going to do this in complete privacy. Someplace where no one would dare enter without explicit permission from herself for any reason. Blaze was taking you to her Bedchambers. A place where once she entered, none of the others would dare interrupt her. As she entered, she turned to lock the door, making absolutely sure she would have her privacy. \"Are you sure about this human?\" She asked after she locked the door. You pause for another moment; \"Do I really want to have intercourse with a giant cat lady?\" you thought to yourself. Well, considering you've already made it this far you decide to do it and reply \"yes\". Content with your answer and this set-up, Blaze placed you on her bed. The surface was incredibly soft. Not surprising. but still appreciated. Looking back up, you saw that the massive purple cat had turned around. After pausing for a moment while looking away from you she began to remove pants and panties. Nothing was separating you from her bare bottom. And with that, she began her descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stare as the cat drew closer and closer, before finally you found yourself...</span></div></div>",

So naturally the both of you were caught off guard as she unintentionally managed to position herself perfectly to send you up and inside the stinky hole. As soon as your head entered her butt, Blaze stopped briefly her face quickly turning bright red. This sudden feeling of pleasure within her overtook her thoughts. It was unlike anything she ever experienced. Her face quickly turned an even brighter shade of red as she tried to retain her composure in spite of the tiny wiggling below her, inadvertently squirming deeper inside of his new goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, likewise, were caught off guard by this sudden turn of events. You weren't expecting to actually end up INSIDE her rear. You tried to resist it a little on reflex, but the hole was keeping you in place, not wanting to let go. You struggled to pull yourself free but this only seemed to move you further inside. Blaze was oddly silent in all of this. Without warning, Blaze proceeded to slowly sit down, letting her asshole swallow the rest of your tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive cat had been pondering your predicament. She knew this wasn't the proper way that this goes... but it felt so good. Despite her attempts to remain collected about all of this, there was no denying that she loved how you felt inside there. As she slowly began to lower herself, she started to savor each helpless wiggle and squirm from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the giantess moaning loudly from the pleasure as you continued to squirm. A putrid odor started to fill your nostrils as your body started to get pushed deeper. 'Ahhhhh~ this feels amazing!\" Blaze said with a calm but lustful voice. Soon your entire body was within her anus. \"Mmmmhhh~.\" Blaze's voice echoed around you as you felt yourself being sucked deeper into her bowels.</span></div></div>",

Everything about this environment seemed hostile to you, from the walls compacting against you, to the heat, to the increasingly powerful odor. Sadly your struggles to escape this prison only seemed to make the situation worse. Blaze had an awkward grin stuck on her face as your struggles continued from within her. It was a strange feeling for her, but an immensely pleasurable one nonetheless. She also felt a pressure building up down there as you continued your futile struggles. She was almost embarrassed at what would inevitably follow. The smell only seemed to get stronger and you struggled against the ever increasing pressure the walls squeezing you even tighter. It felt as if the cat was trying to hold something back. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist for you to piece together what was happening. You started to struggle even more, but it was no use. The increased pressure built up on all sides of you kept you firmly in place until she could no longer restrain it. The pressure suddenly eased up a bit as a gurgling sound echoed from deeper within, distinctively different from all the other sounds her insides made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbling noise abruptly stops and is followed by a loud pop! The exit finally opened and you were forced out by the walls and the pressure in front of you. You\u2019d probably be more relieved if your escape wasn\u2019t immediately followed by a loud thundering noise. A warm and smelly gas hits your face at full force causing you to gag. Blaze starts to blush again as the sudden release of pressure both pleasures her further and embarrasses her at the same time. She attempted to compose herself as she looked back towards you, doing everything in her power to resist the increasing urge to purr from the sensation. As she looked at your helpless body, she continued to ponder your fate. A being from another world. Shrunken and deposited in her personal chambers. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t a random series of events but instead destiny for you. Perhaps some higher power chose you to be her servant... no... her toy. Blaze blushed again and tried to hold back such thoughts, but seeing you struggle with her has seemed to add more credibility to this theory. A devious thought hit her mind as blaze seemed to focus hard on something. Soon the familiar bubbling noise echoed from within her. Before you could react, a second, much stronger blast of air hit you, with enough force to push you back a few feet. You laid on the bed, covered in the smell of two really potent gas attacks from the giant cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smirked overhead, a lustful expression returned  to her face as she released another gas attack on her defeated little toy. The blast of hot air was mercifully short compared to the others, but the stench was probably the most potent of the bunch. She grinned even wider as she pondered what to do with you.</span></div></div>",

The sight was enough to make you regret speaking up in the first place, but you made it this far now.

Blaze soon apologized for her earlier conclusion, thinking that if she didn't mention it, this wouldn't of happened. She also apologized for accidentally sending you up her asshole and not immediately taking you out. She then takes you to her restroom to clean you off, though her scent was all encompassing to your nostrils, as soon as you were brought into the room it all seemed to vanish and be taken over by the smell of her bathroom. Unlike the other rooms you were in, this one had a powerful but pleasant aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly took off your clothes and her gloves then covered you with a small cloth, she then held you under the the sink and turned the water on. You felt the cold liquid hit your body then the soap scrub over it. \"Stay still, I don't want to hurt or drop you\" she said with a calm but stern tone. It was quite hard to though, due to the freezing cold water your body shivered a lot. She soon finished cleaning her scent along with a few other things off you; \"now that that's over with, I'll clean your clothes off as well\", she then took a towel and wrapped it around your body as she put you down on her closed toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the natural warmth of her hands no longer assisted you, you started to get colder despite the towels fabric. Once she finally finished washing your miniature clothes she turned back towards you to give them back but noticed how cold you were, she placed your clothes down on the sinks counter and picked you back up along with the towel and cradled you. She then said; \"your not quite dry yet, here, let me help you with that\", you felt her palms suddenly warm up as she pressed the towel against you to dry your body off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at how comfortable her hands felt and at how warm they had become. Puzzled, you ask her; \"how did you dry off your hands so quickly?, and why are they so warm?\". She calmly explained; \"thanks to my heritage, I was granted the ability to control flames from my hands and feet once I was crowned ruler\". You gave her a intrigued face but soon it changed to a painful one as her palms slowly became hotter; \"uh... Blaze\" you you say a little concerned. Her palms continued to rise in temperature; \"Blaze!\" you shouted, her hands suddenly lost all their warmth as she quickly replied; \"sorry!, it's hard for me to control it at a low temperature\". She said as she began to warm them up again from the lowest temperature she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were completely dry and had your freshly washed clothes back on.

She looked back down at you and quickly pulled your legs out from under her slit and placed you in front of it; ' now if my memory serves me correctly, I believe your supposed to insert part of your lower body inside me. And also while we're doing this, both of us are supposed to...' Blaze paused for a moment, not knowing exactly what the next word she was about to speak meant.

Seeming to understand it now, she simply nodded as well as giving a smirk knowing now that you also knew how to do this. She then bluntly asked for you to remove your clothes. You started to blush again from embarrassment, but before you removed any of your clothing, you asked her if she understood that doing this led to pregnancy then the bearing of children, making sure she was ok with it. She calmly explained in response; ' don't worry about that, are genomes are almost completely different, therefore neither of our cells would bond with each other.

The main one confusing her now being that her species didn't climax prematurely before actually finishing. Therefore, giving her the thought you were already done.) Before she could continue, you thrust your upper torso between her two massive purple and furry walls, making her interrupt herself with a grunt of pleasure. The smell from her inner chamber became stronger as you forced yourself in, now it became more of a slight stench than a mixture of both ends of the spectrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You soon felt the fleshy walls tense up inadvertently pulling you in slowly, the feeling was a little unpleasant but it also gave you a more powerful urge to do \"it\".  Meanwhile from Blaze's perspective, a tiny human just pushed itself inside her for no sensible reason. She was about to pull you out before her urges took over her better judgement as well and demanded that she push you in deeper. Without a second thought, she lowered her hand down towards your position. You suddenly felt her finger push the lower half of your body inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite her efforts to be calm and professional, the sudden increase of pleasure made her purr with delight, your every movement made her purr louder and louder. The further in you went, the smell as well as the tightness of the muscles surrounding you increased, eventually you came to a stop, hitting the end of her passage. The constant pressure being enforced upon your body became so strong it started to hurt a little. But then you heard the loudest purr you ever heard from a cat echo throughout her body, all the built up pressure constricting your body suddenly released and for a moment, there was silence (except for her frantic heart beat and breathing). Then suddenly a wave of her cum hit you facefirst *<b>splorch</b>!*, you were disgusted by the new potent smell assaulting your nostrils and shook as mush as it or as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After that was over and you regained control of your thoughts, you layed inside her, taking a few minutes to process what just happened. ' after awakening in a strange and new area, you realized you were shrunk somehow. You then tried getting help from the first perso... animal person you found and at first, it seemed to be going well, but now you've been cummed on inside a giant cat girl's vagina. Well, I'm gonna have one hell of a story to tell once I return to normal ', you thought to yourself. But then you realized something else, how are you gonna return to normal if you're in here. You looked back through the way you came in and were shocked, your way out was closed. You soon started to try and push past the now sticky and wet muscles keeping you in here, but to no avail, they just wouldn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started to panic, you frantically pushed against the opening, hoping to break through it. But this also had no \"beneficial\" effect on your situation. In one last ditch attempt, you charged then rammed the exit, the only effect this had was giving Blaze a sudden rush of pleasure again making her climax once again. A second wave of her juices covered your body, the smell and feeling of it at this point was enough for you to start gagging. Finally deciding the process was finished, Blaze reached In and tried to pull you out. You saw her fingers enter and tried reaching for them, but unfortunately she couldn't get them in deep enough for you to grab a hold of them. The both of you soon realized that you were trapped inside, Blaze starts to think of another way to get you out...</span></div></div>",

She basically comforted you, assuring you that you wouldn't be harmed, even petting you from the outside. This did ease your worry, but your concern for what would happen next still persisted. You knew she wouldn't be able to hear you from where you were, so you began to push up against the wall closest to you to try and say you were scared as well as ask when you'd be let out. She continued to caress you, then kindly told you to relax and just to let her take care of <b>you</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You paused for a moment, what exactly did she mean by that? You proceeded to move again to get another response, and hopefully a better understanding of what she just said. Blaze purred again as you did this, then almost as she read your mind, calmly told you what she meant; \"it's okay little one, you're completely safe, and soon, you'll be a strong and proud cat like me\". You felt your heart go from 60mph to just zero in a second, she couldn't be serious... right? You felt her begin to walk again, and then to your dismay,  a delicate and wet umbilical cord attached to your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You soon began to feel tired as well as feel a liquid starting to encapsulate you. You moved towards the cervix, and in one last feeble attempt, tried to escape. It didn't work, it was sealed shut, and soon the umbilical cord pulled you back into the center of her womb. You could no longer resist or even keep your eyes open, and as the fluid began to work it's way up you, you tiredly asked; \"why?\". After you lost your consciousness, you fell into a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were sitting on a hill looking over a green field, everything was bright and beautiful. You felt at peace, at least until the ground shook and above you appeared your mom. Though it was a welcome sight to see your mother again after a couple of years apart, it was a little itimadating considering you were the size of a mouse compared to her. You got up to reunite with her, you didn't care about her size or that this was a dream, you were just happy to see her again. She knelt down and extended her hand to you, to which you climbed onto. She then gently lifted you up to her face and lovingly kissed you before hugging you. You gladly let her do this, it was almost like you were in heaven. The loving act continued for awhile, you eventually looked back up at her only to surprisingly see Blaze had taken her place. You were definitely scared and weirded out at first, but as the hug continued, you began to feel safe, and even began to feel connected to her like you were to your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From then on, the embrace continued for the rest of the time you were being redeveloped. In the last few seconds before your rebirth your mother returned. She gave you one last kiss before everything turned into a blinding light, and the warmth became a bitter cold. After being handled by a stranger in white, you were once again in Blaze's hands, but this time you were bigger, and no longer a human. Blaze welcomed you back into the world, and began to tenderly pet you while cradling you against her warm fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From that day forward you were her son. She lovingly raised, and at times, protected you. Though at first it took some adjusting, you eventually loved her back and lived a splendid life with her.</span></div></div>",

But she was a little flattered you wanted to see the rest of her home, but first she wanted to know who you were, how did you get in her chamber, and how did you get so small? She sat down holding you firmly but gently in her hands making sure that you didn't fall again, then proceeded to ask these questions. You couldn't answer the last two but you gave her your name and explained that you just randomly woke up here. She found that hard to believe but it  was most likely true; \"you know I'm honestly surprised you woke up here of all places, I suppose either my guards have become incompetent or somehow you were teleported here\" she personally believed the ladder. But she still didn't have a clue why you were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were are you from anyway?\" she asked, you told her that you were from a G.U.N. controlled area and that it was close to the southern islands. Blaze was perplexed; \"what do you mean G.U.N. controlled area? I never heard or read of this\", you looked at her with confusion as well; \"you don't know about G.U.N.? There the group that controls the western portion of the earth and have the biggest military in the world\". Now Blaze was even more confused; \"wait, that's part of my territory, how can they control it?\", You reply; \"what do you mean your territory? They've governed over that area for centuries and never mentioned you\". Now she was a little annoyed and furrowed her brows; \"my family has ruled over this land for generations, you must be delusional to think otherwise\". You started to feel her palms underneath you heat up a little, but you just assumed it was her warm blooded veins. You both thought to yourselves about the other's words, you decided to hear the giant cat out considering how important she looked, she must be in some kind of position of power, maybe in one of the other power's ruling the world. Plus she could easily just squash you if she wanted. On the other hand Blaze thought you were probably raised in one of the remote areas where they didn't know much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze opens her eyes and now they had a completely annoyed expression, as she started to explain how you were wrong you felt her hands heat up more. You once again thought it was something natural like your body's warmth was combining with hers. You stood there completely silent, listening to her speak and pretending to agree, once she finished she stood up and brought you to a map of her kingdom. You noticed that it was exactly like the maps you saw during your education but without the different governments label's on there respective areas, instead all of the territory's were combined into a few land masses, the majority of which having some kind of feline emblem on them. Then she explained; \" see here, there's no other power in this region besides my own, the few other monarchs are located over in the eastern continent. Blaze then lets you down onto the map and asked you to show her where you were from once again, you take a moment to study the map before heading towards then standing on where the southern region of G.U.N.s territory was supposed to be nearest to where the southern islands were in your mental map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then looked at you with intrigue, that certain part of her land was one of the most educated areas in her kingdom. So now that her previous theory was proven wrong she started to pace, thinking of what possibly could've happened to you, she soon came up with a new possible explanation...</span></div></div>",

That was the only thing you could recall before you blacked out. The immediate thought that came into fruition was that you were dead, whatever that light was, it sure wasn't a simple source of illumination.

Right in front of you was a pricey looking bed with a gold colored rim, and what appeared to be custom made woodwork and covers. To your left there was a towering door, decorated with golden symbols of crowns and embers. There was also various wooden furniture lying beside and behind you. There was a fancy polished marble table on your other side along with a chair. Behind you stood a massive bookcase, even without the factor of your size, it was huge; it must've contained hundreds of books. You came to the obvious conclusion that this bedroom belonged to so one rich or important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were about investigate the rest of your surroundings when suddenly the aforementioned door began to open. Not knowing who was entering or where you were, your immediate reaction was to hide. You crouched down in the carpet hoping to blend in and not be seen, although your clothes and the carpet had a stark contrast in color. You watched as the door moved inward to reveal a figure, a... cat person? You were a bit surprised at the being's abrupt appearance, and not just because of its size, but because you've never seen a cat hybrid before; especially a purple one. From the looks of it, it appeared to be female due to its slender form, chest, and some weird piece of jewelry in the middle of its forehead. Luckily she didn't seem to notice you, she just walked over to the side of what you presumed was her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She surprised you even further by taking off her clothes, and not just her dark purple shirt and whites pants, but her undergarments as well! Though you were usually unphased by similar sights, you couldn't help but stare at her slender form. Your \"admiring\" was cut short though, as she laid on her bed; moving out of range of your weary eyes. You started to ponder if you should try to get her attention, you needed help, but this was most likely a bad time to ask for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though you knew she would probably get mad at you or embarrassed for you seeing her, you decided you had to get her attention. But how should you do it? You could climb up the bed to her, or you could climb the table so you would be in plain sight, and could try to signal her from there. Either way both would probably have the same result. </span></div></div>",

During the trip you noticed she was moving thanks to the vibrations you felt while climbing, as well as making a weird noise. It sounded like a cross between a meow and a murr with a noticeable restraint, like she was trying not to make the sound in the first place. You pondered what she could possibly be doing, originally you thought she was going to sleep, but all the motion and sound she was causing eliminated that possibility.

But besides that fact, the overwhelming smell she was producing seemed to draw you in. By now you had a more \"revealing\" look at her, obviously being able to confirm she was female. But not only that, she was in a yielding position, having her posterior in the air with her legs stretched apart, while grasping at her blanket.

But this place wasn't strange in the way of new animals or flora, no, instead everything was huge. The size difference here was obvious, you could get killed by a mouse or a couple of insects if your weren't careful, which you usually weren't. Days passed by as you made your way through what appeared to be massive forests and long grasslands, which in actuality were just gardens and normal blades of grass. You knew this and just hoped you could find a way to get back to normal before anything else that could kill you got the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today started out fine, you just had to get through another garden of sorts to get to some really fancy residence for help. Obviously this wasn't your first choice seeing that whoever lived there was probably rich and really snooty, but you trying to get to a normal house was arguably more treacherous. Unlike this one, the village you came across a few miles back was out in the open with no grass or foliage low enough to the ground for you to hide in if an animal came by, or an unaware giant. Granted you haven't seen anyone since that incident... But you wanted to make sure you could get one of their attentions without risking getting crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that you were a little closer you realized it was a palace, that had a really easy approach thanks to all the flower beds, bushes, and trees covering the courtyard; you had to admit it actually looked pretty nice. After what felt like miles of walking you finally made it to the edge of the courtyard, obviously outlined by bushes. After doing this many times prior, making your way through the bushes was easy, and luckily you didn't run into anything while inside them. But your journey was soon hindered by an obstacle, an orange and furry one; a fox! It seemed to already know that you were in the bush, and looked at you with what you could only assume was malicious intent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if that wasn't enough to slow you down, you soon heard footsteps slowly coming closer. Oddly enough the fox didn't seem to care, instead of running It got closer to your bush and started climbing. In response you tried climbing up as well, but as you took hold of one of the twigs, one of the branches supporting you snapped, causing you to fall then hit the stone underneath with a loud thud. The fox capitalized on this opportunity and swiftly jumped from the bush onto you, holding you down with a large paw. You tried to break free, but the only result you got was more pain. The fox had dug its claws into your arm, causing some previous wounds to reopen while simultaneously making a gash lengthwise down it. You screamed in pain, which somehow made the footsteps you heard get a lot quicker and closer. Yet again the fox didn't move, it just lowered its head closer to you. Oh God this is it isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You screamed louder, praying that whatever the other set of footsteps was coming from would scare off the predator. And to a degree it seemed to work. The fox stopped leaning down and looked back before shoving a paw over your face. Though you were relieved that the creature's mouth was no longer moving closer, you were now enveloped in complete darkness, unable to see what the creature was doing or if anything else would come to your rescue. The pressure, blocking off your windpipe, made I harder to breathe as you struggled to get some air in you. Soon the paw lifted back off of you. You enjoyed the rush of fresh air, gasping loudly, but soon the fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snout began its approach once more. Suddenly, you heard the loud voice of a female yell; ' Stop! '. Even more surprisingly the fox let go of you and got off, before sitting beside you. After a few more tremors the footsteps stopped just out of your line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were so close to salvation as well, if It just wasn't for this damn fox. You then saw the silhouette of a purple... cat human? lean over you; ' oh my, a human! '. She gasped even more once she got a closer look at you, ' your hurt badly, I better get you some medical attention quick! '. She suddenly picked you up, to examine you, making sure the fox didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t harm you. Her sharp eyes quickly noticed the gash in your arm and the familiar claw marks around you. She shook her head before looking down at the fox harshly, you even heard it whine a little. She looked back at you again. Her worried expression was now gone, and was replaced with...</span></div></div>",

The tides and waves got really crazy and you ended up being tossed from the ship. You tried to get help and return to the ship, but it was no use, the ship only got further and further away before you finally passed out, expecting to never awaken again.<br>\r\nThat was a week ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, you awakened on a beach somewhere on an unknown island. You didn\u2019t see any other people around, the whole place seemed deserted. You wandered aimlessly through the island. Trying to make the most of a bad situation. Though you didn\u2019t see any animals so far,there was plenty of vegetation, in fact the trees were absolutely massive, as were their fruits. After a nervous first try to see if it was edible, it was clear you weren\u2019t going to go hungry here. However, today lead to one of your biggest discoveries about the island. You stood in complete awe of the sight, at first believing it to be a ditch or something before you got a better view. A rush of emotions filled you as you stared. It was a giant footprint. There was no mistake. You saw another not too far from this one, and even more after that. You weren\u2019t alone on this island, and on top of that who ever this other person was, he or she had to be gigantic. The foot prints were so huge you could lay inside them. By comparative scale, you\u2019d probably be barely 3 inches to her... assuming you weren\u2019t actually 3 inches. The massive plants certainly seemed to have a new meaning with this revelation. Not that the exact nature of your sizes really mattered now. At the moment, you carefully followed the tracks, curious about what exactly you were sharing the island with. The journey took almost the whole day, but you seldom found yourself standing before a huge shack fairly close to one of the beaches. Your heart pounded, but you felt it would be easy enough to inspect the building unnoticed.and made your way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of waves echoed in the distance  and the faint smell of sea water tickled your senses, you inspected the rooms. It wasn\u2019t too large, but the owner clearly had some essentials like a kitchen, bathroom, and living room. You saw some junk and ship parts laying around before a noise started to echo. You quickly hid and waited... but nothing came. Soon the sound echoed once more. It... kinda sounds like... snoring? Your heart finally slowed up after the initial scare. Still maybe this would be a good time to investigate the owner to see exactly what you were dealing with. Though perhaps you tried your luck enough for one night and should keep away from her for now. </span></div></div>",

Besides it's intimidating size, it didn't really look that threatening, who knows, it might just be able to help you. After deciding to approach it, you climb onto the bed. You start to make your way to it's head when you notice how small it's body is, granted, it was still huge compared to yourself, but if you were at your normal height you'd probably be about 2 to 3 feet taller then the animal. Once you get closer to it's head you also noticed it had really small and hard to see clevage, well at least now you knew it was a girl.

The giant orange creature\u2019s breath had a bit of that morning odor to it, but at the very least the heat was a welcome change after wandering around in the cold dark for the past couple hours. Inspecting the sleeping giant a bit more, you figured that your best hope would be to get her attention as soon as possible. Of course this was easier said than done as this, humanoid raccoon looking girl was out like a light and your size certainly wasn\u2019t doing you any favors with waking her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving out of the way of her breath, you figured the best bet would be to head for her ear and call out for her attention. You approached slowly as the terrain sank with every step making walking a bit more difficult than normal. You used this time to inspect the room itself. Looking around this girl was clearly a fan of boats and sailing. There was a model ship on a table nearby, various maps and sea charts on the walls, and even a cute captains hat that was most likely her size. Learning a bit more about this giantess you were surprised when you realized that you had already reached the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the ear laying close to the bed you decided to call out normally so not to startle her too much. \u201cHey! Um excuse me, please wake up?\u201d Your tone was a bit shaken as you were unsure how to go about with this. Her ear flicked slightly, but otherwise she didn\u2019t really seem to react. \u201cHey!\u201d You call out a bit louder. Her ear twitched more but she remained out like a light. Finally you started shouting \u201cHEY! WAKE UP!\u201d You quickly covered your mouth afterwards but it seems that this one did the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the girl jolted awake and sat up, looking around frantically. Her sudden movement and her hand planting down on the bed next to you for support caused you to tumble towards the new dip in the bed towards her orange fuzzy hand. \u201cThe heck was that?\u201d She asked groggily in a thick Australian accent. Before long she felt something hitting her hand and shifted her focus to the strange new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her massive eyes moved closer, they were still partially shut since it was still the middle of the night, but as they got a better look at you they started to widen.

Despite the pleasant warmth of the appendage, you began to shiver involuntarily as several frightening potential outcomes flashed in your head. Possibly having one's life at stake does that someone. You felt disoriented as the hand moved up a bit before the fingers unfurled and giving you a full frontal view of the raccoon girl's massive glaring face. Upon realizing the gravity in the situation, your face paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay are' you?  And ya with Captian Whiskers or ya are a bot made by Egg-jerk. Send to learn secrets of the great captain Marine\" The raccoon girl seriously questioned. But you give her no vocal answer as you stared incredulously at the furred titan. Just what in ever loving fuck is she talking about!?! Even Marine herself eventually realized that it was stupid and slap her forehead and shook it. \"Maybe I'm a wee bit off base. But Captain Marine still make ya give your dues ya filthy little vermin.\" She said in her thick accent as a massive finger poked your chest roughly to stress the last few syllables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon began to rub her chin in a multitude of ways to punish you. A suddenly a devious idea struck her not so little noggin. Instantly she pulls out her legs from the covers, revealing her very human-like pieds.

I mean look at them!'</i> The bones in your legs start to feel like jelly and your face became fiery. The sight has made your groin to stir. Quickly you began to feel guilt and shame. Do this goddamned girl know what she is <i>truly</i> doing to you right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broad light Auburn colored soles wrinkled greatly, and her ten fat toes scrunched and wiggled. Momentarily revealing her pointy nails, which is painted messily in the color daffodil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Bugger take a good look at them.you going to be all up close and personal with my lovelies. And they can be quite pft...<b>fragant</b>!\" Marine snickered impishly at the implication she gave out. One of her favorites pastimes is messing with Blaze with them. The prissy pussy cat always gagged and nagged about how \"unladylike\" for a young girl like herself to have feet out like that shoving em around people. Like it is better to smoother them in weird smelling gunk every day. Natural is always best according to the captain\u2019s personal motto. And she will show the cat whose right by dealing with this little intruder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of him he is looking at them...<u>weirdly</u>. She could tell it was fear. While she is very angry at the invasion of privacy and waking her up in the middle of the night. She won't do anything to truly hurt the little guy. She might be angry but she isn\u2019t a monster. Still he needed to learn his lesson after all that. But as Marine looked back at the helpless little rat at her feet, it became increasingly obvious to the raccoon that there is something more to his expression than simple fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Apparently she has already decided that you will be her cabin boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean... my...c-captain?\u201d You struggle to keep up with this girl\u2019s decisions and intentions as she apparantly decided to \u2018volunteer\u2019 you into her crew.. \u201cAnd I...I am not hiding anything from...\" You squakes up to her in utter surprise, worried that the giant may have caught on to what was going on. You hoped your response would get her to move on, but Marine continued to stare down at you. It didn\u2019t take long for you to realize that you were not that good of a liar and she could easily see through any lie you might try to throw her way. Seeing there is no way to worm out of this ordeal. \"I just...I like your feet okay!\" There you give her the <b>simple pg</b> explanation.

You were looking down in embarrassment at first, but it seemed like the worst of it was behind you... or so you thought. Once you looked back up, it appeared that your words finally clicked in Marine\u2019s head. You shivered once more as a mischievous grin started to form on the raccoon\u2019s lips. \"Well lookee here. Bugger likes the fruits of all my hard labor.\" Marine teased. She further snickered at your funny red face. Upon learning this little secret of yours, your captain suddenly had a whole new slew of fun little games for the both of you in the near future. In fact she with this little revelation, Marine wasn't even mad at you anymore. Of course she was still going to \"punish\" you.

And besides, she has to be bluffing about those big dogs of hers.

Yeah, you can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a newfound sense of confidence you made your way towards the large fuzzy soles while Marine giggled overhead, finding the scenario, as well as that bold way you were stepping to be adorable. As you got closer to them. The air around you started getting warmer and staler. And your pace slowed a bit as the increasingly powerful stench was slowly making you dizzy, but nothing you can't handle...hopefully. Though your head get dizzy and your confindence started to wane, you couldn\u2019t help but notice that your lower head is certainly enjoying this experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally got close to the <i>huge</i> soles, the odor had taken a stronger grip of your mind and you found yourself beginning to enter a lucid state of euphoric arousal. Your body, once walking boldly with confidence, now wobbled like a top as you messily planted your beet red face on her harder right heel. A grand force of rotten salty cheese, spicy vinegar and wet earthiness assaulted your nostrils. The intensity and the strength of the smell slightly sting your eyes. It turns out Marine wasn\u2019t bluffing about her \u2018natural perfume\u2019. That girl was actually telling the truth about her mighty orange soles. That smell could probably cause paint to fall off a car. Yet, despite this being the grossest thing you have ever did, a part of you is...<u><i><b>loving</b></i></u> the ever-loving shit of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your face gets wet with sweat and wet dirt, you nostrils flared as you greedily take in the mighty odor. It was like an aphrodisiac to you, riling something deep inside of you. Clearly the soles were putting you further under their entrancing spell. A small part of you that resisted noticed that your state of mind isn't greatest right now. But for the most part, this entire experience was just too amazing for you to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, bugger guess you must really love em.\" A blushing Marine coyly chuckled as she the little human sampling them. It was such a funny feeling that the raccoon was giggling. You better believe this going to be a routine thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I don't got much use for a sleepy head, and you can't get good work done without feeling rested.\" She said as she opened up your cage. You considered trying to bolt while she reached in, but you didn't you'd survive a fall from the top of her table... or even get past her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Marine can we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Captain to you little mate.\" Marine interrupted as she grabbed you and yanked you out of the cage. \"And don't bother trying to talk your way out of this. You ended around my home and knocked over my stuff. If anything I'm helping you out! How could a little guy like you survive out in the cruel giant world? Having a trusty captain like me will make your tiny life a breeze! As long as you help repay the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she did kind of have a point, you really don't like the idea of owning this massive racoon girl any favors. \"What exactly are you gonna have me do... captain?\" You add, hoping it would please the massive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to do just that as Marine had a happy smirk on her face. \"Well, I'm a simple girl and I don't want a lot from ya. I mean you don't have much to give anyways.\" She chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit offended at that comment but you decided to not push your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice that Marine was moving to the other side of her room; specifically, she was going towards the exit. Was she taking you outside? Maybe you were just going to keep watch outside? Or do some chores?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see those guys by the door?\" You hear Marine ask you. You look to the door again and don't see anything of notice. All there is was the door and her shoes. You just shake your head, which Marine seems to have noticed. \"Come on, you might be tiny but I'm sure your brain works just as good as mine.\" You just look at her slightly confused. Marine simply groans and explains it to you, \"I'm talking about my shoes you barnacle brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could process what she said, you feel your stomach drop as Marine casually tosses you towards her shoes. To her surprise, you actually sailed right into one of her shoes, landing perfectly on her heel and leaving you open to her orders. \"Hmmm. It seems like you were meant to end up in there shrimp.\" She giggled watching you recover from your flight. She wiggled her toes eagerly as she approached you , stopping to loom above you. \"Your the perfect size it looks like, now be a good sailor and make way for the captain!\" She ordered as she begins to move her foot towards the opening of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace for the worst as Marine's ginormous foot barrels towards you...</span></div></div>",

This meant that you were now stuck in an awkward position, lodged between her first and second toe. You futilely continue to struggle against the musky, sweaty, orange toes but your attempts to break free only resulted in more of her sweat splashing in your face, intensifying the smell that her foot gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get acquainted to your new friends,\" you faintly heard the orange raccoon say outside of the shoe, with a hint of mischief (and sadism? you couldn't tell) in her tone.

Everything about the house was gargantuan; the walls, the furniture, most importantly the inhabitants. There were only two, a mature looking anthropomorphic rabbit woman, and her young daughter. The daughter also had a pet of some sort, but you haven\u2019t seen him in a while. You doubted it was dead since the girl wasn\u2019t mourning when it vanished, but you didn\u2019t really care enough to figure out the real reason. You kept yourself hidden as you would spy on the two, trying to learn about them and their habits to aid in your own survival. The mother seemed polite and proper most of the time, a trait which rubbed off on her daughter, though she still had some childish traits which come with her age. You actually considered revealing yourself to one of them, seeing if thy could help you, but the fear of being mistaken for a rodent or some other pest kept that idea at bay. Unfortunately, the rabbits were very clean which made it hard to get food most of the time. The daughter would sometimes have an accident, but you you would still need to act fast to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was not a lucky day. You haven\u2019t eaten in a while and we\u2019re starting to get desperate. You happened upon a mouse trap with food over the trigger as bait, staring hard at the trap pondering the risk and reward while your stomach growled. With little choice, you leaned forward and carefully tried to remove the food without setting off the trap. So far so good, but you soon lost your balance and fell forward, setting off the trap and feeling a large metal bar slam against your back painfully, holding you tightly in place. You tried to squirm free, but it was no use.you could only weakly call for help and hope whichever giant found you would be benevolent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps soon echoed as someone entered the room to investigate. Their heavier stomps signaled that the mother had heard the noises and come to investigate. A gloved hand soon wrapped around the trap and you and lifted it up to inspect the catch. After the initial vertigo you looked at the Titan who had now removed the bar from you allowing you to move again. You would be relieved, but the thought of being in this giantess\u2019 hand was a frightening thought, especially when you had no clue what kind of person she was. Slowly and nervously you looked up to see her expression.</span></div></div>",

How did you even get like this.\u201d You were still in a bit of shock and couldn\u2019t really respond coherently. The mature looking rabbit woman smiled knowingly in response and started to pet you with a finger. \u201cYou poor thing. I can\u2019t even imagine what you must be going through.\u201d Her tone was motherly and concerned, which really did a lot to calm you down. To think, an hour ago you kept yourself hidden out of fear for your life. Now she has you and you\u2019ve never felt safer. <br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you.\u201d You finally spoke up. \u201cTruth is... I don\u2019t know what happened. I just woke up one day tiny and in a strange place with no explanation... I... didn\u2019t mean to intrude, I just really needed some form of shelter and thought you\u2019d think i was a pest.\u201d You timidly admitted. The massive rabbit simply hugged you to her chest as she stroked the back of your head with a finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. We might not be able to get you back to normal, but at the very least we can keep you safe and fed.\u201d You we\u2019re almost crying in response to her kindness and generosity after god knows how long you had to struggle for the most basic needs to survive. She seemed to take notice of this and stroked your back gently to help you calm down. The hug got a bit tighter as well, pressing you deeper into her warm, loving embrace. You felt something you hadn\u2019t felt time in a very long time, a sense of safety. A feeling that things would be alright for you. The woman smiled at you as you calmed and spoke up once more.  \u201cMay I ask your name?\u201d Her voice snapped you out of your little trance, but you still felt very safe and relaxed. You cleared your throat before stuttering it out nervously, still a little shy towards this sweet giantess who held you. She smiled warmly response, \u201cMy that's a pretty name. I'm Vanilla.\u201d You were a little embarrassed at being called \u2018pretty\u2019 but it didn\u2019t bother you too much right now. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name. It\u2019s nice to actually meet you.\u201d You spoke up with a bit more confidence than earlier. Vanilla cooed and hugged you once more. \u201cMy, what a little sweetheart we have here. It\u2019s always nice to see others showing courtesy these days.\u201d The next few minutes were the two of you silently getting used to the other. You getting used to how nice this giant you hid from actually was, and her getting used to the small person who could fit in her palm.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let me get you washed up and then we\u2019ll check my daughter\u2019s dolls for any clothes that can fit you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The bathroom was relatively small for them but it had everything they needed. Vanilla set you in a basket with towels near the toilet and pondered. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to go about washing you. The sink seemed fitting in terms of size, but perhaps that would be uncomfortable. The bath itself might be too big, unless you had someone watching you. Granted you\u2019d probably need someone watching you either way.

Then she walked over to the large tub and bent over to turn on the water giving you a nice view of the outline of her rear underneath the dress. You watched her, curious about her actions. \"Isn't that a bit much for someone my size?\" you called up to her, hoping your voice was loud enough that she could hear it over the running water. Vanilla finally turned her focus to you, kneeling down so that she was closer and hopefully less intimidating to the tiny man sitting on the pile of clean towels. \"For just you, maybe, but you won't be alone in there.\" she said in a calm tone. You didn't quite catch on to what she was saying at first. \"What are you talking abo-\" you stopped and sat there in stunned silence as Vanilla returned to her full height and began to slowly disrobe. As her long and beautiful dress came off, your eyes slowly looked up, scanning the long slender legs, shapely hips, firm stomach, impressive sized breasts, and finally, her smiling face looking down at you. Vanilla was amused by your reaction to her undressing and slowly removed her shoes and underwear while keeping an eye on you as you did your best to hold back any pervy thoughts about the gorgeous gigantic, now nude rabbit woman who had generously allowed you to stay in her home. \"I figured I could use a nice relaxing bath as well. Kills two birds with one stone this way.\" she said mater of factly trying not to giggle at how red your face had become. \"Y-y-you're okay doing this with me... like...?\" your stumbled over your words as you tried to calm down. \"Well, I can't exactly take a bath with the dress on now can I?\" she said in a teasing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the tub was filled and Vanilla gently picked you up placing you on the side as she stepped into the tub. Watching her monolithic form slowly and gently enter the water was something else entirely. Slowly her body seemed to sink into the ocean before you before only her head and part of her chest was visible through all the steam and soap. A hand rose from the sea and carried you back down with her while another placed a tiny chunk of soap beside you while rubbing a tiny amount of shampoo into your hair. You did your best to get cleaned off. All those weeks of living in hiding had made your body rather filthy, though your eyes did shift back to Vanilla quite a bit as you went through the process. Vanilla was mostly laying there with her eyes closed, relaxing. From here she truly looked like some sort of goddess. You were thankfully that you were on this particular goddess' good side, imagining what her wrath would be like. Finally your body was mostly clean. Though this was rather relaxing. Maybe you'll stay in for a bit.</span></div></div>",

It somehow made you feel safe. You still resisted her a little on reflex, but Vanilla noticed that you were't putting up as much of a fight and smiled down at you once again. When she finally finished, you're entire body was sore and exhausted from the experience. Vanilla admired her work briefly before noticing how you looked, laying there naked in her hand. You were so small, cute... but vulnerable. The sight of such a tiny, scared, helpless being huddled against her for warmth set off familiar feelings in her. The same kind of feelings when she first saw her daughter, and all those times said daughter would run off on dangerous adventures with her friends. She instinctively pressed you against her chest petting your back gently.

You felt the familiar warmth of her fur against your skin as your body was pressed up against it.

She was waiting for your response, but to her it appeared that you either didn't hear her or you were just being shy. So she decided to help you a bit, she raised you to her now exposed nipples and in a comforting voice she told you that it was ok, and to help yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You began to feel something, for what ever reason, it was urging you to accept her gesture.

Nervously she said; '  p-please don't look at me like that, I know your excited but please try to be civil. '.

You heard her chuckle again; ' don't be shy little guy, I won't hurt you ', she then brought one of her hands down and used two of her fingers to spread apart her vulva so you could enter. You were immediately greeted by a strong scent, though it wasn't necessarily a bad smell, it wasn't exactly inviting either. You slowly start to make for the small hole leading inside her but stop for a brief moment to look inward, it appeared like an endless abyss of velvet muscle leading into darkness, ever so slightly moving thanks to her breathing.

Though considering how small you were, it felt more like a ticklish sensation.

As you continued you journey, the constant constrictions helped you along your way, and thanks to the already wet passage, you didn't really have to put much effort into it.

You started to wonder how the both of them would react to you, though she would probably be surprised by your new appearance, you knew Vanilla would still be kind to you. On the other hand, you had no idea how her daughter would react to having a sibling, let alone where you came from and how small you were, assuming she was young and didn't know about \"the gift of life\".

Once their again, the cervix quickly shut, and before you could react you heard another loud gasp as you were again blanketed by her reproductive cells.

Though you had the mental capacity of an adult and decent motor control, you fell back on the thoughtless impulse of seeking warmth.

You looked back up at Vanilla, she appeared to be happy with her new child, but also seemed a bit flushed, most likely from giving birth to you. She simply smiled while looking at you, she started to cradle you in her arms, covering your torso and lower half with her soft and warm fur. Cream almost immediately got closer to examine you and was once again, way to close for comfort. You could feel her hot breath surround you as she breathed, and when she spoke again her voice boomed, hurting your eardrums to the point that you covered them.

Quickly coming to your bearings, you notice you were back inside her womb, with your almost instinctual urge to get out still being present. So you once again began to search for a way out, it was the only thought your nauseated brain could fully process. You soon found the cervix again, but hesitated for a moment remembering what happened the last time you tried taking that route. After thinking for a bit, Instead of trying to push yourself out like last time, you decided to push against the upper wall of the womb in hopes of signaling her through movement. As soon as you made the third or fourth push, the entire area moved. You were rocked back and forth until finally the movement stopped and you fell back down on the floor of the organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You then heard Vanilla's voice call down to you, asking almost surprisingly if you were awake and or conscious. You tried giving her an answer but it appeared that she couldn't hear you, probably thanks to how small and deep in her you were. Since that didn't work you started to push up again, which to Vanilla felt like a baby kicking. After a few moments of silence Vanilla spoke again, saying that if you were somehow sentient, you should \"kick\" twice.

She then quickly asked if you were ok, if you were hurt, or in any pain. After you replied no by \"kicking\" once you heard her exhale a large amount of oxygen in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She then explained; ' I'm sorry I didn't tell you this sooner, but it takes some time to complete this process. Since it takes 8 to 9 months for a baby to be developed, I thought this would be similar. So when you started to exit only a month and a few weeks in, I feared that if I gave birth to you that soon you'd be under developed. So as you already experienced I kept you in. I honestly didn't expect you to be sentient only 2 months in. And frankly, this is the first time I've ever tried this '. That information hit you like a bombshell, not only were you in her for 2 months, she wasn't even sure this would work?! Well at least it appeared to be working, considering all your new features and that your not dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' i'm still not sure if your ready, you haven't even been in there for half of the time an infant is supposed to.

What if the process failed in the end?, what if she left you in to long?, and how exactly was she supposed to tell when it was finished? Despite these doubts and lingering questions, she decided it would be best to keep you in for a few more months, it did appear to be working after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vanilla then abruptly asked; ' wait... have you been conscious this entire time?

After taking some mental notes just in case she ever did this again, she then jokingly remarked; ' you sure do like to sleep a lot, who knows, maybe the next time you'll wake up you'll be my fully developed kit '.

Soon enough you found yourself up against the exit to her \"<b>warren</b>\", and it was extremely tight, tight to the point that it took all your strength just to get your hands in.

I thought you said you weren't going to... '. She giggled a bit before reassuring you that she wasn't having sex with you, she was just showing her new son his room. Wait... Did she just call you her son?! even more importantly, what did she mean by your room?! Before you could fully process that new information, you felt something grab your feet. You immediately looked down to the source, and to your horror her orifice had gripped onto them and was slowly starting to pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hastily kicked at it and freed yourself briefly, before Vanilla pushed them back in along with your legs up to your waist. You started to panic, and frantically kicked and pushed against her furry lips until your arms were sucked in an deemed immobile. You began to plead with her not to do this, and brought up your previous and very real argument that doing this would kill you, thanks to lack of oxygen and the strong constrictions possibly crushing you. But this time she didn't reply, she only gave you an eager look before using her finger to push the rest of you in. You began to scream for her to stop, beginning to feel her vaginal muscles clamp onto your body and pull you in her quicker. But the only thing she did was tell you not to struggle and let it happen, before muffling your cries by pushing your head in between her furry walls then into her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As your head was consumed by her pussy, you saw the entrance close, trapping you inside. Everything went black as her lips shut, rendering your sight useless. Try as you might, you couldn't break free of her increasingly wet muscles further pulling you in. You slowly became covered in her liquids as you neared her intended destination for you, and before long you felt your legs enter a different chamber. With a few more constrictions, you were deposited into a soft, spongy, and somewhat cramped area. You knew where you were and stopped struggling, it was pointless now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started praying, you didn't know how you were breathing or why her womb just let you in, but you just hoped you wouldn't be digested or unborn; and if either happened, that it would be quick and painless. A new scent started to surround you, calming you down and making you tired. And almost on queue, Vanilla said; ' rest now sweetheart, I hope you enjoy your stay ', before singing you a gentle lullaby while rubbing her abdomen to rock you to sleep. Her efforts almost instantly worked, you slipped away to her graceful tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After some time you woke up to movement, though you couldn't see anything, you could feel...</span></div></div>",

But this was very brief, the motion stopped almost as soon as you became conscious. Though you were barely awake, you could clearly her Vanilla taking with someone, but you could only make out what she was saying. To your further dismay, she rather awkwardly but bluntly requested to have some male rabbit sperm to impregnate herself with. It wasn't that hard to figure out what she was doing and planning for you, you were going to be unborn by her and turned into her son. You wanted to struggle, you wanted to fight it, but you were helpless to do so; the cervix would not let you escape no matter how hard you tried. You soon realised like before the situation was hopeless, and were about to quietly slip away until a sudden question formulated in your mind. Couldn't she have done this without you? she only needed a seed to become pregnant and bare a child, why was she involving you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You began to feel her move again, while hearing inaudible talking coming from the outside. After a while you felt her lay down and were forced to lay down as well. You then heard her thank someone before asking for privacy. Vanilla began to talk down to you with a noticeably excited but still calm and caring voice; ' I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can don't worry. I know this seems scary and all but I won't hurt you, I promise. Soon you'll be my son, and from then on I will take care of you. It'll be safer for you this way, my little friend. I... hope you understand '. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her words were comforting, but you still didn't want this to happen, you were thankful for her hospitality and protection but you didn't want to throw away your past to be this woman's child. So you desperately clawed out the cervix in vain, which let Vanilla know you were awake. ' Oh, your awake, I hope you heard me. Now this may sting a little, but just relax and let me take care of you '. You suddenly felt the cervix open a bit, then a new liquid seep through and cover your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You ignored this and her advice and tried pushing through the cervix while it was still open. As soon as you touched it, it tensed up and quickly closed around you, but this wasn't enough to stop you. You've already gotten your shoulders through, and were about to get your lower torso out. But something suddenly latched on to your back and pulled you back in, letting the cervix close and eliminating your last chance for escape. You could only flail around helplessly as whatever was behind you slowly absorbed your body. Your last sight being the seemingly endless black her insides caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the outside Vanilla felt you struggling, but it slowly got weaker and weaker until finally it stopped within her. She smiled, knowing that her womb was doing its work. From those last few pushes she could tell you didn't go willingly, but that didn't matter, she was finally going to have another child. From the minute she first saw you, she felt, no, wanted to be your mother. Not just a figure, but your actually mom; and now her wish was being fulfilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few weeks later you once again woke up...</span></div></div>",

Though you could only see darkness, you could tell you were no longer in the previous void by feeling your surroundings. Your were submerged in some liquid inside some spongy and yielding area. It appeared to be a bit small at first, but as you pushed against the walls, they expanded to accommodate you. You also noticed that strangely, you were able to breathe despite being fully enveloped by whatever this liquid was; but not through your mouth or nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you swam around exploring the area. you accidentally hit yourself a few times considering how small this new environment was, which lead you to the realization you had fur. You didn't have a lot, but you still had a thin layer fully coating your body. Once feeling that you formed a morbid curiosity, and started to feel yourself for any other changes. To your surprise you had long protruding ears that hung down from your head, along with a small bushy tail on the back of your waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After feeling around some more you discovered you had some kind of cord attached to your belly button. Once that discovery was made you realized you were in a womb, and almost as soon as that hit, your memory flooded back to you. You were inside Vanilla, becoming her son as she said you would. You couldn't believe what was happening, not only were you small and shoved inside a giant rabbit lady's vagina, you're in her womb being conceived again! It took you a few minutes to comprehend this, during which you constantly questioned the absurdity of it. This shouldn't even be possible, how are you still alive? How did her womb even turn you into her... <b>rabbit</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That realization combined with the fact she would most likely want to be your mother when you got out hit you hard. How would you react? what would she expect? The thought of meeting her again as her son was very awkward, you honestly didn't even want to be hers, but now you are. But for some unknown reason, you actually started to feel appreciative towards her, granted she's forcing you to be her child, but she's been nice for the entire time you were with her and was then and now protecting you. Remembering further back, seeing the look she first gave you when she found you was that of general concern and care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the memory of her face alone you could tell she yearned for you, and not in a sexual way as you first thought. She most likely saw you as a lost child thanks to your size and wanted to help, although this is a little extreme. You spent so long struggling and being afraid you didn't even notice her loving gestures towards you, and only saw them for what they were now. You could now see that she earnestly wanted to be your mother ever since she comforted you when she first met you. Who were you to deny her now? she might've been a little forceful, but she obviously was kind, and has decided to go through this to aid you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Recognising all of this, you slowly started to accept the situation and her herself. She would make great mother for you, and your sure as hell lucky to have the honor of becoming then eventually being her offspring. You made a vow to yourself that you'd be the most caring and obedient son she will ever have as a way to repay her efforts. Almost as if she read your thoughts, she unknowingly rewarded you by rubbing you from the outside soon after you made your decision; putting you in a state of bliss feeling her womb's muscles caress you. You really just wanted to hug her at this point now, or anything to show your appreciation and that you now loved her back, but all you could do for now was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After what seemed like hours of laying within her without anything happening, you start to feel something move...</span></div></div>",

By the time you saw it, it was already wet, and you could tell the liquid on it wasn't water or soap. The reproductive organ pulsated ravenously, it didn't take a genius to see she wanted you inside her. She immediately moved her other hand out of the way and pressed you against her lips, covering you in her natural lubricant. You hesitated at first, you didn't think simply complementing her would result in this; but as more of her fluids started to cover your body your apprehension was quickly replaced with overwhelming lust, just like your partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started to caress her inner lips while doing your best to stimulate her with what little you now had. You decided to complement her more to help the process; ' your embrace is so warm and inviting, I want to be smothered by it forever. Your kindness is matched by no other, you truly are a goddess. '. She tried responding, but she could only moan with enjoyment. Your complements had fully aroused her, her lips began to part, threatening to swallow you; but you kept your act up to pleasure her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was practically screaming at this point, but she still wanted more. While continuing to push you against her sex, she began rubbing her clitoris. She was in so much bliss she didn't notice her vagina was swallowing you whole, the only word her mind could process was <b>deeper</b>. Soon your entire body was engulfed by her fleshy cave. Naturally this would be concerning, but the sheer lust and bliss she was putting you through completely overshadowed your logic and or fear. You continued to pet her sensitive area from the inside, and were finally rewarded with a massive climax, and were shot out of her and back into her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could see her innards quiver immediately afterwards, almost as to say they wanted more of you.

You soon realized she had fallen asleep, to be fair, you probably would've to after experiencing something like that in a place like this. You once again looked over her awe inspiring form, she was perfect in every way. If you weren't covered in so many other liquids, you probably would've noticed your drooling and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You began to feel tired likewise, and would soon join her in dreamland, but you felt you were already in it.

It was still wide open and trying to suck something inside, almost like it wanted you with or without its owners consent. You obviously thought about going back in to satiate your own urges, you hesitated. Would it be wise to enter your wife's sacred area without her knowing, what if she got mad and thought you only had sex on your mind? Or worse, something happened to you inside her and she wouldn't be able to help due to her being unconscious?  You considered the consequences, but you soon thought of how nice she was, surely she wouldn't be mad.

You knew you couldn't take much more of its aroma without fainting, so you tried to back-track out, but it had already fully consumed you. Its lips were firmly shut behind you and its pulling and scent wouldn't relent. You started to panic, before realizing you weren't that far from the exit. Almost on queue, the strong but soft constrictions stopped, leaving you in between her womb and lips. But, it still held you in place, not letting you move enough to go back, but enough to let you adjust yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You found this extremely odd, despite your lustful, and tired mind, you still questioned why it would do this.

Well I don't know what you did while I was asleep, but when I woke up I quickly noticed you were gone. Obviously I was worried for you and your well being, but then I noticed a small bulge near my stomach. At first I thought I somehow accidentally ate you and was about to get up and try getting you out. But when I moved I felt you, not in my stomach but... well... my birth canal '. Though the only part of her you could barely see was one of her vaginal walls pressing against your face, you could tell she was blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' luckily you hadn't entered my womb yet, so I pushed you out as fast as I could. It actually felt kind of like giving birth again but a lot less painful. Anyway, once you were out I was going to try and clean my fluids off of you but I couldn't bring myself to wake you up. You looked so cute when you slept, I couldn't dare move you. But seeing that you were still a bit malnourished, I fed you while you slept; though it was really hard not wake you '. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' After all that I noticed you were cold and tried covering you with a blanket, but that apparently wasn't warm enough. So I held you near me. Holding you while you sleep is something I wish we could do more often, you were so adorable rolling in my arms. But I heard you mumbling something. This may be hard to believe, I myself didn't even believe it at first either, but you talked while you were resting. I don't know what you were dreaming about, but you kept saying how warm my innards were and that you wanted to stay inside me. I'm sorry for not consolidating you first dear, but I felt that if you liked it that much in your dream I could let you enjoy me in real life, to you know, bond. Admittedly, I actually kind of... Wanted you back inside me after experiencing it earlier that night. B-but I also thought it be safer for you to sleep there instead of a bed ', she said quickly trying to redeem herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' As I was about to let you back in you actually started to hug me down there. As soon as I let you in I actually felt you crawling inside. I'm really sorry I didn't ask you first, but, I could let you out now if you want '. You didn't know what to do, granted you wanted out but the words she said you said in your sleep had some merit. It is really warm and comfortable in here. But you wanted to see your wife's face again, and also be dry and not covered in her liquids. You thrashed around a little more to tell her you wanted out, and she seemed to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly felt her muscles constrict and push you. A few minutes later you were deposited on what you assumed to be her bed, and were immediately blinded by the light of the room and once again were cold. She began to apologize to you, hoping you weren't mad at her actions. In truth you actually enjoyed it, and soon let her know; ' its fine, I kind of like... being inside you. I should be apologizing for going in without your consent '. Her apologetic face swiftly turned to one of love and joy, before she responded; ' its okay honey, I enjoyed it as well. It actually kind of felt like I was pregnant again, which I honestly loved feeling. Just please ask before you do something like that again, you scared me half to death.  '. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded and once again apologized, before asking her; ' so... what do we do now? I can't really do anything extracurricular because of my size '. She thought for a minute before suggesting; ' how about I introduce you to your new daughter? After we get you dressed of course '. You were actually somewhat eager to meet her daughter, though you already knew how she acted from your observations, you still had yet to meet her properly; she probably didn't even know you existed.</span></div></div>",

You tried to resist looking directly at it and letting her know how dirty your mind could be. As you did this your cheeks started to turn noticeably red, and Vanilla immediately seemed to notice your embarrassment, and its source. You started to get scared, she obviously knew what was going on, and you were afraid for your life. If she thought of you as of a pervert... there are so many ways she could punish you, or even kill you whether intentionally or not.

To your surprise she actually started to laugh, and not an evil or sinister laugh either, completely honest and happy laughter. She soon spoke; ' I take it you certainly like what you see huh? ' with a playful voice. You awkwardly replied; ' heh, I guess ', even more surprisingly she asked if you wanted a closer look. You obviously did, but had a hard time saying so. She could tell by your eyes you did, so she lifted you out from her cleavage and placed you mere millimeters away from it on her abdomen; as well as saying ' go ahead, don't be shy. Were going to be seeing each other like this more often remember? '. Even with those comforting words your face was still red as your blood flow, but now, not only with her permission, but encouragement, you felt safe again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You got down on your hands and knees to get the closest to it without actually touching it, and you were awe struck. For the first time in your entire adult life you got to see a women's private area not just in real life but up close and personal; not to mention the fact that at your new size you could actually fit in it. Apparently Vanilla also saw how much you admired her womanhood and asked something even more surprising; ' you want to help me wash myself? '. You were completely caught off guard by that question, but by now you regained a little bit of your confidence and also saw this as an opportunity to bond with your partner. You almost immediately responded with yes, Vanilla smiled and chuckled before remarking comedically ; ' you must really like it down there, you little pervert '. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You somehow blushed even more at her response, before she asked an even weirder question; ' so... Where would you like to start? my tush? my baby maker? or what seems to be your personal favorite, my breasts? '. You honestly didn't know how to respond to that, did she just offer to let you wash her most sacred places? You couldn't believe it, her putting you between her bosoms was one thing, but actually letting you wash them and or her other private areas?! Though you were reluctant and a little shy, you told her you wanted to wash her...</span></div></div>",

Vanilla then reassured you; ' if your that afraid of her I can just keep you on me until she understands the situation or she grows up '. Even though reassured, you didn't know what to do, should you trust her? or should you swallow your pride even further and have Vanilla as a safe guard against her own daughter?

Contrary to your previous thoughts, she asked who you where, instantly being able to tell you were human. You stuttered a bit while saying your name, still being a little apprehensive. Cream then innocently asked if her mom found her a new friend, Vanilla laughed a little at her daughter's presumption before saying; ' in a way my dear yes, but not an ordinary one, he's your new father!

You turned your attention back towards Cream, she seemed to be completely invested in the story, especially the protagonist. To the point she'd occasionally let her worry for the character be know either through gasps, comments, or questioning her mom to see if the hero was alright. Though the story was rather mild compared to the literature you've come across, it had one thing going for it, that being that you've never heard of or read it yourself before. It even had a few twists that would actually surprise you; a few people within the story actually died, but you could tell Vanilla was censoring it a little to not scare Cream to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While your wife continued reading you went under the covers to warm yourself; neither of them seemed to notice.

Though you weren't sure if they'd be okay with it, you proceeded to get closer to Cream under the blanket.

You didn't really mind if she noticed at this point, but it felt sort of weird doing this.

She had to stifle a giggle at the sight of your still-sleeping body unconsciously bat away her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with the safety of her new father of Cream laid her head back and began to nod off. With her last bit of consciousness, she placed a hand over her belly button, and you. She figured that if she was gonna be your bed, she can at least be your blanket too.

During one small time frame in between her kisses, you were able to give her a quick peck on the bridge of her nose.

She took the blanket off once again seeing you peacefully rest on (in) her, and paused for a moment to adore how cute you looked. A while after she tried to gently wake you up by poking you, which in actuality felt a little rough to you small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly woke up, but didn't really get up. Before realising it was still night, you didn't want to leave your little billet and face the daylight. You wanted to keep your head down and surrounded by her fur along with the rest of your body for as long as possible. But the relentless jabs and whispering from the young rabbit wouldn't let you fall asleep again. So you lazily opened your eyes while unfolding yourself to stand up. You were going to say good morning before you saw the light in the room was still out, but for some reason Cream was up already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were then swiftly raised out of her belly button and up to her face. You were about to ask why she woke you up, before her expression answered it. Her eyes were wide open showing no indication that she fell asleep in the first place; that combined with her wide and innocent smile quickly let you know the situation. She obviously wanted to play with you which in of itself was okay, but what bothered you was not knowing what kind of game she expected you to play with her, let alone how inept a child could become while doing so. And you couldn't really deny her, granted she seemed passive beyond belief, but you had yet to see her or Vanilla's bad side; and comparing both their and your size, that would be a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took a gulp as your previous fear presented itself again. You wanted to run, get Vanilla's help, anything besides being forced to play with Cream unsupervised. But that could also lead to you getting hurt, in many more ways; either accidentally or purposely by Cream even more so than playing, not to mention the numerous hazards of being this small in any place for that matter. To your disappointment playing with her appeared to be the safer option, so you quietly agreed to do what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Defeated, you blandly said; ' so... I assume you want to play a game with me, or something like that? Well I guess we could play for a little while, as long as we're quiet and your <b>gentle</b>. Cream's face somehow lit up even more as you said that, and she started to thank you multiple times for letting her play with you this late ( she probably would of forced you anyway ). She quickly got up throwing her blanket aside and heading for her closet, leaving you on the bed. Then excitingly returned with a reading light and a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' I was hoping we could play dress up, if you wouldn't mind daddy '. You briefly sighed at the thought of being treated like a doll, most likely a female one, but you didn't really have a choice. You hesitantly agreed, to which Cream got a little giddy, to the point she had trouble holding back her excitement; as if she ever tried concealing it. She got back on to the bed and started pulling out dolls along with their clothes as well. You noticed that she had a few male dolls all wearing suits and got your hopes up, maybe this wouldn't be as demeaning and embarrassing as you thought it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After She finished neatly unpacking and sorting the various plastic items, It appeared that she didn't have any other suits besides the ones on the men; which likely meant you'd be trying on dresses and skirts most of the time. You hoped her continuing to search through the box was her looking for more clothes appropriate for you. But the final thing she pulled out was just another dress, a rather small and brown dress; which probably explained why it took her so long to find it. You soon replaced that assumption with the hope that this was going to be really short, and she would only try outfitting you with the tuxedos the men wore. You timidly asked her what clothes she wanted you to try on and how long this was gonna take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She told you; ' I wanna see how you look in all these dresses, I can't begin to imagine how cute you'll look in them! '. You felt your heart sink after hearing that, but you the hastily asked about the boy's clothes. To which she said; ' don't be silly daddy, you can't wear those ', causing you to protest; ' why not? '. She looked at you like you were dumb and replied; ' because their wearing them already, they're their clothes '. After that, you felt like facepalming yourself thanks to this girl's weak concept of common sense; well that or she's messing with you, but you doubt that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You decided not to prolong this or incur her wrath by arguing further, and just asked her what she wanted to dress you with first. She abruptly grabbed one of the dresses on the bed and eagerly asked for you to put it on. The dress itself was rather small and could barely fit you, but you forced it on anyways to please your daughter. She immediately \"d'awwwed\" at your appearance, before saying she had an idea and jumping off the bed. After a few minutes she returned with a little toy camera along with a hastily made paper bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pretty much broke after seeing the camera, doing this in private with your daughter was one thing, but letting Vanilla and possibly others know about this was to far for you. You unintentionally barked at the young rabbit not to take a single photo of you and told her to put the camera away. Her reaction was a bit confusing, she appeared to be in between disappointment, anger, shame, shock, and fear. You soon hushed yourself realising what raising your voice did, you didn't mean to hurt her feelings, but you accidentally set them off anyway. You quickly spoke again in a much calmer voice trying to comfort her and even saying she could take a few shots, as long as she doesn't show them to Vanilla or anyone else; saying that if anyone saw them they'd be able to tell you and her were up late, and that that would have some major repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though you eventually explained that it was okay, she still apologized, struggling not to cry; ' i-i'm sorry dad *sniff* I didn't mean to upset you. I... I just... I didn't know '. You quickly told her she was fine, and that you should be apologizing for your behavior; in turn begging for her forgiveness as well. After wiping an actual tear out of her eye she forgave you, even picking you up and hugging you. You tried to lighten up the situation by saying; so, you wanna see me in the other dresses right? Which one's next? Also how did you want me to wear this? ', holding up the crude bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly but surely she cheered up as she heard you, once again getting excited in a surprisingly small amount of time over something rather minuscule. She took the bow and placed it on your head, though it took her a few tries to get it the way she wanted. Soon she started taking pictures of you in your little get up, smiling and even snickering out of joy while doing it. She tenderly, dare you say lovingly, put you in dress after dress taking at least four or five pictures for each. You managed to create such a powerful bond with her she somehow saw past her previous argument and actually let you try on the suits her other dolls wore. Though she clearly admitted that you looked better in the dresses to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To your surprise, even after all of that, she still wanted to play with you, you and her dolls specifically. Being a lot more trusting and lenient this time you happily agreed. The role-playing started out with prince and princess fantasies eventually leading into duels and even hunting a dragon; though most of it was still just a non-violent romantic fantasy. By the time the story finally ended, you could see it was dawn outside of Cream's window. The both of you simultaneously almost had a heart attack realising the time, you were both up all night instead of sleeping like your were supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You became very scared very quickly, how would Vanilla react to you keeping her daughter up all night?!  Cream didn't look as worried though and soon told you why; ' its okay daddy, she won't be really upset. After we tell her what we were doing i'm sure she'll understand, and if she doesn't she pretty light on punishments for staying up late '. Despite her words you were still worried, how would she punish someone as small as you? The thoughts you had that quickly turned morbid and you naturally didn't want to get punished either. But Vanilla is your wife, she wouldn't punish you that harshly, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way you saw it you had two options, you could either tell Vanilla the truth and face whatever punishment she could come up with. Or secondly, you could get Cream to quickly clean up her stuff and the two of you could pretend to be asleep until Vanilla comes in...</span></div></div>",

Vanilla seemed to agree with her daughter, they just needed your approval. You only thought about the offer for a few seconds before saying it was ok, like Cream said you'd have two protectors, and if Cream did get a little two playful Vanilla would be right by your side to let her know when to stop. This way all three of you were happy, you had Vanilla's and Cream's safe guard and an opportunity to bond with them. Vanilla gets to sleep with her new husband, and Cream gets to play/sleep with her new father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as you agreed Cream immediately hugged you again, and repeated; ' thank you! thank you! thank you!

As soon as Cream was done celebrating the three of you made your way to Vanilla's bedroom, during which Cream imitated her mom and put you in between her own young bosoms; which oddly enough were quite softer than Vanilla's. But your wife's still had more warmth, probably due to her having more fur. During the short walk Cream constantly kept her eyes on you, ironically watching you like you were a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly felt her push you further down, you didn't really object but you still had some worry in the back of your mind. You looked up at her and saw a bit of curiosity in her eyes, you didn't know what she was thinking but you smiled back to let her know she was doing fine. She smiled herself before pushing the rest of you in between her breasts. To be honest your weren't expecting that and almost called out for Vanilla, but the soft and yielding fur of her chest quickly calmed you down. Once the three of you entered the room You heard Vanilla immediately ask her daughter; ' Cream! where is he?! '. Cream simply and innocently responded; i'm carrying him like you were mom ', and revealed you relaxing in her fluff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once she opened her chest, you inhaled a lot. Vanilla gave a huge sigh of relief before telling Cream; ' Cream don't push him all the way in, he could suffocate! '. Cream handed you back to Vanilla while apologizing, but you interrupted saying you could breathe, and you actually enjoyed it; the air flow was just a bit constricted. With that concern out of the way, the three of you layed on her bed, though your bed was a bit different. Instead of sleeping under the covers, Vanilla wanted you to sleep within her. But Cream started to beg the both of you; ' please daddy, sleep with me, pretty pleeease '. She confessed she liked the feeling of having you in her cleavage, and really wanted to experience again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're left two choices, either continue to appease your wife, or bond more with you daughter.

You quickly tried apologizing and pleading with her not to hurt you, and that you were forced into this situation.

She leaned in closer examining you, causing you to fall back out of sheer terror, your trembling became more powerful as a result. Her eyes now stared down at you with intrigue, it appeared that she didn't know what you were, if she thought you were a rat or mouse she probably would've disposed of you by now. But yet...

You closed your eyes and looked away, presumably accepting this to be your final mistake up to your demise. Despite what you braced for, you felt her breath fade away until you could no longer feel it. You then heard her finally break the silence; ' hmm... ' in an amused tone.

Though you still feared her intentions, for some reason you felt that she wasn't going to hurt you. From seeing the new look on her face you could tell she wasn't mad at you, her smirk also seemed different. Not wanting to get on her bad side, you let her carry you without any trouble, and oddly began to feel less on edge.

This time you were on the hunt for a chaos emerald, known for there magical properties you couldn't wait to find one and see what they did. Hearing about the legend of a mighty chaos emerald keeping an island afloat in the air sounded like the most interesting one so you set off to find it. After a few tipoff's you finally manage to get an idea where it is and search the area, wading through what seemed like a endless jungle you start to lose hope of finding the gem. But soon you find something that reinvigorates your determination, mysterious footprints but not like anything you've seen before. They were human-like but a little bigger and appeared to have mild claws on the end of the toes, you decided to follow the footprints trail considering some rumor that a humanoid beast guarded it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      After a couple of minutes you stumble across some kind of hidden stone doorway with strange markings or symbols around it. Grabbing your camera, you immediately started snapping pictures of your discovery. It seemed out of place in a jungle but the foilage camouflaged it pretty well. After some thought you finally decided to open the door. Though it took a bit of effoart, you managed to pry it open, revealing what looked like a glowing portal. After taking a few more shots you work up the nerve to step inside. The light got more brilliant as you slowly approached and soon blinded you briefly. Eventually you came out of the portal to be greeted by an amazing sight. From seemingly out of nowhere an ancient looking city now took up your surroundings. The structures seemed to resemble Mayan architecture. As you wordlessly took another picture you started to notice an uncomfortable thinness of air. You were still able to breathe though your lungs would have to adjust to the sudden change. Though you didn\u2019t see anyone around, you thought you heard voices and decided to move quicklyin order to avoid what you assumed was the guardian beast or tribe. Fortunately, as you snuck along the outskirts of the settlement, you seemed to find your prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere just outside of the more crowded section, overlooking a cliff was what appeared to be a shrine of some sort with 7 glowing gems atop 7 pillars. All of them surrounded a main shrine which held a single giant radiant emerald. You hastily and carefully made your way through what now closer, looked like abandoned buildings, to the shrine. Once there, you walked up some stairs and made your way to the giant emerald, you stood there awe struck at the giant shining gem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you obviously wouldn't be able to carry it back you once again pull out your camera and begin to take pictures so when you made it back you would have proof of it when telling the story. But then, the emerald started to glow, then your eyesight was engulfed by a sudden green flash. you awake dizzy and confused,  you start to look around, You see stone pillars much bigger than before and giant stone walls surrounding you, \"what happened...?\" You asked still being a little dazzed from the flash. You soon realise you've been shrunk down, before you could react to this predicament you felt the ground start to shake and heard a feminine voice \"the master emerald!\" With a alert tone. You turned around to see a enormous and orange anthropomorphic creature in the door way running towards you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you were waiting for her to return you took a look at your new surroundings, there wasn't anything that interesting besides the ancient looking stone walls and a few decorations here and there, the door was made out of some wood and the windows didn't have any glass they were just holes with cloths covering them and the the room was lit with torches. It wasn't completely primitive looking though, there was a bookcase on the other end of the room and even some furniture besides the table also made of wood, cloth, and or feathers. Soon the giantess returned with a book. The massive creature placed the book next to you with a heavy thud. \"Forgive me for the wait, I needed to find this. My name's Tikal by the way.\" she hastily introduced herself as she quickly set herself to get to the bottom of your condition. As she opened it up you saw a lot of text in symbols and words that you could not read. The giant pressed a finger and moved it along the words as she quickly skimmed through it to the important sections hoping to find something related to your curse. \"I serve as the guardian of the Master Emerald.\" She spoke up again trying to ease the tension and break the awkward silence for you. \"I know my home is humble, but i hope you find it accommodating while I try to figure this all out.\" You introduce yourself to her in return, giving he your name and jokingly thanking her for the hospitality. Tikal smiled playfully in return. \"I apologize for acting so hasty earlier. You see, my father leads the tribe and has forbidden humans from ever setting foot in this area. He claims they are a salvage race of cruel and greedy monsters who do nothing more than fight with each other and torture others.\" her cheerful expression seemed to fade to sadness for a moment. \"He claimed it was to keep the emerald's power from being abused. \"But when I saw you I knew you weren't a monster. Even if you weren't so small. You seem to be an intelligent creature and not the ruthless brute my father describes.\" You were flattered by these words. You also counted yourself lucky that it was this one who found you and not one of the others who would be more inclined to believe you were a dangerous monster. \"Honestly you seemed harmless, especially at that size.\" Her joking side returned as he smile reappeared. \"You're actually pretty cute like that if you don't mind me saying.\" she said with a slight blush. Her flattery was getting to you quite effectively as she returned her focus to the book. Though she did peek back at you from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the giant, tribal echidna's eyes lit up. \"Here it is! Your condition.\" You looked at the book curiously, but of course it was just the strange letters and a picture of a gem. \"The Master Emerald has a spirit within it. One that effectively makes the gem alive in a sense. It typically acts through its two guardians.\" she skims past a few more lines. \"But if this consciousness senses that it is in danger that cannot wait it often curses the individual it deems responsible for this danger. This must be what happened to you. This is why you're so small now.\" You looked back up at her. \"Is there a way to reverse this?\" Tikal placed a hand next to you while the other places some of your belongings she picked up onto the table as well. To your surprise they did not shrink with you. \"Since I am one of the emerald's guardians, I should be able to lift the curse.\" As she was about to act she paused, looking over as if she heard someone speaking to her. \"I understand.\" she said to no-one you could see. \"It seems the emerald still believes you to be a risk.\" she looked like she was thinking over this. \"Wait it talks to you?\" you weren't sure if this was crazy or not. After the shrinking you were ready to believe it. \"In a sense. It doesn't speak in words like we do. More in feelings and emotions. Still I'm confused. You don't seem to be a danger. Why would the emerald choose to curse you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal pondered about as she looked back to your regular sized belongings with fascination. She saw what she assumed was currency, some trinkets, and the camera. The odd piece of technology intrigued her. \"I found this near you. Could you tell me what it does?\" she asked curiously as she tilted it around to examine it. \"It's called a camera.\" you start to explain. Suddenly you pause. You mentally put 2 and 2 together and figured why you were in this mess. The Emeralds view you as a threat because of the risk of you exposing them. As these thoughts rattled in your head you pondered how to explain this device to the primitive giant. But before you could think of a convincing lie, Tikal accidentally pressed one of the buttons on it having the pictures of the Emerald Shrine appear. \"I see now.\" Tikal said in her content tone. \"The Emerald's curse will remain over you as long as this record exists. In order to break the curse, you will have to agree to the destruction of this device, or at least the destruction of the records inside of it.\" </span></div></div>",

Once again her expression changed, she was now frustrated by your arrogance, but soon she remembered another way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her face changed, she looked a little embarrassed but calm and thoughtful. She turned her head away from you thinking about it, you noticed this and asked with a more gentle voice \"well is there?\" After a minute or two she looked back down at you, \"are you sure you just can't destroy your material objects?\" she asked with a nervous tone. Once again you refuse and insist if there is another way that she tell it to you, she began to blush hard, \"there is another way but you probably wouldn't like it.\" You beg her to tell you, you didn't want to get rid of your photos or your treasured camera, you would give anything or pay any cost to keep them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the kind and caring echidna she was unlike the rest of her tribe, She stutters and says \"it involves you going inside me...\" an awkward silence filled the room, she slowly started to explain that her insides were purified by the emerald as it chose her to be it's guardian and that if something like this happened her innards could purify anyone who fell under this certain curse. Of course you would be able to return to your normal size and keep your possessions once you left the vicinity of the island. You both stared at each other with embarrassing expressions, you reluctantly decided to go along with it and asked where you were supposed to enter.

Once there she locked her bedroom door just to be safe and make sure you two were alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then set you down on her bed and removed her gloves along with her dress and panties.

Tikal on the other hand saw her necklace start to glow as well, \"it's working!\" Tikal said with a cheerful voice, the light was blinding to your eyes but it soon stopped. You open your eyes again and noticed nothing about you changed physically, but you felt different... You then see what appeared to be a stick poke through the cervixs' opening, \"grab on\" you heard Tikal say, you oblige and grab a hold of it and tugged to signal you were ready. Tikal began slowly removing the stick from her orifice being careful not to make you loose your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last pull she brought you out of her vagina and blushed, \"It worked!\" she said with a kind but exhausted tone. You looked back up at her and her eyes once again shrunk from embarrassment, you too begin to blush and put on a awkward smile. She smiles back and helps you wash off and put your clothes back on, then gently picks you up and raises you to her face. She looks straight into your eyes with a loving expression then proceeds to press your head up against her lips kissing you. You fall back on her palm surprised and frantically try to piece together what just happened, Tikal looks down out you and immediately retracts her and from her face. She brings up her other hand swiftly and cradles you between them; \"oh! I'm sorry! are you hurt!?!?\" you slowly look back up at her and reply with no. Relieved Tikal apologizes for her abrupt action and explains that she thought she was supposed to do that considering that's the definition of love she grew up with. You hastily tell her she wasn't wrong but then again you thought it was wrong knowing that there wasn't a bond between you and her... Was there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get lost in your own philosophy then suddenly Tikal lowers her hand to put you down on the bed and walks out of the room. You stood there trying to comprehend the events that just took place, \"is there a connection between us? why did she leave? why do I feel different than before? was this the right choice?\" Your train of thought continued to hold your attention as you desperately tried to answer each question that arose. Each attempt was met with more questions and more fruitless answers until finally something broke through the thousands of voices in your head. You heard Tikal's voice again as she re-entered the room, \"I'm sorry about my actions, my impulses were controlling my mind, but now since the ritual worked you can return to normal once we get to the boundary\". You stared up at her for awhile, your mind started to flood with even more questions then suddenly it stopped the flow of thoughts and settled on one...</span></div></div>",

You laid still, unable to move thanks to her womb's embrace as anatomic fluid began to encapsulate you. You shut your eyes both out of reflex and tiredness, you had the feeling they wouldn't open again anytime soon. As the liquid fully engulfed you, you heard Tikal's voice one last time, \"I'm sorry...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blacked out, instead of a dream, you were teleported into a black and empty limbo. It felt like an eternity before you finally were brought back to the real world, but it remained black, you couldn't see, you could only hear and feel. You felt cold at first, but then two warm and large hands grasped you and then cradled you. You then heard a familiar voice, \"welcome back. I'm sorry this had to happen, but i promise I'll never let anything bad ever happen to you again, not as long as I'm your <u>mother</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You recognized the voice, but nothing else. You couldn't remember anything besides Tikal herself, not even your own name. You tried to say her name and ask what happened, but all that came out was gibberish. This caused her to hug you tight, then begin to cry. You couldn't tell why she was crying, nothing came to your mind, except a sudden hunger. You began to fuss, telling her you were starving, to which she understood. The next thing you knew, your mouth was curled around one of her nipples and drinking her sweet and warm milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tikal began to calm down as she petted your head gently. she began to hum a tune as well, making your mind turn into mush. You could no longer formulate any thoughts, you could only feel her warmth and hear her song. Eventually the two once again forced you to fall asleep, but this time you dreamt of Yourself and Tikal living happily together as mother and son. That dream soon became reality as the two of you lived out your lives together, never again thinking of the past, except for the moment the two of you met. It was now seen as the moment that brought about your new, better, and happy lifes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again Tikal looks down at you \"i apologize for the uncomfortable experience but since we succeeded  you should be able to return to your normal size and to your home once you pass through those trees over there\" she said in a kind voice. you look back up at her for a minute gratefully, you thank her for her help and she begins to smile. You get excited for the trip back and begin walking in the direction of the trees but you stop mid-thought, you turned around and looked back at Tikal and then at your photos, you soon realised that you no longer wanted to share your discovery with the world (thanks to the purification you lost your desire to disclose the location of the emerald and the city for that matter). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Tikal once again and you suddenly felt compassion, you stood there for a few moments pondering what to do, long enough for Tikal to notice and walk towards you with curiosity. She kneeled down and asked \"what's wrong? don't you want to go home with your photos?\" you looked back up at her, just by seeing her massive eyes you knew she was confused as much as you were. she thought you probably didn't understand where to go so she repeated her previous instructions with a bit more clarity, before she could finish you motion for her to stop. You already knew where the exit was but you didn't know whether to leave or not considering this new revelation, you had no urge to leak the information you gathered from this adventure so you no longer had the will to return home so what was the point? You look back up at her again, with a loss of purpose you honestly didn't know what to do, Tikal still confused didn't know what to do either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there for what seemed like hours but then you get a crazy idea, is this because I've grown affection towards her? You stop that thought immediately as you hear a rustle come from the area behind Tikal, she spun around in response as you dove for some taller grass to hide behind. You crouched behind a single blade of grass as you waited to see what caused the noise, but your mind immediately started thinking about it again, do I really like her? I barely even know her. The rustling gets louder then finally the tension dies down as a lone squirrel came out of a bush and made it's way to Tikal, it stood upright and stared at her, Tikal knew the squirrel well she met it a couple months ago and befriended it by feeding it some of her collected food. She reached for her basket and pulled out some nuts then proceeded to to give them to the small mammal, you looked on and thought \"mabye I'm attracted to her because of her kindness\".

You were puzzled; \"where are you taking me!?\" you demanded from her as you struggled a little; \"please be quiet.\" she responded while continuing to run. You continued to ask her questions loudly while struggling to escape her hand (not angrily, just so she can hear you) but she only responded; \"be quiet!\". You ignore her and continue your inquiry, she then reacts by putting your camera and your photos in her mouth to carry them while putting one of her fingers on your face to muffle your voice and raised her other hand to hold you better while concealing you. \"I'm sorry, but you must not speak now!\" she said apologetically while continuing to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she let's part of your body go as she opens a door. She quickly but gently puts you and your findings down on a table; \"stay here and don't cause a commotion, I'll explain later\" she said briefly as she turned around and ran back outside. You immediately began to think about escaping but how were you gonna return to normal size then get out? You were to small to carry your camera and photos (the emerald only shrunk you and what you were wearing not what you were holding) plus there was nothing around the table you could use to climb down. The closest object to the table was a chair but it was to far away for you to jump to so you just sat there waiting for the girl to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting you looked around the new room you were in, as you assumed from the sight of the town earlier it all looked inferior to the modern world's technology and furnishings. Everything was made out of wood and or stone, the windows were only holes in the wall with cloth acting as blinds along with the doorways on the inside of the house. But not all of the room looked ancient, there were rugs on the floor, a wooden bookcase across the room, and from what little you could see through one of the doorways there appeared to be a bed. After a couple of minutes the girl came back and locked the door behind her as well as closing the \"technical\" window blinds. She then walked up to the table you were on and apologizes for the sudden interruption and kidnapping that occurred. Then she explains why she acted that way; \"I'm truly sorry about that but I had no other options, you see my tribe doesn't take kindly to outsiders especially humans. So I had to hide you before anyone noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her annoyed but also intrigued, you proceeded to ask her; \"why don't your people like mine, and why are you so hospitable towards me?\". She paused for awhile and asked didn't you already know, you shake your head no. She looked back towards the door and then the windows making sure no one was there, then sat in the chair beside the table and responded; \" a long time ago a few of my ancestors were discovered by your people, they were captured and experimented on. Once my grandfather discovered this he was furious with what the humans had done and took some of your kind prisoner as well. The humans soon responded by attacking any echidna tribe they came across using the prisoners as propaganda by saying we were savages and that we tortured them, but they were in actuality after the power are scriptures mentioned. they continued this onslaught until they found our tribe, we tried to make peace with them but they didn't stop there attack. The fighting got so bad that once my grandfather had fallen we offered giving there people back, but they just kept fighting. Soon we retreated back inland to the master emerald, before the humans came close to our last stronghold our shamans managed to get the emerald to help us. It lifted our island into the sky and hid it from the rest of the world, to this day no human has set foot on it until now. And if one did they would be killed as my father decreed.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned by this news, you knew about the prisoners and about the military stepping in but not about them wiping out almost every tribe. You were taught that they simply disappeared one day like Atlantis or the dinosaurs, nothing about a war or the near extinction of a species. And along with the rest of the human race you knew nothing about the master emerald and very little about the echidnas, to you and the rest of humanity these subjects became myths and legends. The only one remotely believable was that the echidnas once existed considering there were humanoid animals almost everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat there in shock questioning yourself and your past, you started feeling sadness and guilt for your own kind as well as her's. You also felt bad for yourself for falling for the same evil your ancestors fell under, Greed. You sat there motionless, too absorbed in your own guilt and shock to speak. She noticed how uncomfortable you were and quickly changed the subject; \"s-so my name is Tikal, may I ask what is your'es?\". It takes you a moment to collect yourself, then you give her your name still looking at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of silence you work up the nerve to speak again; \" so why didn't you kill me then and there or turn me in?\". Tikal then reply's; \" b-because I personally believe that not every individual in a race is evil, or at least not completely. You know, my father told me he saw a human himself once and said they were really tall, but you're quite the opposite.\" Tikal jokingly said already knowing why you were small. She continued; \" plus if you were evil the master emerald wouldn't have shrunk you, your punishment for intruding would have been more severe if so.\". Tikal than began to blush and turn her head away from you; \"plus your kind off cute at that size\", you started to blush too but refocused your attention on returning to normal. You look back up at the giant mammal and ask; \"is there a way to fix my size?\", Tikal stopped blushing and began to think, soon she stood back up and headed for her bookcase and began looking for a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she found what she was looking for and pulled out a noticeably old and tattered book, even more so than the others. On her way back to the table she started flipping through the pages, you ask her what that book was about. While continuing to flip through it she explains; \" it's a old family heirloom, handed down through generations to the chosen guardian of the emerald's shrine. It basically explains how to clean it, how to recharge it's power, how to communicate with it, how to reassemble it, how to use it's power, and most importantly in this situation reverse certain curses or effects it inflicts.\", you then say; \"it's a good thing that they didn't find that certain book\", Tikal smirked a little then continued searching the book for information. Soon you again speak; \"by the way thanks for getting my camera\", she motions for you to wait as she gets near the end of the book. Suddenly her face lit up; \"finally, here it says I have to...\", she stops near the end of her sentence and her expression changes from focused to nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her sudden change and ask what is it? She looks back down at you then back at her book, her face was now turning red. You then ask; \"what's wrong? There is a way isn't there?\", she nods yes while remaining silent. She then turns to you and says; \"there is a way but I'm warning you, there's no guarantee it'll work and I might just end up hurting you\", you consider her warning for a bit then decide to...</span></div></div>",

You ponder what area of her body you were supposed to be squished or squeezed by, as the thought progressed you started to blush again then felt arousal. You started to blush hard, as you thought of being inside certain areas of her body. But finally after some awkward conversation with Tikal you both came to an agreement, she once again picks you up and walks into her bedroom. She puts you down on her bed as she takes her gloves off; \"are you really sure about this?\", she asked for you confirmation one last time (she wasn't totally on board about this but she wasn't against it either. she honestly wanted to help you, but the curiosity she had for this ritual also helped her make the decision. And admittedly the thought of your small body being smothered by hers turned her on).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond \"yes\" wanting to get this over with but at the same time you actually wanted to do it. Tikal then took her sandals and dress off revealing both her underwear and that she wasn't wearing a bra. This made you fully aroused and you almost had a nose bleed. Tikal then explained; \"I need to be naked for this to work.\", then she removed her panties revealing her privates.

Once Tikal was ready she turned around, once she saw how excited you were her mind filled with the thought of your miniature body being in that area and she blushed hard as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then seductively asked with lust in her eyes; \"so.. are you ready? I believe you'll find doing this with an echidna is much more different than with a human ;)\" she winked at you then picked you up, she gave you a long kiss then proceeded to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't know whether to be angry that she didn't mention being in the smelliest part of her body for hours on end or to just enjoy yourself inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went with the ladder and started to pleasure yourself, Tikal noticed your squirming and feeling your body down there turned her on, though not actually knowing how to react her hormones told her to reach down to that certain area. As you were pulled deeper the smell became slightly more putrid but for some reason this just motivated you to finish your stimulation. You started to feel her body vibrate as she touched herself; \"aaaaaaahhhhhh\" she continued to moan for a while, then the vibrating stopped and you heard a loud gasp of relief from her as she came. Her moaning and gasping stopped and you only heard her breathing and heartbeat. Her intestines continued to pull you deeper until you came to a small opening but at least it lead to a bigger space, as soon as you entered the stench immediately became mush stronger beginning to make you dizzy. Tikal seemed to notice that you reached you destination and got up, she began walking and stretching to smother you as much as possible. Then you felt her body vibrate again...</span></div></div>",

She looked down and quickly noticed your presence, not knowing you were human yet she assumed you were a small animal or insect. She could already tell you were hurt (not anything bodily just a few things broken here and there) and lowered herself to see the damage while commenting; \"oh dear, are you okay?!\". You couldn't really answer the question, all you could mutter out were short grunts of pain, But thanks to your endurance as an explorer you didn't cry or start to yell. She noticed how well you hid your pain, obviously knowing you were in it, and said; \"your a tough little one aren't ya\", while giving a tiny smirk. After examining your now frail body, she notices one of your legs are broke while the other was sprang, and that also you were...

She immediately put you back down and told you in a calm but concerned voice; \"stay here and try not to make any loud noises\", she then ran off with your possessions while saying; \"I'll be back just wait here!\". After a few minutes of agonizing pain, you felt the ground vibrate once again, you instinctively wanted to run but you couldn't. Soon the vibrating revealed itself to be the massive female echidna again, she had come back with some small twigs and leafs along with some kind of brown substance (mud) without your equipment. But luckily for you, she knew the basics of her people's biology and figured yours could be similar (which it was a little). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She then knelt down to get a better look at the fracture and you yourself, she then warned you that this was gonna hurt a lot.

She then made what appeared to be a cast around your leg with the materials she brought, she then said; \"I'm sorry about this, but I have to move you\", she said as she began to move her fingers under you. The unbearable pain returned but she quickly covered your mouth again with her soft appendages to keep your scream from being heard. She then quickly moved you...</span></div></div>",

That shrunken person, you, looked off in the distance where a very adorable mouse girl...with orange fur was approaching. To be honest you weren\u2019t exactly sure what kind of animal she was supposed to be. You simply settled on calling her a mouse for the time being. Her clothes have a very \"tribal priestess\" vibe, fitting given the structures nearby which looked like cleaned up versions of what you\u2019d expect to see in old ruins. She was sitting on a log that fell fairly close to a shrine of some sort, simply resting and enjoying the peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been stuck in this place for about...eh a week now. You have no clue what did it or why it also shrunk you, assuming they were caused by the same thing. Despite the initial wave of panic, nowadays you were mostly just bored out of your mind from this extended stay. In spite of your size, this place is actually very safe and is filled with weird blue angel things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoying buggers what they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cmouse\u201d girl usually plays with them, while acting as a sort of caretaker for them as well.

As always her meaty orange soles were vast and powerful looking. Bits of dirt, sand, and leafs painted the fleshy expanse. Despite the usual distance between both of them, you could tell that they are <i>large</i>.Definitely much bigger than a human\u2019s own modest feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched, you felt a familiar feeling of arousal as her toes wiggled and stretched with the wind blowing between them. But this time was a little differant. This time you felt emboldened. As if you could take on the world. Maybe it was the general boredom of your usual time here, maybe you just felt unnaturally confidant. <i>You know...I'm going for it!'</i> that thought blasted in your mind as you finally did something you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever do. You began to trek towards the giant animal girl. Though your small stature did make the journey longer, it also help you remain undetected as you drew closer and closer to those big meaty soles, the sight of which filled you with some, rather sinful thoughts. Maybe a part of you felt bad for this girl and your intentions for her, but you figured what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her in the end. You simply moved closer, planning to get in close to those godly soles, do your \"task\", and come back here no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, it beats eating fruit all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer and closer to the mysterious giant.

The earthy and floral fragrant cause your head to swim like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face feels unbearably warm, and a burning desire to relieve himself is currently eroding your restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tikal was smiling happy, oblivious to what you are going through.

You don't remember how you got there or why you were unconscious, all you knew was that you couldn't see anything. \"Specimen has finally awoken after remaining unconscious for five hours. If the rest of the species of this dimension are like him, then we will have an easy time taking over.\" You heard a cold voice say behind you. Instinctively, you turn to face the voice only to be baffled by the strange sight. Even though the room was dark, you could still make out a horrifyingly huge figure in the darkness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was, as far as you could tell, clad in some kind of strange suit or maybe armor. Disturbingly, it glowed a pale pink light at several key points of anatomy. Its eyes in particular glowed with a sense of condescension and hostility. \"Wh-who are you!?\" You shout afraid. She didn't respond, \"Specimen is terrified of the appearance of our armor. There were likely be no need for use of terror tactics as a result.\" Against your wishes the fingers of her hands began to grasp and test your limbs, rotating them and stretching them until you groaned in pain. \"Specimen appears to retain flexibility under stress and after strain. Endurance and durability will be tested at a later date.\" You weren't certain if she was being recorded or talking to herself, but you certainly didn't want to know how she'd test your endurance and <i>durability</i> later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Specimen also appears to adjust to new size surprisingly well. Perhaps this species could be used as miniature laborers. If that is agreed upon then I will make certain to be the first to... determine the worth of their work. This particular specimen would be quite a good trial case.\" She said referring to you. You could have sworn that her calculated voice became more sheepish and excited as she worked her way through that sentence. \"I will be beginning the interrogation process now. However, considering the specimen's reduced stature, I might have to take a different approach.\" As she said these words, she removed her helmet from and revealed her face. From what you could see in the darkness, she appeared to be a salmon colored echidna with purple eyes. Gigantic purple eyes that were bearing into you with cold indifference. \"Now then small one, let's begin the interrogation. Compliance will make this whole ordeal more enjoyable for both of us.\"</span></div></div>",

As you begin to stir, you start to take notice of your surroundings. You're lying on a cold metal floor. All around you are test tubes and chemicals. This must be a lab of some sort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stand however, you notice just how large the room around you is. The room itself stretched on for miles. As you walk up to a beaker and are smaller than it, it finally hits you. You've shrunk. And this was no floor, it was a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were processing your thoughts, you hear the sound of a door opening. You turn around to the source of the sound and see a young, blond-haired girl walk in. She scans the room a bit before her eyes lock on you. She walks right up to where you are standing. Even with the table elevating you, you still don't even go past her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little guy. My name's Maria. What's yours?\" She spoke with such softness to her voice. You want to answer her question, but despite straining your mind, you can't remember.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been several days since you had woken up in a huge new world. You don't remember how you'd gotten here, you just knew that you did not like it. It was a jungle, it was hot, and everything was gigantic! It wasn't just the trees that towered over you, even the blades of grass in front of you were able to obscure your vision. You weren't sure if everything was big or if you just somehow got small but either way, your situation was bad. You had been able to scavenge food and water, but you had spent every single night out in the open. You'd gone to sleep every night afraid that something would take you away in the night, but you never had a choice and always stayed safe... somehow. But the nights had always been uncomfortable and today you were looking for shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been wandering about for a few hours when you finally found something... terrifying. More accurately you stumbled into your best chance at finding shelter and the most terrifying thing you'd seen yet. The boot print would've probably been big to you at normal size, but now it was like a medium crater. All of the crushed grass and rubble made it clear, whatever had made that print would crush you with no effort. Although terrifying, this was still good news for you. If something this big was stalking the area, that probably meant that it had a home somewhere. You knew it was a risk, but decided it would be worth it to look for whatever shelter that thing had. To that end, you followed the trail of boot prints, continually unnerved by the devastation they left in their wake. You found the remains of an insect in one of them and suddenly felt a lot more pleased about how well he'd done in this new place all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the trail for hours, you found what you were looking for. The prints had lead you straight to a hole in the ground, one that seemed to lead pretty deep below the earth. The tracks you had been following stopped in front of the burrow and immediately circled around back the way you came. You assumed the tracks had belonged to a local of the area, one who had tracked down whatever animal owned this burrow and killed it. You decided that if you ever found the person that did this, you'd try to speak to them and thank them for this gift. Part of your mind doubted that the whole situation was as safe as you thought, but the rest of your mind scolded that as ridiculous. No animals wore boots, and even if the owner of the burrow was still alive, it had likely been chased away by the person that could tear the earth apart simply by walking. Without hesitation you made your way down into the burrow, eager to look into your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour findings were almost as strange as the new world you were in. You hadn't expected to find much, but instead you found a surprisingly big space. There was a bed in one corner of the room and the other corners were filled with large piles of junk and scrap. It almost seemed like the area was being inhabited by something sentient rather than the instinct-driven animals that usually lived in them. As that thought makes its way through your head, you begin to feel something. At first it felt like a very subtle tremor, very weak but completely noticeable. A strange gust of wind followed this, a hot wind that was rhythmic and not very pleasant smelling. Unable to ignore it you turn around and immediately regret your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching in front of you was some strange anthropomorphic creature and you had a hunch that it was female judging by the sound of its breathing, which explains the hot air you had been feeling. She had orange fur that was tied up as long thick hair on the back of her head, kept in two locks with auburn strings. There were two brown stripes across each of her eyes and she had bushy round ears that reach the end of her hair. Her peach muzzle and small black nose were uncomfortably close to you, threatening to consume  you in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile her blue eyes were locked onto you and you could see her bushy tail stuck up in the air behind her. Further behind her you saw what you dreaded most; two boots, one with a fur trim and the other with some metal bands on it. She WAS the one who left the tracks to the burrow! She had figured out you were following her and had circled around behind you without you noticing. And now you were in her sights and she...</span></div></div>",

You continued to stare into her eyes unable to look away, the animosity you could see within them filled you with even more dread. You continued to stare at her without moving, until she finally spoke with a high and energetic voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeya little fella, what brings ya around here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You became even more shocked realising this thing could speak, but soon your panic started to drift away as this revelation sunk in. You almost immediately responded with what little you knew about your current situation, and why you came inside what you now presumed was her burrow. She seemed to understand your words and gestures, but still remained silent and motionless throughout your explanation. The whole time, this animal person seemed to be giving you an odd stare. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite tell if it was good, bad, or simple uncertainty from her, but it was still unnerving regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after you finished your explanation the massive orange creature picked you up. Her grip was a bit rougher than you would have liked, but at least it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard enough to break anything. She soon deposited you onto a crudely made table. Before you could ask her what was going on she ran off without saying a word. The strange giant darted across the massive room over to a pile a metallic junk and started to sift through it. Still being in a state of confusion and slight fear, you stared at her as she started picking up small chunks of metal with both curiosity and apprehension, not knowing what she was going to do with you or those pieces of dense rock. After awhile you lost interest and started to look around the den, besides the things you already saw on your way in, there really wasn't anything intriguing about it. It was mostly just dirt as you suspected, the only other noticeable feature was another hole seeming to lead deeper down into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after you discovered the hole, you felt the familiar tremor of her boots hitting the floor coming in your direction once again. Before you could turn back enough to face her, you heard a loud metallic thud echo from all around you that was immediately followed by a small vibration. You soon realised you were trapped within a crudely made metal cage, if you could even call it that. You then finally heard the giant speak again;</span></div></div>",

But before long, she reappeared in front of you so quick, it almost looked like she teleported.

She obviously had a very active lifestyle and clearly didn\u2019t spend a lot of time washing or replacing her clothes. You swear you couldn\u2019t see an inch of the boot that wasn\u2019t coated in a layer of dirt or mud. Sticks stamped her foot down inches from you. She didn\u2019t want to kill you (yet), just give you a good scare before moving on to the main event. \u201cW-Wait. I\u2019m not actually with the government. I just said tha-\u201c Sticks suddenly grabbed you tightly, squeezing the air out of you and silencing you rather effectively. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re with the government, the robot uprising, the post office, the Girl Scouts, or one of the 5 boy bands the Illuminati use to broadcast mind control sound frequencies. You and whoever you\u2019re affiliated will learn not to mess with Sticks the Badger.\u201d She held you over the discarded boot as she glanced back at your terrified face. \u201cAssuming you survive long enough to relay this message to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never so terrified in your life. Her tight grip prevented any struggles from you. In retrospect, it was an extremely stupid idea to lie to the giant, paranoid conspiracy theorist that you were a government spy. You soon hit the insole of the boot with a hard landing. You could finally breathe again, but the air you were provided with was foul and tainted by the boot\u2019s odor. Looking up you saw her bare foot lowering. Time seemed to slow as you watched this descent. You weren\u2019t sure if it was perception or if Sticks was intentionally doing this slowly to taunt you. Finally her toes entered and quickly ran you down like a bulldozer. You soon found yourself trapped under the... admittedly fairly soft, sole of the giantess as she stood up, putting a tremendous amount of weight and pressure on you. Outside, Sticks was ecstatic. She wasn\u2019t sure what this tiny guy was with, but it had to be something bad. Who else sends in tiny people? No matter, she found him, and she plans to use him to send a message to whoever might be spying on her. On top of that, it felt amazing to finally put these people in their place. It certainly helped that you felt great to her underneath her foot. She gave a few squeezes with her toes as she cracked a small grin. Inside, you were in a living hell. You wanted to pass out from this so you could have SOME sort of escape from your torture, but your fate wasn\u2019t so lucky. You didn\u2019t know how much more of this you could take</span></div></div>",

You could still smell a powerful remainder of her last couple gas attacks from earlier, starting to punch and kick her hand. Sally only grinned at your motions and shoved you headfirst back in her anus. The stench was even worse than you remembered as it was trapped inside like you were. You tried to squirm free, do anything to get out, but you only managed to do what Sally expected of you in the first place, thrash and grind against her insides and bring her unthinkably amounts of pleasure.

Sally got up and started walking, defeated, you just laid there hoping this was the end. All of a sudden you felt a cold liquid strike you from above, (sally was washing you off) once the flow of liquid stopped you felt her paw raise you up again. You felt warm kiss, you opened your eyes and saw sally staring right back at you with a caring expression. You soon realised she was in love with you, still processing this unthinkable notion you feel her rub her cheek against your cold body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      After what happened you didn't know how to feel, granted she just used you as a anal dildo but at the same time you felt a weird connection with her. Before you could delve deeper into this thought she set you down beside the sink and said \"wait here\" as she left the bathroom. You thought about running but even if you wanted to your body is to weak right now and the fall from the sink would probably kill you.

She wrapped the cloth around your tiny body and brought you back to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After some time to recuperate you begin to talk with sally, at first with a angry tone and harsh look, then slowly lower you voice down explaining your situation.

Initially you think of declining still not being able to forget what happened, but realising how easy it was for her to capture and control you, you probably wouldn't stand a chance outside, So you reluctantly accept her proposal. Over the next few days you grew more attached to sally and more forgiving of her blunder, in fact it developed into a fetish. Eventually you also fell in love with her and became her mate, tails did figure out a solution and you jumped at the opportunity to return to normal size.

Then finally the wombs walls retracted briefly giving you time to breathe before another wave of her reproductive cells slammed into you. Sadly, it wasn't powerful enough to actually help you get out, and instead of most of it rushing past you like last time your body blocked the small opening preventing the liquid from escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her moan loudly once again from climaxing, once everything went silent you laid there in her juices hearing her every heartbeat and breath, fearing for your well being you try to figure a way out.

They weren't constricting you but simply moving and brushing past your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you saw the cervix's opening move, a stick poked through and you heard a voice; \"grab it\".

Eventually you once again saw the light of the outside world, once you're completely out of her vagina you let go of the stick and drop onto the bed exhausted.

How did you even get here?, you don't recall walking down a path that led into a giant forest; the only thing you did remember was a flash of blinding light then blacking out. You started to walk in hopes of finding out what happened or at least a way out of all this green terrain surrounding you.

You couldn't muster the nerve to run, so instead you slowly craned your head upwards to see what had stepped in front of you. As your eyes ran up its leg you saw that it switched color between grey and complete black often.

Before the mechanical being took another step, a loud clang sounded as you saw another metallic foot dig itself into the robot's chest knocking down. Immediately afterwards the robot exploded, sending pieces of metal flying in all directions, one bit almost hitting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the initial shock, you once again saw a tall metal leg right in front of you.

Soon enough you saw its head, it appeared to be some kind of female rabbit with emerald eyes and a blonde variation of fur on top of her head. You then saw her lift a metal arm appearing to be hers and speak into it with a thick southern accent; ' Sally, I just naturalized the last swatbot, any else you need me to do? '.

You heard nothing but silence, no mutter or speech from her, just an odd quiet and the feeling of her eyes staring you up and down. This was unnerving to say the least, the feeling of her eyes piercing your soul wasn't helping the situation at all. The urge to just jump out of her hand and take your chances grew ever stronger until the half robot looking stranger finally spoke. she started by asking if you were okay, and normally you would've answered, but you still weren't a hundred percent sure of her intentions. So you just remained still and silent instead of responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next thing you heard her out of her mouth were words of comfort, mainly relating to the fact that that other robot couldn't hurt you now. Still this gained no answer from you, you weren't worried about that machine but about what she could do to you considering what she did to it. And also considering that that other robot looked like some kind of soldier, this only strengthened your fear of her. How where you supposed to respond? Even if she seemed docile now that could quickly change if you said something wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was another awkward and somewhat terrifying moment of quiet before she broke it again by introducing herself then asking for your name in return. Yet you still remained silent, as if waiting for something besides a greeting as an invite to talk. She once again attempted to get you to open up by explaining that she meant you no harm and just wanted to know if you were okay or not. She even went as far as to say she was willing to help you anyway she could if there was something askew. Though part of you was begging for her help the other was still doubtful. The question arose; why would she want to help you? Did she have some motive that you haven't discovered yet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though you came up with multiple reasons why she might want to help you even without a reward, your doubts and suspicions still remained.

But unfortunately you progress was hindered more then once. First you rather clumsily alerted robotnik's forces to your plan. secondly, before you even made a yard past the border your accomplices were caught. The last one bought you time in a bid that at least one would escape, warn others nearby, and hopefully come back with reinforcements. But sadly that time cost dearly, the last you saw of him was a large metal gate locking as he fought stubbornly against an onslaught of various badniks. The doors finally sealed, but were followed by a blood curdling scream soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if that wasn't enough, you already had about five or six machines chasing you already. The fact that you were shrunk down to only a few inches did help initially, but now the robots were practically on your tail, that is, if you had one. After all that, luck finally seemed to be on your size, turns out those badniks aren't that good at hide and seek. By the time the sun fell and rose up on a new day you were finally near the next settlement, you could even see silhouettes in the distance. As you got closer it appeared to be a defense of some kind, they must've heard the explosions from yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you were about to walk up to the guards a familiar engine roar echoed from behind you. \"Crap!\" you scorned yourself, \" I should've know they wouldn't of given up the chase that easily\". Your running soon turned into full on sprinting as you hurried to reach the apparent checkpoint. The ground beneath you started to vibrate, the sound became increasingly louder, and a large shadow began to roll over you. You were about to either be captured or killed before you heard footsteps coming from the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you got a second chance to observe the situation you heard the footsteps abruptly stop for a few seconds before you heard a loud clang then explosion come from behind you. You didn't really know what just happened, but you had no desire to stick around and find out. You continued your mad dash for safety, but were suddenly stopped by a something warm, furry, and soft suddenly catching you and pulling you back. The fur covered your entire body and face, leaving only your ears to interpret what was happening. A few more sudden swings, clangs, and explosions later the fluff surrounding your head finally released it. You took in a large sigh of relief being able to breath normally again, but the moment of calmness was short lived as you were face to face with an angry looking mobian, possibly a lemur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You quickly regained your guard and remained still. Despite this lemur most likely being an ally considering the good relations your town kept with it's, you didn't want to provoke it's aggression towards you, your both strangers to each other after all. You silently gazed up at it's face hoping the enraged expression you saw wasn't supposed to be towards you. Luckily it wasn't, it rather quickly calmed down and turned into one of general concern. The two of you stared at each other for a few minutes which lead you to the discovery that she was a girl, and she appeared to understand that you weren't an enemy or spy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You also took notice on how she looked, she had light and dark grey striped fur along with a yellow top. The rest of her torso was covered in a black suit with two orange stripes on either side lengthwise running down her black pants and ending at her shoes. Her hands had short yellow bandages leading up to a black glove with an orange guard and holes for her fingers. This observation lead to another realization, both of her hands were free. Oddly enough she wasn't holding you with them but instead her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Are you done sight seeing yet? \" She playfully remarked. You hastily snapped out of your quiet awe and awkwardly responded yes. \" Good, now then, lets get you somewhere safe \". You were about to tell her you needed to see her village's leader, but were interrupted by a loud manly voice addressing your current possessor. Before you could make second attempt at communication she swiftly covered your head with the rest of her tail again and stood still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You heard the gruff sounding man speak again; \" what the hell do you think you're doing?! \". To which she responded; \" just having some fun while doing your job for ya \". You swear you heard the man growl before he replied \" You stupid kid! Those were real badniks! You could've gotten hurt! \". She then rather smugly said; \" well i'm not, and no thanks to you and you slow men. Well I'll see you slow pokes later! \", she said as she ran off, you heard in the distance \" you damn vigilante! \", as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon your head was released from her tail's grip again and brought up to level with her purple eyes. She smiled widely, like a kid with a new toy. You immediately told her you needed to see her village's leader, but it seemed like that information went in one ear and out the other with her. She responded without seeming to take in your input; \" now lets fix you up my little...</span></div></div>",

And with that she turned her back to you. She appear looking for her house or something? But you notice her bare leg peeking out of her petal like skirt. They were surprisely long and curvy compared to what you would expect from her. And her emerald colored flats are being played with her light green tinted foot. You begin to get closer to it. You notice the alien's feet is very much like a human\u2019s. It's was significantly longer, wider, and thicker than a human's feet, but the size difference wasn't that <i>crazy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got even closer to heel part of the flat. You look back at Cosmo, she still hasn't noticed what you're doing. \"One sniff wouldn't hurt...\" You slowly thought as you started to sniff the heel part of the shoe. Your head recoiled back once you smelt the complex and <u><i>strong</i></u> scent. It is a perfect blend of a primal earthness and fruitiness, and the prutid funk of sour cheesy vingear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your blushing head, and look up.. only to see the seemingly unaware seedrian's frim and perky bottom that's well hidden because of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being a creepy prev!\" You mentally chided yourself as you quickly look in other direction. But unknown to you, Cosmo has been aware of the human...\"looking\" at her the whole time. She had a small smile. Maybe she can some fun,but then again... it's not nice to mess with people like <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the Seedrian do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You still can't believe the situation you were in, convinced that it was all a dream. You had woken up this morning, very clearly not inside of your bed. You appeared to be inside some sort of museum that housed a lot of valuable minerals. That alone would have been strange enough, but there was also the fact that you were now ridiculously tiny as well! Even the smallest minerals in the museum were massive boulders to you! Fortunately no one had been in the museum when you first woke up, otherwise you probably never would have woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the weirdness of the situation didn't end there. Taking advantage of the emptiness, you started looking around the museum for some of the staff. It was hard to tell at your size, but the place didn't seem that big. You reasoned that it was a small museum. Which was fine for you, that means you had less ground to cover. As you wandered around though, it was clear that no one was out in the main area. You even stumbled upon the main entrance and tried to squeeze under it to no avail. Even your miniscule size wasn't enough to get under its extra tiny gap. Hanging on the handle, you saw a sign that said open on it. Since the open side was facing you inside the museum, you figured the closed side was facing the outside. Which meant the museum was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the lack of people.\" You mumble to yourself as you turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the museum was closed, you decided to keep looking for help. Surely there had to be someone in the museum who could help you. A security guard or the owner had to be in here. You didn't know how long the museum would be closed and you wanted any kind of help ASAP. Knowing that the common area would be devoid of people, you start looking for side doors. After a while of searching you eventually found a door that said curator on it. Fortunately, this door had a big enough gap for you to squeeze under. The thing you saw when you got on the other side was the weirdest thing yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room there was someone sitting at a desk. But that someone wasn't a human! It was some kind of gigantic colorful insect! One that was wearing clothes! At first you swore that you had gone crazy, but no matter what you did you still saw a giant beetle sitting at a desk! Something about her looked vaguely familiar, but you didn't understand what that was until you thought a bit. Eventually it hit you that she looked just like a character from Sonic the Hedgehog! So apparently you were shrunk, trapped in a different dimension, and your only help was from a character you didn't recognize. You guessed that she was from the comics, but you had never kept up with those so you didn't know who she was. You could tell that she was a female beetle at least but that was it. No matter how strange it was, you had decided to approach the giant beetle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were at the foot of her desk, right by her feet as she worked. You still don't want to believe your situation but you had no choice at this point. In your new spot you finally noticed some details about your potential savior. She was definitely a beetle, well a Sonic beetle, but a beetle none the less. She seemed to have  primarily light blue skin. Her exoskeleton was an even lighter blue with pink, yellow, green, and blue highlights that gave it a rainbow like shimmer. Honestly her exoskeleton looked like it could be one of the minerals in her museum. Her two antennae were light blue like her skin and strangely cute with their small size; still bigger than you unfortunately. Even though they were just barely showing right now, the interior of her wings seemed to be cream colored. Finally, she had pink eyes and a white muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed how you would expect a professional person would, but it seemed strange on her beetle form. She was wearing a pink jacket with a matching pink miniskirt that didn't go past her knees. She was sitting at her desk now though, so it might go further down when she was standing. On her hands she wore white gloves with navy cufflinks, probably for when she handled any files or sensitive materials. Of course all sonic characters wore gloves anyways so it figured she had them. To your surprise, she had some navy stockings on and pink heels that matched her dress. Her heels were currently discarded a few inches away from you, leaving her feet free to hang above you. It was weird to see a Sonic character without their shoes on. Apparently they just had normal, somewhat cartoony, feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetles foot hung above you precariously. You don't know if it was the stress of the situation or something else but her feet seemed odd to you. Their movements felt like they were taunting you. The scrunching of her toes, the way she flexed her soles, or whenever she scratched one foot with the other, it felt like a taunt. You were smaller than the foot of a bug girl and they could come down and crush you at any time. The movements of her feet seemed to purposefully emphasize that. Shaking those thoughts out of your head you back up to make some space, and end up near her discarded heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind you, you see that you are at the entrance of one of her heels. Looking inside you could see that the heels were somewhat worn but still a little fresh. If you wanted to, you could go inside and rest. The beetle seemed plenty busy, so you could probably get a quick rest before she leaves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you shake your head. \"What's gotten into me? I must be really tired.\" You groan as you get ready to make your next move. Taking a deep breath you decide to...</span></div></div>",
