But when there's no missions, no one around to talk too, (Or who want to talk to you) and nothing to do, then you get bored. Naruto walked along the streets of the Hidden Leaf Village, kicking a small pebble and wondering what to do. Sasuke always went places on his own, and Sakura constantly tried to follow him, leaving Naruto alone as usual. He gave the pebble a particularly hard kick and it skidded off under a fence. Naruto almost walked past the fence with out giving it a second thought. But by chance, he glanced through a rather large hole and saw a scroll. It was laying on a pedastal in an overgrown vacant lot. Tangles of weeds and thorny plants wound around the fence and surrounding stone walls. Curious, Naruto made sure no one was watching him, then vaulted over the fence. He crept through the flora and grabbed the scroll. He slipped it into a hidden pocket inside his jacket and jumped back over the fence. He ran all the way back to his house. He kicked off his sandals and jumped onto his bed. He pulled out the scroll and tossed it lightly, from hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's inside this thing?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took hold of edge of the scroll and tugged it out. Naruto was lying on his back as he did this, so when he opened the scroll an avalanche of green dust suddenly fell onto his face. He gasped in shock and sucked down most of the strange dust. He coughed and nearly choked quickly running to the sink. He turned the faucet on full blast and stuck his mouth to the stream, drinking until his throat was cleared. He gasped and tried to catch his breath. He glared at the scroll and folded it back up. Then he tossed it into the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless thing.\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out the window and saw the sun was setting. He changed into his pajamas and fixed his nightcap on his head. Maybe there'd be a mission tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

Naruto looked blearily at his clock and saw it was about nine o' clock. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, trying to clear the sleep from them. He reached up to grab his nightcap and found nothing but his hair. He looked around and saw it lying on the ground next to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I guess it fell off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat never happened before...oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged it off and threw back his covers. His hopes were high that Kakashi would have a new mission for him and his cell. He quickly stripped out of his pajamas and put on his usual orange jumpsuit. He pulled up his pants and was surprised to see so much of his legs showing. Usually his lower legs were exposed to some degree, but now his pants were hugging tightly around his calves. And his jacket wasn't fitting very well either. He pulled it down as far as it would go, but a thin strip of his skin still showed. The sleeves were also shorter, reaching only halfway down his arms. He scratched his back, feeling the tightness around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I must be getting my growth spurt!\" He said, giving himself a thumbs up in the mirror. \"Finally, I'll be taller then that jerk Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled at this thought and eagerly ran outside.</span></div></div>",

He hummed to himself as he strolled down the street, heading for the Hokage's building, hoping to find Kakashi and the rest of his cell there with a new mission. He was deep in thought (Well, as deep as Naruto can get anyway) and he didn't even notice someone sneaking up behind him. But he wasn't very discreet, and Naruto soon heard his breathing, his heavy footsteps, and when he stopped walking, the footsteps behind him kept going for a few seconds, then stopped. Naruto groaned inwardly knowing that Konohamaru was following him. The kid never left him alone! He turned around to confront him and Konohamaru tried to disguise himself...but it wasn't very convincing. Naruto slapped his hand across his eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Konohamaru! I know you're following me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru sheepishly lowered his fence disguise and said, \"Aw come on! Wasn't it more convincing this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head and Konohamaru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I guess I'll practice more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are your friends Konohamaru?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...They were supposed to meet me at the bridge, but they never showed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...That's too bad...Well see ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started walking again, but Konohamaru tagged along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to see if Kakashi came back with a mission yet. I'm so bored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might as well forget about it. No one's come in all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!?!? How do you know?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandfather is the Hokage! How could I not know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point...Argh!!!\" Naruto rustled his hair in frustration. \"Now what am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why don't you play with me!\" Konohamaru said excitedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto groaned as he looked down at the eager little boy. Konohamaru wasn't a bad kid by any stretch of the imagination but he could get annoying whenever he was begging for attention. It didn't happen as often as it used to since he started hanging out with his friends but whenever they weren't around the first person Konohamarau sought out was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess we can play. But just for a little bit!\" Naruto said, firm in his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thanks Naruto!\" Konohamaru grabbed Naruto's hand and dragged him off to the training field. \"I wanna play Hide and Seek! That's always a lot of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? For who?\" Naruto muttered. Not only was Konohamaru usually ridiculously easy to find (his camouflage skills left a lot to be desired) but whenever Naruto had to hide he could end up sitting in his hiding place for nearly hours, Konohamaru unable to find him. One notable game had ended after Naruto had been waiting for two hours. He had tracked Konohamaru down only to discover that the boy had given up an hour ago and had promptly forgot all about the game. Naruto had given him a few lumps for that one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Konohamaru said once they arrived. \"Rock Paper Scissors to decide who seeks first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Get ready to lose Konohamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys pumped their fists up and down three times before throwing out a symbol. Naruto cheered when his rock smashed through Konohamaru's scissors. \"Told ya so! I'm going to hide, and you're going to seek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Konohamaru covered his eyes and began to count loudly. Naruto had already come to a decision about how to handle this. He was going to hide someplace easy to hide and then, when it was Konohamaru's turn, he was going to bolt and try and find something else to do. Thinking fast, he spotted a box not too far off. Chuckling somewhat evilly, he hid underneath it. About a minute passed before Naruto heard Konohamaru shout. \"Ready or not here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could hear Konohamaru's feet shuffling through the dust as he looked around. Naruto was already beginning to regret hiding underneath the box. He knew it would be cramped, but this was cramped even more than it should have been! He could swear his back hadn't been pressing up against the top of it when he had first hidden! It didn't help that it was getting incredibly hot inside it, his clothes starting to feel uncomfortable on his body. He was so busy shifting around he barely noticed when Konohamaru lifted up the box in triumph. \"Hah! Oh man Naruto, even for you this was a pretty dumb idea for a hiding place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Like you can hide any better!\" Naruto retorted, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boss!\" Konohamaru said with a frown. \"I could totally see you hiding under there! Your butt and your feet were totally visible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No way! This box totally covers me!\" Naruto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru shook his head and said, \"Nope! It's too small!\" He pressed it back down over Naruto and said, \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down and saw that the kid was right. He could see his feet poking up from under the box. \"Huh...that's really weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and tossed the box aside. Konohamaru snickered and said, \"Uh, Naruto? Do you always wear clothes that are too small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto looked over his body and his eyes widened in surprise. It was true! His clothes DID look small on him! His pants were pulled up around his calves, the bottom of his shirt rising up to show off his belly button, the sleeves pinched tight around his arms. \"What the heck is going on here?!\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto!\u201d  Konohamaru whined, eying Naruto suspiciously, \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at Konohamaru, confused. \u201cHeh? What the heck\u2019re you talking about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me!\u201d Konohamaru then started walking away, turning his head slightly after a few steps, and yelled, \u201cStart Counting! You said you\u2019d play!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghhh\u2026 there is NO damn way that I\u2019m gonna waste my day doing this\u2026 \u201d Naruto moaned, not wanting to continue playing, though, he had moaned also slightly because of his tight clothes. What was going on? Konohamaru had seemed\u2026a little smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s chest was starting to push his zipper down quite a bit, revealing the upper part of his usually covered black undershirt, which felt as if it was straining itself against his well defined, upper body. Naruto sighed as he looked down, patting his developing abs with his somewhat larger hands, the bottom row of them slightly visible along with his belly button. His sleeves looked a bit ridiculous, almost riding up to his thicker triceps, the seams looking as if they were beginning to split. His pants were fairing no better, hugging his larger, more developed thighs uncomfortably, to the point of where if he were to sit, they would probably rip. Naruto\u2019s eyes trailed upward from there, and he suddenly blushed, realizing how outlined his massive, unknowingly larger junk was! He knew he was well endowed\u2026 but not freaking horse hung! The young fox ninja avoided thinking about it, and then looked down at his big feet quizzically, a little confused as he noticed how much of his ankles were no longer covered by his pants. He wiggled his larger, stronger looking toes, which were now almost completely hanging over the edge of his relatively large sandals, noticing how unbelievably tight they were for some reason. He moaned in a childish fashion, realizing his feet looked as if they were bigger than just this morning! Too big... the straps were literally cutting into the skin at the top of his feet; they looked as if they\u2019d burst at any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh man! Seriously\u2026 I just bought these sandals last week!\u201d Naruto whined, stomping his right, sandaled foot into the ground in a childish way, not noticing the ball of his foot push outward, slightly beginning to hang over the edge of his sandal. \u201cAnd these clothes too\u2026 why\u2019re they too small?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Naruto, thinking of the most logical explanation (Well, in HIS opinion anyways) to explain his unbelievably tight clothes, pumped his fists into the air, smiling as he continued to do so. As he did though, without realizing it, he had partially ripped the back of his jacket, his lats pulsing uncontrollably; and, thanks to his strong, growing ass, a small rip had appeared at the back of his pants, showing off his white boxers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe! I must be having my growth spurt!\u201d Naruto cheered, \u201cJust you watch Sasuke! I\u2019ll show you which one of us is stronger now! Believe it!\u201d Naruto yelled, not really caring who, are what, had heard him. He sighed\u2026 realizing, in his excitement, that he was still stuck with Konohamaru. The big and still slowly growing blonde looked left, then right, smirking as he found no sign of Konohamaru. The kid was probably trying too hard to hide from Naruto, so, he could probably use this opportunity to bolt from the scene. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m outta here\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered to himself, sprinting away as he hoped to arrive back at the village quickly. But wow; his now slightly muscular legs were really taking him there quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto ran, he was suddenly distracted by a loud SNAPPPP, followed by another, and then, he literally face planted into the grass. A small bump slowly appeared on his head as he sat back up, about to look at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that!?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flexing his toes slightly in annoyance, Naruto picked up the scraps and looked them over. \"Jeez! Either these things are a complete piece of crap or this growth spurt is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got to his feet, wincing slightly at how tight his clothes had become. It was starting to become impossible to consider all of this as being a simple act of puberty. Naruto wasn't the sharpest kunai in the arsenal, however, so it was taking him awhile to reach that conclusion. He scratched his head, loosening his headband slightly, only now realizing that it was cutting into his skin. He scratched at his chest, his black undershirt tearing as he did so. \"Grrr! This is getting really annoying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unzipped his jacket and threw it angrily to the ground, followed by his black undershirt. That done he was able to take a deeper breath, his chest inflating impressively as he did so. Unfortunately, his pants were still digging into his waist, making the relieved breath shorter than he had hoped for. He was about to rip his pants off when he realized that would mean walking around in his underwear or, worse yet, accidentally damaging both pants and underwear and walking around totally naked! That was definitely not an option!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll just have to deal with it!\" Naruto decided, running back in the direction of the village. The once short teen was now considerably taller, his height closing in on the average adult's height! With no frame of reference around, however, Naruto was only vaguely aware of his impressive and still increasing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto made his way back to the village proper, Konohamaru was doing his best to find a hiding place that would fool Naruto. He was starting to get nervous, expecting Naruto to appear at any second and grab him! After checking the door to the warehouse and finding it locked, the energetic boy decided to just hide in a crate sitting outside. It was better than nothing! He moved the top of it to the side, jumping inside without looking, pulling the cover back over the top once he was fully concealed. Thankfully, there was a knothole around Konohamaru's eye sight that he could peer out of. Naruto wouldn't be able to sneak up on him this time! Getting comfortable, he leaned back and closed his eyes, ready to wait as long as necessary for Naruto to either find him, or give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, he had stirred up some familiar looking green dust, the emerald particles getting sucked up into his body with every breath. There was already a fine dusting of it covering the boy from head to toe, gently glowing before disappearing into his body. There was more to this warehouse than met the eye. Something very strange was going on in the Village Hidden in the Leaves!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Konohamaru smirked, his eyes still closed as he continued to lean against a side of the small crate. \"Hehehe... Naruto'll never find me...\" He whispered to himself, moving his back upwards against the crate as he felt the sole of his sandals touch the other side. He barely pondered the reason for this, and continued to relax, eagerly waiting for Naruto to give up. \"Any second now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's excitement slowly turned to discomfort, his clothes for some reason feeling a bit tight. A bead of sweat fell from his forehead, the inside of the crate feeling really hot all of a sudden. The young ninja suddenly found his scarf becoming unbearably tight, the sudden heat his body was experiencing making it even worse. Konohamaru tugged on his scarf, slowly but surely pulling it off of his neck; he then sighed in relief, being able to breathe better. He held his scarf in his unknowingly larger hand, and wondered why, all of a sudden, it would be so tight... He may have been seeing things, but he swore that his scarf actually looked like it was a bit too small for him. And now that he thought about it... EVERYTHING he was wearing felt tight! Really tight! It was then when Konohamaru sat up straight and felt his head push the lid of the crate up a few inches. He could see outside! Luckily Naruto was nowhere to be found, so this gave Konohamaru time to ponder what was going on. He took off his goggles, the strap ripping slightly without him noticing, and threw them, along with the scarf, outside of the crate as he also pushed the lid off and threw it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young, bewildered ninja looked over himself, and, everything else around him. \u201cUGH! This isn\u2019t right! I KNOW I had no problem fitting in this thing earlier!\u201d Konohamaru crossed his arms, one of his eyes slightly twitching. He was reaaally annoyed at this point. \u201cI swear! For some damn reason, everything just looks... smaller than before...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru scratched his back, the tightness of his t-shirt really annoying him at this point. He didn\u2019t even notice that it looked comically small on him, when, it was usually a little oversized. His shorts were doing no better; the ends well past his knees at this point, and hugging his thighs really tightly. Konohamaru winced as he realized he was bending his legs a lot in the crate, and as he looked up, his eyes lit up with shock as he noticed his whole head was poking out of the now small hiding place! Even his boxers were being strained quite a bit; faint tearing noises audible as Konohamaru\u2019s visibly growing bulge popped the zipper on his shorts open. His growing body was giving him no time to focus on one thing at a time, though, as he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his feet, heard a loud stretching sound; and, right after, an even louder RRRIIIIPPPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t GET IT!\u201d He muttered to himself, \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s goin\u2019 on!?\u201d Konohamaru was right to have no idea what to think when he looked down at his sandals; the straps had literally BURST off his feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru wiggled his larger, squished toes in utter confusion and realized... all he could actually see of his sandals were the straps... on a hunch, he lifted his right foot and realized that his huge, bare feet were covering both his sandals entirely! He lifted both his feet up, picking up the ruined, flattened foot wear and out of curiosity; put one of his sandals against one of his larger appendages. Konohamaru\u2019s eyes went wide as he stared at his foot; not only was it WAY to wide for the small sandal in his hand, but also, the ball of his foot and his toes were completely passing the end of the sandal!  Were his feet that big?! His sandals had fit perfectly that exact same morning... And everything was in proportion, like usual! Plus, there was still the issue of his clothes, which were nearly suffocating him; they didn\u2019t fit either! Konohamaru, now having forgotten about the hide and seek game, was now completely distracted by what was happening to him; or his body, anyways. After attempting to stretch his upper body, which, as if he saw it coming, caused the top part of the front and back of his shirt to rip almost half way down his torso, he KNEW what was happening\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI couldn\u2019t be... No WAY!\u201d The young ninja smiled; this was crazy. But AWESOME! \u201cI\u2019m getting... Bigg \u2013 WOOAAAH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Konohamaru, finally partially aware of what was going on, felt a weird, strong tingling sensation suddenly move through his body, from head to toe, as he quickly surged up a few more inches. At this point, Konohamaru had gotten way too big for the crate, and he finally let his longer, thicker legs push forward. The soles of his bigger, bare feet pushed over the part of the crate he was facing, and he also took his arms out and put them along the top edges, which ended up falling over with the rest of the pieces of the crate anyways. As the tingling faded away, his quick growth spurt did too\u2026 though; he was still undoubtingly growing. Konohamaru finally decided to get up, slowing adjusting his footing as he did so because he wasn\u2019t used to his new size AT ALL. I the process, though, his t-shirt completely shredded off, the remains falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ninja couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWOW!

Konohamaru wasn\u2019t sure... but he could swear that his bicep seemed a bit thicker, too. He also had to be at least as tall as Naruto! Well, the usual Naruto, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A thought suddenly occurred to Konohamaru as he examined his much bigger body. He was as big as Naruto! A mischievous grin slowly stretched across his face as he imagined how shocked Naruto would be when he saw they were eye to eye (although Naruto was still about the same size he usually was in comparison to Konohamaru thanks to his own growth spurt). \"I'll make him sorry he ever ignored me or tried to brush me off!\" He said with a snicker, rushing towards the door of the warehouse. Of course, thanks to his new size, he clumsily ran his shoulder into one of the many crates within, knocking it to the ground. The old wood shattered on impact, releasing a cloud of dust into the air. Konohamaru coughed and waved his hand, not noticing as he sucked in more of the growth dust, speeding his growth rate up past Naruto's though the effects wouldn't become apparent until later. However, the majority of the dust merely gathered into the air like dust motes, swirling in the wake of Konohamaru's body as he ran out of the warehouse and back towards the village. The glittering trail followed Konohamaru until he reached the village gates, the shining particles flying fully in the face of another young shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch where you're kicking up dust kid!\" Kiba shouted, coughing as he got a face full of what he thought was dirt. Konohamaru ignored Kiba as he continued running in pursuit of Naruto, eager to show off. The dog ninja sighed and shook his head, his hands in the pockets of his hooded sweatshirt. \"Man, kids these days. No respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and continued out of the village gates, heading to the training area to work out some frustration. He had gotten into an argument with Shino and he was eager to beat on some wooden dummies in place of his teammate. Slowly, unnoticed by him, his body was beginning to grow, stretching taller and wider with every foot step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru growled in frustration as his search for Naruto continued to be fruitless. He was so focused he didn't even notice the stares he was getting as he ran around in only a pair of boxers which were becoming increasingly tight on him as his body slowly continued its growth. \"Where could he be?\" He asked himself, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\" A Chunin slowly approached Konohamaru, being as cautious as if he was dealing with an escaped mental patient. \"You do realize you're walking around in your underwear don't you honorable grandson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Konohamaru snapped, glaring up at the Chunin. The older man actually took a step back, slightly intimidated by the look in the young ninja's eyes. It didn't help that his body had added on some muscle making him look like a pint sized powerhouse. He put his hands on his hips and said, \"Yeah, I'm only in my underwear. What are you going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chunin gulped a little. He had never really been that brave. He was more of a behind the scenes strategist type. He squared his shoulders and said, \"You can't be running around like this. It's indecent. I'm going to have to escort you back to your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try!\" Konohamaru shouted, getting into a fighting stance. All through this conversation Konohamaru has slowly been growing, his once small biceps now far more respectable, already bigger than this pencil pushing Chunin even though he still only came up to his stomach, this his head was slowly but surely inching upward. His pecs were full and round, pushing out over a slowly deepening six pack abs. His thighs were filling up the pants legs of his boxers, tearing further the already ripped boxers. His calves followed suit, pumping up and making his legs look even thicker. His feet widened and lengthened, his toes inching across the ground. Even his bulge was becoming more impressive, pushing out against the straining button while his backside pushed out against the back. Crouching down as he was, he looked even more intimidating to the Chunin. He gulped again and took a step back. \"Uh...never mind....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and ran off, leaving a grinning Konohamaru behind. \"Yeah, that's what I thought!\" A strange feeling was welling up inside Konohamaru. He felt so...powerful. He had never felt quite like this before. He was used to be a little kid, one that no one really took seriously. Now...things were different! The young and still growing boy continued his search for Naruto, feeling more spirited now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto snickered as his longer, slightly more muscular legs took him through the forest much faster than usual, his body ever so slowly swelling larger with every thunderous step. The oversized fox ninja continued running, his big bare feet leaving large, shallow imprints in the ground, his powerful soles and toes crushing every branch under them. Naruto couldn\u2019t feel a thing though, his muscular feet being too tough to be scratched or injured by such miniscule things.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHeh!\u201d Naruto happily grunted, his lush, blonde hair brushing a few tree branches. \u201cThis growth spurt\u2019s just too cool! A little sudden though\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, what Naruto thought wasn\u2019t even close to the actual fact. Besides being slightly taller than Kakashi at this point, he was unknowingly still getting bigger! He wasn\u2019t that worried at the moment, only thinking he was a few inches taller\u2026 but, he was a LOT bigger than he imagined! How big would he, or could he possibly get? Luckily, the green dust was working through his system very slowly\u2026 at the moment, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto made it to the front gate leading into the village, he couldn\u2019t help but tug at his remaining clothing. \u201cUgh\u2026 Stupid shorts! \u2013 wait\u2026 I mean pants! Aw man\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s pants were becoming unbearably tight, slight rips and small tears visible everywhere; one of the more noticeable ones being down the back of his pants, part of his boxers completely revealed. The young, big blonde blushed as he trailed upwards to his staggering manhood, his bulge pushing against his boxers and pants to the point of it looking like someone had stuffed an overgrown cucumber in them. His thighs and calves were showing a bit more muscle definition than usual, while Naruto also realized that\u2026 he had\u2026 a six pack?! A wide smile spread across Naruto\u2019s face as he felt his abs for the first time with his hands, surprised. They weren\u2019t fully developed, but either way, he had abs! And even his pecs seemed thicker than usual! Not to mention his biceps\u2026 not huge, but nice and round, the usual small bumps replaced with more full, thick looking biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue admiring himself - though, he was still slightly dumbfounded, Naruto realized that his weird growth spurt was actually becoming quite a pain\u2026 he had simply taken one step with his gargantuan foot, and the rip at the back of his pants spread and extended downwards with a loud TEARRRRR!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Damn it!\u201d Naruto yelled, covering his exposed, muscular ass with his large hands. His boxers were stretched to the point of his skin being barely visible through the strained seams. \u201cI gotta get something to wear! NOW! Being bigger\u2019s cool and all\u2026 but I don\u2019t wanna end up NAKED!\u201d Naruto muttered loudly to himself, blushing hard once again. \u201cCraaap! Cuz of this damn growth spurt, I\u2019m gonna need A LOT of new clothes\u2026 And Sandals! And another headband\u2026\u201d Naruto pulled out his frog wallet with one of his hands, sweat-dropping. \u201cThere goes all my money\u2026 Ugghhhh! Guess I can\u2019t get any lunch\u2026\u201d Naruto whined, his stomach rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto sprinted through the front gate, his hands once again covering up his large tear as he made his way through the village to the clothing store; his growing feet sending small, almost noticeable tremors throughout the streets. Naruto had to be at least a few inches past the six foot mark\u2026      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm going to look for the rest of my squad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Konohamaru ran off in search of his friends. Naruto reached into his pockets and searched for some money. He pulled out a few coins and was exstatic to find he had enough for a bowl at the Ramen Stand! He cheered and ran off towards the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he got there, he slammed the money down on the counter and said, \"Give me the biggest bowl you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk counted the amount of money Naruto had and opened the register. He put the money inside and slammed it closed before shouting Naruto's order to the cook in the back. Naruto sat on the stool, leaning forward slightly, his foot tapping impatiently on the bottom rung of the stool. His jacket was riding up in the back, exposing his lower back. Naruto didn't care. He was too hungry to concentrate on anything besides the smell of the ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the clerk set the bowl on the counter in front of him, Naruto was practically drooling. He broke open his chopsticks and quickly began to eat. Broth and bits of noodles splashed over the counter as Naruto messily devoured the ramen. The clerk watched him in disgust. In a matter of minutes the ramen was gone. Naruto slammed the bowl down and sighed contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ramen Guy!\" Naruto called as he ran off to find something to do.</span></div></div>",

He started by doing some stretches first, to get limbered up. After that, he began to run through the exercises Kakashi had shown him and his squad as training. Naruto was at it for hours, skipping lunch and continuing through dinner, hour after hour, almost with no breaks. Naruto had never felt such energy before! By the time the sun was setting, he was sweaty, dirty, and tired, but he had never felt better! He wiped the sweat from his gleaming forehead and jogged back to the village. He quickly made it back to his house, entered, and locked the door behind him. He proceeded from there to the bathroom, to get himself cleaned up before getting something to eat and going to bed. He didn't take long in the shower. He washed the sweat away, swept over his body with the soap and shampooed his hair before turning the water off and drying off. With only the towel on, he heated up some ramen and quickly ate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned loudly as he tossed the towel back into the bathroom and crawled into bed, too tired to put his pajamas on. He was asleep within minutes, a trickle of drool running from the side of his mouth.</span></div></div>",

Usually after training all day, he felt sore the next day, not wanting to get out of bed. But today he felt great! Totally re-energized! He threw off his covers and grabbed another set of his trademark orange jumpsuit. Before he pulled it on, he looked at himself in the mirror. He was a little surprised at what he saw. He had always been a physically fit young man, but he'd never had much muscle development. Now, however, he was clearly starting to show muscle! His chest was more defined, and the beginning of a six pack was already starting to form! He flexed his arm and grinned at the size of his bicep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Look at that! I always knew I'd grow eventually!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flexed in front of the mirror a little while longer, before pulling on his jumpsuit. Of course, accompanying his new growth was a significant change in clothing. He struggled pulling his pants up, the bottom of which was hugging his lower thighs. They were starting to turn into shorts! And his jacket was no better off! He pulled it down as much as he could, but his belly was much more exposed. His shirt fell just below his belly button, the lower half of the Fox Demon tattoo clearly visible. He bent down to put his sandals on and heard a tearing sound. He quickly stood back up and turned around, looking into the mirror. He groaned as he saw a huge tear, splitting down the back of the jacket. He took it off put his sandals on. His toes were hanging over the edge totally now and the straps were a little tight, but he'd live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better buy some new clothes. No one should mind if I go shirtless...\"</span></div></div>",

He was also quite a spectacle due to the fact he was shirtless, showing off his new physique, and his \"pants\" hugged tight around his lower body, showcasing himself to the village. It didn't take long to get to the clothes store and Naruto quickly began to look around for something he could wear. This store was known for having any kind of clothes you were looking for. No matter what your style, this store usually had it in stock. It didn't take Naruto long to find a rack full of his own trademark jumpsuits. He rifled through them and was slightly annoyed at them. They were all too small. Being the only ninja who actually wore an orange jumpsuit, the store had it only in his original size. He was about to give up when he saw another orange jumpsuit hanging from the wall. This one was a much larger size. Naruto grabbed it and tried it on. It was baggy, but he wasn't worried about that. At the rate he was growing he would fill it out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paid for his purchase and looked around. He was thinking about heading to the assignment building to see if Kakashi had yet returned but decided against it. Kakashi would probably send for him when he returned. Whenever that might be. So Naruto sat down on a nearby bench, propped his head up on his hand and tried to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People probably would've just stared at me anyway!\" He muttered to himself, heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hoping he wouldn't run into Sakura again. He appreciated her concern but he knew if he ran into her again, she would hound him until he went to the hospital. And he felt fine! Better than fine! In fact, he'd never felt better! So there was no way he could be sick! With this in mind, Naruto unlocked his house and went in, locking the door behind him. Naruto laid down on his bed and stared at the ceiling. It had been a pretty boring week so far. Sakura had come back, but Sasuke could be gone for weeks on his own, sometimes not even showing up for missions! And Kakashi had been gone a long time too. But that wasn't anyting to be surprised at. Who knows? They could both be gone doing something together. That had happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided not to worry about it anymore. They'd get back when they got back. He quickly made himself up a bowl of instant ramen and ate that. It was a good lunch, but he still had some time in the day left.</span></div></div>",

Sasuke was sitting on the ground, tired and exhausted after Naruto easily beat him in all fields of Ninja training. Chakra control, speed, traps, Ninjutsu, Genjutsu, and more. And Sakura was in his arms. They were both kissing tenderly as she snuggled into his big chest. To him this was the paradise he always wanted. \"Ahh...Sakura. Your so cute in my arms!\" He drooled in his sleep as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Sakura hadn't gotten over how great Naruto had looked. Sure he was bigger than a kid his age should be, but watching such a big, strong body at work was something Sakura couldn't get over. Sure she like Sasuke.

Nothing. The looks he got on the street probably prompted him to close the curtains. Drat! She moved to the door and tested the doorknob. Locked. Double drat! She checked the back door and the windows. All locked. Dammit, this was getting frustrating! Enough was enough! She pulled out a hairpin and began picking the lock. As a ninja, she had no trouble silently picking the lock. The door quietly swung open. She got inside as quickly as she could and closed the door behind her. She looked over and saw Naruto asleep on his bed. He looked even bigger! She especially noted his bulked up muscles. All thoughts of Sasuke were, at least momentarily, removed from her mind as she saw this perfect specimen of a man in front of her. She walked over to the side of the bed and watched him as he slept, his massive chest rising and falling with every breath. He was blushing. She wondered what he was dreaming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he shifted in his sleep! Sakura quickly stepped back and looked around for a hiding spot. She didn't want Naruto finding her in his home without knocking. He'd start to think things about her! She quickly dived into the closet, hiding herself up on the shelves, her body just fitting in the tight quarters. She was in darkness as the closet afforded no light. She heard the bed creak in protest as Naruto got up. She heard his huge feet hit the floor with a thump and the bed creaked again as he stood up. She heard a loud \"Ouch!\" as Naruto hit his head on the nine foot ceiling. She then heard excited movement as Naruto admired himself, as best he could, in his mirror. Then she heard the door open and close as Naruto went back out. She breathed a sigh of relief and jumped out of the closet. That was close! But she didn't really feel like she had enough time to watch. Naruto was probably going to train now. She badly wanted to see that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly exited his house and followed him at a safe distance.</span></div></div>",

Even though Naruto's ninja abilities have enhanced, he was still clueless when it came to being spied on. His tight clothes could hardly hide his powerful body. \"Heh he! I can't wait to start training! At this rate I may even get Sakura to pay attention to me!\" Naruto smirked as everyone who saw him stared in wonder and awe of his size and muscles. To them he must be a Teen-aged Giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura followed him quietly, seeing all the people that seemed to drop what they were doing and watch him move. She had been following him on the roof tops, and was thankful that Naruto was as clueless as can be. 'I'm surprised that no one is following him like I am.' Sakura thought as she watched them continue with their daily lives. And of course Naruto did the same. He went to the Ramen shop and bought over fifty-seven bowls of Ramen! She didn't even think Naruto had a stomach big enough to fit that much! 'His new body must need a lot of nutrients' She thought as she followed him through town as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And of course he went back to the clothing store to find himself clothes. However, unlike the last few times Naruto found out that it would take a week to prepare clothes for his growing body. They were planning to make 10 through Twenty five feet clothes since he had come through the last three days for over several different sized clothes. 'I would agree with them. At this rate he'll actually grow into a giant! And only Choji's clan is known to do that! And that's using jutsu and chakra! He'll be a permanent giant!' Sakura thought as he left disappointed. And the thought of him becoming bigger was more enthralling than ever to her! Quickly she followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon Naruto arrived at his training spot. He was planning to train so he could grow even more! \"And once I get big and strong enough, they'll have no choice but to make me the first twelve year old Hokage!\" Naruto laughed as he flexed a bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Oh please!' Sakura thought as Naruto went back to the 'I am going to be Hokage speech' again. 'But they could always use a man like Naruto as leader.' Sakura thought as she watched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quickly Naruto began to train. Brining out a dozen Kunai knives he through them as each marker with 100% percent accuracy. And as he through more and more, he increased his speed. Allowing him to slice through the ones already on the marker. He did that over twenty times, the beads of sweat showing on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then, Naruto began to practice his chakra control. He tried staying upside down on a tree over an hour, tossing Kunai into the markers as he flexed. Then, he decided to do something new. With his new found Chakra accuracy he used it to float above a lake. Allowing him to 'Walk on Water' thanks to chakra control. And he finally finished with a \"Shadow Clone Jutsu!\" and transformed himself into one hundred Clones. All of them began to fight and punch each other until they were too tired to punch, kick, headslam, pound, and more.</span></div></div>",

She figured Naruto would be back here in the morning to train some more. He was determined to make himself as strong as possible to become the Hokage. Sakura smiled. Naruto may be single minded, but he was passionate. She locked her door behind her before heading up to her room and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto was just finishing up his dinner at the Shikiraku Ramen Stand. It cost him a fortune due to the amount of ramen he ate, but the owners gave him a discount, no doubt intimidated by his immense size. Naruto was starting to get used to his size and wasn't worried about the looks he got anymore. One day, the entire village would have its eyes on Naruto and acknowledge him as the next Hokage! But in order for that to happen, Naruto needed to become stronger. Not being very interested in it, Naruto had quickly forgotten about the dust that had fallen out of the scroll he had swiped. All of it had been sucked into him when it fell on his face and the scroll itself had long since been disposed of. No one would ever know why Naruto was growing like he was and Naruto didn't care how he was growing as long as he kept on growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed through his front door and flopped down on his bed. Instantly the mattress groaned loudly and the frame broke, dumping the mattress on the ground. This didn't bother Naruto much. He just shifted his large body around and fell asleep. His arms and his legs were long since hanging off the mattress. And in the night, Naruto continued growing...</span></div></div>",

'I just love this new look for him! Forget him growing big! I want him to grow as big as a mountain!' Sakura thought as she started to move out of the tree, wishing to show Naruto that she was in love with him.

Curious, she jumped into the tree tops and silently made her way to whatever was causing the ruckus. She came to the edge of a clearing and nearly fell out of the trees at what she saw. It was Rock Lee. But not the Lee she knew. He was huge! Like Naruto...no, just a little shorter by a few feet. She goggled at not only his height but his enormous musclulature. He was wearing a green vest that reached halfway down his torso as well as a pair of green shorts. Obviously the only thing that would fit him...His arms were stil wrapped up in bandages but he wasn't wearing his headband around his waist like he usually did. It was far too small. Sakura couldn't see it anywhere on him, but it was probably small enough to wear as a wristband to him. Maybe even a ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura discreetly pinched herself. A flash of pain erupted in the spot. No, she was indeed awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it that every guy who's ever liked me is growing like this?\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee wasn't paying attention to her.

'He IS stronger than Naruto.' Sakura thought as she saw how easy it was for him to do that. Then, with a big huff she spoke \"Hey Rock! I like how your training!\" As soon as her voice reached his ears, Rock Lee had completly did a tornado like twist. His body crashed into the ground as he looked up at the sight of Sakura. 'He's nearly as bad as Naruto when it comes to surprises.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Sakura! How do you like the new me!?\" Lee asked pridefully as he got on his feet before Sakura could even blink. \"I've been training! I even beat Neji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, I see you had some results.\" Sakura told him \"And you even beat Neji! What did he do when he lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He ran home like a baby! I never saw him like that before!\" Lee said as he sat down indian style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? He doesn't seem the type-I mean never mind that!\" Sakura shouted, causing him to topple over. \"I need to know, when did this happen? The same thing happend to  Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lee got up shocked as he heard those words. \"So Narutos a giant too?\" He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yup, hes even bigger than you. I'd say about three feet.\" Sakura told him. \"But seriously, what happend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I was training one day and this strange dust came out of nowhere. It pressed itself against my face and when all of it was going to cover me it left and I heard a voice saying 'I must find him. The one I first touched' Then it vanished.\" Lee told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see. So that explains some things about whats changing  you two. But that leaves even more questions.\" Sakura thought aloud. Looking at Lee, she smiled. \"Is it alright if I watch you train? Me and Naruto got into a fight about how stupid he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure! Anything for the beautiful Goddess of the Hidden Leaf!\" Lee told her as he got up, returning to punching and kicking the dummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura blushed as she heard him call her a 'Goddess'.

Sudden thumps, the ground shivering slightly, trees rustling, a slight splitting sound heard from far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is that?\" Naruto wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge splitting sound rent the air and Naruto heard Sakura scream! Instantly he was running towards the sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee had split another dummy. Sakura had yelled out in delight, clapping at this impressive feat. Lee blushed as he heard Sakura cheering, moving on to the next dummy. It was like a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that dream was about to be shattered into a nightmare! Naruto crashed onto the scene, looking around wildly for the source of Sakura's troubles. Sakura jumped back, nearly getting bowled over by Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! What are you doing?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at Sakura and said, \"I heard you scream!

Leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked you to leave her alone! You should respect her wishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up and was shocked by what he saw!

She'd never imagined boys would fight over here! Then again, she probably never would've cared unless Sasuke was fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who to cheer for!\" She thought, looking from one titan to the other.</span></div></div>",

Getting as close as he could to two of the clones, Lee unleashed a powerful set of kicks and punches on the both of them. \"Hiyaah!\" Lee said as he slammed a fist right into clone ones face and a kick between the others leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bastard!\" Squealed the one that fell over from the pain between his legs, the other was knocked out cold as the two of them vanished into a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thats when of them grabbed Lees arms from behind. \"Gotcha!

That's when he felt what hit his stomach hit his face. The clones were tossing big boulders that exploded on impact, causing the small microscopic precious gems cut him. \"Lotus tornado!\" Lee said as he got on all fours, heading for all of the clones as a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly each of the clones put their hands together as a giant ball shaped tornado appeared in each of their hands. \"Rasengan!\" All of them said as their attacks collided, covering the place in a massive dust storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Who won?'

He didn't look as big as Naruto so she figured Rock Lee had won! Then the smoke cleared a little more and she saw she was mistaken. There were two other bodies on the ground around this other figure. Sakura looked to the left of the standing figure and saw Naruto facedown on the ground, looking exhausted. She then looked to the right and saw Lee on the ground just as exhausted. Finally her eyes traveled to whoever it was that had just appeared. Her jaw dropped as she saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SASUKE?!?!?\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had enough time to think, \"What the hell is going on?\" before she fainted dead away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, blowing through the village, an innocent looking cloud of dust moved across the sky. One could almost hear a discontented sigh coming from the cloud. If you looked hard enough you could even see what appeared to be a misty figure in the center of the dust. And if you listened beyond the wail of the wind, you could even hear a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you? The one I first touched...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure remembered fondly the first time she had touched the small figure of that ninja boy. Then she had been bundled up and tossed away like nothing. And so she had searched looking for him. She had thought she had found him wearing green, but she had been mistaken. And then again, she thought she had him, wearing blue. But once again she was mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" She whispered, floating through the sky above the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the clearing, Lee and Naruto were just waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my head!\" Naruto complained. The last thing he remembered was the collision between his Rasengan and Lee's Lotus. So who had won?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood shakily up and looked around. He saw Lee bent over an unconcious Sakura. But there was someone else with him. Someone that looked very familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SASUKE?!?!?\" He yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sasuke and Lee turned to him. It looked like he had interupted one of them, but he didn't care!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the heck are you doing here?!?\" he yelled out, pointing an accusing finger at him. \"You leave for all this time and then just come back, looking like that?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was about the same size, height wise, as Lee, but not nearly as muscular. Thanks to his leaner build he was able to wear a bigger version of his usual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not interupt Naruto!\" Lee said. \"Sasuke was about to tell me something very important!\"</span></div></div>",

I heard there are only nine0tailed demons.\" Naruto told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, it appears that she vanished thousands of years ago. Unlike other tailed demons, she has this power that affects others  but not herself. In a sense, it turns one into a giant over a certain amount of time. She was sealed because of this power and her soul exists as dust, making any male that touches her bigger.\" Sasuke explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But then why is she looking for Naruto?\" Lee asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think its a bond she made when she touched him. She not only makes him bigger but also wants to greatly turn him into a bigger giant. It just so happens shes blind as a pile of dust and can't tell who we are utnil she touches us.\" Sasuke told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay...so what should we do so this will stop?\" Naruto asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She'll only stop when she finds you Naruto. That means she'll turn half the males in Leaf village into giants if she has too.\" Sasuke explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't want there to be more giants!

In fact, it was Shikimaru who was laying down inside his house, eyes shut, tuning the world out. It wasn't often anymore that he got to sit down and relax, what with all the missions his cell had to go through, and this was sure to be the only time he'd get peace and quiet since Ino was gone searching for Sasuke. That girl did not know when to shut the hell up! All day it was Sasuke this, and Sasuke that, blah blah blah on and on with no end! Just thinking about her babbling high pitched voice made Shikimaru shudder. It was also nice to get away form Choji's constant smacking, slurping, and crunching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking these things, Shikimaru didn't notice Angelmaru floating in. Her voice lightly whispered, \"Where are you...my one, my bond...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikimaru failed to hear this and sighed, breathing in deeply. He instantly choked and sneezed as the dust surrounded him. He thought he heard a young woman sobbing before the dust blew out his window. He looked around, slightly dazed from being violently brought back to earth from his thoughts. He scratched at his shirt, feeling uncomfortable. He shrugged and laid back on his cushion, thinking about nothing in particular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Angelmaru eddied in the wind around the village, passing several women out doing their shopping. She paid no mind to them and quickly floated up past. Almost by chance, she felt another male prescense. What passed for her heart now leapt and she quickly blew over to whoever it was. In the back of her mind she couldn't help but think this was going to be a dissapointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed she was right. The prescense she had felt was Choji who was reclinging under a tree and eating like always. He was focused on his snack, his back turned to the dust floating towards him. Shikimaru had expressed a need to be alone for awhile, so Choji was waiting it out under the tree before heading over to Shikimaru's house. He brushed absently at his clothes as some dust, probably from the road (yeah right...) covered him. He heard the wind sighing (or is it...) as the dust blew away into the sky. He coughed a little and rearranged himself under the tree before going back to eating.</span></div></div>",

Nothing better than a highly nutritional meal!\" Choji said as he looked into the empty bags of potato chips. Nothing remained inside the bags. Choji had made sure to eat every speck. He didn't even leave a crumb for a Mouse to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now I better go check and see how Shikamaru's doing. He always goes to sleep when no ones around.\" Choji said as he got up. However, he didn't notice the changes that had changed his body. His once large stomach appeared to be smaller. His arms and legs seemed to be shaped by biceps instead of fat. And his cheeks lost a little fat. He even stood at least four inches taller. But his baggy clothes easily fit his growing body.  The boy quickly ran off towards Shikamarus house. He was completly oblivious to everything happening to him as he ran off to Shikamarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His leg muscles carried him easily as he ran. His body moving swiftly and agile like a cat. \"Wow! I need to eat those chips more often if they make me feel this great!\" Choji said as he quickly arrived at Shikamarus. And it only took him half the time it usually did. Arriving at his friends home, he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shikamaru meanwhile was sleeping peacefully. He didn't notice the transformation that was changing his body. His clothes became tighter as his body began to grow. His shirt became tighter as he grew bigger. His biceps and pecs bulging as his shirt began to rip in spots. With each breath his body grew larger and larger. The sides of his shorts began to rip on the sides. His powerful leg muscles revealed as they began to strain his clothes. His socks had stretched on his feet to the point that his toes had ripped through the socks. He smiled pleasantly as he felt his body reach from one side of the 6'5 couch to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He grunted as he heard a sound at the door. \"Great, just great.\" Shikamaru said as he stood up. He rubbed his eyes, still drowzy from his lack of sleep. \"And I was dreaming I had married a non-nagging, not pretty/not ugly girl, and not dumb or smart girl.\" He didn't notice how small everything was as he walked over to the door. Opening it, he grouched and said \"Who is...WHA!?\" Shikamaru said as he saw a skinnier, yet muscular Choji standing  before him. His friend stood a few inches shorter than him. But he could tell it was him. After all, who else in the world has whirlpool shaped symbols on their cheeks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Shikamaru! Your so big!\" Choji said as he butted through, looking around as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What happend to you? And what do you mean?\" Shikamaru said as he looked at him and then himself. \"Whoa! I don't believe it!\" Shikamaru said as he flexed a bicep. \"Is this really me? What happend to us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know. But I do know one thing: And thats that i'm hungry!\" He said as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'That's Choji. Thinking with his stomach first and his head later.' Shikamaru thought as he tried to find a answer for what changed them. Whatever it was, he'd most likely let it slip by and snooze at the perfect chance to know. After all, simply cause he's bigger doesn't mean hes going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Sasuke could finish, Sakura groaned and slowly woke up. She sat up and rubbed her head. What a dream she had! So many giant versions of people she knew! It was...real? Sakura looked on the three giants who were looking down at her. She nearly fainted again at seeing all three of them. But she kept her cool this time and said, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fainted.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that. But what's the deal with you? Why are you a giant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly told Sakura an abreviated version of Angelmaru, the no tailed demon, and her need to bond with Naruto, her blindness, and that she took the form of a mysterious dust.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Each of them headed out towards a different part of village. As Sakura checked her part of the village, she couldn't help but think back to all three of those big hunks. 'Were this not so shocking, I'd probably be all over the three of them.' Sakura thought as she checked the village. That's when she saw Iruka and Kakashi talking. Problem was, they were at least ten feet tall. \"Just how many people will that dust affect!?\" Sakura said aloud. That's when the two of them turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both were wearing overstretched clothes that could hardly hide their bulging muscles. Both their pants were a bit torn on each side. Their biceps bulged with muscle. Even their chests were covered by too short shirts. You could see their abs all the way from where Sakura was. Everyone around them simply walked away and stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sakura?\" Iruka asked as they looked in her direction. \"Whad do you mean 'How many people will that dust affect?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh boy!\" Sakura thought aloud as she jumped from where she was at. Now she was standing with her Sensei and her former teacher, her face was blushing. \"So you heard me?\" Sakura asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes we did. From what we gathered our natural senses seem to have been enhanced as well.\" Kakashi told her. \"Now explain:What did you mean in that statement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So Sakura explained to the two of them what was going on. Both stood with sweatdropped remarks as they heard her talking about Giant Naruto, Giant Lee, and Sasuke and fighting and stupid remarks by Naruto. \"I see. So we were affected by this dust?\" Iruka asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, so will you head back with me to our meeting spot? Were trying to find people shes affected.\" Sakura told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure. I don't get exactly whats going on. So I better hear what Sasuke has to say about this.\" Kakashi told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nodding, the three of them headed back towards the edge of Leaf Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile, with Naruto---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto jumped from house to house. Each landing was so powerful that the roofs cracked underneath his immensly powerful muscles. And as soon as he jumped from those spots, the spot collapsed. Naruto chuckled at his work and said \"It's great being big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Naruto moved through the village, he caught in his eye Shino and Kiba. Both of whom stood at least twelve feet tall. Naruto Groaned as he saw that even Kiba's dog Akamaru was larger than his original size. \"Just Great!\" Naruto said as he jumped towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a startled shock, both Kiba and Shino stared up at Naruto. Their muscles bulging in their clothes, their leg pants ripping at the sides. Shino's shirt no longer covered half his face. And Kiba took off his favorite coat, having tossed it since it would tear with his growth. \"So whatever's going on affected you too. Like some kind of Swarm of Locusts that continue to multiply.\" Shino stated, unable to keep his bug puns out of his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This earned him a punch in the head from Kiba. \"Just shut up with the bug puns for once!\" Kiba said as he looked at Naruto. \"So it happend to you too though didn't it?\" Kiba asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. It's really weird and I don't understand exactly whats going on. But me, Rock Lee, and Sasuke are big just like you. If you want to find out more I suggest you follow me back to our meeting spot! After all, its impossible to resist a guy this big!\" Naruto smirked as he flexed his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, yeah. Your all that.\" Kiba groaned as Naruto left, not even bothering to wait for an answer. \"Damn him! C'mon Shino!\" Kiba said as he jumped off after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shino shrugged and said \"Like a fly buzzing after its meal.\" And jumped off after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Lee's time---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lee had found nothing! No one in the village seemed to have been affected that he could find. This was so stupid! He could be back there, impressing the beautiful maiden of Leaf Village but no! \"There's no one affected around here.\" Lee said as he decided to go back to the meeting spot. And so he left, not realizing that Angelmaru had flown by a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She cried sadly and said \"Where are you? The one I first touched?\" And continued on her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile with Sasuke----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sasuke could hear the sounds of people as they talked all throughout his section of leaf Village. After all, with these new bodies came new senses. He could probably hear a pin drop a mile away. He listend in, wanting to hear anyway say something like \"I'm bigger!\" Or \"Wow your huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing yet.\" Sasuke said as he stared across the village from a roof. That's when he heard it. It was a voice saying \"No matter how much I eat I keep getting bigger and more muscular!?\" That's was all it took for Sasuke to leap off towards the home where that sound came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He arrived in front of Shikamarus home. Wanting to be courteous, he knocked on the door. \"Coming.\" Said a grouchy voice that mumbled \"Man, can't anyone let me rest today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the door opened, Sasuke looked in and saw a seven foot Choji. And at the door was at least a 7'5 Shikamaru. Looking up at Sasuke, Shikamaru rubbed his eyes and said \"So something changed you as well?\" Shikamaru asked as he let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. But thats not the point. You two are growing because of a demon known as 'Angelmaru'\" And so he told them about the demon, the dust, and how Naruto was fifteen feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So why'd you come over here. If you haven't noticed I was busy being lazy and Choji is eating me out of house and home.\" Shikamaru told him. It was true that Choji was eating him out of house and home. Empty bags of chips, no pop, milk, or any liquids, the ketcup, mustard, pickles, chicken, fruits, and everything else was gone. All that food was being used to fuel Choji's growing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you come after me I promise to get you all the food you want.\" Sasuke told them. Choji's ears raised as he heard those words. Looking up, he smiled and shouted \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And you can see who else has been changed.\" At that note, Shikmaru stood up and said \"Okay then. I'm in. After all, I want to see just how many people are in the giants club.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Giants club?\" Sasuke asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, well what else are you gonna call it? The freakishly huge teenager club?\" Shikamaru asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, the name you thought sounds much better.\" Sasuke as he turned and left. Followed by Choji and Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Half an hour passed and everyone gathered in the biggest clearing in the forest. There were many different sizes all around, though Naruto, being the first, was the biggest. The newcomers were shocked to see all the different giants the village had. Shino, Kiba, Sasuke, and Lee were the second largest group at twelve feet. Kakashi and Iruka were the third, and Shikimaru and Choji were fourth smallest. Yet Shikimaur and Choji were still growing, so no one knew how big they'd end up. Kakashi sweatdropped at the size of some of the boys and said, \"For the first time in the last few days, I actually feel small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka laughed a little and agreed. Sasuke suddenly yelled out, \"Alright everyone! Sit down and I'll explain everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat down and waited to see what Sasuke had to say. He stood in front of the group and said, \"Alright. First, I'm going to explain what we're up against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran through Angelmaru's story and what her plans were. Then he began to outline an interesting new theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Angelmaru is blind she focuses on the chakra of a male person and bonds with them, giving them size and strength, while taking a small portion of their chakra into her own. This way, she can remember who she's already touched and compare it to any new chakra she gets. That means no one here, except Naruto being the original, will be affected by Angelmaru again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Yes!\" Naruto jumped up, happy that he would be much, much bigger than anyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else just sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, at the rate Angelmaru is absorbing chakra she'll soon be strong enough to travel outside the village. There are only two ways to stop her from leaving. The first way is to block her path ourselves. This plan is risky, because anyone she accidently touches will grow more. Through all of my research I couldn't find out if this process of growing was reversible or not. The second way is to find out where Angelmaru came from and send her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where she came from.\" Naruto said. \"I found the dust in a scroll in some run down backyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew what he was talking about. It seemed no such place existed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she was sealed in the scroll and Naruto broke the seal.\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll have to try and seal her in the scroll again.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not be so easy.\" Kakashi said. \"Angelmaru is a demon and it takes considerable stamina and chakra control to seal a demon. The one who does it is likely to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there someway we just kill it?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demons are too powerful to kill outright. We'd probably have no chance.\" Iruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they were once more at an impass. </span></div></div>",

She had touched several people and yet none of them are the one she first touched. Her sadness continued to swell. Even though her power and ability to see was growing, she was unable to cope with the fact she could not find him. \"I have looked everywhere for the one I first touched, yet I am unable to find him? Where are you?\" She said as she flew towards the forest that Naruto and the group were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---In the forest---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of the giant Ninja and Sakura were thinking of how to deal with Angelmaru. Sure they were all massive and hundreds of times more powerful: But can they do anything to stop a pile of dust that makes you grow bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do we have anything that can tell us how to destroy her? Like that scroll for instance?\" Sakura asked them, breaking each of their lines of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah! That may be able to stop her if we have that scroll!\" Kiba stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what did  you do with it Naruto?\" Iruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lemme see.\" Naruto thought back to what he did with the scroll.  Now that he remembered back, he could recall that after the dust he had seen words appear. They words appeared upon the scroll only to vanish seconds later as the scroll disentegrated. \"Now that I think about it..\" Naruto told them of what had first happend. He had found the scroll, opened it, got covered in dust, and a group of words appeared as it disentegrated. \"Now I remember!\" Naruto said triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whad do you remember?\" Sasuke asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That it said 'Only the merging of first and Demon shall end it.'\" Naruto told them. All of them groaned at this(Except Sakura. She was already purring about the thought of a bigger Naruto).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So that means the only way to stop her is to let her merge with Naruto and make him bigger!\" Sasuke said angrily, this would not great for him if Naruto lorded over himm like some kind of god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when she appeared from behind a group of trees. Looking at them, Angelmaru smiled as she spotted Naruto's chakra. \"You are the one I first touched.\" She said happily.</span></div></div>",

The rest of her features were obscured as the dust approached Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've searched everywhere for you, my first, my bond.\" She rose from the ground and her invisible lips met with Naruto's. Naruto's body began to glow with a blue chakra energy as all the pieces of Angelmaru's chakra were being absorbed into his body. The glow faded and everyone present heard a content sigh and the whisper, \"Peace at last...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was still as the blue chakra energy faded from Naruto. Nothing seemed to happen. Then, Naruto began to grow! His clothes quickly began to tear off as he grew in height and muscle! Within seconds he cut off all light in the clearing as his mammoth back reached towards the sky. The other smaller giants and Sakura all ran out of the way of Naruto's expanding feet. Naruto stretched higher and higher his pecs bursting with power, his abs cut deep and powerful, his biceps bulking with limitless power! Sakura nearly swooned at the magnificent sight. Then it was over. Everyone stared in awe at the gigantic Naruto. He grinned as he saw all the others looking up to him, awe evident in their faces. Naruto loved it. His toes were bigger than all those others down there. He bent down and everyone moved back except Sakura, too in awe to move. He gently scooped her up and brought her to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What do you think of the new me Sakura?\" His voice echoed with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I love it!\" She yelled out happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can come with me as I take my rightful place as Hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Naruto's huge feet moved and carried his monumental body towards the Hokage building.</span></div></div>",

Naruto loved the feeling of his body free in the air. At this size, he didn't even feel the need to dress beyond the loinclothe. This was 'fully dressed' to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto took one step towards the village and laughed as he felt the tremendous power that radiated from him. As his foot landed, a quake covered the forest from his simple step. But to Naruto it was noexistant. He laughed as he walked towards the Hokage's Headquarters. Sakura smiled and giggled as she watched him in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everyone else had stayed and looked up in awe and surprise. Sasuke was angry now that Naruto could lord over him how big and powerful he is, Iruka and Kakashi looked up and kept saying \"Naruto, you idiot.\", Lee started crying \"I lost my one ture love!\", and the others were staring in awe and admiration of the new Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Hokage was having a field day. Ninja's growing huge, a giant Naruto who keeps sending his bills to him, and the constant threat that another village might invade in this time of weakness. He sat down and fell on the small table, totally spent from all his hours of trying to solve the problem. \"I just wish someone would appear and take this task off my hands!\" He groaned \"This was fine when I was younger. But I don't want to thousands of different paper work! This isn't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when he felt it. \"A tremor?\" He thought as he saw his room shake. Some of the antiques fell as the tremor happend again and again. It was getting louder and driving a throbbing pain into his head. As he felt the tremors getting louder, The Third knew it was no longer a Tremor. 'Please don't let it be who I think it is' He thought as he went to the Balcony. That's when he saw who it was. 'Darnit! This is going to make my job so much harder.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto's giant body walk down the main street through the Leaf, allowing him to reach the place with only damage on things in the middle of the street. Looking down at the small Hokage, Naruto opened his mouth to smile. \"Hey Hokage! I think it's time a newer, bigger, and stronger Hokage took over!\" Naruto said as  he flexed his free arm. Sakura drooled as he flexed the other arm, watching the free show of her boyfriend's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thinking it over, the Hokage knew he couldn't beat him. At that size, not even outsmarting him would beat him. And he doubted that anyone could beat him at that size. So he did the most logical thing he could think of...</span></div></div>",

After arriving at their destination, they were shocked to hear with their new senses what the Hokage had said. He was letting Naruto become 'Emperor!' of the Hidden Leaf! This was unheard of, and each of them was talking amongst themselves about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto called out to Sakura, wanting to see how his Queen was doing. Quickly she returned to where he had placed her. \"What is it Naruto?\" She asked happily at the sight of his titan body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I need to tell you something.\" Naruto said. And so he explained all about the Nine-Tailed Fox. How the Fourth died to seal it inside him and how he has had it in him ever since. Shocked by this info, Sakura had a feeling of total shock. Yet, she remained calmed and placed a hand on one of his big tanned muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It doesn't matter to me if thats whats inside you. Naruto, deep down I think i've always liked you. Only I could never admit it.\" Sakura told him happily. Some people would think she would be unable to accept him or even like him before he became a giant. But that was not true. She loved him even before he grew big, but Sasuke was her greatest obsession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Sakura.\" Naruto said as he tenderly plucked her up and kissed her. \"I'll always protect you no matter what.\"  He placed her against his chest, allowing her to feel his muscles and heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks Naruto. I'll always stand by your side.\" She said as he began to  put her down after allowing her that wonderful feeling. And so she left to do the paper work. And using her Jutsu made 20 shadow clones to help. Something much easier to do the younger you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when Naruto turned his attention to a throne. He didn't care where he slept. As long as he could sleep. That's when he saw the perfect spot. Using his fists he aimed at each of the past Hokage's head statues and smashed them, all except for the Fourths. He would never do that to him. Pounding into the mountain. He stopped afer shaping a massive chair, big enough for his godly body. That's when he sat down. He felt no pain thanks to all these powered up muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking across the town he smiled and said \"I am the Divine Emperor!\" His voice trembling across the village. \"And I shall rule alongside my goddess for all times!\" Naruto smiled as he preeched \"And those that do not worship me or your goddess shall suffer divine judgement!\" Everyone in the village quaked in awe and fear of his power and began to bow. All except the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thats fine and all, but don't expect me to bow down. Takes too much work.\" Shikamaru said as they all moved around Naruto.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I could care less who rules! As long as I have food!\" Choji said with a smile. Both of them had grown tremendously fast thanks to sleep and food. Both were equally Nine feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The others also told him how they felt. Even though some didn't like it, Naruto is god. And trying to disobey him may not be the greatest idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto looked down and smiled. \"Since you all are evangelists of your god. I shall grant you each a rank befetting you.\" Naruto looked down at each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n First he turned to his rival Sasuke. Now nothing but a bug willing to serve him. \"For you Sasuke, I shall make my Prophet of War. You shall lead my armies against those that defy me.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine.\" Sasuke grunted as he looked up at him. He didn't like that he was Naruto's servant. But he had to admit, he had one of the biggest positions his servants would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For Kakashi and Iruka I shall give the ranks of the Prophets of Wisdom. You will teach all children in the village all that is to be a Ninja. And that I am absolute! Nothing will distub my rule!\" Naruto told the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both of them looked at each other and looked up at Naruto like a idiot. They had the same exact jobs. Only now they would also teach that Naruto and Sakura are divine beings who rule over all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto then turned to Shikamaru and Choji. \"You two shall be my Prophets of Silence and Destruction. You shall carry out the deaths of those I deem unworthy. This job will require the two of you to work rarely unless in the middle of a crisis.\" Naruto told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both looked at the other and smiled. This meant they didn't have to worry about working that much, and even though Shikamaru thought it would be a pain to work alot in a time of crisis. At least it meant he didn't work 24/7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now for Rock Lee.\" Naruto said as he looked at his former rival over his goddesses love. \"Since you opposed me you will be my Prophet of Pilgrimages and will always travel the land. You will never see Sakura unless its a emergency.\" Naruto told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nooooooo!\" Lee said as he got down on his knees. Now he would never again see Sakura! This wasn't fair at all! Why did he get to become a god!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As for the last two.\" Naruto said as he looked at Shino and Kiba. He thought it over, unsure of what to do with them. \"They will be the Prophets of Something or other.\" Naruto said with a half-thought. \"They will help with anything that the others needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Idiot' Both of them thought as they saw he ran out of ideas for Prophet names. Same stupid Naruto would never change no matter how big he got. This meant they might be working 24/7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now go forth and perform your divine duties!\" Naruto said with a roar. Scaring all of them to flee away to begin their new existances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto sat back into his throne with a smile. \"Just like I wished it. Thank you Angelmaru.\" Naruto said as he looked over his kingdom. Soon every village will bow before him, then the nations, and finally the rest of the world. All was as he wanted.</span></div></div>",

It had only taken five of those years for the world to recognize Naruto as Emperor over all the world. Most nations willigly submitted to Naruto and his Prophets but there are always some who fight and deny the inevitable. Any nation that couldn't be crushed by the force of Naruto's Prophets was crushed by Naruto himself. No weapon could penatrate Naruto's skin and rock hard muscles. Once complete rule had been established, Naruto had moved his Prophets to the different areas to rule. They in turn were ruled by Naruto who's throne resided in the capitol of the world, the Hidden Leaf Village. Sakura had overseen the problems in the village and their solutions. New laws were passed, old ways were dissolved, and all came to love Naruto and the work he did. Iruke and Kakashi kept teaching the young the ways of the ninja and the ways of Naruto. Everyone was happy and looked eagerly to what was sure to be a bright future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto needed to get away at times with Sakura of course. Being twenty-two their relationship had been cemented in the best way they could. Naruto was feeling worn out from a particularly hard day of rule, so he laid down with Sakura over his right pec above his heart. A light breeze rifled the hair of the sleeping pair as they dozed in the setting sun.</span></div></div>",

If she took Naruto back to her home, she would pass through the village and would be able to scope out those worthy to grow. It was exciting to have such power over the village. She grabbed Naruto's hand and said, \"Oh, nothing really happened. Angelmaru decided bind with me for now, that's all. But I've got something I need Naruto's help with back home so we're going to head over there now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked surprised, but allowed himself to get led by Sakura back to her house.

Despite their new size, they were as agile as they had been before, perhaps even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto couldn't believe his luck! Sakura was taking him back to her house! At last, all those fantasies he had were going to come true! Naruto was so focused on imagining what they were going to do together, he didn't notice Sakura constantstly looking around her. She saw Shino collecting bugs, Kiba walking his dog, Neji training, Konohamaru and Moegi and Udon playing, she saw Kakashi reading his book and Iruka leading a group of students into the Academy building. In short, she saw a whole lot of men waiting to be changed! They were both so focused, they didn't see the stares they were getting from the villagers at Naruto's large size. Finally, they made it to Sakura's house. She locked the door after Naruto entered and ran upstairs to her room before her mother could say anything. Once she was in her room, she locked that door as well.

I was supposed to be the biggest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed and said, \"Well you should've been nicer to Angelmaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What did I do? What are you talking about?\" Naruto asked desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pointed an accusing finger at him and said, \"You threatened Angelmaru before she bound herself to me. Because you were so rude, she told me to use her powers to shrink you until you apologized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto swiftly ran over to Sakura and said, \"Well I am sorry! I only said those things because I was concerned about you Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed and said, \"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Naruto said, grabbing her hands. \"I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled happily and said, \"Thanks Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave her the puppy dog eyes and said, \"Now can you make me big again? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled and said, \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated on his body and thought, \"I wish Naruto would grow back to his fifteen foot giant self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shouted with happiness as he felt his body start to swell up again. Sakura got a front row seat as Naruto's body increased in height and muscle. Naruto's jacket gave up the ghost and burst into shreds, revealing his chiseled and cut torso. Soon his head cracked against the cieling leaving a huge dent. Naruto quickly sat down and took Sakura into his arms. \"Thanks Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed again and said, \"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto released her and sat her on his huge leg, asking, \"What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had a glint in her eye as she said, \"You know I can make other men grow too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked worried and said, \"But you won't grow anyone bigger than me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Now that you apologized I'm not allowed to shrink you any smaller. Only bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a huge grin on his face after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sure there's some people you think deserve to be bigger.\" Sakura said. \"I'll let you pick who I grow first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about it. There were a lot of nice deserving guys who would love to get bigger. Finally Naruto thought of someone.</span></div></div>",

When I look in your eyes, you're still the same beautiful girl I've known.\"  Sakura's smile returned and hugged Naruto.  \"Now you're just smaller,\" Naruto added with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say some crazy things sometimes, but you do know how to make me smile,\" Sakura said, \"Now, let's go find Kakashi.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura, feeling a lot better, decided to put all thoughts of Angelmaru and her influences behind her. If anything bad did happen, she knew Naruto would be there to help her through it, no matter what the cost to himself. So she brushed aside worried thoughts and instead focused on the mission ahead of her. It didn't take long to find Kakashi, still sitting in the same spot, reading his book. Luckily, Kakashi always focused entirely on his Icha Icha Paradise books whenever he was reading, so he didn't notice Naruto and Sakura. They both hid behind a nearby billboard and spied on Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sakura, go for it!\" Naruto whispered excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Sakura closed her eyes and thought, \"I wish Kakashi-sensei would grow eight feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do it?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now we just have to wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long. Within seconds Kakashi started to grow. At first, he didnt' notice it, but he couldn't ignore it when a loud ripping sound erupted from his pants. Setting the book down and standing up, Kakashi was surprised to find that his pants had torn down the legs, revealing his boxers which were getting progressively tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kakashi-sensei wears boxers...\" Sakura said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it matter?\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a thing girls have! You can tell a lot of things about a guy by judging his underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked thoughtful and said, \"I didn't know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth turned their attention back to Kakashi as his shirt pressed tighter and tighter against his expanding chest until it ripped down the middle revealing his bigger muscles. Sakura blushed and said, \"I love this power so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked a little miffed and said, \"I'm still bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grinned and said, \"No one can match my Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned back at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of truth was at hand. Kakashi was standing with only his boxers and his mask still on. Naruto and Sakura leaned closer as the growth started subsiding. Soon...soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing my mask is stretchy.\" Kakashi said, pulling on it a little. \"If it wasn't, it surely would've ripped by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura both did a face fault. Leave it to Kakashi-sensei to go to such lengths to keep his face hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Naruto said. \"There's no way that mask can take that much growth and not rip! Make him bigger Sakura! That mask is going down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sweatdropped and said, \"Let's just leave it alone Naruto. Kakashi-sensei's obviously thought of everything. Besides, there are plenty of other people to grow and it's my turn to choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and said, \"Alright. If nothing else we can always shrink him and force him to take off the mask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the pair set off to find another growable guy.</span></div></div>",

Tonight, you won't escape me so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" Iruka said.

Angelmaru, from what I've read in my studying as a medical ninja, is the most docile of the tailed beasts. I don't think you have to worry about her taking control of your body or hurting you in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed in releif as she heard this. Naruto smiled and gave her the thumbs up. Tsunade continued, \"And from what I've seen, Angelmaru's powers are exactly what this village needed after Orochimaru's invasion. With our shinobi forces down, increasing the size and strength of the ones we do have is a top priority now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura frowned. She had been afraid of this. Now Tsunade was going to force her to use Angelmaru's powers the way she wanted instead of using them freely. Tsunade said, \"But since the power does come from Sakura, I think it's only fair if she gets to decide who gets to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked up in shock as Tsunade smiled at her. Sakura smiled back and said, \"Thank you very much Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Just make your choices carefully. I'm afraid I'll have to hold you responsible if anything happens that threatens the village or its people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful. I promise!\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned and said, \"Well then I'll be going back to my office. I've got to start assigning missions and changing a few of them. I would like you to send me a list of those that you grow though, so I can use them effectively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Shizune, Kakashi. Let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade and Shizune were hoisted back onto Kakashi's shoulders. He turned and said, \"I would like to talk with you three when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious he meant Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura.

She quickly used her Byakugan and saw that Kakashi was a small giant, and was carrying the Hokage with her assistant.  \"Isn't that Naruto's sensei?\" she wondered, \"Wasn't Naruto taller than normal these past few days?  I should follow them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her good speed, Hinata could only keep Kakashi just within range of her byakugan sight.  When she eventually caught up with them, she had to hide as Kakashi was coming back.  She hid behind a tree.  Either none of the ninja didn't notice or care about Hinata's presence, for they didn't stop when they passed her.  Hinata was able to pick up some of their conversation as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto being 15ft tall,\" Shizune said, \"The ramen shop is going to have a love and hate this.\"  Tsunade laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think our hunger is altered when this happens to us,\" Kakashi said, \"It seems another good thing since. . .\"  But what else Kakashi was lost as he was too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun's 15ft tall!  I have to see this!\" Hinata said and went in the opposite direction of Kakashi.  She soon came to the training area and heard a voice call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"502!  503!  504!\" Rock Lee said, \"And barely a sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Bushy-brow, now would you stop that?  It's annoying watching you  go up and down like that,\" Naruto said.  Sakura was sitting on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually agree with Naruto,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I must keep my promise.  If sakura didn't make me grow, I must do 10000 push-up!\" Lee responded, before counting aloud again.  He was up to 550s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sight of these three giant males, Hinata did what any girl like her would do: Scream her head off.  This caused Lee to stop his self-inflicted punishment.  All three looked and saw Hinata in the tree line, looking more shaky than she was after her fight with Neji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-N-Naruto,\" Hinata stuttered as she slowly approached, \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Naruto said.  He didn't want to tell about Sakura, as that was her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A special power,\" Sasuke said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine,\" Sakura said, \"I can make any guy as big or small as I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHianat seemed to blush as she said, \"You mean you could make Naruto bigger than this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Naruto said, \"We're sort of an item now, Sakura and me.\"</span></div></div>",

The other three realized what had happened:  Hinata had a crush on Naruto and he just broke it bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Kakashi-sensei comes back while I'm gone, tell him I'll be back in a few,\" Sakura said hopping down and going after Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what did I miss?\" Naruto asked again.  Lee and Sasuke looked at each other, then Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think being bigger could make some more stupid?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least oblivious to the obvious,\" Lee replied  This started Lee and Sasuke chiding Naruto for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sakura was moving quickly and heard a girl crying.

How long have you loved Naruto-kun!?\" Hinata yelled, her tears were back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gift I received from a demon,\" Sakura said calmly, \"One of the powerful tail-beasts bonded with me.  As for Naruto, I guess it's been growing for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not as long as my love for him!\" Hinata said, \"I've cared about Naruto since the Academy, when all you cared about was Sasuke Uchiha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, part of me is sorry you had to find out in such a bad way,\" Sakura said, \"Naruto can be pretty dense at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Hinata said.  \"But still, you weren't watching him all those years.  You don't know how lonely he was in this village.  No one approaching him.  No one wanting to be his friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even you.  You watched him and did nothing to help ease his pain,\" Sakura said coldly, \"But there were others who weren't held back by fear.  That was one reason I made Iruka-sensei bigger as well.  He cared about Naruto and treated him like a younger sibling.  So I might of been blinded by an infatuation with Sasuke, but you still did nothing.  Who's crime is worse:  The blind one who didn't see the pain or the one who did see and did nothing?\"</span></div></div>",

I've seen him battle a missing-ninja and outwit him, saving Kakashi-sensei's life.  I've seen him help change the outlook of an entire town, and not Konoha.  I've seen him face things that would make you die from shock.  It nearly made Sasuke, but Naruto's voice gave Sasuke a beating that made Sasuke even more powerful.  Then there was his fight against Neji, you recall that right?  Remember how he won?\" Sakura asked.  Sakura's words were making the desired attack.

Sakura's last point made Hinata miss Sakura completely, giving Sakura a chance for a powerful punch to Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it,\" Hinata replied, wiping her now bloody nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you recall his drive to win?  How he never stopped fighting, even when Neji was winning?

It was pretty hard to miss,\" Sakura chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My heart was still injured from Neji's attacks.  I didn't see the entire fight,\"  Hinata confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you didn't see his burst of chakra, revitalizing him,\" Sakura said, \"Do you know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll never know him for who he really is,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A true hero,\" Sakura said before leaving to return to her squad and Lee.</span></div></div>",

I want to see if your power works on dogs too! Just dont make them any bigger than me....\" Naruto interjected, almost guessing sakura's thoughts. \"Alrite, Naruto I'll leave this choice up to you. How tall should I make Kiba?\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto I want to be as big as you!\" Kiba forced himself to say. \"No way! I may let you grow and all but I'm still going to be the biggest shinobi around! Sakura, lets make kiba 13 feet tall, and akamaru proportional to that.\" Naruto made his decision. Even a massive 13 foot Kiba couldn't compare to him anyways. \"Ok, Kiba I'm trusting you won't be a wrong choice here... Angelmaru, I wish Kiba was 13 feet tall and Akamaru was proportional to that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba all of a sudden looked down and the ground was getting farther and farther away, his clothes ripped to shreds as he began to grow muscle all over his body. He flexed a bit and watched his new biceps grow into boulders on his arms and let his pecs bounce up and down. He stood there stark naked at 13 feet tall with a 6 foot tall akamaru to match. \"That felt great!\" Kiba said, looking over his new body ignoring the fact that all the other giants had kept their underwear on when they grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww Kiba!\" screamed sakura, at that height his underwear should've stretched out but not left his body. Even Narutos stayed on a he was bigger. \"OOO sorry! Forgot my boxers today...\" \"I have a solution to this.\" whispered Angelmaru in Sakuras head. A grey sarong was conjured up over the lower half of kibas body, bearing the angelmaru symbol. \"Well that works too\" Said Kiba, kind of disappointed he didnt get to show off ALL of his new size to the village.</span></div></div>",

Sure, she could easily shrink the Akatsuki members (all of them being male) but where was the guarentee they wouldn't be able to sneak up on her? How much stronger was Naruto and Sasuke now? Stronger than the Akatsuki members? Who knew? Naruto wasn't looking worried. Only angry. Obviously the thought of Akatsuki coming after Sakura enraged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do Kakashi-sensei?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to be prepared for their arrival first of all. I've already discussed this with LadyTsunade and she agrees that Sakura should never be left alone. Naruto shouldn't be either, but he's in a better position to protect himself. If they can, they won't miss an opportunity to capture Naruto as well. Both of you are Jinchuriki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Naruto nodded, agreeing to this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also thought it would be smart to have our defenses increased. Therefore, Lady Tsunade would like you to choose a group of shinobi you trust and increase their size greatly. More so than Naruto even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura both instantly started protesting. Kakashi stopped them with a raised hand and said, \"This is neccesary to have a show of force if multiple members of Akatsuki arrive. It'll also force them to be more offensive. They're not fools, though, and will probably have at least one member sneaking into the village to quickly capture Sakura. Since she can't call up a physical manefestation of Angelmaru like Naruto can do with the Nine Tailed Fox, they'll believe her to be an easy target. Therefore you'll have a small group of bodyguards, no less than two shinobi, and no more than five. I'm going to assume Naruto and Sasuke will be part of that group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and Kakashi said, \"Alright then, let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

Your mission is to protect your friend.  If you end up fighting and killing him, so be it.  But do not instigate the fight.  Shikamaru is your leader until Jiraiya comes back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I knew I'd have to be on more dangerous missions if I was grown,\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would of been chosen anyway, so at least you got to decide to grow on your own,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do you want me to take them?\" Shikamaru asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within a mile of the village,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Shikamaru said before thinking.  \"All right, we'll have a Naruto Shadow clone in front.  I'll be next.  Then Sakura with the real Naruto.  Then Neji, using his Byakugan to watch our back, and Sasuke in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, go,\" Tsunade said before the remaining shinobi left and she herself went to wait with the ANBU line.</span></div></div>",

Not only do they contain crystalized chakra but they are imbued with a jutsu that increases one's body and power to great extents. But I have embedded a piece of my own chakra inside each scroll. As the Leaf ninja grow, their desire to grow more will increase until they are all fighting each other wildly. And with each defeat, the victor only grows bigger and stronger. Soon, only one will be left standing, with not only the full power of the jutsu but a substantial dose of my own chakra. Manipulating this chakra, I intend to take control of the last standing giant and use him to crush the Leaf Village once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto smiled and said, \"Very clever Lord Orochimaru. But why not simply take the body as your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru turned away from him and said, \"A body of that size would be far too impractical for my own desires.

A visiting Gaara was also targeted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto was impressed by the sheer number of shinobi targeted. Their fighting alone could be enough to destroy the village.

He was slightly smaller than Naruto in height and a little less then him in muscle. His undershirt had ripped completely with his vest valiantly clinging on. His pants had been reduced to shorts while his sandals were entirely ripped off. He turned to the pair and said, \"Oh, so you too huh? What a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, me too? What's going on here?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru stepped aside and revealed an unconcious Shino. If he was standing he would be comparable to Naruto in both size and muscle. His coat was all but destroyed, the sleeves ripped open from his massive biceps and the front ripped in half revealing his deep six pack and gigantic pecs. His legs had done much the same to his pants that Shikamaru's had done to his and his feet were bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened out here?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me.\" Shikamaru said. \"I was just minding my own business when I was suddenly attacked by this guy. I only just managed to knock him out before you two showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First Naruto, then Lee, now Shino and Shikamaru.\" Sakura listed. \"Why is this happening?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Talk about unfair! I was the first one to start growing! This is my thing!\" Naruto announced pointing at Shikamaru angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shikamaru could say anything else, they were all distracted by Shino glowing blue. They watched as his body deflated back down to it's original size all that impressive muscle and height leaving him. Naruto and Sakura knew what would happen next and watched as the blue light engulfed Shikamaru. As soon as the blue light cleared Shikamaru began to grow. His muscles swelled as his overall height increased. Naruto took a half step backward, surprised at how much Shikamaru was growing. His biceps swelled, ripping apart the sleeves of his coat, his abs crunched and released and were soon joined by another row making an eight pack. His shoulders grew wider tearing whatever was left of his jacket apart, the material floating to the ground. His shorts looked like they were painted on his massive thighs. His feet plowed through the ground as they lengthened. Soon, Shikamaru was twenty five feet tall, ten feet taller than Naruto, and casting his shadow over both Naruto and Sakura. They both quickly stepped out of it. Shikamaru seemed nonplussed as he looked over his new body from his huge pecs to his wide back. He turned to Naruto and a strange expression overcame his face. He took a step forward. They took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but I want to fight you Naruto.\" Shikamaru said. \"Whether you want to or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that.

Gaara didn't say anything as his prey held still before him. Instead, he took a step forward, the ground shaking violently under his enormous weight. Sakura was knocked onto her butt, Naruto barely able to keep his feet. Gaara then raised a hand and brought it down clearly intending to smash Naruto into unconsciousness or worse. Naruto steadied himself, intending to fight even if it was hopeless, when Shikamaru finally caught up, his own arms up to stop Gaara. Shikamaru smiled and said, \"I don't think so. He's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara's eyes narrowed and he said, \"Your a better prize anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's our cue to leave!\" Naruto said, grabbing Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Sakura and Naruto had put quite a bit of distance from the other giant ninja both of which had started battling the other. Sakura glanced back and saw that Shikamaru had grabbed Gaara in his shadow. The strain showing on Shikamaru's face made it evident that he probably wouldn't be able to hold it for long. In her own opinion, Gaara was going to come out on top of this fight. She bent down from her position on Naruto's shoulder and said, \"We'd better hurry Naruto! That fight isn't going to last much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and increased his speed, dashing between the trees with such speed that the scenery became a blur. Within minutes, the village was rising into view. Naruto slowed down as he approached the outer limits of the village, looking for the abandoned lot where the scroll was. The only question was, would he find it? </span></div></div>",

Normally they'd be happy to see him, but with what was going on today, they were leery of him. Their fears were unfounded though as Kakashi smiled down at Sakura (and up at Naruto). They both sighed and Sakura said, \"Kakashi-sensei, it's so good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi clapped Sakura on the shoulder and said, \"Don't worry. I'm still in control, though I'm not sure how all this came about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura held out the scroll and said, \"Their was dust in this scroll that made Naruto grow.

We were told they were mission scrolls so we both opened them. Naturally we were covered in dust. We thought it was a prank and didn't think too much of it. We just rolled them up and stored them with our other scrolls. We started fighting again and I won. Well...I'm sure you can guess what happened next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto said, \"So you got Asuma-sensei's size huh?

But if we do that, we'll eventually lose sight of our mission and ourselves. So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slammed his fist into his open palm. \"Well that's obvious! We have to fight and get stronger! I won't let some snake like Orochimaru take control of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sakura and Kakashi looked skeptical at Naruto's enthusiasm.

This won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing left to say to each other, Sasuke and Iruka began fighting furiously. Sasuke made a few quick hand signs and breathed fire in a steady stream out against Iruka, engulfing him in a huge fireball. When the fire cleared Iruka was still standing with barely a mark on his huge body. Not bothering with jutsu, Iruka pulled his leg back and smashed Sasuke with a powerful kick. Sasuke went flying back crashing through various buildings to land in a hurt heap fifty feet away. Iruka walked after him, enjoying his new power as he easily dominated Sasuke. Kakashi, Naruto, and Sakura quickly followed, worrying about the outcome. If Sasuke managed to win this fight he'd no doubt come after Kakashi and Naruto next making him nearly unstoppable. On the other hand, if Iruka won he'd no doubt come after Kakashi and Naruto next making him more powerful than even Sasuke would become. Not to mention Gaara and Shikamaru were still out there somewhere, though by now one of them would've won the fight they started. They didn't know it, but only Sasuke, Naruto, Shikamaru, Gaara, Kakashi, and Iruka were left. Once one of them came out on top, Orochimaru would make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iruka approached Sasuke, Sasuke leapt up and attacked Iruka, driving a fist into his face. Iruka grabbed Sasuke's arms and held them out, bringing his knee up repeatedly into Sasuke's stomach. Sasuke wouldn't be able to take much more abuse. The size difference was too great. If someone didn't do something then Iruka was sure to win. Thinking fast, one of the smaller ninja made a move and attacked Sasuke effectively stealing the win from Iruka. But who was it?</span></div></div>",

As though from far away, he heard what sounded like laughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head and the numbness died down. Little did he know, Orochimaru's chakra was slowly building up inside his body, taking over little by little. Naruto was able to resist this far and would no doubt keep resisting, but one more dose of Orochimaru's dark chakra could be enough to send him over to Orochimaru's control. The growth started slowing down when Naruto was about seventy five feet tall. Even sitting he was taller than some of the smaller buildings. The growth he sustained from Iruka gave him enough energy to stand and look around the village. While this sudden change was amazing (Naruto had never felt stronger) he knew it served a dark purpose. The end was close. Only Kakashi, Naruto, Gaara, and Shikamaru remained. And surely either Gaara or Shikamaru was defeated. Soon, the final showdown would be at hand. Naruto, after making sure Gaara was nowhere to be found at the moment, knelt down and offered his palm to Kakashi and Sakura. Both of the ninja climbed on and Naruto brought the pair to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what Kakashi-sensei?\" Naruto asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's voice was still quite rumbling even when he was just whispering, his breath washing over both ninja in his palm. Kakashi thought about the question posed to him and said, \"I suppose we have to find the others like us and fight them. I don't think Orochimaru will make a move until there's only one of us left. We have to make sure that you, Naruto, are the one left since you seem to have the best control over Orochimaru's chakra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kakashi said this, Naruto felt a twinging pain in the back of his mind, the far off laughter seeming to get closer. Would Naruto be able to take it? This was already starting to be too much. Naruto shook his head again and steeled his will. He had to resist. There was no question about it. If he didn't, the village would be in big trouble. Konoha had already sustained a lot of damage as it was.</span></div></div>",

Tsunade and Shizune had been shocked to see Kakashi, but he quickly explained the situation. Tsunade's look of surprise turned to one of grim realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound like something Orochimaru would try.\" Tsunade said. \"I'm going to have you assemble a team to search for Orochimaru Kakashi. It's imperative we find him and stop him from continuing this plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi nodded and said, \"I'll do the best I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked stern and said, \"No, trying isn't good enough. If Orochimaru succeeds here the village won't stand much of a chance. If worst came to worse we'd have to kill remaining giant. That itself would no doubt cost many lives, much like the battle with the Nine Tailed Fox all those years ago. Either way, it would be a tragedy for the Leaf Village. I don't know if the village can keep bouncing back from all these attacks and emotional blows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi understood. \"I'll go assemble the Anbu Black Ops. We'll start looking for Orochimaru within the hour depending on how long it takes to rally them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"Then go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kakashi left Tsunade turned to Shizune and said, \"Shizune I need you to go out and find Jiraiya. We might be needing him before this is over. He shouldn't be too far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded and left. Near the outskirts of the village, Orochimaru and Kabuto watched the events of the village. Orochimaru smiled as he saw Kakashi dart around the village, looking for the Anbu Black Ops. He turned to Kabuto and said, \"Kakashi, Gaara, and Naruto are the only ones left. Since Naruto and Gaara refuse to fight, Kakashi is our prime objective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru pulled out a scroll identical to the one that Naruto and the others had received and opened it, drawing a brush across the paper, making a series of symbols and shapes. He quickly finished drawing and placed the scroll on the ground. He made a series of hand signs and slammed his palm down on top of the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden Jutsu! Mind Corruption: Grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust suddenly erupted around Orochimaru's palm littering the scroll and covering most of the symbols. Orochimaru, already showing the strain of using this jutsu so many times to make many other scrolls, stood back up and made the same hand signs, adding three at the end. He held his palm over the dust covered scroll, focusing on the center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden Jutsu! Mind Corruption: Chakra Imprint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple pulse of chakra flowed out of Orochimaru's hand and into the scroll, causing it to briefly glow purple. When the glow faded Orochimaru carefully rolled the scroll up and sealed it. \"In half an hour the scroll will be ready. We have to mask our presence until that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto nodded and made a few hand signs, \"Earth Style! Diving Concealment Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto and Orochimaru both sunk into the ground, awaiting the time to spring the trap on Kakashi.</span></div></div>",

Pankun nodded and Kakashi followed another dog on the scent's trail, while Pankun raced back to Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kakashi came to where the trail ended.  \"Hmm, I think this might be a trap,\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you fell right into it,\" Kabuto said appearing with Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kakashi, I have a gift for you,\" Orochimaru said, holding the scroll up, ready to open it on him.

He saw both Kakashi and Kabuto coughing, the dust settling equally between the two. Orochimaru smiled evilly. He watched as Kabuto and Kakashi both started growing bigger and bigger, their muscles expanding. Kabuto stopped growing at about twenty feet tall, while Kakashi grew bigger and bigger until he reached thirty five feet tall! As soon as they were both done growing, they started fighting. Orochimaru laughed as he watched them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is something I hadn't planned. But it seems to be working out in my favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Orochimaru watched the two titans fight, Tsunade was looking through her medical books trying to find something that could help reverse whatever jutsu Orochimaru had used. Kakashi had given her a small amount of the dust found leftover in Naruto's scroll and she was analyzing it carefully. Since she was a woman she had no fear of handling the dust. She was starting to get frustrated when Pakkun leaped through her window, landing on her desk and scattering some papers. Tsunade glared at the little dog and said, \"This had better be good Pakkun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakkun nodded and said, \"Kakashi found Orochimaru. He sent me to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade gathered some papers together and said, \"Very well. Thank you Pakkun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakkun jumped out the window to return to Kakashi. Tsunade dropped the papers into the wastebasket next to her desk and said, \"None of this is going to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unrolled a scroll and put the dust onto it. She made three hand signs and held them over the dust. The area around her hands started glowing. Within seconds, several symbols had lit up. Tsunade looked them over and said, \"It couldn't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled down a book quickly flipped through it. When she found the page she was looking for, she ran her finger down a column. She stopped about halfway down the page and read quickly, her eyes darting left and right. She stopped and whispered, \"So it is. Mind Corruption Jutsu! I have to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade closed the book and ran out of her office, heading downstairs in the Hokage Mansion to get a few things done before Orochimaru attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the village, Jiraiya and Tsunade spotted Gaara and Naruto sitting quietly in the practice field. Jiraiya shook his head and said, \"I can't believe Orochimaru could do something like this. Pick up the pace Shizune!

Yeah, he grew, but that doesn't mean,\" Naruto started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His eyes are different.  Remember when you and the shadow ninja confronted me in the hospital?  I saw his eyes then.  Today, his were glazed over.  This ninja has the same glaze,\" Gaara explained.

He raised his foot and was about to bring it down on Orochimaru when Orochimaru jumped back. Orochimaru grinned crazily up at Naruto and began to make hand signs.

You've got to fight it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru laughed quietly and said, \"Don't be a fool. One of you was doomed to be my slave from the start. Pity. I really thought someone like Kakashi or Sasuke would come out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the hand signs again, his chakra rushing out into another jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden Jutsu! Mind Corruption: Assault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara fell to his knees in pain, grasping his head. He wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gaara and Naruto fought off Orochimaru's forbidden jutsu, Jiraiya was just joining Tsunade in the basement of the Hokage Mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tsunade?\" Jiraiya asked as soon as he hit the bottom stair. \"Got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do.\" Tsunade said. \"I remember reading about another case like this. Of course, there wasn't any giants involved. Back then, a powerful ninja used a jutsu that was able to control the minds of other ninja by implanting a piece of his chakra inside their bodies. That's likely what Orochimaru is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the growing?\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something Orochimaru developed on his own. The jutsu crystallizes chakra and stimulates from within the ninja's growth patterns, causing them to expand. By mixing these two jutsu together he's able to expand certain ninja and control their minds at the same time. Think about it. If one piece of Orochimaru's chakra can start taking control, just enough to want to force the ninja to keep growing, then imagine what a bigger dose of his chakra could do. As the ninja fight each other, they start absorbing more and more of his chakra. By the time only one giant remains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be nothing more than Orochimaru's puppet.\" Jiraiya said in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Tsunade said opening a scroll. \"Which is why we have to dilute Orochimaru's chakra. The growth problem can be fixed after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade held out the scroll and explained her plan. It would be risky since in order to purify the ninja's chakra, they'd have to be extremely close. Not only that, it would take awhile to perform. On top of all that, they still had to deal with Orochimaru. Things were starting to look grim.</span></div></div>",

She had been struggling before, but now she held still, the cold metal pressing against her neck. Naruto saw this and growled in anger and frustration. Orochimaru called out to Naruto, \"If you keep stalling I'll kill her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the kunai against Sakura's throat and drew a small drop of bood.

Surely Tsunade had some kind of plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was starting to lose his patience. \"Listen very carefully boy. Even if someone comes to rescue you, what will it matter? I'm the only one who can break the jutsu over you and I'm not about to do that. If someone so much as shows up here and you haven't started fighting, I'll kill her! What's your choice? Fight or let her die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew he had no choice. If he didn't start fighting, Orochimaru was going to kill Sakura. If anyone tried to help him Orochimaru would kill Sakura. The only way to save Sakura was to fight Gaara. Once one of them won, Sakura would be safe. If he, Naruto, won, could he continue fighting off Orochimaru's control? He would probably be able to do it better than Gaara could at this moment. Plus, if he did win, and help was on the way, then he only had to hold out long enough for the help to come. He turned to Gaara and said, \"I'm sorry Gaara. But I'm going to have to break my promise. We have to fight now, or Sakura will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Naruto Uzumaki.\" Gaara said. \"Then our fight is moved from then, to now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though his body was much larger, Gaara's sand proved a good defense against Naruto's powerful punches.  Naruto's speed kept him from getting caught by Gaara's sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good.  If I lose that other ninja will be free,\" Gaara thought, as another punch was blocked, \"Naruto's improved a great deal.  But he is always stronger when protecting someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sand is powerful,\" Naruto thought, \"I'll need to take him down like I took down Iruka.\"  Naruto jumped back and made eight shadow clones.  Four went and charged Gaara, forcing his defenses to work over time while the other four made two rasegans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, even if he barely touches Gaara, the damage of one will be extreme,\" Jiraiya said quietly, \"Both hitting might make enough of an explosion for Sakura to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get ready in case that happens,\" Tsunade ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru smiled evilly.  \"I had nearly forgotten that boy knows the 4th Hokage's move,\" he said, \"At that size, he could destroy the half the Leaf Village in one strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" Sakura thought, shedding some tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara was watching the four as they attacked.  \"There!\" he thought when all four clones left something open and Gaara pierced eat with sand spikes.  They disappeared.  \"What now?\" Gaara thought when he heard running steps towards him.  He saw Naruto charging head on with some chakra in his hand.  Gaara moved to step when he felt something hit him in the backside.  He turned his head and saw the real Naruto with a rasengan.  The force of it had pierced his sand and hit him square in the back.  Gaara started to fall forward when the second one hit his chest.  As a result, Gaara flew into the sky.  As he did, he began to shrink, while Naruto climbed upwards to 160 feet tall.  While this happened, three other things happened with in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the concussion from the strikes made Orochimaru flinch enough to cover his ears.  Sakura also covered his ears.  The moment this happened, Jiraiya raced forward and picked up Sakura while Tsunade landed a punch on his back, breaking the spine and sending him into Naruto's huge leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately, the moment Gaara lost, his sand prison on Kakashi fell and the copy ninja stood up, wanting to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsunade quickly looked around, spotting Sakura being safely carried away by Jiraiya. Turning to Naruto she saw Orochimaru's body laying on Naruto's enormous foot, broken. She quickly made her way over to him and grabbed his arm, dragging him upward. At least, that's what she intended to do. As soon as her fist closed over Orochimaru's wrist, the skin broke and the hand fell limply off. Tsunade looked down in shock and saw that Orochimaru had used his body swapping technique. She had simply destroyed an empty shell. She turned and searched for Orochimaru, wondering where he had escaped too. She turned to Kakashi and saw Orochimaru standing on Kakashi's shoulder, his hands blurring in his haste in making hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden Jutsu! Mind Corruption: Control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed both palms onto Kakashi's shoulder forcing control over the copy ninja. Kakashi lost the will to fight and prepared to follow Orochimaru's orders. Orochimaru, starting to sweat from the effort this was costing him, smiled at Tsunade and said, \"You're as strong as ever Tsunade. But I'm afraid I can't stay and chat. It seems my plan hit a snag and I must correct it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed softly and made a few hand signs. Kakashi suddenly turned and sped away, disappearing into the distance before any one had time to react. Tsunade clenched her fist in frustration and said, \"We almost had him! I should have known he'd try something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya set Sakura down next to Tsunade and said, \"I think we have bigger issues to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed up and Tsunade remembered she was standing on Naruto's foot. He was looked down at them with a pained expression on his face. It had obviously just gotten increasingly more difficult to subdue Orochimaru's influence over him. Sakura looked worried and said, \"You can help him right Lady Hokage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked torn. She turned to Sakura and said, \"Yes I could. I was planning on doing it after we captured Orochimaru. Now I'm not so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sakura said. \"You have to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru is still on the loose! And worse, he still has Kakashi under his influence. We might need someone like Naruto to defend ourselves with. If I undo the jutsu Orochimaru has on him, he'll return to normal and we'll be helpless when Orochimaru returns!\" Tsunade shouted, losing in patience in the desperation of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked crestfallen and stayed quiet. She knew what she wanted. She wanted Naruto back to normal. She wanted everyone that had been changed to be changed back. But was that the right choice for the village? Would Naruto want to be changed back if it meant the destruction of the village? All these thoughts raced through her head. She didn't know what to think or do anymore. Jiraiya suddenly said, \"Can't you just remove Orochimaru's chakra? That way, he'll still be the same size and Orochimaru won't be able to manipulate him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade thought about that. \"The jutsu works so that Orochimaru can increase the size of a chosen ninja and manipulate them with his chakra. That links both aspects of the jutsu together. I might be able to untangle them and just purify Orochimaru's chakra, freeing Naruto. But it's risky. There's no guarantee that the whole thing won't come undone. Trying to force one side of the jutsu might put too much strain on Naruto as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya looked grim. \"I still think it's the best course of action. For Naruto and the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"I think so too. Alright then! I'm going to need all your help for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade instructed Shizune, Sakura, and Jiraiya into a circle around Naruto who she instructed to lay down. He did so, his face still contorted with effort. Tsunade turned to Sakura and shouted, \"All you have to do Sakura is channel your chakra with all of ours. We'll need you to support our efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Sakura shouted, holding out her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned to Shizune and said, \"Perform this like a standard procedure Shizune! I'll handle the complicated part!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Lady Tsunade!\" Shizune said, holding our her hands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then turned to Jiraiya and said, \"Get ready with a scroll capable of sealing chakra! When I remove Orochimaru's chakra its of vital importance that it's sealed before it can do any damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Jiraiya shouted, pulling out a scroll and drawing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned to Naruto and said, \"Alright! Let's begin!\"</span></div></div>",

She saw in the corner of her eyes, Shinue nodded.  \"Now Sakura,\" Tsunade commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sakura said pressing her hands down next to Tsunade.  Shizune also put her hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun,\" Tsunade said as the three females' chakra went into the giant's body.  Tsunade closed her eyes and focused on finding every remnant of Orochimaru inside Naruto.  \"Wait, what is this?\" Tsunade thought as she remembered a conversation she had with Jiraiya after she returned as Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naruto's tapped the Kyuubi then?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I taught him how.  He also seemed to recognize when its chakra was active.  Naruto called his chakra a blue color and the red was the Kyuubi's,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Tsunade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Naruto, Tsunade was sensing three different chakras.  But what she found interesting was the Kyuubi's red chakra was destroying Orochimaru's little by little.  Thinking on it, it made sense to Tsunade.  The Kyuubi wanted freedom.  With Naruto he could have some.  But with Orochimaru, he wouldn't have any control.  \"This is how he was able to fight it for so long,\" Tsunade thought pushing her chakra force to help remove Orochimaru's chakra that was too deeply in bedded into Naruto for the Kyuubi.  Tsunade was very thankful for the demon as if any piece broke off as she was collecting the mass, it would destroy it.  After ten minutes, she had finally amassed all of it.  \"Jiraiya!\" Tsunade yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Jiraiya yelled.  Jiraiya watched as Tsunade pulled out a large mass of purple chakra.  It took on the shape of a person, but was missing some parts.  Tsunade shot it at Jiraiya and he sealed it in a scroll.  Shizune and Sakura fell to their chests from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The operation was a success, I hope,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hope?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you from the start, it was dangerous,\" Tsunade said, sitting down.  \"I need a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy you ten if this worked,\" Jiraiya said.  All four looked down at Naruto when Gaara finally came down and landed on Jiraiya.  Gaara was still alive, thanks in part to his sand slowing his fall and in part to Jiraiya.  The shock of the impact made Naruto stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Naruto?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened</span></div></div>",

The evil laughter that had been plaguing him had finally been silenced. Naruto slowly smiled, happy that he was free. Suddenly he jumped up and shouted, \"I'm free! Yahoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his hands in the air and cheered, laughing, happy that he was finally free of Orochimaru's influence. Unfortunately, he had no idea that he had just dumped his friends onto the ground. Tsunade, already at the end of her rope due to the worry and the stress of the operation and desperate for a drink, lost her temper and punched Naruto in the side of the foot. Naruto felt the bone crushing punch as little more than a poke due to his enormous size and the new toughness of his skin and the density of his muscles. He looked down and grinned. \"Hey Grandma Tsunade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade blew up at Naruto, \"You idiot! I have the decency to free you from enslavement and all the thanks I get is getting dumped on the ground like bad rice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knelt down and said, \"Hey you don't have to get so snarky lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura said, \"I'm so glad to see you're normal again Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave Sakura the thumbs up and said, \"It's great to be back Sakura! Where's Gaara and Kakashi-sensei? Are they okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya looked uncomfortable and said, \"Gaara's right here. He's fine, just tired. As for Kakashi...Orochimaru escaped with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!?\" Naruto thundered. He slammed a fist into the ground, knocking everyone onto their butts. \"HOW DID HE GET AWAY?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade got back onto her feet and shouted, \"We did what we could Naruto! There's a reason you're still a giant! We came close to capturing Orochimaru, but he was one step ahead of this time. He's bound to come back with Kakashi to attack the village and when he does we'll be ready for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and said, \"It doesn't seem right, but if I have to beat down Kakashi-sensei then I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya laid Gaara down and said, \"Alright, but you'll have to be ready. Orochimaru isn't going to leave anything to chance this time. We might have one big Kakashi to deal with when he comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded again and said, \"It doesn't matter how big he is! I'll still beat him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and said, \"Alright then. We'd better get back to the village and prepare a defensive force. But before that I want every ninja that was affected by the scrolls to be retrieved and treated for any injuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go find them Lady Tsunade!\" Shizune said running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned to Jiraiya and said, \"You stay with Naruto and help him prepare for Kakashi and Orochimaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded and said, \"I don't know how much I can help him, but I'll do what I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned to Sakura and said, \"You're coming with me Sakura. We can't risk you being used as a pawn again so you'll have to stay with me at all times. While Naruto fights Kakashi, we're going to try and take down Orochimaru. Naruto can't get any bigger, but Kakashi still could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and said, \"I'll do what I can. Just ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"Then follow me to the village. We have work to do.\"</span></div></div>",

One, as he's a sharigan user, he'll track your every movement.  But if you can cover the eye, he can't track.  Even if it's cloth thin, it will be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, he was the 4th Hokage's student.  As a result, he knows the rasengan as well,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good,\" Naruto said, thinking on how powerful his was when he struck Gaara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.  Third, we don't know what Orochimaru might do to him, so treat him as your enemy until the fight's over.  Even if you have to kill him.  Understand?\" Jiraiya said in a tone Naruto had rarely heard him speak in, \"Considering your resistance to Orochimaru, it would be better for you to grow larger than try to heal Kakashi in his current state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I want you to try something a little radical,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me and radical,\" Naruto said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Tsunade and Sakura were in Tsunade's office.  \"Where is it?\" Tsunade said, looking through piles of paper work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's what?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Tsunade said, pulling out a bottle of sake and drinking it straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were here for sake!?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some papers on those who were exposed to the crystals,\" Tsunade said, pulling the papers from the top of the pile.  \"Now to examine the patients,\" Tsunade said, leaving for the hospital where Shizune took the former giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya smiled as he looked at the Naruto before him.  He was the same size he was before fighting Gaara.  \"Nice idea, making multi-size shadow clones,\" Jiraiya thought as the main Naruto hid underground.  Jiraiya's plan was to draw Kakashi back here to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the woods away from the leaf Village, Orochimaru was resting.  \"This set back will be perfect if I can infect that Kyuubi-boy with my control by letting him win against Kakashi,\" Orochimaru thought as the now 100 foot tall Kakashi just stared into nothing.  \"It'll be win-win either way,\" Orochimaru said laughing.</span></div></div>",

His puppet, Kakashi was staring into space, no orders having been given to him by Orochimaru. Orochimaru knew Naruto would fight Kakashi just as he knew that Tsunade had probably found a way to excise his chakra. Naruto had shown an amazing ability to resist Orochimaru's chakra but that was when the chakra was being assimilated in his body slowly. How much resistance would he mount when an enormous dose of Orochimaru's chakra was absorbed in his body? With Naruto under his control, Orochimaru would finally realize his ambition to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village! He opened his eyes and stood up from his position on Kakashi's shoulder, his hands already moving in the by now familiar hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden Jutsu! Mind Corruption: Battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi's eyes suddenly lit up and he got to his feet, moving towards Konoha. He was determined to find Naruto, his last remaining opponent, and finish him off once and for all! Orochimaru laughed as they moved, knowing it would all be over soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kakashi and Orochimaru made their way back into the Leaf Village, Tsunade was finishing examining Choji, her last patient of the former giants. Sakura had been watching her, taking note of all her techniques, hoping to learn as much as she could from them. Tsunade checked all the charts she had regarding the patients and said, \"This is odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura asked, \"What's odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade handed Sakura a few of the charts and said, \"There seems to be a strange abnormality in all the ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of abnormality?\" Sakura asked, looking the charts over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. It seems that they're bodies have all been changed permanently by the Forbidden Jutsu.\" Tsunade said, making a note on the charts in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't appear to be detrimental.\" Tsunade said. \"It looks more like a change Orochimaru wasn't planning on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it mean?\" Sakura asked, not gaining much information from the charts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to just wait and see.\" Tsunade said. \"But I wouldn't worry. Beyond this abnormality and a few cuts and bruises, they're all doing exceptionally well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura handed back the charts and couldn't help but wonder what was happening to the former giants' bodies. Would it turn out to be a problem? Or was Orochimaru's jutsu not fully developed when he used it? Only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the training field, Jiraiya was hiding in the brush, watching the seventy five foot Naruto shadow clone as he waited for Orochimaru. He knew Orochimaru would attack soon. He wouldn't want this opportunity to be missed. Suddenly, a voice called out, \"Chidori!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya and the shadow clone both looked up and saw Kakashi, Sharingan revealed, descending on the clone with one hand raised, the Chidori clearly visible. The clone barely managed to avoid the shot which created a crater that radiated for at least a hundred feet on all sides. The training field had been obliterated in one shot! The hundred foot Kakashi stood up straight, looking for his opponent. The clone suddenly attacked from the top, with a kick aimed directly at Kakashi's head. Kakashi grabbed the clone's foot at the last second and tossed it to the ground. The fight was on. But who would come out on top? </span></div></div>",

Or is something else going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Orochimaru pondered, Naruto's clone and Kakashi exchanged powerful blows.  Both were taking a beating while Joraiya waited to try and stike Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Orochimaru, this idea of making giant warriors is really pathetic,\" Jiraiya yelled as he rode on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you wouldn't be complaining one bit if I focused on making the women of this village giantesses,\" Orochimaru called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why didn't you?\" Jiraiya asked, holding on to Naruto's hair after Kakashi landed another punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons, one you'd of enjoyed it too much.

No doubt he's hated doing everything I've forced him to do, but he has no choice but to do it! His will no longer matters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya sent a punch Orochimaru's way that the snake ninja barely dodged. \"You should keep your focus on our fight Orochimaru!\" He yelled, lunging in for another attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru jumped back and opened his mouth, the Kusanagi erupting from within him. He grabbed it and charged Jiraiya, slashing at him wherever he could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Orochimaru and Jiraiya fought, Naruto continued holding Kakashi. He didn't know what to do. Chances were Kakashi wouldn't break free since he was sixty feet smaller than Naruto but he wouldn't be able to be helped without Tsunade. Naruto knew that if he didn't do something Orochimaru would try something even if he was currently occupied. He'd only need a split second to cast his Forbidden Jutsu on Kakashi or try something equally heinous. What was he to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fights raged on Tsunade was making a most interesting discovery at the hospital. She didn't quite know what to make of it at first, but the longer she looked the more sense it made. She sat back in her chair and called for Sakura. She had been attending  to the patients as best she could with the other nurses but came running when she heard Tsunade's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Lady Hokage?\" Sakura asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've discovered something quite interesting. That abnormality in the the bodies of the former giant ninja comes from a remnant of the jutsu Orochimaru cast. It's the part of the jutsu that stimulates the growth processes in the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that mean?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it.\" Tsunade said. \"All parts of Orochimaru's jutsu was removed except for one: the growth factor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's face suddenly lit up and she said, \"Do you mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Tsunade said, slapping her hand down on the charts. \"Those ninja affected by Orochimaru's jutsu will be able to control their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing!\" Sakura said. \"But there's limits right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To an extent.\" Tsunade said. \"Depending on long the jutsu was cast on the ninja will determine how much they can grow. I believe Gaara, Naruto, Kakashi, and Iruka will be able to grow the most with the other ninja falling in behind them. The smallest of the group will probably those who fell in their first fight like Shino. How much longer until the ninja will be conscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura quickly looked through the papers she'd collected from the other nurses. \"Ummm...it looks like they'll be up within the next ten minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!' Tsunade said. \"As soon as they wake up I want them briefed on the situation between Orochimaru, Kakashi, Naruto, and Jiraiya and I want them sent out to help. We'll be following the last ninja to wake up to help Kakashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded excitedly, happy to know that this whole mess was finally coming to an end. The only question was, would the ninja be in time to help Naruto?</span></div></div>",

He attacked Orochimaru, who defended and realized  Kusanagi's sharpness was nothing to this katana.   With the weapon in hand, it once again became even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was holding Kakashi well.  The corrupted ninja couldn't even move Naruto's hands one inch.  Kakashi was now trying to flail in order to escape.  But still to Naruto's power, it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not good,\" Orochimaru thought when he analyzed the situation, \"Naruto's still holding out that stalemate after weakening Kakashi with the shadow clone.  And with this pervert having the edge on me, I can't aid Kakashi.  Wait, that could work.\"  Orochimaru smiled a wicked smile.  Jiraiya took the moment he left open to cut him in half with his katana.  Orochimaru laughed as he shot himself out of his body and like before went after Kakashi.  \"Mouth!  Open!\" Orochimaru yelled in his weakened state.  Kakashi looked towards his master and did so before closing his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Naruto exclaimed unsure what just happened.  Jiraiya looked on worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Orochimaru in there, it'll be even harder to win,\" Jiraiya said, \"He can now hide in Kakashi's own body to recover while Kakashi takes us on after being enhanced.\"  As if on cue, Orochimaru used the Fobidden Jutsu:  Growth on Kakashi and he sored to 170 feet tall.  Inside, Orochimaru was spent and he knew it.   Those last two moves took everything he had.  It was up to either Kakashi winning or Naruto winning and becoming his slave.  Given the amount of his chakra inside his slave, he was confident in either direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi moved then to strike Naruto, who dodged.  \"He's faster,\" Naruto thought dodging.  \"Ero-sennin!  What about plan C?\" Naruto yelled as he dodged another strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Jiraiya said jumping up while Naruto made five shadow clones.  Naruto started to prepare the rasengan while Jiraiya scaled the giant Kakashi.  Kakashi saw the rasengan being formed in the back ground and it flagged a major warning in his primitive mind.  He aimed to defeat the Naruto with it before it hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the leaf village, the first three ninja woke up.  They were Iruka, Gaara, and Shikamaru.  Their memories of being huge came back to them after a minute.  Tsunade and Sakura then briefed them on what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can grow back to the largest size we were?\" Isuka asked, shaking his head.  He was greatly disturbed by the fact he attacked his own students.  Or was it them who attacked him?  It was all a blur, like a bad hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and as you three are the first to wake up, you'll have to help fight either Naruto or Kakashi,\" Tsunade said opening the door, \"Gaara, I can't order you as . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Naruto helped save me in the past and helped today as well.  I'll try and help as I can,\" Gaara said.  He and Iruka went out the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, how troublesome,\" Shikamaru thought leaving as well.  Once they were outside the confines of the hospital, they  grew them selves to 20 feet and Iruka picked up Sakura and Tsunade before running off to the training field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gathered that it would take a lot to win against Kakashi.  But he also knew the problem with their size.  The touch of someone small on them wasn't felt.  As the clones disappeared, Naruto smiled as he saw Jiraiya above the sharigan eye.  In a swift motion, Jiraiya pierced the eye with his katana, disabling its awesome power and giving Naruto enough time to complete the rasengan and strike Kakashi in his gut.  Before the blow was hit, Jiraiya jumped off the mountainous Kakashi.  When Kakashi was hit, he coughed on reflex, sending his weakened master at the ground with incredible speed, too fast for the weakened Orochimaru to control.  As Oroshimaru fell, he felt something hit him and suddenlt below him was Jiraiya. his katana had blood on it and in his last few moments, Orochimaru realized he was cut in half vertically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of the rasengan was enough to defeat Kakashi.  And an all to familiar glow appeared.  As it encased Naruto, he grew again, pushing past the 300 foot mark.  He eventually stopped at 350 feet.  All of Orochimaru's chakra that was in Kakashi was within  him.  Like before, he collapsed on the ground.  Jiraiya barely got out of the was of his massive knee.  As his mind became slowly under Orochimaru's will, he searches for his master.  But as his master is dead, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Orochimaru's chakra filled Naruto's body, Naruto's last bit of reserve left him, leaving him a puppet or Orochimaru. Luckily for him, Orochimaru was already dead, leaving him unable to make Naruto do anything. Unluckily, Orochimaru's chakra was still poisoning Naruto and filling him with evil thoughts. The Kyubi was slowly breaking down Orochimaru's chakra like before, but it would be necessary for another cleansing by Tsunade before Naruto would be fine. Jiraiya held his sword at the ready, prepared to fight Naruto if need be. He watched as Naruto got onto his hands and knees, scanning the ground, obviously looking for Orochimaru. Jiraiya quickly summoned a toad and said, \"Get rid of Orochimaru's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toad croaked and its tongue darted out, wrapping around the two halves of Orochimaru  and pulling them into his stomach. The toad disappeared and Jiraiya kept his eye on Naruto. Naruto was starting to lose his patience with trying to find Orochimaru. Then his gaze landed on Jiraiya. He grinned and his hand darted out, whether meaning to hit or grab Jiraiya wasn't sure. He pulled out his sword and struck out, landing a hit on Naruto's finger tip. It was like poking someone with a pin. It stung, but he didn't even get it in deep enough to make Naruto bleed. Jiraiya was about to fight back with something a bit more damaging, when a voice suddenly called out, \"Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked and saw Shikamaru, Iruka, and Gaara running toward him. He stood up to his full height and the other ninja faltered slightly. At their current size of twenty feet they were about the size of Naruto's ankle. Not good. Shikamaru increased his height to the max of twenty five while Iruka went up to fifty and Gaara reached seventy five. Even then, they were practically nothing next to Naruto. Shikamaru quickly sent his shadow out and caught Naruto, instantly feeling the strain of holding someone Naruto's size. His chakra was rushing out fast. Iruka set Tsunade and Sakura down and quickly ran forward, pulling out a scroll and unrolling it at Naruto. With a puff of smoke, a giant kunai was released from the scroll along  with a few shuriken. Iruka tossed the shuriken at Naruto who took the tiny bits of metal like they were nothing. Pulling back, Iruka jammed the kunai into Naruto's foot, hoping to at least cause some damage. The kunai stuck in Naruto's big toe, a small trickle of blood flowing from the wound. Naruto barely blinked, his eyes fiery with the desire to reach out and crush Iruka. Luckily, Shikamaru's jutsu was still holding. Gaara quickly called up his sand and proceeded to wrap it around Naruto's arms and legs, pulling him to the ground and tethering him. Shikamaru released the jutsu, sweat beading on his forehead and said, \"That was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto instantly started struggling, though the sand managed to hold him fast. Tsunade sighed and said, \"Okay, we've got him held down. Now lay him on his back so I can purify his chakra. Ready Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Sakura said, preparing to add her chakra to the procedure once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Jiraiya?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, but where's Shizune?\" Jiraiya asked, pulling out another sealing scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stopped dead in her tracks and said, \"Oh damn it! Shizune is back at the hospital treating the other patients! We can't do this without her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the giants and said, \"One of you hurry and get Shizune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka nodded and said, \"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iruka ran off, Naruto started glowing a strange purple and red color. His chakra seemed to be growing stronger. Jiraiya looked on and said, \"This doesn't look good. The Fox's chakra is mixing with Orochimaru's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura clapped her hands to her face and said, \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it can't be good!\" Jiraiya said as Naruto's chakra continued fluctuating. \"I just hope Iruka gets back here fast!\"</span></div></div>",

Gamabunta and Kytsuyu were shocked at seeing th giant Naruto, who towered over them.  As Jiraiya briefed the two on what was up, Tsunade returned to Naruto's chest and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Iruka was moving as fast as he could, destroying some trees along the way, when something made him stop.  More to the point, two someones.  Iruka looked down and saw Shizune in the arms being carried by Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke!\" Iruka called down, \"You're up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he came too a few minutes after you guys left me behind!\" Shizune yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Iruka said, reaching his hand down, \"We need you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Sasuke asked as Shizune changed giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto's fighting an overwhelming amount of Orochimaru's chakra,\" Iruka said, \"They'll need as many med-ninja as they can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" Shizune said, \"That's why a med squad will come with the next giants to wake up.  I figure together, you could hold down Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.  He's over 300 feet tall,' Iruka said, before bolting back the way he came.  Fewer trees were lost this trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"300 feet?  You have to be kidding me!\" Sasuke thought, trailing far behind the massive Iruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iruka made it back with his much needed companion, Tsunade yelled, \"About time!  Get over here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Shizune yelled, jumping over.  The two boss summons watched carefully, ready to attack if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women did as before and placed their hands down.  Suddenly Iruka spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I send my chakra in with you?\" he asked, \"I have a far greater amount and it might be helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked at Iruka.</span></div></div>",

Gaara was starting to struggle holding him down, while Shikamaru was slowly regaining his chakra to perform the Shadow Possession Jutsu again if need be. Tsunade put her hands down on Naruto's chest and said, \"Remember Iruka, don't feed so much of your chakra through that you overwhelm me. You and Sakura should start feeding me your chakra now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade and Shizune performed the operation much the same way as before, though it was much more difficult now with the massive Naruto thrashing around and the sheer amount of chakra. Tsunade saw the Kyubi had once again burned through a lot of Orochimaru's chakra and was continuing to suppress it. Before, the Kyubi's chakra had stayed out of her way as she removed the chakra. Now it was actively trying to confuse her, to draw out his chakra instead of Orochimaru's. Tsunade started to struggle, keeping the Kyubi's chakra in while pulling out Orochimaru's. Then she felt Iruka's chakra flow into her in addition to Sakura's. She used it to force the Kyubi's chakra back into the seal and yank out Orochimaru's chakra all at once. She yelled out, \"Jiraiya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya pulled open the scroll and caught the purple chakra as it flew out of Tsunade's hands. The scroll started feeling warmer and warmer as the chakra became sealed within it. Finally, all the chakra was captured. Jiraiya bound the scroll and drew seal after seal over it, making sure not a single scrap of Orochimaru's chakra would ever be freed. He tucked the scroll away with the other one, the last remnants of Orochimaru. Tsunade nearly collapsed at the amount of chakra it had taken to perform the operation. Sakura and Shizune had both fell unconscious, unable to withstand the strain. Tsunade stood shakily and nearly faltered. Iruka steadied her and said, \"Is it over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"When the med squad gets here they'll need to look over Naruto, Sakura, Shizune, and Kakashi. Shikamaru and Gaara don't look hurt, just tired and you seem fine. So for the most part yes...this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the med ninja arrived in the arms of the remaining giants, two in each arm. Kiba, Asuma, Chouji, Lee, and Sasuke were each told the events after they were knocked out and about their new powers. Naruto slowly started to shrink as the med ninja looked everyone over. Within the hour, he was normal sized though it would be several hours before he finally woke up. A search was set out to find Kabuto since he hadn't been seen since his defeat at Kakashi's hand. His body was found, mutilated by Orochimaru who had used a jutsu none of them had ever seen before on him. No doubt whatever had happened had revived Orochimaru when he had been near death before he sent Kakashi to attack the village. His body was taken care of by the ANBU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya and Tsunade stood on top of the Hokage's Mansion, looking out over the Leaf Village. The giants that had woken up were already helping to rebuild the village, hoping to make amends for what they had done. Gaara had left to return to his village, promising to return later to see Naruto and lend assistance if it was needed. Tsunade sighed and said, \"Well, all in all I see this as a good turn of events.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya turned to her and said, \"Even though the village took damage we managed to kill both Orochimaru and Kabuto, both registered in the Bingo Book as high class criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but we gained a strong defensive force with the giants.\" Tsunade said. \"People will think twice before attacking us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and said, \"What did you do with Orochimaru's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya smiled and said, \"I left it with one of my toads. He'll make sure the body is destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"I'm going to go check on Naruto and Kakashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsunade left Jiraiya to his thoughts, the toad that was holding Orochimaru's body was hopping through the forest on the way to dispose of the body. Normally the toads would use jutsu to dispose of things, but this toad was unable to perform jutsu. Instead, he was planning on burning it once he was clear of the village. As  he hopped along, something exploded out of the ground and closed around the toad. A strange plant like head pulled itself out of the ground, the plant attached to what appeared to be a human body wearing a black coat with red clouds. The plant opened and the mangled toad fell out, Orochimaru's body visible in the toad's stomach. The plant opened fully and revealed a man with half his face white, and the other half black. He pulled the two halves of Orochimaru's body out of the toad's stomach and said, \"I thought this toad tasted funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's Orochimaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone finally killed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take him back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu grabbed both halves of Orochimaru's body and sank back into the ground. It would soon be found that Orochimaru had written the Forbidden Jutsu that had caused this whole mess on a scroll that was still in tact in his robes. And now it was in Akatsuki hands.</span></div></div>",

Which meant that Tsuande had been lecturing Naruto for going on ten minutes and he was getting bored and only half paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So above all else, you need to be extremely careful with your new abilities.  They should not be used inside the village without authorization and you should at all times avoid using it on a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was inevitable he would ask some question since Naruto never seemed to fully grasp something at first.  \"Wait, I get not using it in the village but why not on missions?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsuande could answer, Kakashi weighed in.  \"First of all the less people outside the village that know about this jutsu the better, it's an important advantage for us.  Secondly if you can just run around as a giant on missions your training will slack because you don't need to get any stronger.  Think of this as the equivalent of Lee training with weights on.  When he takes them off too fight he is that much stronger and faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it, so the stronger I get while I'm small just means I'll get even stronger when I'm big!\"  Naruto said with some excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's close enough for now.\"  Kakashi answered while rubbing the back of his head.  Tsuande was <i> slightly</i>  disturbed at that exchange but if it meant Naruto would keep himself under control it was worth leaving him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any event, I have an important mission for your team.  Jiryaa has told me that the frog he used to hold Orochimaru's body has gone missing.  It was likely captured by someone.

Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuande continued as if he hadn't spoken.  \"Your concern is noted Kakashi, but they  need to learn to work together, you understand that as well as anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but I'd like to start them off on a mission where combat isn't likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we get to fight someone? Awesome, granny is actually giving me a serious mission!\"  Tsuande and Kakashi were continuing their conversation without Naruto, which he didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send a fifth member to help you keep them in order.  Jiryaa can accompany you and that should help things in line.  Will that suffice?\"  Kakashi nodded his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A ranked mission is set.  Kakashi, Jiryaa, Naurto, Sauske and Sakura are to track down the remains of Orochimaru and deal with whoever had taken them.</span></div></div>",

Naruto was on top of the world as the pair walked through the streets of Konoha, Sakura carefully steering Naruto clear of any of the working giants. Naruto was too deep in his own thoughts about his good luck to notice how long it was taking to get to the training field. Sakura had barely managed to avoid Shikamaru and Iruka both rebuilding a shop that had been flattened when Kakashi and Sasuke had been fighting. Sakura sighed as she saw the training field appear ahead of them. She grabbed Naruto's hand and started running. Naruto snapped out of his fantasies and ran with Sakura, wondering why she was suddenly sprinting towards the training field. Just as it was looking like they would be home free, a huge foot suddenly landed in their path. Sakura slammed headlong into it and fell on her back, Naruto barely able to stop himself before crashing into the giant appendage. Naruto craned his head back and was shocked to see Sasuke glaring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!?! Why is Sasuke still huge?!?\" Naruto shouted to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned and grabbed her head, sitting up. She saw Sasuke and sighed. Tsunade had ordered that clothes be made for the giants that would expand with them. They were created within a few days courtesy of the Akimichi clan. Sasuke had spurned wearing a shirt as he worked, his muscular upper body glistening with the sweat of the afternoon. Sasuke had an annoyed look on his face and said, \"Shut up loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto growled up at Sasuke but found himself on his back as Sasuke pushed him over and pressed his foot on him. Sakura jumped up and shouted, \"Sasuke stop that! You two haven't seen each other for three days, so the first thing you do is fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke pressed a little harder and said, \"He can get out of this and he knows it. He's too much of a coward to fight me on even terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flailed and shoved against Sasuke's toes, trying in vain to dislodge the foot. He shouted, \"Shut up! I could beat you anytime, anywhere, any size! Just name it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura growled in exasperation and said, \"No! I won't have this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke stooped down and grabbed Sakura. \"Don't worry Sakura. This won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke let Naruto up and walked over to the training field. Naruto wasted no time in jumping up and chasing after him. Once they were in the center of the field Sasuke said, \"Okay here's how it is. You can be any size between your current one and mine and you can fight using any means necessary. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had no idea what he meant by \"any size\" but didn't much care. He was looking forward to pounding Sasuke even though he was so much bigger than him. Sasuke set Sakura down and said, \"Better get somewhere safe Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura knew she couldn't stop this so she ran a little way away and shouted, \"I'm still against this! Naruto just got out of the hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both ignored her. She crossed her arms and tapped her foot angrily. She didn't like this one bit. Naruto didn't even know he could change his size! He was so angry, she didn't even know if he could concentrate enough to change. The two boys stood staring each other down as Sakura dwelt on these thoughts. Suddenly, Naruto charged, making ten clones that jumped to various points on Sasuke and attacked. With a few swipes, Sasuke destroyed them all. He smirked and said, \"Is that it loser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by a long shot Sasuke!\" Naruto shouted, making more clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would win this fight?</span></div></div>",

He can't even drink ramen without burning himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that was only once Sasuke and Konohamaru bumped into me!\" Naruto defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he isn't,\" Kakashi said, \"Naruto's just suffering the affects of a severe trauma.  And you were stupid to fight him as he is.  He did after all save you from Iruka.\"  Sasuke just glared even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would someone please tell me how they're so big after shrinking?\" Naruto asked, \"I mean, I remember some of the fight with Kakashi.  Ero-sensei distracted him long enough by poking his sharigan eye with a sharp sword.  Then I beat Kakashi and all I could here was an insane laughter.  I can't remember anything until I accidentally stepped on Sakura this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding right?\" Sasuke asked, \"You help save the village and you don't even remember it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, let me say this once and only once, don't go fighting Naruto or anyone else.  We are shinobi of the Leaf.  We are allies, comrades and friends.  Petty jealousy would only work against us.  So drop it,\" Kakashi said, \"Now get back to helping Shino rebuild the Ichiraku shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sasuke said, angry, but not willing to tussle with a man almost 9 times his size.  He left the field and Kakashi shrunk back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so we can grow to what our highest height was?\" Naruto asked, \"Sakura, why didn't you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to, when we got here to train.  Out here, you can learn to control it without much worry.  If I told you back in the Village, you might of tried and made a bigger mess,\" Sakura explained.  Naruto blinked.  The image of him growing to insane heights.  His feet alone would of destroyed parts of the village easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Naruto said, \"Now why did you lie about the ramen?!\"  Sakura and Kakashi now blinked.  Naruto sounded more angry at the fact his favorite ramen shop was gone more than not telling him he could grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said the Ichiraku's ramen,\" Sakura said, \"I was planning on my house after we trained.\"  It took a great deal of effort, but Sakura didn't blush at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let me try growing and start training!\" Naruto yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Sakura said, \"You're max height is over 300 feet tall!  I can't train with you unless you're under seven feet.  If you try going that big while we practice other things before the growing part, forget about the ramen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Naruto said, \"Anything for you.  After all, I am on a mission to protect you with my life.\"  Sakura turned and walked away towards a training post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now let's start with some warm-ups.\" Sakura said, her face very red.  Naruto followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" Kakashi thought, \"I'm just happy Sakura thought of the ramen bribe.  I hope she has enough for even the normal size Naruto.\"  Kakashi departed the field to inform Tsunade of Sasuke's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Tsunade's office, she was reading a note which spoke of movement on their western front by some people in black cloaks with red clouds on them.  \"Not good,\" was all she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have to stay put in the center of the targets! You can only hit certain targets by making the kunai bounce off each other. That way you train body and improve your coordination at the same time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no problem!\" Naruto said, putting away all but five kunai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a look around at all the targets and stood in the middle of them. With a few tosses he hit the first few targets. Then, using the last three kunai, he threw one between two targets, then launched the second one against the first driving it into the target while flinging the first into the air. With the last kunai he knocked the second kunai into a target on the ground. The last kunai was thrown with such force that even after knocking the second kunai down it sped on course into the last target. Sakura looked impressed. She hadn't expected Naruto to do so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Naruto!\" she said, happy that he had beat the test on his first try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sakura!\" Naruto said, a slight blush pinking his cheeks. He would never tell Sakura that he had seen Sasuke doing a similar exercise once and had started using it himself until he was perfect at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's have do some combat training.\" Sakura said, pointing at a group of dummies that had been set up. \"Just do whatever you want to take out those training dummies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it Sakura!\" Naruto said, creating a group of Shadow Clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura watched as Naruto obliterated the dummies in a flurry of punches, kicks, and shurikens. Soon, only splinters remained. Sakura was starting to see that Naruto hadn't lost any of his old touch even after three days of inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now I want you to fight your Shadow Clones for awhile. Keep fighting until you only have a quarter of your chakra left.\" Sakura instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and created about thirty clones. Sakura jumped clear as the many Narutos started beating each other down. It took about an hour before the clones disappeared and Naruto was left panting and sweating. He grinned and said, \"There! No problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled and said, \"Now you have to fight me! I won't go easy on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cheered and said, \"You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto charged forward and started engaging Sakura in close combat. Even with only a quarter of his chakra left, Naruto was a powerful opponent. Sakura pulled out a kunai and slashed upward, forcing Naruto back long enough for Sakura to make a few hand signs and throw a pink haze around the battlefield. Naruto watched as Sakura disappeared into the pink mist, flower petals flowing around the area. He wasn't sure what to do as Sakura suddenly charged from behind and punched him the head, turning to kick him in the back of the knee, forcing Naruto to the ground. Naruto jumped back up and saw that Sakura had disappeared again into the mist. Naruto remembered seeing or hearing something about this before...then he remembered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is genjutsu!\" Naruto thought. \"I just have to find a way to release it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held still and waited until Sakura charged again. This time, Naruto turned and grabbed Sakura by the arm, kneeing her in the stomach and elbowing her in the back, slamming her into the ground. Instantly the genjutsu disappeared. Naruto saw Sakura groaning on the ground and said, \"Oh crap! I'm sorry Sakura! I just got carried away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura got to her feet and said, \"It's okay Naruto. I just need to train more if I'm going to keep up with you and Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two genin rested for about fifteen minutes before Sakura said, \"Alright there's just one more thing you need to do. You need to learn to control your growth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jumped up and shouted, \"Yes! Yes! I've been waiting for this! How does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura remembered what Kakashi and Sasuke had said, \"Just concentrate and build up chakra in your body. Growing will be instinctual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeated these instructions to Naruto who said, \"Okay! Here I go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto concentrated on growing, Kakashi was entering the Hokage's Mansion.</span></div></div>",

She was breathing hard.  Naruto wasn't the only one to not train in a few days.  Sakura was busy helping Tsunade check over the others and make sure the clothes were ready.  Naruto, however, was doing fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, you should take a rest,\" he said, \"You don't have to push yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I want to get better as well,\" Sakura said.  She pulled out some kunia and aimed at a tree and started. \"Right on target,\" she said.  Naruto barely aimed and threw, hitting right next to Sakura's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Naruto said, \"That's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all of you giants have better eyesight now, as well as chakra control and overall stamina,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This rules,\" Naruto said, \"It's sad you couldn't have this gift as well.

It's easy to just blast yourself up to over 300 feet tall, but takes finesse to reach a size between your standard height and your max height. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" Naruto said, standing up and positively quivering with excitement. \"Can I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and Naruto concentrated on growing. Within seconds his body was bulking up at an alarming rate, his jump suit stretching to contain it. Sakura shaded her eyes and looked up as Naruto passed ten feet, then twenty, then thirty, stopping at thirty five feet. Sakura nodded and shouted, \"Good work Naruto! Keep it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and concentrated again, continuing his rise up into the heavens. As Naruto and Sakura trained, they had no idea they were being watched. Hinata had been worried about Naruto since she had heard about this whole situation. She had been gone on a mission withe Neji when it had all happened and had come back to find Naruto hospitalized. She had visited him several times over the course of his invalidity, dropping off gifts of medicine which Tsunade politely accepted on Naruto's behalf. When she had heard he was out, she had searched the village high and low to find him. Now that she had she was too shy to approach him. Especially since Sakura was there. She knew that Sakura liked Sasuke, but had seemed to be paying more attention to Naruto, only leaving his side when he was out to tend to other patients with Tsunade or Shizune. Hinata wanted to talk to Naruto if even for a minute, but knew she'd never get the nerve to. She sighed as she watched, wondering what was going to happen with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata watched Sakura and Naruto, Kakashi was strolling through town looking for his new team. Asuma had been easy to find, since he was working right outside the Hokage's Mansion. He had been at his full ten foot height and was helping Kiba fix a building. Kakashi had explained the mission and Asuma left Kiba grumbling that he had to finish the job himself. Finding Iruka and Shikamaru proved easy as well since they were both working at the same apartment, both at their full heights. Iruka saw the two Jonin coming and said, \"Hey Kakashi! Asuma! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi said, \"Business I'm afraid. The Hokage has a mission for all of us. That includes you Shikamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned and said, \"It's not bad enough I have to spend all my time working, now she wants me to go on a mission? What a drag...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka shrank himself down to normal size and said, \"What's the mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently four members of Akatsuki have been spotted near the borders of the country and they appear to be heading for the Leaf Village.\" Asuma said. \"Our mission is to investigate what they're up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka laughed and said, \"That shouldn't be too hard. All we have to do is grow and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no.\" Kakashi interrupted. \"She doesn't want us revealing our secret yet and we're not to reveal our full heights even if we get into a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Iruka said. \"Well that makes things a little more difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only reconnaissance, so we probably won't be getting into a fight.\" Asuma said. He turned to Shikamaru and said, \"Shrink already Shikamaru. We've got to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru yawned and said, \"Nah, I don't think so. That mission sounds like a snoozer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma sighed and said, \"Now is not the time to be lazy Shikamaru. Now come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shook his head and said, \"Sorry Asuma-sensei but I really don't want any part in this. I'm sure the Hokage wouldn't mind finding someone else to go in my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow, I don't think she'd be too happy if she knew you were planning on disobeying a direct order.\" Kakashi said, imagining Tsunade's reaction to the news if they were to report it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Shikamaru seemed to be ignoring them all now. This wasn't going to be easy.  </span></div></div>",

Asuma and Iruka exchanged glances.  This was a side of Kakashi neither ever wanted to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the training field, Naruto was still growing and occasionally shrinking in different amounts.  He now stood 94 feet tall.  Hinata was watching from behind some trees with her Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's amazing,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Sakura, back up,\" Naruto said, \"I want to try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" Sakura asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to jump and shrink,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why?\" Sakura asked.  She had known Naruto to try some crazy things, but this she just didn't get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to see how much higher I'll go if I shrink after launching with these powerful legs,\" Naruto explained, \"I mean, if I can keep the same speed, can you imagine what that would be like for me running at 300 feet and diving into someone at 50 feet tall?  The speed from the hit would be stronger, wouldn't it?\"  Sakura's mouth hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, that's brilliant,\" Sakura said, \"And a great strategy to use if you need to fight again.\"  Sakura backed up to the tree line, near where Hinata was.  Naruto took a deep breath and launched himself high into the sky and shrunk to 20 feet tall  during the upwards flight.  The high point of his jump was increased greatly.  He positioned himself into a dive and before he struck, flipped into a feet first landing.  Everything in 200 yards shook violently.  Naruto was actually knee deep in dirt.  Sakura nearly screamed from the shaking, but heard some noise behind her.  Once the world stopped she looked behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura, how was that?\" Naruto asked, smiling.  He looked and saw Sakura wasn't  where she was.  \"Sakura?\" he called again, worried he might of hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all right,\" Sakura said, \"I'm just looking over Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata's here?\" Naruto asked, pulling his legs out and walking over.  Sakura carefully pulled a fainted Hinata out from behind the tree line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must of bumped her head from that quake you made,\" Sakura said.  Naruto looked down on the two tiny girls.  He gently picked up Sakura and Hinata in his two hands.  Sakura went to his shoulder and Hinata went to his lap after he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she's all right,\" Naruto said, looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably fine,\" Sakura said stiffly.  Hinata began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what happened?\" she thought, \"One minute I was in a tree, next I'm on this hard stuff.\"  Her eyes blinked open and she saw Naruto looking down on her.  His chest right next to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata,\" Naruto said, \"You all right?\"  Hinata began to blush and her heart rate sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm fine,\" Hinata said, \"I'm glad to see you're well, after what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Naruto said, oblivious to Hinata's subconscious actions.  Sakura wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened just now?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made an earthquake,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was a really interesting move,\" Sakura said, scooting over to Naruto's head, \"You came up with a bunch of great moves during the incident.  Some of which saved my life.\"  Sakura then did something a bit bold.  She gave Naruto a thank you kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had blushed a bit from Sakura's kind words, but when she kissed him, it took all his self restraint not to jump up again, since Hinata was on his lap.  Hinata however felt both jealousy and sadness when she saw the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let go that easily,\" Hinata thought, glaring at Sakura.  Sakura met the glare with  one that read she understood and wouldn't back down from Naruto.  'Naruto,\" Hinata said, \"I'm really glad you're all right,\" Hinata said, \"Feel free to come by my house if you want to talk about your experiences.\"  She rose off his lap and got off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hinata,\" Naruto said, \"Maybe I will tomorrow.  I'm heading to Sakura's for dinner tonight.\"  Hinata's smile froze, but her eyes went wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you have a nice evening,\" Hinata said before leaving.  Inner Sakura gave an huge laugh for that victory just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that!\" Inner Sakura screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was very sad now and ran on.</span></div></div>",

The pair talked about various things as they made their way to Sakura's house. They talked about the other members of their team, the state of the village, the fact that Orochimaru was finally gone, what the other giants were doing with their time, and what kind of ramen they wanted to make. Finally, they reached Sakura's house. Her parents were both out leaving the house to themselves. Sakura pulled out a pot, a ladle, and the ingredients for ramen, namely noodles, seasonings, and pieces of meat. She turned to Naruto and said, \"You just sit tight and relax Naruto. I'm going to make you all the ramen you can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! You rock Sakura!\" Naruto cheered, hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled and started filling the pot with water. As she started making ramen, Shikamaru was meeting with the other members of the team, ready to head out and spy on the Akatsuki against his will. They all walked to the gates and Kakashi turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, before we go I want to be clear on a few things. We all know the nature of the mission correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just trying to find out what the Akatsuki are doing so close to the village.\" Shikamaru said, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Kakashi said, nodding in Shikamaru's direction. \"That means no fighting unless absolutely necessary. If we do find ourselves in a fight we shouldn't use our giant  powers at all. If we're backed into a corner and have no choice, we shouldn't grow bigger than ten feet since that's Asuma's max size. It'll give the illusion that we can only grow to ten feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Everyone said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi nodded again and said, \"Alright. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach ninja took off in a different direction, radios on standby to report any sighting of the Akatsuki to the other members of the team. In less dangerous areas of the village, Sakura was finishing making the first batch of ramen for Naruto. She poured the steaming pot of noodles and broth into a bowl and set the bowl down in front of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go! Pork and beef for the first bowl.\" Sakura said, handing Naruto a pair of chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sakura!\" Naruto exclaimed, eagerly digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura watched Naruto gobble up the noodles with insane speed, heading back to the stove to make more. By the time Naruto was done with the first bowl of noodles, Sakura was ready dumping a new batch of noodles into the still hot broth with some shrimp and soy sauce. This went on for three more bowls, Naruto famished after training so hard. Finally, he was done and Sakura was able to eat a bowl herself. When they were both done eating, Sakura started cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help Sakura.\" Naruto said, moving next to her at the sink and drying dishes as she washed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Naruto.\" Sakura said gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem!\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed happily and glanced over at Naruto. Not only was he being protective, but he was actually helping her do chores! This was something she could get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two genin cleaned up after themselves, Team Kakashi continued to scour the areas outside the village, hoping to catch even a glimpse of the Akatsuki. So far they were operating under the assumption that the Akatsuki didn't know they were being tailed. But what if they did know? That would make it even harder to find the already elusive missing ninja. They would eventually reveal themselves if they planned to attack, but by then it would be too late. Surely someone would get hurt. With these thoughts in mind, Team Kakashi worked even harder in their search for the Akatsuki.</span></div></div>",

Back track and call for help or stay on their trail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Shikamaru, Kakashi was also lucky.  He saw and approached the other Akatsuki team and carefully listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that scroll Zetsu delivered say Sasori-sama?\" one asked the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't rush me Deidara,\" Sasori said, \"This is a complicated jutsu.  Even with that idiot Hidan being the one whose a giant, there can be problems if this is rushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably why the Leader chose you,\" Deidara said.  Sasori grunted in response, opening the scroll before him.  With his sharigan eye, Kakashi saw what the scroll was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Kakashi thought, \"They have a giant making scroll from Orochimaru's corpse.  Jiraiya wondered where that toad went to.  I guess we know the answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi silently backed off and summoned Pankun.  \"Pankun, go give Lady Tsunade this new information,\" Kakashi said, explaining what he found and how to make he decided it would be best for them to neutralize this treat now.  Pankun nodded and ran off quickly.  Kakashi tapped his radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Kakashi?\" Iruka asked.  Asuma also acknowledged.

He and Shikamaru moved in range and waited.  When Hidan and Kakuzu walked under the shadows of some trees, Shikamaru attacked, using the shadow to strengthen his hold.  Both immediately realized something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the @$%#%^$ happened!\" Hidan asked, trying to move.  Both were draining on Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I'm not going to hold them,\" Shikamaru said, wait, if I grow to a normal sized height, that would help.\"  Shikamaru then grew to 6 feet tall.  The bind was more powerful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shikamaru strengthened the bond, Asuma came down and decapitated Hidan.  The head flew off and hit a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God $%$#%%^ it!  That #$@*% hurt!\" Hidan yelled.  Asuma looked  at the talking head, while Kakuzu tried breaking the bind.  But with Hidan decapitated, Shikamaru focused his efforts on the remaining one, a shadowy hand reached up and started strangling the man.  Kakuzu saw where the bind was coming from and sent a tendril through the ground to disrupt it.  He had to hurry as he felt the hand squeeze his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Shikamaru,\" Asuma thought, while Hidan shouted obsenities and for Kakuzu to fix him.  Asuma then picked up Hidan's head.  \"So he can fix you?\" he asked before throwing Hidan's head far into the woods.  It rolled and fell into the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was getting worn from holding this guy.  \"Asuma, kill him now!\" Shikamaru said.  At that moment, a tendril shot out and almost hit Shikamaru.  He dodged at the cost of releasing his jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an interesting pair you two are,\" Kakuzu said. before he felt Asuma's blade pierce a heart of his, but the blade was still an inch from his body.  \"Wind blades, how interesting,\" Kakuzu said, \"You just killed a heart of mine.\"  Kakuzu then countered , by breathing fire on Asuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuma!\" Shikamaru yelled, moving towards his sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Iruka and Kakashi, Iruka moved into position and threw a kunia at Deidara.  The missing-nin dodged easily and both looked towards where Iruka threw it from.  But another came from another Iruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think their trying to trap us hmm,\" Deidara said as more came from random spots.  They were easily deflected by Sasori's puppet's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish they'd just attack. I hate waiting,\" Sasori said before they both sensed something behind them and saw Kakashi's lighting blade formed and he was charging at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikiri!\" Kakashi yelled as he pierced and destroyed thtail then puppet's shell.  In the shock of this attack, a clone Iruka took the scroll and got out of there.  Kakashi also poofed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were all Shadow clones?!\" Deidara yelled, \"What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went right after the scroll,\" Sasori said, standing up in his main, 'They probably know what it's for.  We should follow them and report in.\"</span></div></div>",

Asuma! We've recovered the scroll and are heading back to the village. Retreat at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru quickly touched his ear and said, \"We hear you. We're on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu grinned and said, \"Leaving so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma, burned from the sudden attack by Kakuzu, said, \"We've got pressing matter elsewhere. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu laughed and said, \"You're in no position to run. And the kid over there doesn't look like he's going to be holding out for much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru looked at Asuma and said, \"Get ready to run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma nodded and got to his feet. Kakuzu looked over at Asuma and tried to attack with his tendrils again, but Shikamaru quickly grew to ten feet and strengthened his hold on Kakuzu, a shadow hand racing up Kakuzu's body to his neck. Shikamaru held Kakuzu tight, breaking his neck. Kakuzu fell to the ground and Asumu and Shikamaru both took off heading back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both ninja were gone, Kakuzu got his feet, straightening his neck. He still had a few hearts left and it would take more than breaking his neck to finish him off. He walked over to Hidan's body and lifted it up. He slung it over his shoulder along with his bounty and started looking for Hidan's head. He slowly made his way to the river where he saw something stuck to the side of the river on a tree branch. Getting closer, Kakuzu saw that it was Hidan's head, holding against the current by biting a branch that was hanging over the river. Kakuzu grabbed it by the hair and Hidan instantly started shouting, \"It's about $%$#%%^ time!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu dropped Hidan's body and head and said, \"Quit complaining. We're both still alive after all. I can still trade in this bounty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidan snorted and said, \"Yeah, but I want to get those two! They can't just treat me like this and get away with it! I'll $%$#%%^ kill 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu rolled his eyes and pulled out a needle. He dropped Hidan's head onto his body and started sewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez! You're never careful with that damn needle!\" Hidan complained. \"It hurts like hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu said, \"How many times have we done this? Just get used to it. Would you rather I left your head in the river?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidan grumbled and said, \"Just hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kakuzu worked, Zetsu suddenly appeared out of the tree overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you ran into some trouble.\" Zetsu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were ambushed by Leaf shinobi.\" Kakuzu said. \"One of them grew to about ten feet tall. Obviously Orochimaru was busy with those scrolls of his. This might be more difficult than we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu nodded and said, \"I'm going to go check on Deidara and Sasori. Stay here for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu quickly made his way through the ground, looking for Deidara and Sasori. It didn't take long to find them. Zetsu rose out of the ground and said, \"I take it you two were ambushed as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you guess hmm?\" Deidara asked, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakuzu and Hidan were also ambushed. One of them was a giant as well. Orochimaru's jutsu must have lasting effects beyond what we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised.\" Sasori said, outside since his puppet had been destroyed by Kakashi. \"Orochimaru's Forbidden Jutsu often have many effects, some of which he's unaware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, they got the scroll from us.\" Deidara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go report to Pain about this.\" Zetsu said. \"You two find Kakuzu and Hidan. They're about two miles East of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Zetsu disappeared into the ground. Deidara sighed and said, \"This was supposed to be an easy mission. What happened to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have as much information as we should have before trying to attack.\" Sasori said. \"This is a somewhat unorganized mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should probably try to find Hidan and Kakuzu hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ninjas started heading to where Hidan and Kakuzu were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Akatsuki started to regroup, Kakashi and Iruka and met up with Asuma and Shikamaru at the gate of the Leaf Village. Shikamaru shrank back down to normal size and said, \"That's it right? We're done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Kakashi said. \"I'll deliver the scroll to the Hokage and report what we know about the Akatsuki members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm taking Asuma-sensei to the hospital.\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma grimaced and said, \"I'm find Shikamaru. I don't need to go to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru suddenly grew to twenty feet and said, \"Do you want me to carry you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma knew he was beat. He sighed and said, \"Fine, let's go to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shrank back down to normal and said, \"Glad you see it my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka laughed as he watched Shikamaru and Asuma walk away. \"Things sure are different now. I don't think I would've normally been assigned to a mission like this before. And Asuma is usually the one forcing Shikamaru to do things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kakashi said. \"I think that despite the trouble we went through with Orochimaru and these scrolls, it all turned out for the better. Even Akatsuki seems like less of a threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka stretched and said, \"I think I'll go back to rebuilding the village. See you later Kakashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi lifted a hand in response and headed toward the Hokage's Mansion.</span></div></div>",

Sasori's scroll was on it between them.  \"I don't like you changing my orders mid-mission,\" she said quietly, \"But it seems to of worked out for the best.  Two Akatsuki were neutralized and one had a dangerous weapon destroyed.   Based on your info on the puppet member, it sounds like Sasori of the Red Sand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of him,\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty ironic, you fighting him.  Since out intelligence says your father killed his parents,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's interesting,\" Kakashi said, stiffening up.  He still didn't like the mention of his father.  \"How are things going here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiraiya went off to find his toad's remains,\" Tsunade said, \"He was angry at one of them dying and feels partially to blame for the Akatsuki finding the scroll.  He's also looking for Orochimaru's old hideouts to find and probably destroy his work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kakashi said, \"And Naruto and Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, they haven't gone within 100 feet of the other,\" Tsunade said, \"Sasuke helped finish the Ichiraku and is on to some other buildings.  Naruto's been at Sakura's for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone else know the genin giants are being watched by ANBU?\" Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you, Shizune, and their senseis,\" Tsunade said, \"Though all they're really doing is being watchers and messengers to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, I doubt even some of the strongest could stop one of us,\" Kakashi said.  Tsunade raised an eyebrow when Kakashi separated himself and the other giants from the people of the Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I want you to stay on boarder patrol Kakashi,\" Tsunade said, \"Don't grow unless needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Kakashi said before disappearing.  Tsunade looked at the scroll and opened it up.  She had never gotten a chance to examine one.  But before doing so, cut a piece of it off and put it in a sealed box so they'd have a scent to track Sasori by if needed.  Tsunade went on to examine the untainted scroll in hopes of a way to make other ninja grow if need be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tsunade examined the mysterious scroll, Shizune was tending to Asuma in the hospital. He had rather severe burns down his right side since Kakuzu had singed him at close range. Shizune had cooled the burns using a special salve created from deer antlers from the Nara clan and then wrapped him up in bandages. Shizune sighed as she finished the room Asuma was staying in reeking of medicine. She turned to the door and opened it, letting Shikamaru, Ino, Choji, and Kurenai in to visit. Asuma smiled and said, \"I didn't expect so many visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you can say lying there in your condition?!?!?\" Ino shouted angrily looking like she wanted to punch her sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave him alone Ino.\" Shikamaru said. \"He's injured after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my point! When are you going to learn to be more careful?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ninjas' life is one of danger Ino, you know that.\" Asuma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that doesn't mean you have to take unnecessary risks Asuma.\" Kurenai said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma sighed and said, \"Fine, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about Asuma.\" Shizune said, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. \"Though the burns were extensive you got him here fast enough to prevent any permanent damage. With a few sessions of intense ninjutsu healing, he'll be up and about again in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sighed in relief at hearing this. Asuma tried to light a cigarette and said, \"See? Everything is going to be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai plucked the cigarette out and flung it out the open window. \"No smoking until you're out of the hospital. Show some restraint Asuma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma groaned and said, \"I'm injured! Why are you taking the one thing I enjoy away from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai frowned and said, \"You'd better be joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma hastily said, \"Of course I am! Come on, I thought it was obvious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno sighed in exasperation and said, \"Come one you two. Now that we know Asuma-sensei is okay we have to get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Choji and me have to get back to work!\" Shikamaru said, earning a smack in the head from Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai coughed and said, \"I'd better be going as well. I'll see you later Asuma. Take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma smiled and said, \"Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai smiled and said, \"You'd better be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma laid back down on his pillow and sighed, relaxing as he felt a dull throb coming from his burns. Shizune said, \"Your first session will be in just an hour Asuma. That'll take away most of the pain and help you to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma pulled out another cigarette and said, \"I've got plenty of ways to stay relaxed Shizune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune looked a little worried and said, \"Just don't let anyone catch you doing that. I'll look away this once, but this is a hospital after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma nodded and blew out a ring of smoke, watching it dissipate against the ceiling. \"This is going to be a long few days...\" He thought, drawing in on the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asuma relaxed in the hospital, Shikamaru and Choji returned to work rebuilding the village. Not too far away from where the two genin were working, Sakura and Naruto were walking through the village, talking and enjoying the day. They passed by Shikamaru and Naruto called up, \"Hey Shikamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru looked down and saw Naruto. \"Hey, you're finally awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And stronger than ever!\" Naruto said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about using some of that strength to help rebuild the village?\" Shikamaru said. \"We've all been working our butts off for the last three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Naruto said, with his arms behind his head. \"Nah! I don't feel like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed in exasperation and said, \"Don't let the Hokage catch you lazing around or you'll get whipped into work so fast you won't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said, \"Sure Shikamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair left Shikamaru and Choji to their work and continued walking through the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Sakura said. \"Maybe you should start working. I mean, even Kakashi and Iruka-sensei are rebuilding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and said, \"But that kind of work is so boring! If I do any work I want it to be a mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura knew Naruto was going to say something like that. He hated doing any kind of chore, but he was all energy when it came to a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you're going to be getting a lot more missions now that you can become a giant.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued walking, they came upon someone in the road.

Now the difference between them was extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should of been the one to have that power,\" Sasuke mumbled as he looked down the street to a break area.

Sakura looked at Naruto, waiting for some response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Sasuke, we didn't see you there,\" Naruto said, moving to the side, \"I hope you have a nice day.\"  Sasuke grinned his teeth.  He bent down and picked Naruto up by his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you're better than me?  You beat me in an unfair fight,\" Sasuke said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, let him go!\" Sakura yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfair?

I was just walking with Sakura, minding my own business when he grabbed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade rolled her eyes and said, \"Yes, and I'm sure you couldn't have possibly have said anything to set him off could you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto avoided her gaze as he said, \"Well...maybe...but he still started it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly you sound like an Academy Student! 'He started it!'. Just like a child! Is this the kind of example you want to set for the people of this village? You've been given an amazing gift through this ordeal and since getting your full power all you've done is fight with Sasuke!\" Tsunade lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt pretty bad by this point. He knew it was wrong to constantly fight with Sasuke, but he couldn't just take his insults laying down either. On the other hand, he really hadn't done much work unlike the other giants. They were all much smaller than him, yet he was the only one not working. Tsunade started shifting the mountain of loose papers on the remains of her desk and said, \"I think it's time you started working like everyone else. And as punishment for sending you crashing into my office I want you to work with Sasuke. And I mean just you and Sasuke! You both need to resolve your differences and quick! Sakura will be working in the hospital with Shizune in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned and said, \"Oh come on Grandma! Not Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shoved a paper into Naruto's large hand and said, \"Yes, with Sasuke! Now take this paper to Sasuke and both of you find some work to do. This is as good as a mission straight from the Hokage! If either of you disobey what is written on that scroll you'll both be severely punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked over the paper and saw that it was basically what Tsunade had just said, written down as a mission. Naruto sighed and said, \"Fine, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade watched him left and collapsed into her chair which had survived the impact. She rubbed her temples and muttered, \"How could this day get any worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and started looking for the scroll amongst the wreckage. After about five minutes she found it. In pieces. In all the commotion the scroll had been destroyed. It was in at least twenty different pieces, all the symbols wrecked.Tsunade saw a couple of specks of dust still on the scroll pieces and her heart started racing. She looked out the window and watched as the dust from Naruto's impact floated through the village. Scattered amongst the normal dust was, no doubt, growth dust from the scroll. Tsunade watched helplessly as the dust blew over the entire village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...\" she whispered to herself.</span></div></div>",

As he departed the Hokage Mansion, Sasuke and Sakura arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, what happened?\" Sakura asked, seeing some debris in his hair.  Sasuke shrunk down to his old size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost landed on Granny Tsunade,\" Naruto said, \"So, as punishment, Sasuke and I have to work together.\"  Sasuke's eyes went wide.  Sakura looked between the two guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh,\" Naruto said, looking at the paper.  He had forgotten to read that part.  As he reached the part of the paper, \"Until one of three things happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those would be?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'One, Jiraiya swears off peeping',\" Naruto said before adding, \"Not gonna happen.  'Two, I, Tsunade, give up drinking.'  Also not gonna happen.  'Three, until I tell you two hot headed idiots otherwise.  Now get to work or else. . .'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\" Sakura asked, slightly scared at how Naruto looked from reading the ultimatum.  He gulped and handed it to Sasuke who quickly found what was written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to shovel out all the stables in the Land of Fire with out hands,\" Sasuke read, \"She can't be serious, can she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she is,\" Naruto said, \"I've never known her to break a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be there to help,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're on hospital duty with Shizune,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's written in this order as well,\" Sasuke said, \"Fine, let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later Sakura,\" Naruto said, as he and Sasuke walked off to another section of the village.  Sakura was a little peeved at both of them for their stupidity earlier, but she still wanted to spend time with them, with Naruto.  But an order was an order and she went to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut team 7 wasn't the only one who heard this new order.  Hinata had been buying some groceries when she saw the flying Naruto crash into Tsunade's office.  She had hoped to approach him upon his leaving, but couldn't when Sasuke and Sakura approached.  Now as she watched Sakura go off in the other direction, Hinata followed her crush as he and Sasuke went to work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, the dust that was scattered had a unique trait:  it stuck together set masses.  So as it floated over the village, it would slowly descend on two unsuspecting males before the next morning would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which ones would we follow?</span></div></div>",

She knew what Tsunade was trying to accomplish with this mission for Naruto and Sasuke, but she somehow didn't think that just forcing them to spend time with each other was going to help the situation any. This kind of thing just needed to get worked out on its own. Oh well. It wasn't like she could do anything about it anyway. She turned to corner and saw Konohamaru walking toward her, rubbing his hair for some reason. He saw her and said, \"Hey! You're that forehead girl who hangs out with Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared at the boy and charged forward, punching him square in the gut, sending him to the ground. He gasped and managed to weakly ask, \"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should respect a pretty young lady you jerk!\" Sakura shouted, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru got to his feet and muttered, \"First I get covered in dust and now this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura ignored him, not hearing the part about the dust as she walked away. As Konohamaru turned the corner, adjusting his shirt, Sakura stopped and thought to herself, \"Was he taller? Must be my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed Konohamaru out of her mind and continued on her way to the hospital. She wondered what Sasuke and Naruto were doing now and how well they were getting along. As though on cue, a huge plume of dust (normal dust) appeared in the distance along with a very familiar yell of anger. Sakura sighed and said, \"I knew this wasn't going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you know what that was?\" a voice suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned and saw Neji coming out of a store, a bag in his hand. She smiled and said, \"Naruto and Sasuke are supposed to be working together. They've always had a rocky relationship but this whole giant thing just made it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji nodded and said, \"I can't say I'm too pleased with it either. I missed the whole thing because I was on a mission. Enslavement doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in, but it all appears to have worked out to the advantage of those involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura said, \"I suppose. As long as no other enemies of the village get their hands on it then everything should work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji shifted the bag in his hand and said, \"We can only hope. I've got to be going now. I have to take this home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked away and Sakura turned back to the hospital. Everything seemed to finally be settling down. She walked into the hospital and turned to the front desk. \"Excuse me, I'm supposed to be working with Shizune today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk smiled and said, \"I'm sorry only authorized medical personnel are allowed to work in this hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked surprised and said, \"But I was working in here just a few days ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded and said, \"Yes, but you were working with Lady Hokage. Unless you have some kind of proof that you're allowed to work here I can't let you get to where Shizune is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed and said, \"I do have proof, just not on me. I'll be back in a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and left the building, running to where she remembered seeing the plume of dust. That's where Sasuke and Naruto were and that's where she'd get the paper proving she was aloud to work in the hospital. She was so focused on where she was going she failed to see someone turn the corner. She ran full tilt into them and was knocked down on her butt. After looking to see who she ran into she was shocked to see a giant standing over her. But it wasn't any of the giants she knew. It was a new one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

But as Konohamaru reached down with a sadistic smile, Sakura was having trouble.  Only when the boy fell to the side, did Sakura feel relived, for the moment.  That is, until she saw her savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, on the other side of town, Naruto was glaring down at Sasuke.  \"You could of waited for me to get out of the way!\" Naruto said.  He knelt down from his 30 foot stature to Sasuke's 15 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You survived being thrown through a wall, I thought a building collapsing on you would be no problem,\" Sasuke said coolly.  He looked at the rubble around them.  Tsunade had assigned them to a demolition crew to take down old buildings.  It was her plan for them to work out their anger on the buildings that would be coming down already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Naruto said, \"Look, we can't keep fighting forever.  Why don't we just respect each other for the other's strengths?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  You are smarter than me in terms of books, but I have a stronger will to keep my promises,\" Naruto said, shrinking to 15 feet tall and holding out his hand, \"We make a good team.  Always have, once we got past our differences before.  Why don't we continue with that?\"  Sasuke looked at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the heck does he come up with these speeches?\" Sasuke thought, \"But he's right.  We need to reform our friendship or we'll both suffer.\"  But a sudden quake from another section of the village made them look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at the giant that saved her.  But she was still shocked at seeing Neji standing 12 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Konohamaru yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to leave her alive to use as bait,\u201d Neji said as he grew again to 20 ft tall.  Konohamaru also grew to 15 feet.  Neji turned to Sakura and picked her up with ease.  \u201cLet\u2019s get going.  Master should be pleased,\u201d Neji said before he grew to 30 feet tall and running off.  Konohamaru grew as well and followed, crashing through a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!,\" Naruto said, staring where Sakura was.  \"Neji's huge with Sakura?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this would be an excuse to stop this work,\" Sasuke said, watching as the two new giants run out of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Naruto said, before they charged off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Sasuke chased after the new giants and Sakura, eager to catch up with them and stop them. Neji glanced behind and saw the opposition coming. He turned to Konohamaru and said, \"Stay behind and occupy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru nodded and stopped, turning to face Naruto and Sasuke. Sasuke quickly grew to his full height of twenty feet while Naruto grew to match him. Konohamaru smirked and said, \"I can do better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth genin watched in surprise as Konohamaru grew bigger and bigger reaching fifty five feet in height! Naruto glanced at Sasuke and said, \"You attack low, I'll attack high!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke nodded as Naruto grew to match Konohamaru. Konohamaru looked surprised but quickly recovered and said, \"If you want Sakura back you're going to have to go through me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto answered with a quick, \"Shadow Clone Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Konohamaru was surrounded by Naruto clones, some as big as Naruto, some as small as Sasuke, and a few in between. Konohamaru pulled out several kunai and tossed them at the clones, smiling as they exploded one by one into clouds. His smile quickly faded as he felt a burning sensation on his leg. He kicked out and knocked Sasuke back who had used a Fireball Jutsu on him. Even though Sasuke was more than a match for Konohamaru when they were normal size, the sheer size difference was all it took to reduce Sasuke from unbeatable opponent to mere annoyance. It wasn't a fact that was lost on Sasuke, but there was nothing that could be done about it. He threw out shuriken attached to strings and surround Konohamaru. Bringinig the strings together he sent fire down them searing Konohamaru from all sides. While Konohamaru was busy trying to avoid the fire, Naruto powered up a Rasengan and slammed it into the young boy's chest. Instantly he was thrown back slamming through building after building until he came to a stop about a hundred feet away. It didn't look like he was getting back up, but he wasn't shrinking either. Naruto had attained his size through Orochimaru's chakra while Konohamaru had got his through Sasori though neither of the two boys knew this. As such, Konohamaru was merely knocked out, but still a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, both Naruto and Sasuke searched for Neji, but he had disappeared with Sakura. Naruto smashed a building nearby angrily and said, \"I can't believe we let him get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sighed and said, \"Well there's nothing we can do about it right now. We should report this to the Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrunk back down to his normal size and said, \"Yeah, Grandma Tsunade will probably want to know about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grabbed Naruto's arm as he started walking toward the Hokage Mansion. \"What are you doing Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of us needs to stay here and watch Konohamaru in case he wakes up. You can get a lot bigger than I can and you may need to. Just because he only grew up to fifty five feet now doesn't mean he can't get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and said, \"I sure hope neither of them can get too much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto ran over to Konohamaru's unconscious body. He looked at the burn marks and the spiral mark on his chest where the Rasengan had hit and felt bad. He knew that Konohamaru couldn't help himself and was being forced to fight against his will, but that didn't mean it was right to hurt him so much. Hopefully they'd be able to keep him under control and they wouldn't have to fight anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke made his way to the Hokage Mansion, Neji, Sakura in hand, was making his way to Sasori and Deidara who had found Hidan and Kakuzu and were waiting for Zetsu to return. Hidan glared at Kakuzu and said, \"You just had to bring a corpse with you on this mission didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu sighed and said, \"I didn't bring this on the mission. I killed him ON the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it's starting to @#$%&amp;* smell!\" Hidan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori quickly broke in and said, \"Stop it. The last thing we need now is you two fighting. Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu turned to Sasori and said, \"Well it's not like it can get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, Neji came crashing through the trees, stopping in front of the four Akatsuki members. Deidara turned to Kakuzu and said, \"You had to say something didn't you, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji simply lowered Sakura to the ground who fell to her knees, weak after the frightening journey. After setting Sakura down, Neji crossed his arms and said, \"What is your order master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara looked from Neji to Sasori before asking, \"Do you know this giant ninja Sasori-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori shook his head and said, \"It looks like the Konohagakure ninja somehow lost control of the scroll they stole from us. Its worked in our favor though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu smiled and said, \"Looks like you don't have to do any work after all Hidan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidan shrugged and said, \"Whatever. It didn't really matter to me anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara said, \"What are you going to have him do Sasori-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori thought about and said, \"I'm not sure yet. Perhaps we should wait for Zetsu to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother?\" Hidan said. \"We have a great weapon right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu snorted and said, \"Yes and how many giants does the Leaf Ninja have? With only one we wouldn't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara shrugged and said, \"I don't know. We should at least find out what we can do with this one. Maybe there's more than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori nodded and said, \"Very well. We'll test this ninjas' power while we wait for Zetsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura just watched all this in horror. She was trapped, hoping that Naruto or Sasuke or anyone could come and save her. She didn't know why Neji had brought her here since the red haired ninja (Sasori she thought they had said) hadn't given him any orders. What was going to happen next?</span></div></div>",

But why didn't Naruto grow from beating Konohamaru?  Unless they can only grow from dust of the same maker,\" Tsunade said quietly to herself.  Suddenly, Sasuke appeared outside the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage, Neji and. . .\" Sasuke started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.  I saw the whole thing,\" Tsunade said, her gave turned to the 6 foot ninja before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they took Sakura as well,\" Sasuke said.  Tsunade looked at Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains why Naruto and Sasuke went after Neji and the boy,\" Tsunade thought.  \"Ironic,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This entire situation is your and Naruto's fault,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sasuke asked.  He could understand the escape part as they were too focused on Konohamaru, but everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dust that made them grow came from a scroll Kakashi retrieved from the Akatsuki.  I was examining it when you sent Naruto to me earlier.  As a  result of Naruto's entrance, the scroll was destroyed and the dust released.  So, this is your fault.\"  Sasuke gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events,\" came a voice from behind both of them.  Tsunade turned and saw Jiraiya looking grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found the toad I take it?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its remains.  Something ate it and spit it up,\" Jiraiya said, \"And now we have two more rouge ninja giants?  What a week.\"  Tsunade closed her eyes.  She knew they had to get Neji and Konohamaru back to normal.  They also had to stop them from meeting up with their master.  Obviously, this master was different from Orochimaru, seeing as Neji and Konohamaru worked together verses fighting.  But with a different master, they couldn't be shrunk by victory from any of the good giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiraiya, I want you to lead the rescue mission,\" Tsunade said, \"But first, get Shizune.  we'll need to fix Konohamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Jiraiya said before disappearing.  Tsunade glared at Sasuke before running off to where Naruto was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood at 200 feet tall, pressing down on the now 70 feet tall Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, why did this have to happen?\" Naruto thought before he saw this prisoner wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Naruto?  What happened?  Why am I huge?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You don't remember?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just remember walking past your girlfriend, then waking up here,\" Konohamaru said.  Naruto wasn't sure whether to believe him or not.  But Konohamaru suddenly grew ten feet and Naruto's lacking hold was broken before he could get another hold.  Konohamaru raced from beneath the mammoth Naruto.  Naruto only holding the remains of the boy's scarf.  He was about to give chase when he felt some pressure on his toe.  He looked down and saw Tsunade and Sasuke below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade watched as Naruto shrunk to 8 feet tall.  \"Naruto, you idiot!  Why did you let him escape?!\" Tsunade yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he started acting normal and couldn't remember what happened.  The others turned normal after being beat, so I wasn't sure,\" Naruto confessed, \"But I did grab his scarf so we could track him with Kakashi-sensei.\"  Tsunade and Sasuke looked at Naruto.  Both could see him being tricked the first time, seeing as they wouldn't of been sure themselves.  But both saw the second part as an accident.  But someting caught Tsunade's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see the scarf,\" Tsunade said.  Naruto handed it over.  It was fine,and not much left, but it was there:  Sasori's dust.  Suddenly Kakashi, Jiraiya, Shizune, and Maito Guy appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my precious Neji, what happened to you?\" Guy yelled.  Tsunade looked at the assembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three can't grow, but of them, Shizune and Jiraiya will be needed.  Guy can't do much to help.  Kakashi and Naruto will probably be needed.  Sasuke won't want to be left out.  This will be trouble,\" Tsunade thought.  \"All right, we'll follow them with Konohamaru's scent.  I'm going to be examining the dust, so Shizune, I'll need you to go with them to operate on the two giants and Jiraiya to seal it.  Kakashi will lead and Naruto will assist.  Sasuke, though you're the smallest of the three, you're also one of the fastest.  You're objective will be to get Sakura out of there.  Everyone else, subdue those two giants,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Guy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't grow.   You'd most likely be a hazard to the team,\" Tsunade said coldly.  \"Now get going!\" Tsunade said as Kakashi picked up some tattered remains of Konohamaru's clothing.  He summoned Pankun and they were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with some extrasensory radar, Konohamaru knew exactly where to find his master and ran that way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the other ninjas mobilized, Sasori was busy making more scrolls to create more slaves with. Deidara, Kakuzu, and Hidan were standing guard around him while Neji kept a long distance lookout using his Byakugan to help. Deidara, being the closest to Sasori, asked, \"How many scrolls are you making Sasori-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori, his concentration focused completely on the scrolls, said, \"Only three. There's no point in overdoing it right now. This jutsu is a lot more draining than I had anticipated. I won't be of much help in a fight after this so it'll up to you three to protect me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara smiled and said, \"What about the big guy, hmm? Personally I think he'll be of more help than those other two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad they can't hear you say that.\" Sasori said, sealing the last scroll. \"They'll be fighting all over again if they could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori stood up with all three scrolls, his breathing ragged. He tossed one to Deidara and said, \"The Leaf Shinobi aren't going to take this situation lightly. I believe they'll come looking for us again. That's why you, Kakuzu, and Hidan are going to take these scrolls and use them to make three more giants. It can by any shinobi of your choosing. No matter who it is, they'll fall under my control. If worse comes to worse, try using the scroll on one of the smaller giants that Orochimaru created. Normally the two forces, Orochimaru's and my own, would clash and the jutsu would be useless. However, if some of the giants changed very little from Orochimaru, then my jutsu should override his and put them under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara sighed and said, \"This is becoming more and more complicated as time goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't complain.\" Sasori said coldly. \"Just hurry up and do your mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara nodded and left, heading toward the Leaf Village. He started running through names in his head, wondering who to use the scroll on. \"No kids.\" He thought. \"They won't have enough skill to contend with the likes of Kakashi. And definitely not that Maito Guy person. He's way to annoying even if he's on our side. Hmm...Who should I choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Deidara headed toward the village, Sasori handed out the other scrolls to Kakuzu and Hidan with the same instructions as Deidara. After they both left Sasori sat on the ground, his body weak after using the Forbidden Jutsu so many times. Before he had time to take more than a few breaths, however, Neji said, \"Someone's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori quickly said, \"Then get ready to fight them. If you're overwhelmed, then escape immediately with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji nodded and crouched into a fighting stance. Luckily for them, it was nothing to worry about. Konohamaru came charging into the clearing at ten feet tall, small enough not to be seen, but big enough to move fast. He stopped in front of Sasori and said, \"I managed to escape master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori frowned and said, \"A kid eh? Better then nothing I suppose. Hyuga boy. When the other Leaf ninja arrive, fight them but don't worry about escaping. The boy will help me get away if things look grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys nodded and started growing, Neji to a fighting size, and Konohamaru to an escaping size. Sasori recovered enough to throw out a few chakra strings and attach them to Konohamaru. The boy was going to be able to put up a fight only if Sasori controlled him. Neji would fair well on his own. Now there was nothing left to do, but wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, hidden from sight, was bound and gagged by Sasori. They were going to keep her as insurance in the coming fight. If need be, they'd use her as a human shield to escape. The other ninja wouldn't dare hurt a comrade.</span></div></div>",

Kakashi blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Naruto would come up with that.  But as long as Neji and Konohamaru are growing and dangerous, it might be useful,\" Kakashi thought.  Shizune looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I can do this,' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi, we're nearing them,\" Pankun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Sasuke, hold up for a minute,\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Sasuke asked as they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I'm going to hide in your shadow,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, doing this will make us seem weaker than we are,\" Kakashi said, as Jiraiya preformed the jutsu, \"And if Neji and Konohamaru retain their memories of the past few days, both will know Naruto's and my top reaching sizes.  So we'll need an ace in the hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Sasuke said before they started moving again.  They moved at their fastest speeds, but once they got in Neji's vision ragne, that speed was less effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four Leaf ninja are coming,\" Neji said, \"Kakashi, Naruto, Uchiha Sasuke, and a medical ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the others?\" Sasori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're taking a longer way around and not following the paths Konohamaru and I made,\" Neji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready then,\" Sasori commanded.  Both slaves took fighting positions.  Neji was now closing in on 100 feet tall.  He doubted any strike could pierce him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto took the lead, he made a massive amount of Shadow clones and threw them the giant Neji.  Neji prepared to defend when all of the clones grew to massive size and landed on Neji, overwhelming him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori watched the attack.  \"Boy, watch the back,\" Sasori said, realizing the similarity to the attack before.  But it was too late, and Sasuke came from the back woods.  Konohamaru readied to attack when Jiraiya came from Sasuke's shadow and summoned a toad to attack Konohamaru, while Sasuke looked for Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Neji fended off the last Naruto, who were all clones, he stood looking Kakashi at eye level.  In a moment, Kakshi used his sharigan on Neji to slow him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Naruto was staying with Shizune to protect and wait for sasuke to get back with Sakura.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasori knew when he was beat. He had no idea the Leaf shinobi would launch such a ruthless attack from all sides. It was a miscalculation on Sasori's part and one he would now have to deal with. He twitched his fingers and Konohamaru ran over to him, picking him up. With his other hand, Sasori shot out more chakra strings that attached to Sakura and pulled her out of her hiding spot and into Sasori's grasp. Directing the one hundred foot tall Konohamaru, Sasori punted Sasuke out of the way, the size difference once again canceling any need for finesse or planning, and escaped as fast as he could, the giant toad giving chase. Neji, however, wasn't so lucky. After dealing with the Naruto clones and getting caught in Kakashi's Sharingan there wasn't much left to do except try to escape. Unfortunately, with Konohamaru being left to the toad, every ninja present was focusing on Neji. Within seconds, attacks rained down from both sides, Naruto with his Shadow Clones, Sasuke was fire techniques, Shizune with poison gas, and Kakashi with regular close quarters combat. While Neji was getting pummeled, Jiraiya was drawing out a sealing scroll, ready to catch Sasori's chakra when the healing began. After a few more minutes of ceaseless pounding on Neji, Naruto was able to use Shadow Clones to pin him down while Shizune was lifted onto his chest to perform the healing jutsu. It was difficult, but she drew on Sasuke's chakra to finish the operation, hunting down and pulling out all of Sasori's chakra. Though it was powerful, his chakra did not contain the same poisonous malevolence that Orochimaru's had. Jiraiya caught the chakra in his scroll and sealed it up, stowing it in a bag separate from the one he was using to hold the scrolls of Orochimaru's chakra. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as Neji shrunk back down to his normal size, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around in the aftermath of the battle and said, \"Crap! That other guy got away with Sakura and Konohamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya smiled at him and said, \"Hey, don't worry about them! I sent a toad after him so he'll be coming back in a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though on cue, the toad returned to Jiraiya's side. Jiraiya yelled up to it, \"Alright, did you get him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toad croaked and shook his head. Apparently Konohamaru had gotten away. Jiraiya swore loudly. \"I underestimated him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's nothing we can do about it now.\" Kakashi said. \"Let's take Neji back to the hospital and report to the Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was reluctant with this plan. He wanted to chase that guy down now and get his friends back. But he was pretty worn out by his fight with Neji and he wanted to make sure he was going to be okay too. So the group left, ready to track down Sasori again when they were better prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Leaf ninja made their way back to the village, Konohamaru had stopped running and set Sasori and Sakura down in a large clearing, far enough away from the village to be safe. Sasori was almost fully recovered and pulled out a scroll. He had been defeated soundly and was now down one servant. Even if Deidara, Hidan, and Kakuzu made more, they wouldn't be enough. The Leaf Village had too many giants on their side. The only way to tilt things back into the Akatsuki's favor would be to make whatever servants he had now, bigger and stronger. It didn't help that his bodyguard was a mere Academy Student with barely any jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't matter though.\" Sasori said to himself as he finished drawing the last symbols on the scroll. \"After he gets this dose of power, no one will be able to match him in size or strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's heart was pounding as she watched Sasori work. This was starting to look very, very bad. It was bad enough having only Orochimaru to worry about. Now they had to try and keep track of at least three people. And she knew there were more members in Akatsuki. The only question was where exactly were they?</span></div></div>",

Eventually Kakuzu got sick of listening to Hidan yell and sewed his mouth shut. After a few hours of travel the Sand Village was finally in sight. Deidara landed next to Kakuzu and said, \"Alright hand me your scrolls. I'm going to find the target and seal the scrolls into three low level bombs. I'll set the bombs off around the target and he'll get covered in the dust. He'll no doubt then seek out Sasori and we'll have three giants on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara counted Neji not yet knowing he was being healed as he spoke. But Kakuzu nodded and handed over the two scrolls he had. He brought Hidan's body over to his head, which he had just dropped on the ground, and said, \"I'll start sewing Hidan back together. Don't be gone too long or I can't guarantee Hidan will be whole when you come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara rolled his eyes and said, \"I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped back onto the clay bird and flew it up high into the sky over the village readying the bombs and searching for Kankuro. It didn't take as long as Deidara would've thought. He was dressed in the casual wear of the Sand Village and without the usual markings on his face since he wasn't currently on a mission. Focusing in on him, Deidara saw that he was buying maintenance tools and spare parts. Deidara remembered that he was a Pupper Master and was no doubt buying these items to help repair his puppets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's using Sasori-sama's puppets if I remember correctly.\" Deidara thought. \"Mere toys compared with Sasori-sama's latest work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeidara swooped around and hovered when he was over Kankuro. Taking careful aim, he dropped the bombs around him. Deidara watched as Kankuro stopped in his tracks as he saw the bombs fall around him, exploding on impact. The dust burst free from the destroyed scrolls and gravitated toward the nearest male which was Kankuro, covering him in three full scrolls of growth dust. Deidara grinned and said, \"Bulls eye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKankuro coughed and looked around wildly, wondering where that attack had come from. He cursed himself for not bringing his puppets along with him. He wasn't expecting to get attacked while on a quick trip to pick up parts for Crow. All these thoughts were wiped away as his body slowly started to grow. As he passed ten feet in height, his clothes getting incredibly tight on his body, his mind had only one thought: Get to Master Sasori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, and still growing, Kankuro headed to Sasori and Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kankuro started his journey, with Deidara, Hidan, and Kakuzu in pursuit, Neji was starting to awaken from his healing sleep. His eyes opened to find himself surrounded by ninja all looking ready to attack. He said, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune approached slowly and said, \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji looked at Shizune and said, \"I'm feeling fine. Can someone please tell me what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room breathed a sigh of relief and Shizune said, \"Don't worry about it Neji.

Gaara, his sister and their sensie are on their way here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Tsunade said, \"Now they're back to two giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets better,\" Jiraiya said, \"They found the remains of three scrolls where Kankuro grew.\"  Tsunade's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inform Kakashi and have him meet the arriving team,\" Tsunade said, \"And don't open that door.\"  Jiraiya looked at Tsunade.  Her tone wasn't one he had heard in many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning?\" Jiriaya asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My job,\" Tsunade said, before Jiraiya closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might just make things worse,\" Jiraiya said, puffing away.  Tsunade looked over what her notes had on the symbols she copied from the first destroyed scroll and one of Orochimaru's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be able to do it,\" Tsunade thought, \"I might just be able to make my own growth scroll.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In his hiding spot, Sasori was making more growth scrolls in the hope to strengthen his small amount of forces. He was hoping to have at least four giants on his side to take on the giants in the Leaf Village. Unfortunately, there were many giants on the side of the Leaf Village. Luckily, a chunk of them were only about ten to twenty feet tall. Sasori was hopping to create a smaller group of bigger giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them have their pawns.\" He thought to himself. \"I'll give them queens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru was keeping a lookout for Sasori in case they were attacked by the Leaf shinobi again. Suddenly, the ground vibrated under his feet. Looking around Konohamaru was surprised to see a giant coming straight toward them at high speed! He crouched down and said, \"Master! A giant is coming this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori put another growth scroll on the pile and said, \"Show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru lifted Sasori into the air and pointed toward the incoming giant. Sasori smiled and said, \"I recognize him. He's not from the Leaf Village at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru prepared for the coming giant ready in case he was going to attack. The giant, however, was not looking for a fight which was probably good for Konohamaru since he was at least forty feet taller than him. As he stopped in front of Sasori he said, \"I've arrived Master Sasori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori nodded and said, \"Very well. You're the Puppet Master from the Sand Village aren't you?:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKankuro nodded and said, \"What are your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori thought about it and said, \"For now, keep watch with the boy. I have a few more scrolls to make in preparation for our attack on the Leaf Village. Judging by your size I'm assuming Deidara and the others used all three scrolls on you. If you two are my only puppets, I'm going to need you big enough to be of good use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru put Sasori down and Sasori went back to work making the scrolls. As Sasori prepared to strengthen his forces, Gaara, Temari, and their sensei were arriving at the Leaf Village. Kakashi was there waiting for them. \"Good. You made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari nodded and said, \"Has Kankuro been spotted yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shook his head and said, \"We believe he's joined Sasori. We're getting ready to mount an attack on him once we get a team together. The Hokage left choosing the team up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari stepped forward and said, \"Then let me be part of that team! It's my brother out there after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shook his head and said, \"I can't. The giants have too much power for an ordinary ninja to fight. Their size gives them greater power and greater defense. Normal ninjutsu will have little to no effect. Even the stronger attacks don't do more than ordinary close quarters attacks. I will need Gaara though since he's one of the larger giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara nodded and said, \"I expected that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come on.\" Kakashi said. \"We're going to get the others for the team. You two go to the hospital. The Hokage entrusted Shizune with giving out separate missions relating to backup for whatever may come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari and her sensei headed toward the hospital while Gaara and Kakashi started looking through the village for suitable candidates to add to their team to head for an attack on Sasori.</span></div></div>",

Making the scroll had been far more difficult than she expected.  \"I just hope this works,\" she thought, examining the dust on the scroll.  While Orochimaru's was green and Sasori's was a red-amber, the dust before Tsunade was pinkish-blue.  \"Now I'll need a male to try it on.\"  With that, Tsunade departed her office in search of a test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the process of making the growth dust wasn't hard with the symbols.  What drained each of the creators was putting their own will into the dust, to determine what exactly became of the giant after growth.  Orochimaru desired corruption and power to be given to the victor.  Sasori wanted complete subjugation.  Tsunade's dust was different to a degree.  The dust she created, unknowingly to her, would work best on those who already grew, amplifying their power, much like how she amplifies her own strength with chakra control.  But like all the others, enough exposer to the dust would lead to the person serving Tsunade as a slave.  Tsunade only knew the last part for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade approached where many of the giants were waiting for Kakashi to tell them if they would be picked to go on the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should I pick?\" Tsunade thought, \"Kakashi should be a good choice, since it'd better to have him the largest over Naruto.  But Naruto has shown to be quiet ingenious with his new found power, if a bit flaunting.  Shikamaru or Iruka would also be good, as both are chunin.  Then there are the little giants who didn't last very long.  But I also don't even know what this dust will do.  Maybe I should try a test a little dust on someone first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsunade started eliminating her choices one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto is out since he's already big enough. Besides that I want to use this on someone who won't make trouble for the village when this whole thing is over. I don't think I should give it to Kakashi either. He's already able to hold his own against even bigger giants when his mind is clear. Giving him the scroll would be overkill. None of the smaller giants will work either since they won't get much bigger. Knowing Sasori he isn't just waiting around for us to attack him. He's no doubt strengthening his own forces and we need to do the same. Shikamaru is smart, but too lazy. There's no guarantee he'll do any work after this is over if he's the biggest giant around the village. Sasuke is too volatile and Gaara isn't from the village. That leaves Iruka. Hmm...That's not a bad idea. He's reliable, he's responsible, and he's proven he can hold his own against even the Akatsuki at his current size. If he's even larger he should prove quite useful. Alright. Iruka it is then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this went through Tsunade's mind as she watched the team before her. Having finally decided she walked up to the group and said, \"Alright! Before you guys leave I have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the scroll and continued, \"After studying the scroll we stole from Sasori and the dust we obtained from Konohamaru's scarf I've managed to make a growth scroll of my own. For this mission, I've decided to give it to one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Naruto shouted out, \"Oooh! Granny Tsunade! Pick me! I want the scroll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi smacked Naruto on the head and said, \"Be quiet Naruto. You can get big enough already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no such thing as enough when it comes to training!\" Naruto shouted. \"I want it so bad! Come on, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head and said, \"Sorry Naruto but I agree with Kakashi. You're both already good enough at your current size. I need to give this to someone who can be trusted not to make trouble after this whole thing is over and isn't already too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the smaller giants had hopeful looks on their faces but Tsunade shook her head and said, \"But they have to already have a pretty good size. At least over twenty feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto crossed his arms and looked around, \"But who's that then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade walked up to Iruka and said, \"Here Iruka. I know we can trust you the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka looked surprised but smiled and said, \"Of course Lady Hokage. You can count on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted and put his arms behind his head. \"Not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka laughed and said, \"I've been looking for a way to get the edge over you again Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said, \"Yeah right Iruka-sensei! There's no way you'll get as big as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade said, \"Don't be so sure Naruto. We don't know how effective this scroll will be. Just to be safe use it once you're outside the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tsunade headed back to the Hokage Mansion, standing out on the balcony to watch Iruka use the scroll. Team Kakashi made its way outside the village and walked about two hundred feet away. Tsunade spotted the group, nothing more than a collection of tiny figures on the horizon. She watched as one of the figures detached from the group and walked a short distance away. This was it. The moment of truth. As Tsunade watched, nervously biting her thumbnail, the team standing a short distance from Iruka was looking on in the same anticipation. The question on everyone's mind was how big Iruka would grow. With a deep breathe Iruka opened the scroll and the pink and blue dust blew out and surrounded him. As the dust cleared Iruka quickly started growing. The team collectively tilted their heads back further and further as Iruka continued growing. Kakashi turned to Naruto and said, \"Naruto, grow to your full size. That way we'll have a yardstick to see how much Iruka grows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and quickly grew himself up to his full height, looking down on Iruka as he kept on growing. Naruto was shocked as Iruka came up past his waist, past his chest, and finally, with a grin on Iruka's part, past his head. Now even Naruto was looking up as Iruka continued growing up and up and up. Naruto and the rest of the team had to keep moving backward as Iruka's enormous feet started encroaching on them, his toes growing far above their base heights. And still Iruka continued growing. Past four hundred feet, then five hundred, then six hundred until he finally started slowing down at six hundred and seventy feet tall. Iruka looked down at the team and could just make out their tiny forms. Naruto, though quite a bit bigger than the rest of the team, was still small next to Iruka. Iruka laughed and said, \"I told you Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned and said, \"This doesn't change anything Iruka-sensei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka shrunk himself back down, Naruto following suit though a little reluctantly. He was going to miss being the biggest around the village. As the team continued on looking for Sasori, Tsunade was walking back into her office, going over what she had just witnessed. Iruka had grown much much more than any other giant. The question was, would he lose his size if he lost in the coming match? If he did, they'd all be in trouble with a gigantic Kankuro or Konohamaru to deal with. Then again, depending on what Sasori was doing, they might have to deal with them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to use the dust again to understand it completely. There are a few more giants around here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade closed the door to her office to ruminate over her choices.</span></div></div>",

This means Gaara, Sasuke, Shikamaru, and Shizune can't go against them.  You're task is two fold.  First, protect Shizune, as she's the only med ninja on our squad.  Two, reclaim Sakura.  Three, if you have the opportunity, kill Sasori.

They then got on the move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKankuro glared at the Academy student, who was his partner.  Both stood a nice 250 feet tall.  \"Stupid runt,\" Kankuro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Konnohamaru replied, \"You want to fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, both of you!\" Sasori yelled.  Both went quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we'll move to the side then, hmm,\" Deidara said, \"And let your puppets take on the main heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid kids,\" Hidan said, \"I still don't see why you didn't grow me like planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if I had, we'd of needed a new member to the Akatsuki,\" Sasori replied, \"You'll note these two have barely anything on.

Sasori felt that Kankuro would be able to handle himself yet Konohamaru would likely get beat quickly against opponents of an equal size. Kakashi hung back slightly as Iruka and Naruto moved forward, Iruka heading for Konohamaru while Naruto took on Kankuro. Just before Naruto reached Kankuro he created a group of Shadow Clones that jumped into the air, growing to their full gigantic height to press Kankuro in the same way they had Neji. Kankuro threw out his hands and five strings attached to two of the clones. With a twisting movement, Kankuro managed to turn the clones against the others, destroying them before they reached the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to do better than that!\" Kankuro said, guiding the clones in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known Sasori would teach him something like that. I don't think Kankuro was capable of controlling humans before.\" Kakashi thought, moving silently behind Kankuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones were not liking being under anyone's control. The looks of displeasure on their faces was enough to broadcast what they thought of the whole situation. While Naruto was facing down this small army, Iruka was trying his best to subdue Konohamaru without actually hurting him. Konohamaru was relying on his new size and strength to help him win since he lacked any serious ninjutsu. Iruka was matching him, blocking his blows and landing a few of his own. Iruka didn't like the idea of fighting one of his students but he hated the idea of one of his student's being controlled against their will. This thought spurred him on causing him to land more blows on Konohamaru. Konohamaru growled and pulled out a tiny ball. He threw it at Iruka causing it to explode in a tiny black cloud on his cheek. It did absolutely no damage but it surprised Iruka long enough for Konohamaru to slam his foot into Iruka's stomach. Konohamaru, being under Sasori's control, had no reason to hold back like Iruka so his kick was full force and Iruka was not expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle between the four titans raged on as Kakashi slowly got behind Kankuro, ready to attack and grab Sasori off Kankuro's shoulder. Just as he was about to attack Kankuro pulled his left hand around and caused one of Naruto's clones to guard him from behind. Turning slightly, Kankuro was able to send one clone after Naruto and the other after Kakashi. Sasori smiled as this fight went on, the odds clearly in his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far from this position, Team B was heading out to engage the other Akatsuki in battle. Since they had so many giants of varying sizes on their side they didn't anticipate any problems. The biggest obstacle, was finding them. Shikamaru stopped suddenly and held out his hand. The group came to a halt next to a clearing. Shizune, hanging onto Sasuke's back, asked, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru put a finger to his lips then pointed at the clearing. Everyone looked and saw two of the Akatsuki members standing in the clearing, talking. Looking closer, they saw Sakura tied up between them. Sasuke was instantly suspicious. \"This seems almost too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded and whispered, \"Yeah, I know what you mean. It's more than likely a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune looked nervous as she said, \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara quietly said, \"Surround them. If we attack from all sides, they won't be able to target us in a big group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded and said, \"Sounds like a plan. Me and Shizune will go one way, Sasuke and Gaara go the other. We'll all attack at once after six minutes have passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke handed Shizune over to Shikamaru who started moving to the left. Sasuke and Gaara headed to the right. Once each giant was in a different spot around the clearing, forming a triangle with the Akatsuki in the center, they had one minute before the attack would begin.</span></div></div>",

Actually, Gaara didn't retreat, but instead tried to contain the explosions in his sand coffin.  Due to the strength  of the three, this was a costly act on his chakra, but no damage was done.

Not sure really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're not needed to live anymore,\" Gaara said as he started crushing Deidara from the legs up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he had changed,\" Shikamaru said quietly to Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has,' Sasuke said, \"He hasn't tried killing us, has he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll tell you, they went that way! hmm,\" Deidara yelled nodding his head northward after his pelvis was crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Gaara said before encasing all of Deidara in sand and killing him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's get moving,\" Shikamaru said, ignoring the blood now dripping from Gaara's sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the real Kakuzu and Hidan were moving south with Sakura on Hidan's shoulder.  He was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgin sacrifices,\" Hidan said, \"That's something I haven't done in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me how long this stupid ceremony will take?\" Kakuzu said, \"I'm not in the mood for a long one.  We do have enemy forces tracking us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a half hour,\" Hidan said when something shot out of the woods and grabbed Sakura.  Kakuzu barely had time to see the toad's tongue rescue Sakura when Jiraiya came from the other side, with his sword from before drawn and ready.  He charged forward and decapitated Hidan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was miscalculated,\" Kakuzu said, seeing his partner was down, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so,\" Jiraiya said, looking at Kakuzu, while the toad from before grabbed Hidan's head from a distance.  It picked up the injured Sakura and went after Team B.</span></div></div>",

With no need for restraint Kankuro and Konohamaru were able to fight viciously with intent to kill. Neither Naruto nor Iruka wanted either giant hurt so they were slightly pulling their punches and aiming not to permanently injure. With the situation looking grim, Iruka knew he had only one choice. He quickly grew another two hundred feet reaching 400 feet tall. Konohamaru, who had been aiming a punch at his face suddenly found himself punching his teachers thigh. Iruka ignored Konohamaru for a moment and grabbed the two Naruto clones by their collars, bashing their heads together and causing them to disappear, Kankuro's chakra strings falling to the ground. Kakashi took this moment to dart forward and grab Sasori in his hands. Before Sasori could bring Konohamaru around to attack Kakashi, before he could try to attach chakra strings to control Kakashi, Kakashi closed his fist around the Puppet Master, crushing his body to death. With the death of Sasori, Kankuro and Konohamaru lost their will to fight. Both just stood there waiting new orders but without Sasori they would be waiting forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wiped some sweat off his forehead and said, \"That was close! Now we just gotta wait for Shizune and Pervy Sage so we can fix these guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi dropped Sasori's body to the ground and put his foot on it, grinding the remains into dust. Iruka helped the two boys to lay down on the ground. They were compliant to the touch and quickly laid down their eyes staring up into the sky still waiting. Iruka and Naruto shrunk back down to a height closer to Kakashi so they could talk while they waited. It didn't take long for Jiraiya to suddenly burst through the trees followed by a toad. In the toad's tongue was Sakura which the toad laid carefully down. During all the excitement she had fainted the strain of being kidnapped and the worry about dieing for so long finally catching up to her. Another fifteen minutes passed and still Team B hadn't come back. Iruka turned to Jiraiya and said, \"Did you see them anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded. \"They were making an attack and had almost fallen into a trap. Gaara took out one of the Akatsuki members and I stole the head from the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everyone gave Jiraiya a weird look and he sighed and said, \"Don't ask. The point is there's still one more Akatsuki member out there and we don't have any idea what his powers might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also possible they've got reinforcements.\" Kakashi said. \"There were only four that came to attack the Leaf Village. That leaves six members still out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started looking uncomfortable as he asked, \"I'm not liking the sound of that. Shouldn't we go find them? It's not like they're going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. Jiraiya said, \"Alright. Naruto, Kakashi, and me will all go looking for Team B and assist them if they need it. Iruka will stay here and guard these two to make sure nothing happens to them. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka grew to three hundred feet tall to keep a lookout as the rest of Team A headed out to look for Team B.</span></div></div>",

The other three followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, the real Naruto told Jiraiya and Kakashi of finding Team B and they retreated to Iruka as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka stood tall, watching for any signs of approach.  Suddenly, he turned around and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Lee?\" Iruka asked the 15 foot tall ninja, but to the 300 ft Iruka,  he looked closer to 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard Sakura-san was captured and came to help!\" Lee shouted upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee, you're not big enough to help against them,\" Iruka said pointing to the giant mountains that were Konohamaru and Konkuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I wanted to try anyway!\" Lee shouted when suddenly the rest of Team A and Team B arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bushy brows?

At that size he was able to carry the smaller giants under one arm. To make the trip go faster, the other ninja rode in his other hand with plenty of spare room. The trip was over in a few minutes thanks to Iruka's increased speed. When they got back, Shizune quickly ran to the Hokage's Mansion and knocked on Tsunade's office. Tsunade's voice issued out, \"If you're a man, just open the door. If you're a woman, then come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune opened the door and walked inside. Tsunade looked up from about five piles of blue and pink dust and said, \"Shizune! What have you got to report?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune quickly said, \"The mission was a success. We subdued Kankuro and Konohamaru and eliminated two members of the Akatsuki. Sakura was also recovered..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled and said, \"Excellent. That just leaves the remaining members of Akatsuki to worry about. We should still be on guard in case they make any more moves. Judging from the amount of giants we have they'll probably try something covert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune agreed and said, \"We had to transport the giants here for you to shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuande's smile disappeared as she heard this. She sighed and said, \"I thought that might happen. Very well. I'll see to them immediately. Just make sure at least one giant above twenty feet is nearby to share chakra as well as some medical ninja who can transport the subjects back to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded, her gaze drifting to the dust. \"What exactly are you working on Lady Tsunade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked down at the dust piles and said, \"I was planning on experimenting with the dust. I've created five piles here of varying coarseness. The pile to the far left is the coarsest while the dust to the far right is the finest. I think the fineness of the dust effects how powerful it is, but I haven't been able to test it to be sure. After we're done shrinking the giants I want these tested on the smallest giants. That means Choji, Shino, Kiba, Asuma, and Lee. Make sure that those five are gathered in the Training Field. I haven't decided yet who to give what dust...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lady ninjas headed outside to the village borders where the two giants were lying down. Iruka placed her on Konohamaru's chest first, Jiraiya standing by with two scrolls to seal the chakra with. Iruka lent his chakra to Tsunade again allowing her to quickly cleanse Konohamaru who instantly began shrinking. Once he was down to his normal height he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the hospital. They repeated the process with Kankuro which was slightly more difficult since Tsunade was starting to feel the strain from creating the dust and almost immediately shrinking the giants. She was quite dizzy by the time Kankuro was taken to the hospital. Nevertheless, she went to the Training Field where the five smallest giants were waiting for her. She pulled out five scrolls and said, \"I suppose you all know why you're here, but just in case I'll break it down for you. You are the five smallest giants. Therefore you are the perfect subjects for my latest tests. I have with me five scrolls. I labeled them one through five. I'm not sure which, but either one or five is the strongest. The rest get stronger from one on or from five down. Each of you come and take a scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach giant stepped forward and took a scroll. Once everyone had a scroll Tsunade said, \"Alright, which of you has what scroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a journal and jotted down the names of the ninja and the number of scroll they got. Once that was done she nodded and said, \"Open the scrolls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they didn't know was that the fine dust was the strongest while the coarse dust was the weakest. Scroll One had the fine dust in it, but who got what scroll?</span></div></div>",

I just hope the strongest isn't over 15 times their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stood back from Akamaru.  \"Sorry buddy, we don't know how this would affect you.  It was made for humans, not dogs,\" Kiba said as Akamaru ran over to Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five ninjas moved away from each other then opened the scrolls.  The pink and blue dust was slowly coating their bodies.  Once done, all five shot upwards very quickly.  Choji was growing the fastest upwards  But it seemed as soon as he started, he stopped.  Scroll 5 had increased his 12 feet max to 108 feet tall, 9 times his original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took a deep breath as he rose taller and more muscular.  From his 11 foot beginning, he rose to 121 feet tall.  \"Hah, now I'm taller than you Choji!\" Kiba said, smiling.  Akamaru gave a happy yelp at Kiba's happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma kept focused on how exactly his body was changing, from his vision getting better to the sheer power in his little pinky.  As he grew 13 times his original size, he soon topped off at 130 feet tall.  He was inwardly happy he was larger than his students once again, so persuading Shikamaru and Choji was no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what about those two?\" Tsunade thought, seeing Asuma level off and Choji was smaller than him.  It seemed that even though the others grew faster, the grew smaller, while Lee and Shino were growing taller, it was not as fast as the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino kept his normal poker face on as he went higher and higher.  Shino had started with a maximum of 13 feet tall.  But now he was rising above Asuma a great deal.  He continued skyward, until he stopped at 195 feet tall, 15 times his original maximum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Tsunade couldn't tell exactly how tall Shino was, she could guess he was near 200 feet.  Deep in her gut, she had wished Asuma had taken Scroll 1, for a 200 foot plus clone of Guy would not be the easiest thing to handle.  As Tsunade turned to the last growing giant, she watched as he slowly gained on Shino and soon rose above him, climbing higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee!\" Tsunade shouted, \"Don't even think about jumping!\"  But Lee couldn't hear her.  Thankfully, Choji did and passed the words up the line until Shino yelled it at Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Lady Hokage!\" Lee shouted back, causing Tsunade to cover her ears.  She really wished someone else had gotten Scroll 1.  Eventually, Lee slowed down and stopped at an even 300 feet tall, 20 times his original maximum.  Tsunade looked at the giants she grew and knew the base of power had shifted in the village.  While there was no issue with Iruka being taller than Naruto, as Kakashi was the 3rd tallest, Tsunade knew that with two more students in that height range, their might be issues.  She also wondered how much influence she'd have over them since they used her scrolls?</span></div></div>",

Eventually the whole village will be in turmoil and that is when we'll make our move. In the meantime we will need more giants on our side. Since Itachi copied the jutsu through his Sharingan he will make the scrolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi nodded and pulled out a few scrolls, heading for the exit where the light was better to start making the scrolls. Kakuzu turned to Pein and said, \"What about the rest of us? What are we supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPein turned to Kakuzu and said, \"We wait.

And you have to remain your smallest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away Guy Sensei!\" Lee shouted before leaving table quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Tenten said quietly after Lee left, \"I'm worried what will happen if he ever gets any sake in him now.  I mean, without either Naruto or Iruka-sensei present, Lee could level the village easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why, as his teammates, we have to insure that doesn't happen.  Right Neji?\" Guy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Neji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere still, Konohamaru was enjoying more respect from his peers at the Academy due to his new stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, being that tall was great!\" Konohamaru said, smiling, \"I could of done anything I liked.\"  The girls near him were fawning over him, while the guys looked on in envy and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still small enough for me to beat you as easily as before,\" Iruka said, looking at Konohamaru while he was reading a book during a study period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Iruka-sensei,\" Konohamaru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in his life, Jiraiya wasn't using his telescope to peep on women.  Instead, he was monitoring different people to see how they reacted to Tsunade's actions.  Unknown to many, he was present at Team 7's chat in the woods and the dinner talk with Team Guy.  This made him feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Tsunade's still experimenting with the stuff,\" Jiraiya mumbled as he went on his way to Tsunade's mansion.  He wanted to ask her to stop this dust making before things got out of hand.</span></div></div>",

This business with the giants had slowly been driving a wedge between the normal people of the village and the giants and between the giants themselves. It wasn't good for the whole of the village and it needed to be stopped. He quickly jumped up to the window at Tsunade's office and said, \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade jumped and quickly rolled another scroll up. \"You know you're not supposed to come in that way. What if I had dust out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya walked into the room and said, \"That dust is exactly what I've come to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade tucked the scroll away in her shirt and said, \"Are you worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm worried.\" Jiraiya said. \"I've been watching the people of the village and how they've been dealing with this situation. The primary emotions throughout the village have been anger and jealousy. The giant situation hasn't been good for the village and the more you experiment with it the worse it's going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and said, \"Jiraiya. This business has done nothing but improve our standing in the world. No one would be fool enough to attack us with so many giants on our side. Why should we stop now? Frankly, it doesn't matter how big the giants get since they can shrink down to normal size and interact with the normal people of the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya frowned and said, \"Well suppose one of them decided they don't want to follow the ways of the village anymore? What would stop them from destroying the village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stood up and said, \"The other giants of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya walked over to Tsunade's desk and said, \"What if all the giants decide to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled and said, \"Well then we simply make a scroll with a stronger controlling force. Even if Naruto tried to leave we could use scrolls on the other giants to not only increase their size but increase our dominance over them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya looked shocked as he heard this. \"Tsunade are you listening to yourself? You're starting to sound like Orochimaru! Do you really want to subjugate the entire village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade frowned and said, \"I guess I never really thought about it like that...You're right Jiraiya. This power is too much for the village. We should cut our losses now and try to improve the relationships with the people of the village. However, I don't want to waste this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the scroll and said, \"So the only question is, who do we give it to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya thought for awhile and said, \"How strong is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head. \"I have no idea. The dust is even finer than the dust I used on Lee so it's safe to say it'll make someone over 20 times their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya frowned as he heard this. \"I'm not sure we should use it on anyone. It could make things much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head again and said, \"We have to use it. What if the scroll falls into the wrong hands? And I'm not just talking about Akatsuki. Sasuke has been nothing but trouble since he grew so I don't want him getting this scroll. There's a reason he's the smallest right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded and said, \"Well then who? Definitely not Iruka. He's big enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade started listing names off, \"Choji could use it. I don't think he'd make much trouble though his obsession with food could make trouble. The last thing we need is a rampaging Akimiji. Then there's Shino. He's already a bit too big I think though he wouldn't make trouble either. Kiba is out as well as Naruto and Kakashi since they have too great a base height. Asuma is another idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya snapped his fingers and said, \"What about Shikamaru? He's not too big and he's already proven his loyalty before. Not to mention he's so lazy he's not likely to make trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade bit her lip and said, \"I suppose it would be better to have someone too lazy to do anything than someone who might turn on the village or otherwise make trouble. Alright, Shikamaru it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Jiraiya the scroll and said, \"Deliver it to him and make sure he grows in a clear area away from the village. I'm going to send Shizune and myself out into the village to start repairing our bonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded and said, \"If we're not careful Akatsuki will take advantage of our disunion  and attack. We have to be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded slowly and said, \"I just hope they'll listen.\"</span></div></div>",

How much longer until they're made?\" Kankuro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should be ready by tomorrow morning.  Temari went to find out for sure,\" Gaara said.  Kankuro nodded.  He wondered if that was the only reason for her going out into the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari smiled as she drank some tea at the tea shop.  Across from her was Shikamaru Nara.  Temari was returning from the Akimichi's clan residence when she ran into Shikamaru and persuaded him to have some tea with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it like growing that big?\" Temari asked, \"Gaara doesn't talk about it much since he returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice in a way,\" Shikamaru said, \"My jutsus are stronger and my chakra reserves are higher.  Plus the clouds look the same from any height I can grow to.  Down side is I have to do more manual labor around the village.\"  He then gave a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't like doing more than you need to,\" Temari said, \"And it doesn't bother you that you're now the second smallest giant in the village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Shikamaru said, \"I actually don't care, as long as no one bothers me.  With so many more giants, the odds of me fighting more Akatsuki are slim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But from what I heard, you did a great job at it,\" came a voice from behind Shikamaru.  From no where, Jiraiya appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what do you want?\" Shikamaru asked, not caring who Jiraiya was.  Temari didn't know him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to come with me outside the village,\" Jiraiya said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it needed?  Or may I refuse?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, refusal's always an option.  But it would also mean a live show rather than pictures being given out,\" Jiraiya said, smiling.  Shikamaru's face was drained a little of its color as he took a sip of tea.  Temari noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Temari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Shikamaru said, standing up, \"I need to go with him.  Here's the cash for my drinks.\"  As he put the money on the table, Jiraiya waited.  Soon Temari was left alone, eeing Shikamaru left enough for both their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Shikamaru asked the Sannin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way,\" Jiraiya said, \"Orders from the Hokage.\"  Shikamaru shook his head and followed.  Jiraiya led Shikamaru through side alleyways and up abandoned streets.  Shikamaru knew then what was going down wasn't something they wanted company for.  Soon they made it to the woods and to a large lake in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of coming here?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how deep this lake is?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough, your to take that boat over there and head to the center,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can walk on water just as easily,\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then it'd be like you were on level ground.  I want you to go a bit into the water,\" Jiraiya said, pulling out the last scroll.  \"The Hokage wants you to use it on yourself.\"  Shikamaru's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jiraiya said, \"You were chosen because you are trustworthy, loyal, smart, and not ambitious or easily influenced.  The Hokage wants this scroll used up.  Keeping it hidden only allows for someone to find it.  Can you imagine what it'd be like if the Akatsuki finds it?  Or Sasuke Uchiha?\"  Shikamaru grunted.  With his mind it didn't take long for him to come up with 100 different worst case scenarios, depending on who found the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should take this as a compliment,\" Shikamaru said taking the scroll and getting in the boat.  Jiraiya gave it a good kick and soon Shikamaru was over the deepest part of the lake, roughly speaking 300 feet deep.  Shikamaru held the scroll to his chest and released the dust.  Then the growth started.  Slowly he grew with his clothes to match.  Soon his weight became to much for the boat and it sunk beneath him.  It was an odd sensation to Shikamaru, growing down rather than up.  Jiraiya could only hope he didn't get so large, the lake didn't help conceal him.  No one was meant to know about Shikamaru's full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Jiraiya, Temari followed the pair and saw Shikamaru take the scroll and now grow.  Though only his head was above water, Temari saw it increase in size.  \"I hope he's all right,\" Temari thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya saw Shikamaru start to rise from beneath the waves.  \"Man, he reached the bottom already?  And he shows no sign of stopping.\"  And Shikamaru didn't stop as he grew taller and taller.  He finally stopped at six hundred seventy five, 27 times larger than his previous max and now the tallest ninja of all, though only 375 could be seen above the water line.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru quickly shrank himself down, rightfully thinking that a 375 foot upper body sticking out of the forest would be a dead giveaway to what was going on. When he back to normal size he walked along the water until he came to shore where Jiraiya was waiting for him. They were about to leave together to head back to the village when Temari walked out from her hiding place and said, \"That was pretty impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shrugged but Jiraiya frowned at the Sand girl. \"I know you're an ally to the Leaf village but you shouldn't be sneaking around spying on people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari smiled and said, \"Well it's not like I could ever do anything to the village. My brothers alone wouldn't let me do anything let alone trying to do something with so many giants in this village. Truthfully, the Leaf doesn't need allies if it doesn't want them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya didn't like that line of thinking and said, \"That doesn't matter. Shikamaru just used the last scroll so there will be no more growing. I don't want you to reveal your full height to anyone Shikamaru. I don't want there to be trouble between comrades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru agreed and said, \"That's all you needed me for right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded and said, \"I'm going to continue to monitor things around the village and keep a lookout for Akatsuki members. Don't do anything to antagonize the people of the village. If you get any opportunity help relations between us. The village is starting to get divided and that is something we can't afford.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ninja nodded and Jiraiya left, hoping that this thing wouldn't end up hurting them in the end after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, Tsunade and Shizune had managed to find Team 7 and was talking with them. She left the last scroll out of it, not wanting to start off by getting Naruto and Sasuke angry. Both boys and Sakura were sitting on a rock in the woods while Tsunade talked to them, Shizune there to lend moral support and help Tsunade if things were to get rough in any way. Tsunade looked between the two boys and said, \"I thought you two would get along better after spending time together but I see that hasn't happened. Nor has either of you been very happy about the recent growings. Sasuke, did you ever stop to think that there was a reason behind my decision not to use you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke didn't say anything. Tsunade continued, \"You are arrogant, volatile, and narrow minded. These are not good qualities of a protector of the Leaf Village. If it had been up to me, Naruto wouldn't be as big as he is either. I would've preferred to keep you both under twenty feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to protest but Tsunade silenced him and continued, \"You Naruto are loyal and kind but you also have a deep need to show off and try and prove yourself. That could mean easily falling into a trap and being used against us. The Akatsuki have the jutsu to make more scrolls and even though the Kyuubi keeps you from going completely under control at first it will eventually use the chakra as a means to escape from your body. That would be disastrous for the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys said nothing, neither betraying his emotions. Tsunade continued, \"The reason I want to talk to you both is because bonds in this village have begun to fray. Some are blinded by jealousy at others sizes while some are angry and afraid of the giants. This is not an atmosphere that should exist in this village. If things keep going the way they are the village will eventually become divided. To prevent this, I have decided that no more growth scrolls will be made ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's heart sank as he heard this. That meant that he was stuck forever at his \"meager\" height of twenty feet. Every other giant would always look down on him. Now that it was a fact instead of a mere speculation Sasuke would have to learn to deal with it. Tsunade smiled at him and said, \"Perhaps revenge isn't the best course of action for you anymore. There are so many other ways to live your life. Don't throw it away by focusing on your brother. The reason you sought him out so fiercely was because you wanted revenge, but you also believed that no one else would be capable of it. Now we have a large group of ninja that can make it happen easily. I don't expect you to come to terms with this situation instantly but eventually you'll see. I'm confident in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke didn't know what to do or say so he just sat there, thinking about what he was going to do. Sakura patted him on the shoulder and he didn't pull away like he usually did. Sakura found this to be a good sign. Naruto saw that Sasuke was going to need some time to deal with this so he decided to stop worrying about everyone else and help his friend through his tough times. Tsunade turned to Shizune and said, \"Alright, let's move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune looked back at the three ninja sitting close together on the rock and thought, \"Maybe everyone can learn to get along...\"</span></div></div>",

While making it, he made a dust that would make the victim more susceptible to his sharigan persuasion, but only his and not any of the other sharigan users.  \"And now I need to go see for my spy,\" Itachi said, packing the scrolls away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, who could it be?\" Tobi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to come with you?\" Kisame asked, \"With so many giants, it could be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Itachi said, \"Things will go differently from before.\"  With that, Itachi walked to the village and entered past the guards.  Using his sharigan, he hypnotized them and continued unscathed.  Kisame and Tobi could only watch from a far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi walked along until he came to a back door in an alley way.  He released the jutsu on his spy and waited.  From the back door, Teuchi, the owner of the Ichiraku Ramen Shop came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Itachi,\" Teuchi said quietly, \"Care for a bowl on the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know about the smallest gaints remaining in the village,\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smallest ones are your brother at 20 feet and Shikamaru Nara at 25 feet,\" Teuchi said, \"Tsunade made her own dust and grew the others so everyone else in the village are 100 feet or more.  Choji Akimichi is the smallest of them along with Kiba Inuzuka.  Neji Hyuuga is disgruntled for Rock Lee's new growth to 300 feet tall.  And from what I heard some at the hospital say, Kankuro of Suna would like more power.  He was one of your group's victims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deliver these to the Akimichi and Inuzuka boys,\" Itachi said, holding out two scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Itachi,\" Teuchi said, taking the scrolls.  Itachi disappeared but didn't leave the village.  Instead, he went back to where the Uchiha used to live and rested while he made another scroll for Kankuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuechi returned to his daughter.  \"Ayame, what do you think of the giants?\" Teuchi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some people seem scared of them, why do you asked?\" Ayame asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of giving some of them a free meal, since their mere presence helps protect the village,\" Teuchi said, \"And why don't we start off with Kiba and Choji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a wonderful idea,\" Ayame said, smiling, \"I'll go send word to those two right now.\"  She took off her apron and departed.  And Teuchi set up the trap by placing small exploding tags on each scroll and putting them in the ramen.  Once exposed to the air, they'd blow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Choji soon came back and Teuchi had their bowls ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I normally don't like ramen, but if it's free count me in,\" Kiba said digging in.  Choji said nothing and started in as well.  But ate fast and soon started draining the liquid from the bowls.  Almost at the same time, both tags touched air and covered them in Itachi's dust.  Ayame screamed at the sight of the explosion and then their sudden growth, while her father quietly slipped out the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both giants grew taller and taller, they had three orders in their minds.  First was to say they served Kakuzu and second to leave the village in two different directions and the third was to try and kill Tobi if the opportunity presented itself.</span></div></div>",

Thinking fast, Kakashi and Asuma went after Choji while Iruka took off after Kiba.The three senseis had already been together discussing the events of the village and the movements of Akatsuki when they had spotted the two growing giants. Noticing the by now familiar slightly blank look in the eyes of the giants, the three ninja acted quickly. Since Iruka was the biggest he went after the bigger Kiba while the two smaller ninja went off after Choji. Itachi watched this all passively everything going exactly as planned for him. He knew that if he sent two giants off away from the village they would be sure to draw all attention away from what he was about to do next. Staying in the back alleys the missing-nin eventually reached the hospital. Once there he waited until a nurse came out on her lunch break. He hypnotized her and said, \"Where is Kankuro of Suna staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse instantly responded, \"He's on the third floor in room 356.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi looked up at the hospital and said, \"Point at the right window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse looked up at the third floor and pointed at a window that was near the corner of the building. Itachi released his grip and quickly escaped into the hospital leaving the nurse dazed and confused but with no memory of her encounter. Luckily, no one was in the room except Kankuro. He was in a hospital bed, wearing nothing except a hospital gown his face still clear of the usual stripes. He hadn't been allowed to leave the hospital for sometime and he was getting annoyed by the whole situation. He wanted to feel the feelings of power with a clear head instead in a fog of control. He was spending his time repairing small parts of Crow and Black Ant waiting for his custom clothes to be finished so he and his siblings could go home. He looked up in shock as Itachi arrived in the room, throwing the scroll at Kankuro. It exploded when it was inches from his face, covering him in dust. Itachi grabbed Kankuro and tossed him outside through the window as he started growing bigger and bigger. As soon as he hit the ground Kankuro went running outside the village, growing continuously as he went. Itachi stayed hidden in the shadows heading back to Kisame and Tobi. </span></div></div>",

Despite the huge issue at hand, there was only one silver lining to it.  Itachi's dust was by far the most crude of them all, growing its victims 2 to 5 times their size.  But to a 250 max before, that would still be a huge issue.  Using his chakra strings, Kankuro pulled off the three senseis and sent them flying into each other as he leveled off at 700 feet tall.  In their moment of disability, all three made a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for some distance, all three shrunk in size to ten feet tall, using what intelligence they had to know being that big was easy to track.  At ten feet, they were fast and powerful enough to deal with normal ninjas who might stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that one guy was big,\" Kisame said as Itachi appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and he didn't have anything on,\" Tobi said, \"Are you perverted like Orochimaru, Itachi-sama?\"  Itachi merely looked at Tobi and didn't say anything.  Soon the three were off to find their newest slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the village, damage control was everywhere the giants stepped.  With many more injured from this ambush than in Orochimaru's strike, the medical ninja were on the scene trying to get to everyone.  Some of the giants also came to help clear out rubble and find injured people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 7 looked around at the damage done.  \"Man, what happened?  How did those guys grow like that?\" Naruto asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?  Someone hit them with a scroll,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that, but who was the maker?\" Naruto wondered as they came to the three fallen teachers.  All three were down to their normal old heights.  \"Kakashi,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Kankuro,\" Iruka said, \"He's bigger than my max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did either of you hear anything as to who might be their master?\" Tsunade asked as she arrived to check them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba mentioned something about a Kakuzu,\" Iruka said, \"Right before we got the surprise attack that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to stop this?\" Tsunade thought, \"With them having the scroll, they can make more giants or ambush us at any time.  What are we going to do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the medical ninjas looked after the three senseis and the other giants helped in cleaning up after the three new rouge giants, Tsunade headed back to the Hokage Mansion. This madness had gone on long enough. She had to do something to combat the Akatsuki's knowledge about the scroll. She was determined not to make any more since that would only exacerbate the problems at hand. As she walked up the Hokage Mansion's staircase leading to her office she was stopped by two figures. Tsunade instantly knew who they were: The elders of the village, Homura and Koharu. If they had came out seeking Tsunade it probably meant trouble. Tsunade continued walking up the stairs and said, \"What brings you both out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura was the first to speak, \"We need to talk Tsunade. The recent events in the village have gotten out of hand and we need to do something about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade indicated that they should go into her office. They did so and Tsunade asked, \"What would you propose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu said, \"The villages safety is at stake so long as those giants exist in our midst. We come to you with two options: Find a way to permanently shrink them back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade thought about that for a moment. If all her research thus far was correct then she didn't think there was a way to shrink them back down to normal size. It wasn't a normal jutsu that could just be released. She focused back on the elders and said, \"And the second option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura looked deadly serious as he said, \"The only other option...is to kill them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's eyes widened as she heard this. Could they really be serious? How could she eliminate the others? She shook her head slowly and said, \"That is completely out of the question. I will not have any members of this village killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu stared coldly at Tsunade and said, \"As Hokage you are responsible for the wellbeing of the village. If killing a few means the salvation of many then those few should be sacrificed for the greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade did not like this talk of \"greater goods\". It sounded like a terrible excuse to easily solve a problem. She continued talking, \"I still won't. There has to be a better way. The giants and the normal people of the village can learn to live together. It'll take time, but it can be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura frowned and said, \"And in the meantime, what if the Akatsuki attack again? What if more giants are turned against us? If we kill the giants we have now they won't be able to turn against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And likewise they won't be able to help us!\" Tsunade said getting frustrated. \"Any male can be made into a giant, even normal people. An army of normal males at a massive size could be just as dangerous as a giant ninja. If we have some giants we at least have protection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu shook her head and said, \"You are as stubborn as Sarutobi was. But in the end he too came around. You will as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those strange words, the two elders left Tsunade. As Tsunade was being ordered to do the impossible, Itachi, Kisame, and Tobi were heading back to the Akatsuki's hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is so exciting!\" Tobi said running behind Itachi. \"You're so amazing Itachi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame laughed and said, \"Looks like you have a fan Itachi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi said nothing. He pulled out a kunai instead and threw it at Tobi. Tobi barely dodged it in time yelling out, \"Hey! Watch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi stopped running, facing Tobi in a clearing. Kisame stopped as well and said, \"Itachi what's wrong? Why are you attacking the kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi turned slowly to look at Kisame. \"We've been working together for a long time Kisame. But I can no longer go along with this man's work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame looked confused as Itachi said this. \"You're as clear as ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi laughed nervously and said, \"What's all this about Itachi? What work? I just barely joined the Akatsuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi ignored Tobi and continued talking to Kisame. \"Go back to the cave. This doesn't concern you. If you stay, you may learn more than you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame snorted and said, \"Whatever. If that's the way it's going to be, then fine. I'll leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kisame left, leaving Itachi and Tobi alone. Itachi closed his eyes and said, \"After all these years I've finally got the means to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi held up his hands and said hurriedly, \"Why do you want to kill me? Tobi's a good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi opened his eyes revealing his Mangekyo Sharingan. \"Enough of this charade. We both know who you are Madara Uchiha. I sent Kisame away for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi lowered his hands slowly and said, \"Well I can't say I'm surprised. I always knew you'd try something like this eventually. Do you really think that you can defeat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi shook his head. \"Alone, no. I'm sure you haven't revealed the extent of your powers to me and have a few tricks left to show. But with the three giants on my side I don't see how you can stand against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara laughed and said, \"You really think I couldn't see this coming? Well then, let's see how the power of Itachi Uchiha matches with the power of Madara Uchiha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stared at each other, Sharingan's active, waiting for the other to make the first move.</span></div></div>",

A heavy sigh came before she closed her eyes and pulled out a bottle of sake.  Soon followed a cup to drink.  She gently poured the liquid into the cup and waited.  She stared at the drink and the smooth surface on top of it, her reflection staring back at her.  She couldn't kill the giants.  She knew that.  Besides the strategic loss, losing people like Kakashi and Asuma at this time and age would be one of the worst things.  And then to lose hopeful promising ninja like Naruto, Shikamaru, and a few of the others would be detrimental to the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sound like Orochimaru,\" Tsunade said before putting a drink down when she heard clapping.  Tsunade looked up and saw Jiraiya had infiltrated her den without her sensing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be really focused on what those two old farts had to say,\" Jiraiya said, walking forward with a bag on his back, \"To not have a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jiraiya said sitting down, \"They're scared and wrong.  The 3rd Hokage would never of done something like that.  He loved every man, woman, and child like his own.  He could accept them dying in battle.  But slaughtering comrades was far lower than he would allow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we do?\" Tsunade asked, \"I mean, I've looked over every scroll, every medical book on a way to reverse it, to help the situation.  The closest I got was a way to forcibly shrink and grow certain aspects of the body in a permanent nature!\"  Tsuande looked away quickly realizing what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how you got those 'two friends'?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up or I'll punch you,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jiraiya said, taking some things from his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in that?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this stuff was meant to go to Naruto when he gets older and more mature,\" Jiraiya said, \"But I doubt the Fourth would mind us using it in a way to help save him.\"  And from the bag, Jiraiya pulled scrolls of notes, data, and ideas for possible jutsus the 4th Hokage had written.  Though some were incomplete, every idea was conceived in away that wasn't how Tsunade thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think any of this will help?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may.  He's like his son:  Always thinking out of the box,\" Jiriaya said as he finished emptying the bag, \"Let's get to work.\"  Tsunade nodded and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour passed and some scrolls were quickly finished, like \"Way to summon ramen on missions\" jutsu was tossed quickly.  But eventually, Tsunade said, \"I found something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Tsunade find?</span></div></div>",

He has detailed notes on how to create a scroll and it looks like he was halfway through creating a kind of antidote. I can probably recreate it but it won't be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya smiled and said, \"Well that's something at least. How effective will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade pulled out a pen and made some quick calculations on the scroll. After a few minutes of hasty scribbling she said, \"I'll be able to shrink our own ninja anytime they might get unruly. It looks like the Fourth was trying to make it so he could shrink giants that were created by other dust but never was able to finish it. In other words I'll be able to shrink all the giants that have my dust in them but not that have the Akatsuki's dust in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya's smile became rather fixed as he said, \"Well...that still solves half the problem. As long as we make it clear that giants can't defect and use their power against us the elders don't have a case against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade set this scroll aside slowly and started sifting through the rest of the scrolls that was in the bag. She was no longer just looking to look but was actively searching for something specific. Jiraiya noticed this and said, \"Looking for something special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"That scroll that described the Fourth's attempts to make the growing scroll got me thinking. He understood the whole jutsu concept and had known enough to make an antidote. What if he managed to make a growth scroll but never used it or talked about it since he didn't have a full antidote for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya's eyes widened and he said, \"That could both advantageous and dangerous. The Fourth Hokage was a powerful ninja. If he did manage to make a growth scroll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let that idea linger in the air. He started sifting with Tsunade through the various scrolls, notes, and books both anxious to find the scroll if it existed. After about ten minutes of searching Tsunade pulled out a very familiar looking scroll. Jiraiya stared at it and said, \"That's it isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and said, \"This is definitely a growth scroll from the Fourth Hokage himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya stood up and said, \"What are we going to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stood up as well, holding the scroll with the care of holding a bomb. She wasn't sure what she wanted to do with it. It was just like with the last growth scroll she made. It was too dangerous to use but even more dangerous to leave alone. The bonds of the village still hadn't been fully healed and the Akatsuki were still at large, waiting to make their move against the village. The main worry was how powerful was this scroll? The Fourth was an amazing ninja to be sure. What if he knew it was too powerful and specifically didn't use it? If she did use it, it was sure to prove a powerful asset for the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pros outweighed the cons at this point. She had to be extremely careful who she chose to use this scroll on. Since it was made with the Fourth Hokage's chakra she wouldn't be able to forcibly shrink whoever she used it on. At least not yet. She handed the scroll to Jiraiya and said, \"We're going to have to use it. Will you deliver it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya nodded and said, \"Who are we giving it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head and said, \"I haven't decided yet.

The fight in its first rounds had consisted entirely of genjutsu. To any spectators it would've looked like the two Uchiha were simply staring at each other. Scenario after scenario of each other's deaths ran through their minds, clones fought, limbs were severed, scenery was destroyed, and other nameless terrible things chased the two fighters. Eventually Madara managed to push Itachi to the limit of genjutsu and forced both fighters back into visible reality. Itachi was breathing heavily, his body tiring more quickly than normal. His eyes flicked to the sides and three ninja suddenly appeared. Before Madara knew what was happening, the three ninja grew to  twenty five, fifty, and seventy five feet piling on top of the oldest Uchiha one after another. The three giants swiftly moved aside following Itachi's mental orders. Itachi walked over to where Madara had been standing and found that nothing was there except a crater. He turned around and blocked the attack that came from behind Madara still quite alive. Madara laughed and said, \"Well this has been fun, but it's all over now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara jumped back and glared at the three giants in turn, his eye taking on the unmistakable look of Mangekyo. Within seconds, the three giants walked over to Madara and got behind him. Madara laughed again and said, \"My Mangekyo holds the most powerful ability of any Sharingan. It has the ability to cancel any other technique used by a Sharingan. Any techniques you may use relating to the Sharingan fail if I so will it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi's expression remained impassive as he said, \"You can't bluff me Madara. The technique used to create those giants was not a Sharingan ability. I don't know if what you say about your eyes are true, but I do know that you merely hypnotized those three. They are still under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara shook his head and said, \"You really think any jutsu you use could overcome the power of my eyes? You're a powerful opponent Itachi, but you're no match for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi started walking forward and said, \"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze turned to the other three ninja and their eyes locked. Slowly, the ninja started walking back toward Itachi. They were halfway to Itachi when Madara sighed and said, \"And this is where I prove my eye's power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara flashed his gaze upon the unfortunate ninja and they instantly walked back to him. It seemed his words had not been a lie. Madara's Mangekyo was stronger than Itachi's. Therefore his hypnosis was stronger than Itachi's.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A half hour earlier, just after the rescue team departed, Jiraiya presented Kakashi with the scroll.  Kakashi would be lying if he told his comrades he was both excited and worried at the same time as he carried the 4th's scroll in his pocket as Team J moved through the woods.  He, like Jiraiya, knew the 4th Hokage in ways no one else did.  So knowing he made a growth scroll only made him wonder how close an eye he kept on Orochimaru and how lond did it take Orochimaru to perfect his jutsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, we're far enough from the village,\" Jiraiya said, \"Kakashi, use the scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Kakashi said, pulling out the scroll.  There was a moment of reverence as Kakashi held the scroll.  IN a quick flash, he opened the scroll and a beautiful color of yellow sprayed onto him.  With his sharigan eye, Kakashi saw that this dust was truly fine.  It was so fine, to someone who didn't know it was dust would think it was pollen from flowers.  Iruka, Shikamaru, and Jiraiya held their breath as Kakashi sky rocketed upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this feeling is amazing,\" Kakashi thought as he grew taller and taller.  Iruka, like Naruto before, grew to be a benchmark for Kakashi's new height.  But Kakashi quickly dwarfed Iruka and continued higher and higher.  From his 180 foot max, Kakashi stopped finally at 6300 feet tall, 35 times his original size and over 1 mile tall.  Kakashi quickly shrunk back to his old size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Shikamaru said, \"You were huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost scared to wonder how tall I would of been if some had gotten on me,\" Iruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a a little under 4.5 miles high,\" Kakashi said before they continued on their way.  The surrounding forest destroyed from Kakashi's feet and legs.  The team was very lucky in many ways.  Not only for having a good person to use the scroll on, but that Itachi and Madara never sensed the earth shaking due to them fighting with genjutsu at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the size of 20 feet, and carrying Jiraiya, the big three quickly found the missing giants due to the noise of them walking back and forth between Madara and Itachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, they shrunk and were hidden,  And over heard the following part of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't bluff me Madara. The technique used to create those giants was not a Sharingan ability. I don't know if what you say about your eyes are true, but I do know that you merely hypnotized those three. They are still under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara shook his head and said, \"You really think any jutsu you use could overcome the power of my eyes? You're a powerful opponent Itachi, but you're no match for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi started walking forward and said, \"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze turned to the other three ninja and their eyes locked. Slowly, the ninja started walking back toward Itachi. They were halfway to Itachi when Madara sighed and said, \"And this is where I prove my eye's power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that other guy has a sharigan?\" Shikamaru asked, \"What are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could either help Itachi, since he looks like he's on his last leg or wait for the other guy to finish him off and then move in,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we go now, you Shikamaru should bind all but Itachi as we move in.  I'll go after that Madara, while Iruka grabs Itachi from behind,\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll support Kakashi,\" Jiraiya said, \"So, should we move in?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't think we should go in now.\" Shikamaru said. \"We know Itachi is really powerful and this Madara guy looks even stronger. We should just wait for awhile. Madara will likely kill Itachi and then we can move in with the element of surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if Madara is too powerful for us to beat?\" Iruka said. \"We might need Itachi's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have to worry about Madara.\" Kakashi said. \"What can he do if I just grow to my max height and crush him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to decide it. They waited it out. The fight was brutal. Itachi sent waves of black fire at Madara all of which were destroyed by Madara's eyes. Itachi tried to send the fire at the giants but Madara was far too fast for that. Itachi soon realized his eyes were useless in this fight and switched tactics. He pulled out a smoke bomb and tossed it at Madara. It exploded blinding him for a few seconds before the smoke dissipated. Itachi used those few seconds to send three clones up to the giants' face. As soon as they touched their skin, they exploded pushing them back. Itachi then caught the three giants in a genjutsu and forced them to attack Madara before he could cancel the illusion. Itachi frowned as he saw Madara's body phasing in and out dodging the attacks with ease. The giants were soon back under Madara's power. Madara walked forward and said, \"Enough of these games Itachi.It's time I showed the second power of my Sharingan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi walked forward to meet Madara, ready to fight with whatever Madara through at him. Madara's eye flashed and, faster than even Itachi could follow, a force smashed into Itachi creating an enormous crater in the ground. Madara walked to the edge of the crater and saw that Itachi seemed to missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How disappointing. I wasn't even using a quarter of my power. I thought for sure Itachi would survive for at least another few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara turned to leave and found himself face to face with Itachi. Madara smiled under his mask and said, \"What a surprise. How did you survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi said, \"My most powerful defense. Susano.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara's eye narrowed and said, \"I see. How did you accomplish that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi continued, \"Your eyes can cancel any Sharingan technique. I knew that, yet I had a theory. If your were using your eye to attack, could you cancel my own techniques? That's your Sharingan's weakness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara clapped his hands and said, \"Bravo Itachi. You've managed to see my eyes one weakness. But our time together is now over. You were a worthy opponent as I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi jumped back as a ghostly skeletal figure appeared behind him. Madara's eye once again flashed and Itachi moved forward, the sword from Susano aimed at Madara, ready to trap him in an eternal genjutsu. The sword stopped inches from Madara as the unseen force smashed down on Itachi again. Susano stood no  chance. It smashed as easily as if it were a shadow clone and Itachi was once again forced deep into a crater. This crater was much larger and much deeper, burrowing straight down into the ground, the bottom lost to darkness. Madara knew that this time Itachi was through. He turned to his giants and said, \"Alright boys, let's get back to the hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could move, Team J sprang into action. Kakashi and Jiraiya moved to subdue Madara while Shikamaru and Iruka went for the giants. Madara easily dodged the attack and said, \"My, my, my. If it isn't the Leaf shinobi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi turned back around to face Madara and said, \"You don't stand a chance against us Madara. Prepare to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara tilted his head and said, \"Oh dear. You have no idea what you're dealing with do you?\"</span></div></div>",

Iruka went to his max and quickly attacked Kankuro by nailing several nerve and his five unprotected areas These were is eyes, ears, nose, throat and groin as none of them had any muscular protection.  With all five hit near simultaneously, Kankuro dropped from the pain.  Shikamaru turned his head when Iruka did the same strikes to Choji and Kiba.  In mere moments, the three giants were incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive double team,\" Madara said, looking at Iruka and Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're opponents are us,\" Kakashi said, growing large and focusing his sharigan on Madara.  Madara laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're borrowed sharigan can match up against mine?\" Madara asked before he was struck by Jiraiya wielding a rasengan.  But Madara merely fazed through the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jiraiya said, before realizing what happened, \"Impressive defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Madara replied.  It was then he felt himself being compressed into one spot and looked up at the 1000 foot Kakashi.  His sharigan had gone into its mangekyou form.  Mardara laughed again.  In a quick moment, he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did he go?\" Kakashi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well with that sharigan of yours,\" Madara said, now standing on a tree branch, \"To honor your advancement, I'll take my leave.\"  Madara coughed and rolled his head before going back to his Tobi voice, \"Now have a swell day all you  Leaf Shinobi!  I don't think Boss-sama will try growing any more of your people for a while.  You guys are just to big to deal with!\"  And in another blink, Tobi left to the main hideout.  Kakashi went down to 800 feet tall as Jiraiya went to Itachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, you're alive,\" Jiraiya said, looking at Itachi, \"Who was that man?\"  Itachi opened one eye and looked at Jiraiya.  The Toad sage immediately realized he was in a genjutsu.  Next to him was Itachi, but standing before him was a healed Itachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the last of my strength, I will answer your question,\" Itachi said, \"As ordered by the 3rd Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 3rd?\" Jiraiya asked.  Itachi nodded and went on to explain how the Uchiha clan was planning a coup.  How Itachi was picked as a double agent, that he was to slaughter every Uchiha to stop it, but couldn't kill his brother.  How Madara was a near ageless man and the only way to beat him was for someone to take Itachi's eyes and put them on another Sharigan warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is what you need to know,\" Itachi said before the healthy one vanished and the dying one's eye closed for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get back to the village now,\" Jiraiya said to the giants, \"That guy is above any of us.\"  The giants nodded and Kakashi picked up Kankuro, while Shikamaru and Iruka got Choji and Kiba.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Team J transported the three giants back to the Leaf Village, the remaining members of Akatsuki were joining together to discuss their next move. Pain looked around and saw that there were only a handful of members left. Zetsu, Tobi, Konan, Kisame, Kakuzu, and himself were all that were left. Deidara, Sasori, and Itachi had been killed by the Leaf ninja while Hidan's head had been stolen and his body sold for cash. Things were looking grim indeed for the organization. Pain sighed and said, \"Perhaps we have underestimated the tenacity of the Leaf shinobi. I think it would be best if we didn't try to convert them with the scroll. We have to think of a way to gain more power without worrying about losing that power to the Leaf village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the obvious choice is to make one of us giants.\" Kakuzu said. \"That way we can guarantee that no one will go rouge on us or get converted back to the Leaf village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame laughed and said, \"Yeah, good luck finding one of us who will be willing to stick our necks out taking on all the Leaf giants single handedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi laughed with Kisame and said, \"Besides do you know how big their biggest giant is? At least 1000 feet tall! How could we possibly stop that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could try a surprise attack.\" Zetsu said. \"Something the Leaf village won't expect or be able to retaliate with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human shield,\" Konan said, \"Or a bargaining chip would be best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, someone who's close to the Leaf shinobi. Someone who would cause the whole village to mobilize to save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I still think there are far too many giants of the Leaf village. We should focus our efforts on finding a way to shrink them.\" Pain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi straightened up suddenly and raised a hand into the air. \"Ooh! Ooh! Leader-sama! Call on me! Oh please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain sighed and said, \"What is it Tobi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi excitedly said, \"I did some spying in the Leaf village while Itachi was creating giants and I overheard people talking about when Orochimaru was attacking. Orochimaru had made a scroll that forced the giants to fight and the loser would shrink while the winner would steal their size! Maybe we can do something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestions kept coming from all sides, each one with its own pros and cons. While the Akatsuki discussed their next move, Tsunade was finishing healing Kankuro, Kiba, and Choji returning them to their normal size and sending them back to the hospital. All in all, the Leaf village was once again prospering. Tsunade and Shizune had been healing the bonds of the village all the while Team J was going after the three rouge giants and their efforts had not been in vain. It had been easy to convince the giants to stick together and not make trouble for the village. The real challenge had been in convincing the villagers that the giants were an invaluable asset to the village. She had done this by showing how helpful Naruto could be. Just by going along with whatever Tsunade told him to do was a big help in convincing the villagers. If Naruto could be kept under control, his strength channeled to help and heal the village, then anyone could. Tsunade also set certain laws into effect specifically concerning the giants, namely that they could only be a certain size when they were in the village proper and that they were responsible for any damage caused to the village that was directly connected to them. Things like this helped the village accept the giants as good and helpful rather than evil and damaging. There were still those who bore grudges but not all healing can be done in a single day. The village was on its way at least.</span></div></div>",

With Tsunade's healing going on, and no likely strike by the Akatsuki, both people and giants were getting along very well.  In different parts of the village, people were bonding in their own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke, working under Sakura's direction, were helping repair the damage done by Kiba's run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are doing great!\" Sakura yelled at the two twenty foot giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sasuke said, lifting some debris.  Naruto and his shadow clones also picked some up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't half as bad as I thought it'd be,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because Sakura's invited us over to eat at her house once again,\" Sasuke thought.  But if it got Naruto working with him, he'd have no qualms about the motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the main gate of the vilage, Shikamaru was escorting Temari to where she'd meet up with her brothers and her jounin-sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get a chance yesterday to say thank you,\" Temari said as they walked down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For saving your brother?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Temari said, \"What you did will go along way in helping good relations between our villages.\"  Shikamaru nodded, but felt that this wasn't the only relationship she was commenting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Shikamaru said before Temari stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just around this corner's the main gate, right?\" Temari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Shikamaru replied, he thought Temari already knew this.  Suddenly Temari leaned in and kissed Shikamaru on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay strong you big lazy fool,\" Temari said before going around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari, what are you blushing about?\" Gaara asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business,\" Temari replied in her normal tone.  Shikamaru was smart not to continue following her around the corner as Kankuro looked that way before they departed back to Suna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Guy, once again at a restaurant, was also enjoying some bonding time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Neji, I am so sorry for my hubris!  And for making you feel umbrage against me!\" Lee said as they ate some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee, two things,\" Neji said taking a napkin to his face, \"One, you already apologized to me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thirty times yesterday,\" Tenten added in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, if you're still going to do it, don't have food in your mouth,\" Neji finished.  Lee swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" he said.  \"I am so happy that we are getting along once again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my wonderful students, you truly are bonding nicely,\" Guy said, \"But the best way to ensure you bond completely with each other is for you to wear each others' underwear!\"  Neji and Tenten nearly choked on their food.  Both exchanged glances and knew to get out of there before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wonderful idea Guy-sensei!  I'll take mine off right now!\" Lee shouted loud enough for the entire place to hear.  \"Wait, I forgot to wear some today,\" Lee said right before he dropped his pants.  Neji and Tenten looked at each other again.  It was too late, for them because they realized deep down, they truly weren't bothered by this anymore.  And that is something that really scared them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya smiled as he once again looked through the village and seeing all the bonding and healing going on.  With Team 7 being the corner stone of Tsunade's plan, it worked very well.  He was also lucky to catch Temari's kiss to Shikamaru.  He made note of it and would add that to his next Icha Icha book \"Big Lovers\".  As he passed Team Asuma, they were enjoying a nice meal at the Bar B Que.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if we could only get those damn elders to talk about what Itachi was saying,\" Jiraiya thought as he went to Tsunade's where she was meeting with them right now.  And in the hospital morgue, there were 10 ANBUs lead by Kakashi, protecting Itachi's remains from anyone who might try destroying the body for any reason.</span></div></div>",

Itachi had planned ahead in case he wasn't able to kill Madara. When his life ended, the order that was hidden in the back of Teuchi's mind sprang forward and took control. Itachi didn't want any part of his body being found by the Akatsuki or used by the elders of the Leaf village. He made sure to tell Jiraiya that his eyes needed to be implanted in a Sharingan user if they were to be able to take on Madara. He had made sure to make it sound urgent for this specific purpose. By this time Itachi had expected his eyes to have been removed and given to Sasuke since he was the only other full blooded Sharingan user left besides Madara himself. Kakashi might work in a pinch, but his single Sharingan wouldn't be as effective against Madara as Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyo would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Itachi's eyes were still resting in his head, the operation to remove them and implant them in Sasuke still only an idea in Jiraiya's head. He never suspected Itachi of trying to have his own body destroyed so quickly. Teuchi turned to his daughter and said, \"Ayame, I'm going to deliver some ramen to the ANBU at the hospital. Can you handle things here for awhile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Ayame said, smiling at her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi stockpiled as many lunch boxes as he could, heading for the hospital. Itachi had been very specific in his instructions. He knew that his body was going to be put under high surveillance until it was decided what to do with it. Teuchi was to use the ramen as a distraction. As soon as the lunch boxes were opened smoke bombs would go off casting the entire area into a smoke filled haze. At that time Teuchi was meant to plant incendiary bombs on Itachi's corpse, burning it until it was nothing but ash. It would only take a few seconds to accomplish the entire mission and Itachi's last secrets would be safe from everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Teuchi made his way to the hospital, Tsunade was talking with the elders about Itachi's last words. She had been trying for hours to wheedle the information out of them but they were steadfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Itachi say something like that at the end of his life? What could he have to hide? Is it true what he said?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had asked question after question in this vein but the answers had all been the same. Itachi was a known criminal trying to hide his crimes of the past by making something up on his death bed so he wouldn't be remembered as a criminal. He was trying to stall for time to use some last ditch attack to kill the surrounding Leaf ninja. On and on the back and forth went neither party giving any ground and the discussions getting absolutely nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Teuchi was arriving at the morgue of the hospital, his trap prepared.</span></div></div>",

When he got close to Kakashi, he whispered, \"Also I'll have too much come the next shipment.  Business has been real down lately.  I need to get rid of my over stock.\"  He gave an embarrassed laugh.  Kakashi nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell anyone,\" he said and accepted the 11 containers of ramen.  Teuchi started back out as the ninja opened the containers.  There was a blast of smoke and Teuchi turned around and burst through the doors.  He saw Itachi's body and threw the incendiary bomb.  The body ignited and Teuchi smiled as his master's face was burnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kakashi was right,\" came a voice from behind Teuchi before  he felt something wrap  around him  He saw wooden planks bond tightly around him as a twelfth ANBU came from the shadows.  \"A decoy body was needed after all,\" he said, looking at Teuchi.  Kakashi soon entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decoy body?  Then where's the real one?\" Teuchi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we won't be telling you that,\" Kakashi said, \"But you'll be visited by Ibiki soon and we'll learn all about you and your work as Itachi's spy.  We'll also need to bring in your daughter, Ayame for questioning as well.\"  Teuchi said nothing, but felt some saddness his daughter was being dragged into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, at a cave where the Akatsuki were meeting, Pein sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in the past 24 hours, we got no where in terms of deciding what to do,\" Pein said, \"The only thing we did agree on was to use our own servants or cause civil unrest between the normal people and the giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we never decided on how,\" Kazuku said.  \"If that's all, I'm going off to collect some more bounties.\"  And in a flash, his projection vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also out of here,\" Kisame said, \"I have other things to do.\"  Kisame also vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pein-sama,\" Konan said finally, \"You could always grow one of your other bodies.

About ten miles away was another cave, this one deeper underground than the official Akatsuki hideout and this is where they were meeting. Kakuzu, Kisame, and Zetsu arrived within about five minutes of each other. When they were all there Kakuzu said, \"So what are we going to do? Everything we've done so far has either ended up killing one of us or giving more power to the Leaf village. At this rate, the Leaf village will be able to police the entire country making any of our private exploits impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame shook his head and said, \"You really only care about money don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu shrugged and said, \"There are worse things to be obsessed with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu coughed and said, \"Does anyone have any ideas at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu rubbed his face and said, \"There has to be someway to obliterate the Leaf village quickly and silently. An attack from the sky or the sides or underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame and Kakuzu both looked over at Zetsu. He looked from one to the other and said, \"I don't know what you both think I'm capable of but there's no way I could destroy the entire Leaf village in one shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame's suddenly widened and a sharkish grin rose on his face. \"No you couldn't. At least...not at your current size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu nodded and said, \"That's something we never thought of before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu looked slightly nervous as he said, \"That sounds a little...desperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame rolled his eyes and said, \"Well as it is things are getting desperate. If we don't do something our leader is going to try another attack which is no doubt going to fail again possibly granting a Leaf giant even more size and power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu sighed and said, \"Well, do either of you even know how to make a growth scroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu pulled a scroll out of his robe and said, \"I stole this awhile back when you first found Orochimaru's body. Sasori didn't even notice it missing. With this we could make a scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame grabbed the scroll and opened it. \"Hmm...this looks a little complicated. This kind of jutsu really isn't my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu sighed and said, \"You're trying to pin all the work on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu quickly said, \"Don't even think of looking at me. I have no idea how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame tossed the scroll back to Kakuzu and said, \"Well let's just both make a scroll and use them both on Zetsu. We're guaranteed to get some good size that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakuzu agreed and said, \"Besides, we're not letting him go until he's big enough to swallow the Leaf Village in one shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZetsu shook his head and said, \"That's almost unimaginable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisame grinned again and said, \"Well you only need to get that big once. After that you don't ever have to get bigger than this if you don't want to. Now let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the remaining Akatuski members planned their fiendish plans, Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke were gathering at Sakura's house for dinner. Sakura was making a variety of dishes including ramen for Naruto. As Sakura cooked, the boys sat at the kitchen table talking. Sasuke was staring out the window for about five minutes before Naruto said, \"Something on your mind Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked at Naruto and said, \"I was just thinking about Itachi. I always lived my life seeking the chance to kill him and now that he's dead, I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted and said, \"Is that it? Why don't you start rebuilding your clan? That always should have been priority number one in my opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sighed and said, \"Do you know what I have to do to revive my clan? I'm a little young for that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head and said, \"Whatever. I don't really know what you're talking about, but there's always other things you can do. Revenge is a stupid reason to live anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned from the stove and said, \"I agree with Naruto on this one Sasuke. You're better off now that Itachi is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke still didn't know the truth about his brother. He still thought of him as a cold blooded murder rather than a hero of the Leaf village. The time would come when he would be told, probably by Kakashi, when he was older and could except the truth. Until then, he'd just have to find another purpose to his life. Ten minutes later Sakura was handing out the dinner and everyone stopped talking to start eating. The meal passed quietly without much talk interrupting it. When it was over Sakura set the dishes in the sink and said, \"I'll take care of those later. What do you guys want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, leaning back in his chair, said, \"Hmm...I don't know. I don't really feel like training after all the fighting we've been doing lately and we just ate so I'm at a loss for ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smirked and said, \"Is fighting and eating all you ever think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jumped up and said, \"Oh like your constant revenge talk and dark brooding was any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura got between the two boys and said, \"Now don't you start! The last thing I need is my house destroyed by a giant squabble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys sat down again and Sakura sighed, sitting down as well. Things hadn't changed all that much after all.</span></div></div>",

In truth, Hinata had been following the group around watching them from the shadows. She loved to watch Naruto work, whether it be at his normal size or his giant size (She had almost fainted once when he was working without his shirt on, all his giant muscles flexing). But she couldn't say that to Sakura. She couldn't say, \"I've been stalking you for the past few days because I want to watch Naruto and wish I could be a part of his group of friends.\" So what could she say? Finally, she decided on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been very lonely lately since Kiba and Shino are always working on rebuilding the village. I don't have anyone to talk to or just be with and so I was wondering if I could come in with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat at least was partly true. Kiba and Shino had both been pretty busy but Kiba at least seemed like he was trying to make time for Hinata. But now that he was in the hospital all she had for company was Shino and all he wanted to do was go around looking for bugs when he wasn't working. She waited with bated breath, hoping Sakura would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled at the timid girl and said, \"Sure! Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled back and said, \"Thank you very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked inside and Sakura closed the door behind her. When they got back to the kitchen, Naruto grinned as he saw Hinata and said, \"Hey Hinata! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed furiously and managed to stutter out, \"N-not much Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head at Hinata's behavior and said, \"Weird.\" quietly to himself. Sasuke just raised a hand as a greeting. Sakura pulled out a chair next to Naruto and said, \"Come on and sit down. Naruto just sent out a shadow clone to get some board games for us to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata actually looked cheerful as she heard this. \"That sounds like fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at her and said, \"How good are you at Risk or Konoha-opoly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata replied, \"I've never played Risk but I'm pretty good at Konoha-opoly. Is Risk hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke shrugged and said, \"That depends on how good you are at strategy games. You have to know where to send your armies and how many soldiers you want to attack your enemies. You also have to be careful that you don't bog down units of your army in weak countries or get them stuck trying to cross a river. That'll just leave open targets for your enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds hard.\" Hinata said. \"But I'll try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if Naruto can play it you shouldn't have any trouble!\" Sakura said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's not fair!\" Naruto shrieked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at this (except for Sasuke of course. But he still smiled). Suddenly, the door burst open and Naruto's shadow clone came running in with two board games clutched in his hands. He set the boxes down and disappeared in a puff of smoke. Naruto unstacked the boxes and said, \"Alright, which one guys?\" </span></div></div>",

While she was confident in working various armies in Risk, she didn't want to go up against Sasuke in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're left with Naruto,\" Sasuke said, \"I wonder which the fool will pick?\"  Naruto glared at Sasuke, but saw through his chide.  He wanted to play Risk and probably have the advantage.  Truthfully, Naruto did understand Risk as he's read the rules several times while alone.  But Sakura wanted to play Konoha-opoly and he knew Hinata stood more of a chance there than at Risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to play Konoha-opoly,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because it was the first game I thought of,\" Naruto said, unpacking the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, dibs on the Kunia,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the Nin-dog,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the ANBU mask,\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll take the headband,\" Naruto said.  With the tokens decided, Naruto set the board up on the circular table.  They sat so Naruto was across from Sasuke.  Hinata was on Naruto's right, and Sakura on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's roll to see who goes first,\" Sakura said, rolling the dice.  Sakura got 8.  Sasuke then rolled and got a 7.  Hinata took the dice and got 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice roll Hinata,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Hinata said, timidly as she handed the dice to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I got 3!\" Naruto said before handing Hinata the dice back.  And since they would go counter-clockwise, Naruto would be last to roll.  Sakura, as banker, handed out the funds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I go,\" Hinata said, rolling a 12 again.  \"Konoha Electric company,\" she said, \"Uh, can we buy the first time around or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Naruto said.  Sakura and Sasuke gave no objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Hinata said, paying the money and rolling again.  She got a 10 by 6 and 4.  \"Chance,\" Hinata said moving her token and pulling the orange card.  \"Move to nearest utility.  May buy if unowned.\"  Hinata moved to the water works and bought that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, when you said you were good, you weren't kidding,\" Naruto said as Sasuke took the dice.  Hinata blushed from the compliment as Sasuke rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snake eyes,\" Sasuke said before looking at Naruto.  \"Don't even say it,\" Sasuke said before he pulled a Community Chest card.  \"Pay $150 for Academy tax.  Darn it,\" Sasuke said handing the money over to Sakura.  Sasuke rolled an 8, by 6 and 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go to visiting,\" Sakura said.  Sasuke moved there and Sakura rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes 5!\" Sakura said as she went to Main street and quickly bought it up.  Naruto took the dice and got 3 again.  He moved to Ichiraku Ramen and bought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" Naruto said, as it became Hinata's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game proceeded long into the night.  Naruto, by many bad rolls, ended up landing on many of Hinata's properties and paying most of his money to her.  Sakura was able to obtain all four Big Streets and took much of Sasuke's fortune, even after he got both Hokage's mansion and Damio's castle.  Hinata was able to get the three second most costly properties, Hyuga Estates.  A few more minutes passed and Naruto and Sasuke both had to retire as they went bankrupt.  They both went in the same turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now it's just you and me,\" Sakura said, looking at Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hinata said.  While Hinata had fewer properties, she did have the two monopolies around the \"Go to Jail\" square and a few other scattered properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the battle of the Kunoichis began with them trading funds between each other as they landed on the others properties and buying up any of the boy's now owner-less property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you guys call it quits and count your money?\" Naruto asked as he and Sasuke cleaned up the dishes from dinner, four hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this isn't going to end very soon,\" Sakura said.  Hinata nodded and started counting her money.  Sakura did as well.  \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without property, $783.  With, $1252,\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without property, $709.  With $1306,\" Sakura said, smiling.  \"That was fun.  Want to play again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" both Naruto and Sasuke said together after finishing with the Kitchen.  Both girls laughed at how both guys had the same expression on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Hinata said yawning, \"I need to get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do spend the rest of the night?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay as well?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind,\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offered.  Of course I wouldn't,\" Sakura said before looking at the guys.  \"I'll clean up the game and you can pick it up in the morning,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Naruto said, \"See ya later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice night,\" Sasuke said as both left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun,\" Naruto said, \"But man, Hinata was good with those dice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how good she'd of been if she was focused completely on the game,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else was she focused on?\" Naruto asked as they walked down the street.  Sasuke just shook his head and bid Naruto good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the girls, as they put on some night gowns, Hinata borrowing a set of Sakura's, Sakura looked at Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really like Naruto, don't you?\" Sakura asked, putting a mat on her bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, do you?\" Hinata asked.  Sakura thought for a minute before answering.</span></div></div>",

She had been under the impression that Sakura liked Naruto as much as she did. If it wasn't for Hinata's cursed shyness she would've admitted her feelings to Naruto long before this. But she just couldn't bring herself to say it. Every time she even started getting close the words would fumble in her mouth and Naruto would get bored or think she was weird and walk away or change the subject. If Sakura had liked Naruto then Hinata probably wouldn't have stood a chance. Sakura seemed to notice Hinata's relief and said, \"Don't get me wrong though, something might pop up between us. Feelings change and maybe someday you won't even like Naruto as much as you do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head and said, \"No, I'll always feel this way about Naruto. I've never felt differently about him. I've just never been able to say what I feel. I just get so nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura patted her on the back and said, \"It takes time to get up the courage to tell someone you love them. What you need is a friend to help you through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at Sakura in surprise and said, \"You'll help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and said, \"But I don't think it would do much good at this point. He's so obsessed with me I think you'd just turn him off by telling him you loved him out of the blue. Instead, you just have to be more open with him. Get to know him better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded slowly, her heart beating faster just thinking about getting closer to Naruto. She lay down on the mat and said, \"This is all so sudden. I-I don't know if I can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura climbed into her own bed and said, \"Don't worry about it. With me helping you it'll be a cinch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned out the light and pulled her blankets up high, moving lower down in bed to keep warm, sighing in contentment. Hinata sighed and looked up at the dark ceiling Naruto's face appearing out of the darkness. She blushed as she saw his usual grin and whispered, \"Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and turned on her side wondering what was going to happen in the coming days.</span></div></div>",

So, as he awoke another body, he picked up the scroll in a attacking body and opened it up.  Pein slowly rose in the air until he came to 60 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, five times larger,\" Pein said, \"Konan, throw me another.\"  His partner, Konan, threw the scroll and it burst open.  Pein rose again, this scroll was one of the ones created later.  Pein grew to the height of 540 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will do,\" he said as his summoning body walked up to Konan to carry the scrolls.  \"Where's Madara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went off to find the other Akatsuki,\" Konan replied, as Pein shrunk down in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Kakuzu and Kisame were worn out from making the scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't like this,\" white Zetsu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  It could be fun.

Zetsu figured that's what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you,\" Kisame said.  But nothing else was said from those Akatsuki as Amaterasu was smmmoned and burned them all to dust.  Madara went forward and picked up Kisame and Kakuzu's scrolls and pocketed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun,\" Madara said, \"I wonder if my lackey will try killing me?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madara thought about what had just happened as he made his way back to the Akatsuki's hideout. It was bad enough they were losing members due to the Leaf ninja, now the remaining members were engaging in acts of treason and deceit. Now only three members of this once powerful and feared organization were left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it is time that I make one of these scrolls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, with his skill he would no doubt be able make a powerful scroll but who would he use it on? Could he still trust Pain and Konan? They had been the most loyal out of all the Akatsuki members, probably since they had the most control in the organization and he let them run the whole organization. Madara weighed his options as he entered the Akatsuki's hideout. Pain turned to look as he walked in and he said, \"Did you find them Madara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara shook his head. \"Wherever they are, they obviously don't want to be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain's eyes narrowed as he heard this. The two men just stared at each other, each trying to guess what the other was thinking, what the other was planning. Pain broke the contact first, turning back to Konan. \"Very well. Then we should finish preparations for our attack on the Leaf Village. Once we do attack, we will destroy Konoha completely, leaving only the jinchuriki of the Kyuubi.After we destroy the village, we will move on to Suna and get the jinchuriki of the Shukaku sand spirit. The rest of the tailed beasts will fall one by one after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara slowly walked around the cave, listening to Pain talk. He was only half listening. He knew what Pain's plan was going to be. It was rather obvious. Madara had the instructions to make a growth scroll in his coat. He still wasn't sure if it was in his best interest to use it, but he was sure the giants of the Leaf Village had at least three giants that were far above Pain's height of 540 feet. If he did make a scroll it would have to powerful. Very powerful. It didn't help that Pain was starting to lose faith in him. Judging by his body language it seemed like he knew Madara was hiding something. Oh well. There would be time to deal with that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the Akatsuki planned their final attack, Teuchi was brought before Tsunade for questioning. Now that his last instructions had been completed, Teuchi had only one thing left to do before Itachi's control left him completely. Tsunade sat behind her desk listening as Teuchi retold the story of Itachi's life, confirming all the terrible events from his initial drafting as a double agent all the way to his own death at Madara's hands. The last thing Teuchi said was, \"Itachi had been using me as a spy since he joined Akatsuki, hoping to keep an eye on Sasuke so that the elders didn't try and finish him off while he was away. He wanted it to be known that I was performing this task against my will and that I should not be punished for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and closed her eyes trying to take all this in. At least Sarutobi-sensei never agreed to the massacre Tsunade thought gratefully. It was all the elders fault. There's and Danzo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi suddenly sat up straight and said, \"Excuse me Lady Hokage but why am I here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stared at Teuchi and realized he was telling the truth. Obviously Itachi's last vestiges of control were now gone. Tsunade assured him that she had just wanted to see him about some trivial matter. Within minutes he was gone back to Ichiraku to continue his business in peace. Tsunade folded her hands trying to keep her cool. Those bastard elders were liars. The worst kind of liars. They had been keeping secrets from the Leaf Village all these years. A coup...the Uchiha's had been planning on trying to take control of the Leaf Village by force. Those actions would've caused a mass civil war between the Uchiha and the other forces of the Leaf Village. Many would of died. Did it justify the massacre of the entire Uchiha clan? Itachi had thought so. So had the elders and Danzo. The Third Hokage had thought it was a bad idea. He hadn't wanted to go through with the massacre but the others overrode his own decisions. Regardless, it was all over. But the elders would have to answer to this. Tsunade got up and headed for their council chamber. </span></div></div>",

Shizune was paralyzed by the immense anger and killing intent in the Hokage's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could of happened to make her like that?\" Shizune wondered as she pressed herself against the wall, waiting for Tsunade to pass and when she did, Shizune went to find other Jounin to warn them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere on a roof of a building, Jiraiya had been waiting to hear from his informants.  He was waiting to hear about Akatsuki movements when he saw Tsunade pass a window in her mansion.  When he saw her face, even for a moment, he knew there was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Teuchi confirmed Itachi's story.  If he did. . . I better get in there,\" Jiraiya said departing his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was within sight of the elder's room.  As she took another step closer, she felt Jiraiya appear behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Jiraiya.  Leave me,\" Tsunade said before continuing on.  Jiraiya followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it Teuchi confirmed everything I told you?\" Jiraiya asked grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I know this isn't some hoax either,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was how Teuchi repeated the words of the old man in his story,\" Tsunade said, \"His words, his reactions were right on the spot.  And it were things that no one but those who've seen that man under great stress and deliberation would of known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you want to go kill the three elders?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Tsunade said, \"I want to punish them.  The entire slaughter of a clan is too far.\"  She now stood before the doors.  In a swift moment, she punched the doors and sent them across the room.  Inside the chamber, Danzo, and the others were sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade, what's the meaning of this?\" Koharu asked, seeing the two remaining Sannin standing before them and coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breaking a door is far better a crime than murder of a clan,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back to that business again?\" Homura asked, \"I thought it was realized that Itachi was lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did his spy confirm every detail? Jiraiya asked, \"Including actions by the Third.  Actions that he would of only done when faced with an impossible choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't that impossible,\" the cold and logical Danzo said, \"For the greater good, some may need to be pushed away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then you did order Itachi to do it,\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was for the village.  A civil war would of destroyed Konoha.  You must see that,\" Homua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't condone what you ordered done,\" Jiraiya said, \"Neither the First or Second would of gone that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was because they joined with the Uchiha clan that we had this problem,\" Danzo said.  \"They were all power hungry and wanted more.  Madara was the worst of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if would of enjoyed watching the civil war from his grave,\" Koharu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uchiha Madara's alive,\" Jiraiya said, \"He was the one who killed Itachi.\"  For the first time in a long time, all three elders showed signs of surprise at hearing of Madara's health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not possible!\" Homura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itachi called his murderer by that name and he had a sharigan,\" Jiraiya said.  All three elders exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is the Hokage going to do to defend the village now?\" Danzo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will die to protect this village.  If you were so concerned about it, you should of killed the Uchiha's yourself,\" Tsunade said.  \"But for now, I need to deal with your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned to Jiraiya and whispered something in his ear. Jiraiya frowned and whispered something back. Tsunade gave him a dark look and nodded. Jiraiya turned and left. Tsunade turned back to the elders and said, \"I've decided on the perfect way to punish you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you threaten us Tsunade.\" Koharu said softly. \"After all we've done for this village since your grandfather started it. Have you no respect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade laughed harshly and said, \"You three don't deserve respect. I'm going to make you think twice about trying something like this ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura stared steadily at Tsunade and said, \"What would you have done in the first place Tsunade? A war is on the village's doorstep. Two clans that had been at war since the very beginning. Are you saying you would've let this destruction be unleashed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head. \"I would've found a way to solve the problem with no bloodshed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo suddenly looked furious as he shouted, \"You stupid woman! Do you truly believe the Uchiha were to be reasoned with? Those power hungry demons would've slaughtered this entire village for their damned pride and you would've just let them do it! I can see it in your eyes! You're a dreamer, one who can't possibly understand the harsh realities of this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stared levelly at Danzo and said, \"No. You're wrong. I'm not living in a dream. You are living in a haze of distrust and fear. You couldn't possibly understand the bonds that run through this village. The First, the Second, the Third, the Fourth...they all understood those bonds. And so do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one else had time to say anything else. Jiraiya had returned with Sasuke at his side. The three elders realized what Tsunade was thinking and Koharu quickly said, \"Tsunade beware what you're about to unleash. Remember the sins of the past. Don't do something you'll regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled coldly and said, \"That's sound advice. All those years ago, perhaps you should have heeded it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she turned to Sasuke. Staring him straight in the eye, she explained everything to him. All the details of war, of coups, of his brother, of his entire family, and of Madara as well, she told him all. When she was finished Sasuke was left in shock his entire world view changed in an instant. The shock was slowly replaced with rage. He started growing, filling the council room until he was at his full height of twenty feet. Tsunade had been expecting this. Sasuke charged for the elders, hands outstretched to  grab, to hit, to destroy. Instead, he found them grabbed by Tsunade. Using her great strength she managed to hold him in place though it was obviously taking great power.to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke stop! You can't kill them! That is the one punishment that is forbidden! If we were to kill them the balance of the Leaf Village, of the country of Fire, of the other countries and villages could all be disrupted. Distrust and fear could spring up and we could be looked on as dangerous rogues. Instead, I'm allowing you to decide their fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took awhile but eventually Sasuke was back to his normal size, dwelling on a punishment for the elders.</span></div></div>",

Jiraiya looked back from the doors where he was standing guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again no,\" Tsunade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I want them stripped of their position in this village.  All of them are to be followed by your personal ANBU until they die.

Tsunade didn't know what they were trying to do, but she wasn't about to let them escape. With a curt nod to the ANBU, the elite ninja moved in to apprehend the elders. Before they reached them, a barrier rose around all three. Homura and Danzo turned to escape out the window but Koharu stayed behind. She looked directly at Tsunade and said, \"You won't get away with this. What we did needed to be done. There's no denying it no matter how idealistic you may be. We will report this behavior to the Fire Daimyo. Do not be surprised if you are stripped of your title. That may very well prove to be the least of your worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three elders jumped out the window the barrier constricting around them until    it surrounded them like a cloak. With a strange shine of chakra the elders disappeared from view. Tsunade turned to the ANBU and said, \"I want them found. They are not to leave this village under any circumstances. Send out any available ninja and bring them back for their punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ANBU quickly rushed to obey this order. Tsunade turned to Sasuke and said, \"I never expected something like this to happen. Don't worry. They will be found and their punishment will be enacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke crossed his arms and said, \"What happens if they do get in contact with the Daimyo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya stepped forward and said, \"It's possible that the Daiymo could order a change in the way the village is run. As the ruler of the country where the Leaf village resides we are technically under his laws. We have our own code of laws which we follow but they are subject to be changed at his whim. Normally he lets the village run itself since we're the main military power in the country. But if the elders tell their side of the story Tsunade will be deposed as a dangerous zealot and be replaced. No doubt the elders will have nothing nice to say about me or you either.

They won't escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it began. As many ninja as were available patrolled the entire village searching for the invisible elders. Even the ninja that were guarding Itachi's body and the ones guarding the village gates. Finding the elders was given the top priority since if they got out to the Daimyo everything they were currently working on or for could be changed or destroyed. Unfortunately, this left the village very open.</span></div></div>",

With his other hand he produced a lighter and flicked it open, lighting the fuse and sending the rocket into the sky where it exploded in green sparks. Instantly several shinobi appeared out of nowhere surrounding the other ANBU, Kakashi, and Hiashi. Danzo picked up his cane and shouted, \"Root ANBU this is your most important mission to date. Subdue this traitorous group of shinobi and allow us to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Root ANBU darted forward attacking the group led by Kakashi. As the ANBU attacked   the three elders attempted to escape. They didn't get far though. As soon as the Root ANBU had started attacking Kakashi had started growing. The Root ANBU found their attacks all hitting Kakashi and each one doing little to no damage. With a few swift kicks Kakashi was able to subdue the entire group of ANBU. They had been at an extreme disadvantage due to their surprise at Kakashi's monstrous size. With Kakashi able to defeat the Root ANBU, the other ANBU and Hiashi were able to chase after the elders surrounding them once again,forcing them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu sighed and said, \"So this is how it ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi stepped forward and said, \"You've brought this upon yourselves. But you will not be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura shook his head and said, \"We shall be looked upon in disgust for the rest of our lives, confined to chairs as our spines are broken.

There may come a time when those you counted as friends and allies turn against you and threaten your life. What will you do then I wonder? I hope I live long enough to see it for myself. Nothing in this world is certain. It never was and never will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi had heard enough. With a simple signal the ANBU moved in and rendered the elders unconscious, their bodies falling to the ground. When they awoke they would find their legs dead and unresponsive as Tsunade herself would sever the nerves in their spines. At last the Uchiha had been avenged and Sasuke could live the rest of his life out in peace, free to choose whatever path suited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though there was cause for celebration in Team Seven, the troubles of the Leaf Village were not yet over.</span></div></div>",

Pain narrowed his eyes at the Uchiha and said, \"What is it Madara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara advanced on Pain and said, \"Well, I've been thinking Pain. This organization as gone downhill as of late. Once it held the attention of the world and it still served my purposes as well as yours. But now that my purposes are no longer being served, I don't believe I want to be a part of this anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain turned to stare fully at Madara. He came within inches of Madara's mask and said, \"So be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Madara was surrounded by Pains six bodies, each preparing to attack from a different location. Madara's eye narrowed then blasted back open revealing his Mangekyo Sharingan. Before any of Pain's bodies could attack they were all crushed at the same time by Madara's power. It seemed that even Pain had no idea of the true scope of Madara's eyes. Madara turned his gaze on Pain and said, \"Now you and Konan will attack the Leaf village. If you are captured to be interrogated you will tell them you killed me in a coup. If they kill you on sight, then Konan will deliver the message then surrender herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke of Konan his eye glanced in her direction capturing her in his power as well. Pain would've been a better match for Madara if he had known the attack was coming. As it was, all he could do is watch as Madara crushed the last of his organization under his heel. Madara watched as Pain and Konan ran off in a futile attempt to attack the Leaf village. Thanks to Madara they were sure to be killed almost as soon as they were in sight. The giants had no peer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that will eventually turn to their downfall.\" Madara said to himself as he left the cave that had been the Akatsuki hideout for so long for good. \"The next generation is so impressionable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadara laughed to himself and disappeared into the afternoon heading for a place of hiding to plot his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went almost exactly as planned. Pain and Konan infiltrated the Leaf village but were quickly spotted and captured. They were interrogated and willingly gave up their information without the need for torture. This was instantly found suspicious by Jiraiya who had come to know the Akatsuki and their ways over the years. He met with Tsunade on top of the Hokage Mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the looks of this.\" He said. \"Those two gave up way to easily. And weren't there at least three other members of Akatsuki still alive? Where did they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and said, \"I suppose it would be foolish to think that the Akatsuki would fall so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madara.\" Jiraiya said simply. \"He must be behind all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could his plan be?\" Tsunade said tapping her foot impatiently. \"Why would he try this fruitless attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't trying to harm the Leaf village. Ibiki told me that Pain said Madara was dead. Judging by the state of Itachi and his words there's no way that  Madara would fall so easily. I'm guessing this whole thing was a plan to make us think that Madara and the Akatsuki were all killed so that we'd be lulled into a false sense of security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned toward her desk and started writing. \"Then we'll send out parties to search for him. He won't be able to hide for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so for all intents and purposes the Akatsuki was finished. Other criminals strove to fill the gap left by the powerful organization but no one could really measure up. With the giants patrolling two major portions of the country not many criminals got a chance to rise in power. Night and day Tsunade had ANBU search for Madara or even Madara's corpse but he had disappeared completely. Eventually security decreased around the the village as it entered a period of peace. Relationships developed and fell and new bonds were formed and broken. Thanks to the giants no one in the village felt fear from the outside threats that had once been prominent in their mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet peace is never absolute. Years later, Madara was planning his next move at last.</span></div></div>",

In that time, Konoha had become the strongest of the great five villages, with Suna being right behind.  Though the other villages respected the strength, they never gave up trying to find their own growth jutsu to even the playing field.  But the only people who knew how to make them, never revealed these secrets.  Madara and Tsunade both kept this information to themselves.  Both knew how powerful and dangerous this could make even a tiny country.  And neither wanted to upset the balance, well Madara didn't want to yet.  He was still waiting for the right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this ten years, Tsunade retired from the position of Hokage once Team Seven had all become jounin.  In her replacement, Tsunade chose Kakashi as the next Hokage.  With her free time, Tsunade researched the affects the dust had on the giants.  And it wasn't until one conceived a child a few years after the end, did she know what else transformed about the giants.  Their sexual organs also transformed.  In the human reproduction, men will either give an X or Y chromosome to the X egg.  When she was examining the fetus of Asuma and Kurenia in Kurenia's womb, she discovered that the child had a different chakra than what it was meant to have.  After many tests, she discovered that Asuma's giantism had been encoded on the Y chromosome, so any male born from a giant would inherit his father's burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ten years, Team Seven had become powerful force, near equals to the Sannin, and this was when all were at their smallest heights.  Sakura had become Tsunade's rival in terms of beauty and medical ability.  Sasuke had advanced to the Mangekyou Sharigan after truly grieving for his brother's death and realizing the lose of a good man it was.  Naruto had become a near physical copy of the 4th Hokage, but had still never learned he was his son.  He also had created many powerful jutsu, some of which had become forbidden due to their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi's corpse had been preserved and his eyes untouched.  Sasuke had refused the eyes when offered to him, still wanting to come to his own power on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of romance, between some, it flourished, while others still required some shoves out the door.  It took a few years, but in this day, Temari of the Sand was engaged to Shikamaru of Konoha.  The commute between the two villages, but both had earned the permission of their Kages to have the relationship.  Gaara was happy his sister found someone to love, and as the Kazekage, he knew this would help the alliance between the villages.  Hinata had blossomed into a beauty of her own and gained much confidence when it came to Naruto, but she still hadn't confessed.  Ino had come to a similar development.  While before she had a young girl's crush on Sasuke, now it was a true deep love.  But both girls were ignored by their loves as each man had developed serious feelings for their female teammate.  And Sakura had come to give that she cared about each man a great deal, but was still unsure of who she loved more.</span></div></div>",

It was the kind of day that no one could be mad during or even want to fight. But it was also the perfect conditions for a mission and that is exactly what Team 7 had just finished doing. Ever since becoming jonin, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura had been routinely assigned the most difficult missions due to their incredible power individually and especially as a team. Just today they had finished an S rank mission in the Land of Waves. Lately there had been supporters of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist that had been rising in power ever since Zabuza and Kisame fell. The other Swordsmen had been weeded out their swords used to mark their graves. A few years later seven ninja had rose stealing the swords out of the graves and calling themselves the Second Coming of the Seven Swordsmen. They had dropped the mist moniker since it was comprised of ninja from several different villages. They had started out as a minor nuisance barely worth worrying about. Then they had started becoming more and more bold in their attacks. It was discovered a few months back that they had trained in the ninja arts of those whose swords they held, adding it to their own jutsu mixing styles together on occasion to create attacks never before thought of by shinobi. Finally, it was requested that the Leaf village take care of this threat. Naturally, Kakashi sent out Team 7. After staking out the situation for most of the previous day, the three ninja had attacked the New Seven. Between the three the Swordsman were flummoxed. They managed to pull off a few spectacular moves separately and together forcing Naruto and Sasuke to actually change their sizes. Finally, they had managed to finish them all off. The battle had raged for at least three hours taking quite a bit out of the ninja. It had been a spirited battle and all three were in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was walking slightly ahead of the other two laughing at their victory. \"That was the best fight I've had in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura caught up with him and said, \"What about that group of thieves we fought ending with an attack by one of Orochimaru's leftover experiments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke walked up to the other side of Naruto and said, \"Naruto just doesn't remember that one since he got knocked out before it could really get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed as Naruto turned to Sasuke and shouted, \"That's not fair! I was cheated out of that fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, are you always so loud Naruto?\" a voice said from behind the three ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned and grinned as he saw Shikamaru and Temari walking behind them. \"Hey Shikamaru! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping.\" Shikamaru said in a suffering voice. \"For the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right!\" Sakura said. \"When is the big day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks from today.\" Temari said. \"We've already got most of it planned out but there's some last minute things this lazy man was supposed to take care that he didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not surprised.\" Naruto said, smiling at Shikamaru who rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's just get this over with.\" Shikamaru said, pulling Temari slightly on her hand. She tightened her grip on his hand and said, \"Alright, alright. You're usually not in such a rush...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched the soon to be newlyweds, Sakura tilted her head and said, \"Did Temari seem different to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged and said, \"Different like how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like she was in a better mood then she normally is. I thought she'd be a little more annoyed that they still had to shop for supplies for the wedding. What do you suppose happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke said, \"Maybe she's pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ninja turned to look at Sasuke in surprise. He looked back and said, \"What? It's possible. They may only be getting married now but how long have we seen them together? Who knows how long they were seeing each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Sakura said. \"Anyway, let's go report to Kakashi-sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three made their way to the Hokage Mansion where Kakashi was sitting in his office, looking over some papers. He looked up when Team 7 walked in and said, \"I take it the mission was a success?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran forward and shouted, \"Of course it was! What did you think was going to happen Kakashi-sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi laughed and said, \"Well here's your payment anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Naruto a small stack of money which was then divided between the three ninja. Kakashi watched as the three started leaving, talking amongst themselves. Sakura suddenly stopped and turned back. \"Oh, Kakashi-sensei I have a question. Lady Tsunade's been doing research into Asuma and Kurenai's baby right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi nodded. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...no reason.\" Sakura said. \"Medical curiosity. Where is she right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shuffled through some papers and said, \"I believe she's relaxing in the Hot Spring today. If you do go and talk to her make sure you don't sneak up on her. Unless you like being punched over 1000 meters away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed and said, \"Thanks Kakashi-sensei. I'll see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched Sakura leave before turning to Naruto. \"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, who had already started heading towards Ichiraku for some celebratory ramen, turned back and said, \"What's what about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke rolled his eyes and said, \"Are you blind Naruto? She's wondering about giant's babies. Doesn't that mean anything to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about it for a minute before his eyes widened. \"You don't think she...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke nodded and said, \"It's possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto narrowed his eyes at Sasuke suspiciously. \"You aren't involved in this are you, you pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smacked Naruto in the head and shouted, \"Idiot! Why would I bring this up if I was doing something with Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, could you two take this outside?\" Kakashi said, staring levelly at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both left, deciding to follow Sakura to see what she talked to Tsunade about.</span></div></div>",

But who do I like?\"  Sakura was so conflicted for a moment, she accidentally bumped into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Sakura-sama,\" Iruka said, looking at his old student, as they just bumped shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iruka-sensei, you don't have to use that with my name,\" Sakura said, \"I mean, I was your student first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geese Sakura, don't you know this lunkhead is always the polite one?\" Anko asked, as she stood next to Iruka.  \"By the way, how was your mission yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went really well,\" Sakura said, \"And Naruto's probably off at the Ichiraku, spending everything he has, again.\"  The couple laughed and went on with their respective walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar behind Sakura, Naruto and Sasuke followed carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what she wants to talk to Tsunade about specifically?\" Naruto said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're following her dummy,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura continued on her way, but seeing Iruka with Anko made her move a bit quicker to the hot springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could that be what's holding me back?\" Sakura wondered, \"Could knowing what type of child I might have make me so uneasy?  I mean a normal fetus is only so big, but if it were to grow inside of me, Sasuke's would be within manageable terms.  He just better hope for only one child.  If it was Naruto's,\"  Sakura shuddered a little, \"I'd be dead before the second trimester.\"  Soon she made it to the hot spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just shuddered,\" Naruto said, \"She hasn't done that in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be serious,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking if Tsunade was there, Sakura went to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade-sama,\" Sakura said from a distance behind the former Hokage, \"May I join you?\"  Tsunade turned around.  Her jutsu was still intact and looked like she hadn't aged a day in ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, what brings you here?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a big mission yesterday and needed to relax,\" Sakura said.  This was partially true, despite her other desires.  Sakura slipped into the hot waters.  \"So nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how is little Daiki?\" Sakura asked about Asuma and Kurenia's first born son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's much like his grandfather in terms of honor,\" Tsunade replied, 'Or did you mean his inheritance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That as well,\" Sakura said in a serious tone, \"What effects are their on him from Asuma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you know, no matter how tall the boy will grow naturally, his giant side is stuck without another scroll,\" Tsunade said, referring to all boy giants who were now men.  None of their maxes increased, despite them gaining a few inches in their shortest form.  Sakura nodded.  \"Daiki was shown to grow to exactly 65 feet maximum.  He also couldn't start growing until he had really started using his jutsus.  so if you're worried about a giant womb, that will only happen if you have quadruplets or more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was worried about that?\" Sakura asked in a panic.  Suddenly she looked out at the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried about peepers?\" Tsunade asked, \"Remember, they put a a mineral in the water so people can't see in.  Jiraiya was pissed at that.  But as my last law, I had to do something special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sakura said, \"I guess I'm just worried about my team mates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Tsunade asked, now serious as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care about both a lot.  Both have helped me grow and I've helped them,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't know who you love more?\" Tsunade asked.  Sakura nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that I don't have to worry about any child I have killing me, it brings me back to the start of it again,\" Sakura said.  Tsunade sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, you don't have to pick one of them, you know,\" Tsunade said, \"Try going out on dates with others as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I might try that,\" Sakura said, \"That might help me get my head together.  But whose still available?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking me?\" Tsunade asked before both started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, on a rooftop, Sasukewas trying to read lips with his sharigan, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Sasuke said, \"Every thing's fuzzy over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this sucks,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very stupid to try and peep on the two strongest women in the village,\" Jiraiya said, appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pervy Sage,\" Naruto said, \"But we weren't peeping.  We wanted to know what they were talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Jiraiya said, \"The steam prevents any vision from entering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always dream kid.  You can always dream,\" Jiraiya said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsunade rose and said goodbye to Sakura as the young Jounin sat in the waters and thought about possible other guys to date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, Choji's available.  But not really my type.  Shino's nice, but some of his bugs just creep me out.  Kiba is inlove with Hinata, so that would just make things too weird.  Whose left?\" Sakura thought.  Sakura rolled her head and the last two guys her age came to mind.  \"Lee and Neji.  It's been, gosh, six months since Neji and Tenten split up.  And from what I heard, it was a mutual agreement that they were better as friends than boyfriend/girlfriend.  I wonder if he'd go out with me?  Well, only one way to find out.\"  Sakura rose and went to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gone,\" Sasuke said, \"Let's get closer and follow her some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to know what she's up to?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it any of our business?  I mean, come on Sasuke, what are we?  Two perverted guys who stalk our friend to the spas?\" Naruto asked.  \"You can be it, but leave me out of it.\"  And then Naruto vanished just as Sakura left the main room and was on the road again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, at the Hyuuga Manor, both Neji and Hinata were hard at work.  The jounin Neji was training the chunin Hinata and Hanabi at the same time.  Today, they were sparing against the other.  Hinata had come a long way in terms of her Byakugan skill.  Hanabi was equally gifted.  Suddenly there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, take a break you two,\" Neji said, leaving for the main door.  Hinata and Hanabi were worn out today from the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting better Sister,\" Hanabi said, \"Maybe Naruto will finally notice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe Lee will notice you,\" Hinata shot back quickly.  Both girls stared at each other and then looked away.  Hinata was happy when she found out about her sister's crush on Rock Lee.  Using it usually shut her up, as it wasn't as well known as her own interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji opened the door.  \"Oh, what are you doing here?\" Neji asked his visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Neji, I came to see you,\" Naruto said, \"I have a question that I think you can help me with.  May I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Neji said.  Neji was confused.  Rarely did Naruto ever come to the Hyuuga manor.  Even more rare was when Naruto and Neji had a talk that wasn't about a recent mission.  A talk about a private nature was unheard of.  \"This way to my quarters,\" Neji said, leading Naruto.  As they passed the sparring ring, Neji called out, \"We're done for today.  Get some rest.\"  His cousins looked up and saw Naruto walk by with Neji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?  What's he doing here?\" Hinata said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he wants to ask Father's permission to date you?\" Hanabi chided.  Hinata could only wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto now sat in Neji's living room.  He was waiting for Neji to bring some tea in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what did you want to talk about?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know how your relationship with Tenten affected your missions,\" Naruto said, \"And you with Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Neji said, \"Well, when we were dating, I had to put my relationship on the back burner when I was on a mission.  And with Lee, at first it was difficult.  But eventually, we got to a status quo.  He must of felt like a third wheel sometimes.  But he never showed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Naruto said, sipping the tea before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wouldn't have to do with you and Sasuke liking Sakura, would it?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does,\" Naruto said, \"I don't want to pressure Sakura, but I don't want to lose to Sasuke here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it really be a lose if Sakura was the one who wanted him?  If you wanted Sakura's happiness above all, wouldn't that be more important than an age old pissing contest with Sasuke?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Neji.  Thanks,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.  Guy told Lee and me the same thing a few years ago about Tenten,\" Neji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have to use them on Sasuke as well,\" Naruto said, laughing as he stood up.  \"Thanks a lot Neji.  I'll see you around.\"  Naruto walked and let himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the doors of the Hyuuga Manor, Sakura stood and knocked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto had decided to leave by the back exit of the Hyuga Manor since he would end up closer to his house anyway. As he walked away down the street to his house Hinata slowly walked up behind him her heart pounding. She had followed after she had heard Naruto leave with Hanabi giggling behind her. She had ignored her sister's snickering knowing this was as good a time as any to maker her feelings to Naruto completely known. She would lead him to asking her out on a date and see how things went from there. She followed him for a few minutes hiding behind bushes, fences, and trees until she finally worked up all the courage she could and ran out toward Naruto saying, \"Naruto! Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned around and smiled when he saw Hinata coming towards him. \"Oh hey Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had finally stopped thinking of Hinata as a creepy girl who constantly fidgeted in front of him and always acted really uncomfortable. He had been beginning to think Hinata was afraid of him or something. Luckily she had loosened up around him. She was smiling at him as she caught up and asked, \"Can I walk with you Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked surprised at first and Hinata's heart sank. Then he smiled at her and said, \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked on in silence for a few minutes before Hinata said, \"How have your missions been going Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and said, \"Great! Kakashi-sensei's been giving us some really good ones! How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I've been getting by.\" Hinata said. She didn't want Naruto to think she didn't do anything exciting or that she was shying away from tough missions.Being a Chunin she didn't get as many tough missions as Naruto was getting as a Jonin.She got closer to Naruto and said, \"So what are you doing tomorrow Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about it and said, \"Well...as long as Kakashi-sensei doesn't saddle us with any missions I'm not really doing anything. Why? Oh! Do you want to do something tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could've sung with happiness! She smiled and said, \"Sure! That would be wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata and Naruto walked to Naruto's house, Sakura was waiting anxiously by the door of the Hyuga Manor. She was nervous since she didn't know how Neji would take to the idea of dating her. She wasn't even sure whether or not she wanted to date him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have to keep my options open.\" Sakura told herself sternly. \"Naruto and Sasuke aren't exactly undesirables. There could be a chance that both of them already have their eyes on someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura ruminated the door opened and Neji appeared surprised to see her. Sakura smiled and said, \"Hello Neji. Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji nodded and said, \"You know, Naruto came by just a few minutes ago to talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked shocked and said, \"Really? W-what did you talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems he was worried that relationships between squad members could cause the bonds they shared to break.\" Neji said, showing Sakura into the same room he had talked with Naruto in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...\" Sakura said quietly sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that he has his eye on someone on his team.\" Neji said. \"But he's willing to put these feelings aside if it means the happiness of the person he loves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could almost feel tears welling up in her eyes. To think that Naruto cared that much about her feelings that he'd step aside and let her be with Sasuke if that's what she wanted. Neji handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose on it. He smiled at her and said, \"I think I've answered any questions you may have needed to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sniffed and said, \"Oh no, I was wondering something completely different. Now I'm not so sure I should ask but...would you ever consider going out with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji considered Sakura's question. He knew she probably was only looking for a little security but he had never really considered going out with Sakura before. He had looked  at her over the years as a capable shinobi but his feelings had never developed beyond that. Now that he thought about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked her in the eye and said, \"Yes I would Sakura. If things don't work out with Sasuke or Naruto I would be willing to go out with you. However, I'm not going to wait around while you decide whether or not you have feelings for your squad mates. I have a life of my own after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked a little embarrassed as she said, \"I never expected you to. Anyway thanks for talking with me Neji. It really helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji showed Sakura out and watched as she walked out of sight. Things could get very interesting around here...</span></div></div>",

And he created the Giantess-Harem Jutsu,\" Sasuke thought, as he turned his gaze back to Sakura as she left the spa.  He watched as the girl he loved walked on, but Naruto's words rung in his head.  Sasuke growled and didn't follow Sakura.  \"I hate it when he gives those speeches,\" Sasuke said, \"He actually says intelligent stuff.\"  He then vanished and wandered around for some time, thinking on what Sakura might of been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Sakura's call at him made him look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke,\" Sakura called, \"Where have you been?\"  She walked up in front of him and looked up into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just wandering around,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not doing anything?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Why?\" Sasuke replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to get some tea?\" Sakura asked, \"My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sasuke said, smiling.  The two went to a little shop and sat down.  As they waited for the tea, Sakura looked at Sasuke with a warm smile.  But there was more to this smiling face than the smile it self.  Sakura was studying Sasuke's face for any unconscious action he might give in response to what she had planned.  But this act was well hidden that Sasuke didn't even notice it.  The tea came and both sipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke,\" Sakura said, \"May I ask you a hypothetical question?\"  Sasuke blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sasuke replied.  He had an uncomfortable feeling in his gut, but dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say, you liked Ino a lot.  So much, you wanted to date and even marry her, okay?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Sasuke said, \"Are you jealous of this desire of mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd be happy for you.  But what if Ino and Choji decided to go out.  What would you feel?\" Sakura asked.  Sasuke blinked.  His mind was quickly putting the \"what if\" to reality.  Sakura was Ino and Choji was probably either Naruto or himself.  The unknown was what the point of this idea was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would feel sad,\" Sasuke said, \"Sad that I let something slip though my fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, even if I didn't feel that way about Ino at first, she liked me before Choji.  For me to let that go, I'd feel stupid.  I'd probably wait and see if things didn't work out, especially if things went south,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you'd be a shoulder to cry on and help her get back with Choji if she really wanted it?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I may not like doing something like that, but then again, this is all hypothetical, so who knows how I'd act,\" Sasuke said.</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that she had become friendly with Ibiki Morino, while studying under Tsunade.  As a result, she picked up a few interrogation tips neither Naruto or he knew.  Out of his team, he would have to note that Sakura could be, at times, more dangerous and deadly than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you like to do now?\" Sasuke asked, finishing his tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to do some shopping,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll see you later,\" Sasuke said, smiling a little.  Suddenly he looked out the window.  \"Hey Hinata and Naruto are walking together,\" Sasuke said.  Sakura turned to the window.  Through the glass window, she saw Naruto talking to Hinata about something and Hinata was laughing and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for them,\" Sakura said, sweetly.  It was for only a brief moment, but she felt a sting seeing them together so casually.  Luckily, for her, Sasuke didn't notice the act.  \"Well, by Sasuke,\" Sakura said.  Sasuke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata and Naruto walked past the tea shop, he was telling her about the time he invented the Giantess-Harem jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so when I made it, I had just used it to get Sasuke to blink.  It was an old game we had to see who would first,\" Naruto said.  \"I first tried my standard Sexy Jutsu.  But unfortunately he was wasn't fazed.  He then tried a fireball jutsu on me.  He told me only a powerful attack would work, not some stupid little girl.  I came out of the transformation and grinned.\"  Naruto paused for dramatic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do next?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I created 20 shadow clones all around him and transformed used the Harem jutsu.  He was weakened, but really blinked when all the clones grew and smothered him,\" Naruto said, laughing, \"He wouldn't speak to me for a week.\"  Hinata laughed as well.  She didn't find the story that funny, but enjoyed Naruto speaking so casually.  She also blushed slightly thinking on what that image must of been for Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did anything happen next?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sakura beat me up for making another perverted jutsu,\" Naruto said, \"And my attack helped Jiraiya to write his next Icha Icha book.\"  Naruto stopped.  \"Hey, I wonder if Kakashi promoted me to chunnin for helping with that book?\" Naruto said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you serious?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Naruto said, \"Just playing with you.\"  Hinata's blush went deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke wandered the streets back to his home, he thought on what happened with Sakura.  It took him by no surprise she wanted to know how starting a relationship with either him or Naruto would affect the team.  She always one to want to know everything before making a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is again,\" Sasuke thought sensing someone watching him.  He turned and decided to call them out on the deserted street.  \"Hey, come on out,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt worried when Sasuke called her out.  In ten years, Ino had become a a striking beauty.  Her face and body could rival both Hinata and Sakura's.  Now a Chunnin, she served mainly as a teacher at the Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped from the roof top she was on and approahed Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,' Ino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, why were you following me?\" Sasuke asked.  He wasn't angry and could of guessed why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had come to ask you,\" Ino started.  Sasuke resisted the urge to interject.  \"Would you like to go on a date with me?\" Ino finished.  Sasuke blinked and a small smile came to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sasuke said, \"Why not?  How about tomorrow night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'd love that!\" Ino said, \"Thank you Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Sasuke said.  Inwardly Sasuke wondered how Sakura would feel about this.  While he did like Sakura a lot, he also found Ino a very nice person to talk with.  He knew he'd enjoy this date, even if things didn't work out between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would never know how deep she felt about either boy if she didn't press the relationship with them.  Considering what Neji told her, Sakura would ask Sasuke out during a meeting they'd have with Kakashi that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura walked down the street, she saw Temari and Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I wanted some good fruit for breakfast you lazy bum!\" Temari yelled as they were sitting on a bench, having a morning snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geese, all they had were apples.  They wouldn't have the plums or pears in until next week,\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi you two,\" Sakura said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Sakura,\" Temari said, smiling, \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great.  But if I do't hurry, I'll be late for a meeting with Kakashi,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even as the Hokage, he's late,\" Shikamaru said, \"I wouldn't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he might restrict our missions if one of us is late.  Neither of the guys would like that,\" Sakura said, hurrying on.  Temari laughed, before going back to scolding her soon-to-be husband about what fruits she liked, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura got to Kakashi's office, Naruto and Sasuke were waiting for her.  Kakashi wasn't there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're almost late,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran into Shikamaru and Temari,\" Sakura said, \"I got chatting for a minute.  So sue me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what are we here for at this hour of the day?\" Naruto wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called you here,\" Kakashi said, appearing from no where.  \"I just wanted to tell you about another mission I have planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ready?  We just got back yesterday,\" Naruto said.  Everyone looked shocked.  Naruto was complaining about being assigned a mission?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this one won't be for a few days,\" Kakashi said, \"As you know, Shikamaru and Temari's wedding is coming up.  What you don't know is how many important official of the Fire County's government will actually be attending.  Two days before the event, you three will escort them to the village and back to the capital after the reception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will we have any aid?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering the delicacy of this mission, yes.  We don't want to take any chances, so you will have to pick three more people to help,\" Kakashi said.  The three exchanged glances.  Without much talking, they came to a relative idea of who to bring along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neji would be good,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuma would also be a good choice,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Iruka,\" Sakura said.  Kakashi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choices,\" Kakashi said, \"That's all for today.\"  They could see a smile beneath his masked face.  He turned the chair and pulled out one of his favorite Icha Icha books.  His former students left quickly, not wanting to disturb him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was interesting,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't pick Hinata,\" Sasuke said, \"You two seemed close yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are friends,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you want a mission today?\" Sakura said, interjecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have a date tonight,\" Naruto said.  Both his teammates stopped in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With who?\" Sakura asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata,\" Naruto said.  \"It just sort of came up as we were talking yesterday.\"  It was then he noticed Sasuke chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too ironic,\" Sasuke said, \"I also have a date tonight.  Mine's with Ino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Sakura gasped, \"When did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was walking home,\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is funny,\" Naruto said, \"So, uhh, where should I take Hinata?\"  Both Sakura and Sasuke exhanged glances.  They shouldn't of been surprised by his question, this was Naruto after all.  But even after more than a decade working together, he still found something to say that made them speechless.  Neither responded and just vanished, leaving Naruto alone in the lobby of the Hokage's mansion.</span></div></div>",

A pink dust was created. and the scroll sealed itself.  \"Now open it Hidan,\" Sasori said, returning to the puppet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Hidan said, opening the scroll over him.

Suddenly, Hidan started growing...sort of. Within minutes Hidan's right arm swelled up and burst the sleeves of his coat, the enormous appendage slamming into the ground. Before anyone could blink, Hidan's left foot started growing as well, bursting the sandal off. Hidan fell down as his left foot started raising his body into the air. Landing on his back, with his left foot pointing up into the sky, Hidan started cursing out Sasori while Kakuzu shook his head in disgust and Deidara laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the $%**# did you do to me?!?!?\" Hidan yelled, unable to move much due to the weight of his giant limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori checked over the scroll detailing the jutsu and said, \"We were too hasty.

Orochimaru created it with the intent of using it for a permanent servant.\" Sasori explained. \"In other words, we have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasori got out of the puppet again and performed the jutsu a second time, laying the dust on the scroll and sealing it. Sasori climbed back into the puppet and said, \"Alright, when half an hour goes by sprinkle the dust over the rest of Hidan's body. You have to wait though. I modified the jutsu this time so the two scrolls will be in equilibrium with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Akatsuki were forced to wait around to use the jutsu again.</span></div></div>",

Naruto had been caught off guard at Kiba just up and attacking him.  Now he was ready for a fight, with his increased strength and natural speed Naruto was easily dodging every attack.  After almost two minutes of non stop attacking Kiba had yet to land a hit.  Naruto was smiling at how good he was doing, which only served to make Kiba madder, which led to him fighting even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba threw yet another punch that was easily dodged, and then Naruto saw his opening.  He landed a quick punch to Kiba's side that sent him flying and crashing hard in to the ground.  Before Kiba could even think about standing up, Naruto had plowed in to him with a big kick that had all of his power behind it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was over, Kiba was not getting up.  As Sakura and Naruto watched his body started to glow blue, and then inch by inch his body started to shrink.  His height reduced, and his muscles shrunk until everything was back to normal.  Maybe a little bigger then normal if her eyes did not device her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came phase two, everyone knew what to expect.  Naurto started to grow.  His biceps bludged outwards more, but not anything that would endager his range of motion.  His chest pushed out standing proud and scuplted on his body.  His abs were firm ridges, and his back just radiated power.  His hight inched upwards, until he was over 20ft.  He would still be a little smaller then Shikamaru, but Sakura barely reached his knees now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that was over, Sakura was hoping to find the scroll so they could be done with this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto thought about it for a moment...then snapped his fingers. Of course! He knew a way he could show off AND hide at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the village, Kiba was just returning home after a mission. He tossed aside his sweater, his body finally able to breathe. It was a hot day and that sweater wasn't making things any cooler. He really needed a shower. He took off the fish net shirt he wore under the sweater and tossed it aside. His mother, sister, AND father were all off on an extended mission so he had the whole house to himself! He could let his clothes lay anywhere, eat whatever and whenever he wanted, and have absolute privacy. Heck, he could walk around naked if he wanted! Right now though, he just wanted to clean himself off. He had his hand on the doorknob to the bathroom when there was suddenly a thunderous knocking at his door. Kiba growled in frustration and opened the door. Just ignore it. He didn't want to worry about visitors right now. He was about to close the door to the bathroom, ignoring the constant knocking, when the front door suddenly was blasted off its hinges. Kiba ran back out into the entrance way to his house and skidded to a halt, gaping at the huge man who was framed in his doorway. All that could be seen of him was his huge naked torso, visible since the jacket the person was wearing was unzipped and forced wide open. His orange pants were more like shorts, rising above his knees. His head was above the door frame, invisible to Kiba's eyes. Of course, he didn't need to see a face to recognize the searing orange outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...? What...how...?\" Kiba stuttered, not quite believing what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto put one meaty hand on over the door frame, gripping it between his massive fingers and bent down, grinning at Kiba. \"Hey Kiba! Your family is gone for awhile right? I'm staying with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a request. Naruto shoved one arm and shoulder through, bent over more, and crammed himself through the doorway, his huge pecs getting stuck. Naruto took a deep breath, his chest expanding, cracking the doorframe worse, allowing him to barely squeeze himself in. \"Damn...stupid tiny door...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just gaped at his front door, totally destroyed. Naruto, still bent over slightly since the ceilings were only about nine and a half feet tall, looked around. \"Man...this place is kind of a dump...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stomped forward, the whole house shaking slightly with his every step. Kiba quickly shoved the front door back into place as quickly as he could. It wasn't perfect, but it would hold for now. He then ran back to the living room to see Naruto taking up the whole couch, sighing as he leaned back, his arms stretched across the entire back of it. There was only a little bit of room on either side of his huge thighs. He grinned as soon as Kiba appeared before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place you got here. I'm going to enjoy living here for awhile!\" Naruto laughed, the couch creaking and groaning under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Kiba finally found his voice. \"There's no way you're staying here Naruto! I don't know WHAT is going on but I DO know you're not just going to break into my house and act like you own the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reached out and yanked Kiba forward, his grin looking slightly sinister as he stared at Kiba. \"Oh yeah? And who's going to make me leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grabbed Naruto's fist and tried to break his grip but no matter how he struggled he couldn't escape. Naruto was way too strong now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Fine! You can stay here for a little while!\" Kiba relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's evil grin turned into an easy going smile and he dropped Kiba back to the floor. \"Good! Now...how about you make me something to eat? A big guy like me gets really hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba paled a little at that. Naruto was a bottomless pit when he was normal sized...just how much could he eat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snapped his fingers and said, \"Hey! I SAID get me some food! Now get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba clenched his fists and shouted, \"Screw you! I'm not your slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lifted one foot up and kicked Kiba's legs out from under him. Kiba hit the ground, hard, on his back. Naruto pressed his enormous foot down on top of the smaller boy, pinning him easily, the foot covering most of Kiba's torso. Naruto wiggled his toes in Kiba's face and said, \"Yeah, while I'm here, you are! Big guy makes the rules, so if you don't want me to break some bones, you'll do what I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tried to shove the foot off his chest but he couldn't so much as budge it! In fact, Naruto was slowly increasing the pressure! \"Okay! Okay! I'll get you your damn food!\" Kiba shouted. The pressure disappeared, along with the foot, and Naruto said, \"Good! Make it something delicious! And don't stop bringing it until I tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba walked sullenly to the kitchen. So much for his ultimate vacation...</span></div></div>",

Kiba thought as he realized that he could use this as an excuse to get away from the massive, growing kid on his couch. He ran to the door fast enough so that Naruto couldn't react in time, and opened it. What he saw left him breathless. He was face to face with someone's abs! He slowly tilted his head upwards, and saw who the massive kid was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIKAMARU!?\" Kiba yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed, and simply replied, \"I kind of... need a place to stay. I heard that your family wasn't going to be here for a while, and I'm pretty sure that my parents wouldn't like to see that their son was almost eight feet tall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stood there, speechless. Shikamaru really had grown. He had already gotten rid of his jacket and shirt, leaving his massive chest bare. His pants looked more like shorts on him now, and his monstrous thighs were putting too much pressure on them as tiny rips were visible. Kiba then looked down, noticing that Shikamaru's massive feet were bare. He was probably to lazy to get new sandals after the first pair had burst off of him. He continued to stare as Shikamaru until he heard him as, \"So? Can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why not!? You AND Naruto can stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru walked in, and asked, \"Naruto? Why is he-Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on a couch that was no longer big enough for him, Naruto stared at Shikamaru, yelling, \"Hey! You grew too! Why don't you lie down somewhere, Kiba was about to make me something to eat. I'm sure he wouldn't mind making enough for both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is NO way I'm feeding both of you!\" Kiba shouted, being really mad now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. \"Yes, you WILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru examined Naruto. He was bigger than he was! At first, he had thought that there was something wrong with him, but now, he had living proof that he wasn't the only one growing! He was getting worried.</span></div></div>",

He sighed and looked over at Kiba. \"Well? Weren't you getting us food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grumbled and seemed about ready to say something when Naruto swatted him a little and said, \"You heard him! Get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba yelled a little, his skin getting bruised where Naruto struck him. He sullenly went into the kitchen and started looking through his cupboards. He and his family ate a lot of meat so there was quite a few different types. Beef, pork, chicken...he pulled down all the meat he could find and then dragged out a bag of rice. Meat, rice...he could probably make some soup too...he pulled out some noodles and other spices and decided to just make a huge pot of ramen. Naruto would love that and if Shikamaru had a problem...well food was food. He normally would just refuse and then kick Shikamaru out...but now...well, he couldn't do that. He sighed and just started making food. It would only be a week or so...he could survive this. Hopefully Naruto's ego wouldn't get any worse...there was no telling what he might force him to do otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba began preparing the gallons upon gallons of ramen for his hungry \"guests\", Naruto sighed and smiled at Shikamaru. \"So, why are you growing Shikamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru, who had his eyes closed and seemed to be asleep, opened one eye and said, \"It just started happening. I was just napping, minding my own business, and when I woke up, I was this big and all my clothes were tattered. It was way too troublesome to even try and find other clothes. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto explained about the scroll and the dust. Shikamaru tilted his head and muttered, \"Where have I heard that before? It sounds familiar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Has something like this happened before?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shrugged and said, \"I can't remember. I really don't care either way. Maybe now people will be more willing to leave me alone and just let me nap...\" He wiggled his toes a little and said, \"Man...my feet are sore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said, \"Good thing we have a little slave to rub our feet for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smiled a little and said, \"We just have to make sure he doesn't leave the house and squeal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't taken much to turn Shikamaru to Naruto's way of thinking. It came of being larger than life and naturally lazy. If he could have people do all the work for him why would he complain? It was like a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry!\" Naruto said. \"I'm going to keep a close eye on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba heard Naruto's loud obnoxious laugh and wanted to punch something. He did NOT like being a slave to those two! He couldn't hear their conversations but he had an idea what was going on. He dumped the seared meat into the broth and kept stirring. He had two huge pots, one for each Naruto and Shikamaru. Would it be enough? He hoped so. This wasn't any fun at all. It would only be a few more minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Dog boy! Where's our food? Hurry it up!\" Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba growled and shouted, \"HOLD ON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and crossed his ankles. Life was good~</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto loved all of this! He was massively huge, being about eleven feet tall, and, he was still growing! Secondly, he now had Shikamaru with him, going through the same thing. He wasn't as big as him, or growing as fast as him, and that was how he liked it. He still wanted to be the biggest, after all! And then... there was Kiba. He didn't have to move one of his massive muscles, since Kiba was now going to take care of, and hide him. Though, Naruto wondered how long him and Shikamaru would actually be able to live in Kiba's house. Everything was perfect! That is, for the first few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his towards Shikamaru, noticing that his eyes were once again closed. But, soon enough, he noticed   something. The smaller than him, but still massive boy in front of him, was growing! And fast! Shikamaru's body slowly took up more and more room on the small chair he was in, his head also inching upward. His biceps had swelled noticeably as had his forearms giving his arms a broad, strong look. Naruto looked down at Shikamaru's legs and noticed his thighs thickening, his calves bulging and his feet growing and moving across the floor to accommodate his new size. As Naruto stared in disbelief of his friend's swelling body, he noticed each of Shikamaru's pecs were growing fuller and rounder, being filled with unbelievable power and mass, and soon, his abs followed. Naruto could hear Shikamaru's bones cracking as they grew longer, his shoulders also widening as his back flared out. Soon, he was left in only a pair of tight, grey boxers, with his manhood being outlined in them. Shikamaru was to heavy to be held up by the small chair he was sitting on by now, and it ended up collapsing. With this, he woke up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's going on!?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to answer, still stunned by Shikamaru's rapid growth spurt, \"You grew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru looked himself over, not believing what he saw. While napping, he had grown massive! Just by looking at Naruto, he could tell that he was at least two feet taller than him. Naruto wasn't happy about that. \"Uh... great. As if my day wasn't already stressful enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, Kiba walked in with a pissed look on his face, with their food. \"YOUR FOOD'S READY! Are you-holy crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of him, sat Shikamaru. Even while sitting, he was at least a foot and a half taller than Kiba! His massive feet stood out in front of him, and he wiggled his toes. \"I'm going to need a foot rub when I'm done eating!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Kiba yelled!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The huge pots of soup were, thankfully, enough to fill up Shikamaru and Naruto, although barely. Naruto was still rubbing his stomach with an annoyed look, trying to see into the kitchen to find out if there was more. Shikamaru, however, leaned back against a wall, shoving a few cushions and pillows under his back to be more comfortable. Without any further preparation he shoved his feet up against Kiba and said, \"Alright. Foot rub. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shoved the foot aside and said, \"J-Just give me a second! I have to do the dishes first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and looked over at Naruto. \"Hey Naruto. Go do the dishes. I want my foot rub now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted and said, \"Like hell! I'm not going anywhere! Kiba's the one who does the dishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru lifted his other foot and shoved it against Naruto's thick chest, shoving him backwards off the couch. \"How about this? The biggest makes the rules. Now get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at Shikamaru. That shove...Shikamaru wasn't supposed to be that strong! Those extra feet and the extra mass in his muscles really gave him a significant edge over Naruto. This wasn't good...Now HIS perfect vacation was getting ruined! Shikamaru was lazy...but now he was also strong. Naruto had seen him when he got serious in a battle. He wasn't sure he could take the genius level shinobi in a one on one battle. At least not without wrecking the house and revealing them to the public. Suddenly Naruto smiled. The biggest made the rules huh? He grabbed the pots and said, \"Alright. I'll wash the dishes...THIS time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto easily carried the pot into the kitchen and began washing. He knew that he was growing. Eventually he would outstrip Shikamaru in size and THEN he'd make his move! He turned on the water and dumped some soap into the sink. He started scrubbing, sitting cross legged on the ground in front of the sink. It wouldn't take long for him to finish washing the dishes...but just the idea that he was being ordered to do this made him incredibly angry. HE was supposed to be giving out orders. Well, in a few hours at least, he'd be able to take on Shikamaru and reassert himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Shikamaru had both of his massive feet up on Kiba's lap. \"Okay, first the left and then the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned as he began rubbing the left foot. It was about the size of his torso, the heel resting in his lap while the toes were just brushing his chin. Kiba winced a little as he ran his hands over the soft foot. Shikamaru didn't walk around unless he had to so his feet were surprisingly soft for a ninja. They still had the smell of feet. There was no avoiding that natural smell. At least they weren't sweaty and stinky or covered in toe jam or something. Kiba started by rubbing his hands up and down the sole. Shikamaru moaned a little, his toes curling as Kiba's small hands rubbed over his foot. Kiba moved up from the sole to the toes, rubbing each to individually, followed by rubbing between each toe. Shikamaru shivered a little. It appeared his toes and feet were pretty sensitive. After about five minutes of rubbing, Shikamaru shifted his left with his right. Kiba sighed and started the whole process over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...you're doing great Kiba...\" Shikamaru said with a small smile. Kiba felt a strange sense of satisfaction. Shikamaru was being a lot nicer than Naruto and he had pushed Naruto over and ordered him around. He had enjoyed that. He kept rubbing it up and smiled as he remembered these memories.</span></div></div>",

He just backed up, put them back on his lap, and continued rubbing. Kiba snickered slightly as he felt the teen giant's toes tickle under his nose, and looked back at Shikamaru. His smile was much wider than before, and for some reason, his head seemed to be moving upward. It didn't take long for Kiba to figure out that, once again, his young friend was growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba moaned. \"My God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Shikamaru's body rippled and undulated, slowly swelling before his eyes. His shoulders broadened, while his thighs pumped up and swelled, knearly touching eachother. Kiba loved being able to watch this... his friend was growing massive right before his eyes, and his feet continued to grow in his lap, the toes soon passing his own head. Despite this, Kiba continued to rub, loving every second of what was happening. But, Shikamaru's body grew bigger and wider until his head was pressed tight against the ceiling from his sitting position, and this then knocked him out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Shikamaru shook his head. \"What going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately stopped rubbing, and looked up too the giant in front of him. \"You started growing again! But, I doesn't look like this is going to stop any time soon. DON'T damage the house! Cause, if you guys don't kill me, my parents will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru grinned as cracks appeared on the ceiling as his head pressed more and more against it. He leaned lower, pushing Kiba against the wall with his massive, growing feet. \"Did I say to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned, answering, \"This isn't the best time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't care, just continue.

Shikamaru's smile was uncharacteristically mischievous. He was enjoying this more than he let on. Kiba, who was slowly but surely being covered by the massive foot pinning him to the wall, watched as the toes slowly rose up above his head again. Shikamaru's foot was as long as he was tall! This was getting insane! Shikamaru groaned a little and said, \"What did I just say?  Don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on Shikamaru!\" Kiba pleaded. \"If you don't try and get out of here, you're going to destroy my house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru lifted up his impressive hand, made a fist, and slammed it down against the couch, crushing it flat with the same ease a normal human would crush a bug. \"And if YOU don't rub my feet I'll crush you just as easily as that couch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba jumped and started rubbing again, no longer complaining. Shikamaru was nicer than Naruto...as long as he was getting what he wanted. And a foot rub wasn't that bad. Kiba was now using both hands to knead a single toe, having to reach up higher and higher until the toes were out of his reach. Then, it was back to rubbing the sole. All the while, the giant foot was pressing against him more and more, the wall splintering behind his back as Shikamaru's head and shoulders rose up into the second floor, his wide, glistening chest pressed up against the ceiling, each nipple pointing almost downward as his pecs continued to pump and swell. Suddenly, Kiba felt the wall crash down behind him, his body falling backward into the next room over, Shikamaru's foot still in front of him, but no longer bearing down on him. He got up and dusted himself off, just as the ceiling finally couldn't handle anymore and crashed down over Shikamaru's gigantic body, effectively turning the house from a two story with multiple rooms to a two story with one BIG room which now contained one BIG ninja. Shikamaru chuckled as he looked himself over. He flexed his arm and watched as it bulged up, ending in an impressive peak with a single, large vein running over top of it. It was a really intimidating sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba picked his way over to Shikamaru, looking up at him in awe. Shikamaru smirked down at him and said, \"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gulped and said, \"Y-Yeah! Why wouldn't I?\" It was best not to argue with giant muscle bound ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about your house? I'm wrecking it...that's a problem for you right?\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Kiba insisted. \"I mean, it's not like my parents can do anything to you if they find out you caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded and snatched Kiba up, bringing him up to his face. \"Yeah...And to make sure they don't do anything to you, you're officially my personal slave. I'm not letting you out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru held Kiba in one arm, pinning him to his huge chest. Shikamaru searched around and twitched his knee, crashing it into the nearby wall which instantly collapsed, revealing Naruto in the kitchen. Naruto slowly turned around and jumped to his feet in shock. \"S-Shikamaru? No way! This is so unfair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru picked his foot up and pushed it against Naruto. \"Don't even start pipsqueak. Things are different around here now. I'm the biggest, I'm the one in charge. If you don't want to end up a stain under my foot you'll do exactly as I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't answer. Shikamaru's sole was pressing firmly against his mouth. \"I'll take your silence as consent.\" Shikamaru said, leaning back again. Kiba snickered and smiled up at Shikamaru. He was pretty cool! He was really starting to admire Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...why don't you finish the foot rub Kiba started?\" He dropped Kiba down by his other foot. \"You too Kiba. One for each foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately began rubbing, working over every part he could reach. Naruto, on the other hand, refused to so much as move. Shikamaru increased the pressure until Naruto couldn't stand it any more and sulkily rubbed the other foot. Shikamaru sighed and just enjoyed it. Life was good.</span></div></div>",

Too big to be bossed around, and big enough so that he could tell other people what to do! Though, after a while, he grew tired of his foot rub... he was actually starting to feel tired. It WAS getting late, so why not get some shut eye? Shikamaru then pushed his feet into both Kiba's and Naruto's faces, causing them to look up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job you guys, especially you Kiba! But, I'm getting kind of sleepy, so let's go to bed.\" He told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up, and replied, \"Like hell I'm going to sleep!

At least he had ONE slave who didn't question him. He let Naruto go, and finally, the giant brat began to get ready to sleep. Shikamaru could now also close his eyes, not having to worry about anything. His slaves knew that if they tried to escape, they would get nice barefooted stomping. Shikamaru was also looking forward to tomorrow for one reason... he could still be growing! He'd need to find a better hid out soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and his slaves soon all fell asleep.

As he swelled up, his head crashed through the roof, before his back became too much for the wall to handle and it crashed down around him. This caused the roof to slam into his expanding torso, hitting his enlarging chest and splintering apart, not leaving a single mark of any kind on Shikamaru. He didn't even wake up. His feet grew along the floor, pushing Kiba and Naruto along the floor. Just as his toes reached the wall, the two sleeping teens' bodies pushing up against the wall, Naruto and Kiba got hooked between Shikamaru's big and second toe, keeping them safe as they knocked down the last wall. Shikamaru continued to grow through the night until Naruto and Kiba were about as tall as his ankle. His muscles were all engorged to massive sizes, his biceps huge, unstoppable mountains of muscle, his pecs almost obscuring his view of his feet, while his abs were a rock hard eight pack, his groin pushing obscenely at the little bit of material still clinging to his hips. His thighs were officially rubbing up against each other, his calves bulging out like enormous footballs of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun rose the next morning, the light hit Shikamaru in the face first thing. He groaned and rubbed his eyes. \"Stupid sun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up, his massive body casting a shadow over the entire area across the street. Shikamaru, his eyes still blinded by the light, couldn't tell that he had grown so much in the night. He sighed and rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground under his feet, Kiba had heard the rumbling boom of Shikamaru's voice and woke up. He blinked a few times as he looked around and saw what appeared to be some kind of...flesh colored walls? He reached out and touched them. They were warm...and soft...he knew this feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shikamaru?\" He looked up in disbelief at the huge shinobi in front of him. From his position on the ground he couldn't even see Shikamaru's face from around his gigantic pecs. His body had been amazing before but now...it was nothing short of god like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru didn't hear Kiba's tiny voice, too focused on waking himself up. He sighed again and looked down. \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward to see beyond his pecs and smirked when he saw Kiba staring up at him in awe. \"Hey there little slave...looks like I had another growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! You look amazing!\" Kiba actually felt admiration for how huge Shikamaru was getting! It was crazy! He stood up and ran his hands over Shikamaru's foot. \"Wow...looks like I'm going to have to work harder next time you need a foot rub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...I'm glad you have the right attitude Kiba.\" Shikamaru said, plucking him out from between his toes and lifting him up to his face. \"Now we just need Naruto to get a clue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, he's an idiot.\" Kiba said with a smile. \"If he doesn't come around I never get tired of watching you force him to do stuff for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru dropped Kiba on his shoulder and said, \"I'm feeling a little sweaty after being cooped up in your house all night. Let's go get cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet and cracked his back, bending over and snatching Naruto up. He didn't give him the freedom of sitting on his shoulder. He held him clenched in his meaty fist as he traveled to the nearest lake. He dipped one toe into it and winced. \"Damn...that's cold...ah well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly lowered himself into the lake. By the time he was sitting down only his shoulders were sticking up out of the water. It wasn't a very deep lake. He sighed and closed his eyes, relaxing again. Kiba smiled and jumped into the lake from Shikamaru's shoulder. Yikes! The water WAS cold! He shivered a little as he rose back up to the surface, swimming over to Shikamaru's chest to keep warm. Shikamaru cracked an eye open and smirked. Yeah...this was definitely the life!</span></div></div>",

Or... could it be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO FREAKIN WAY!\" Naruto yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru turned his head towards Naruto, smirking. \"Yes way! You thought that I was trouble before. Well, now that I'm bigger, and out of that small building, I can squish you if you question what I ask you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood there, too stunned to talk! Shikamaru was... bigger than big! God like even! He barely passed his ankles at this point, and he was fifteen feet tall! This was just, SO unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thoughts were interrupted as Shikamaru took his massive foot out of the water, and put it in front of him. \"I feel like another rub! So, get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Shikamaru asked. \"I said GET STARTED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hesitated, but ended up rubbing the massive foot that was more than double HIS size. He slowly rubbed he bottom of the sole, trying to be gentle. For once, the major emotion he was feeling right now... was fear. A fear of Shikamaru stepping on him, or getting even bigger! He continued to slowly massage the bottom of his foot, sometimes looking at his 'friends' massive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I knew you'd come around sometime or another. Your doing a magnificent job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto REALLY wanted to punch Shikamaru in the face at this point! Why is HE the biggest? Why couldn't he be the biggest, mightiest, and most powerful person known to this world? This was SOOOOOOOO unfair!!! Naruto wouldn't stand for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This should be ME! This should be ME!\" The world really seemed to hate Naruto at this point in time since no matter how much he wished and hoped and WANTED to be huge he was stuck at a \"mere\" 15 feet tall. Why was Shikamaru growing so much more than him? What was causing it? Wasn't there some way to speed his growth along? He wanted so badly to just be able to smash Shikamaru between his feet and show him his place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Naruto the world seemed determined to make him burst a blood vessel since, as he rubbed, Naruto started noticing that he wasn't able to reach quite as high on the foot...He hadn't been able to reach the ball of the foot at any point when he started rubbing, but now he was having trouble even reaching halfway up the foot...He stepped back and could only come to one conclusion. Shikamaru was growing AGAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh COME ON!\" Naruto shouted, stomping his foot. \"This just isn't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and cracked an eye open. \"What are you...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked confused as he saw his chest slowly rising up out of the water, Kiba staring up in awe at him as his pecs swelled up and out, pushing the dog ninja back before they rose above him, water cascading down over Kiba, pushing him under the water. Shikamaru chuckled, his abs pushing out, feeling the tiny Kiba against his abs. He fished him out of the water and put him on top of his shoulder. \"You're getting too small Kiba. I'm not going to be able to interact with you pretty soon. You'd better get growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled a little weakly and said, \"I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed at that as Shikamaru put his attention down on Naruto. He put his foot down and smirked when he saw his toes were almost as tall as Naruto....and getting taller! Naruto, sitting on the ground after the ground shaking caused by Shikamaru's massive foot. Before he could move Shikamaru gently pressed his toe down on top of him. Naruto tried to hold back the gigantic toe but he was unable to stop it. It pressed hard against his chest, forcing him down into the dirt. Shikamaru chuckled and said, \"You're a lot easier to deal with when I can just hold you down with one toe Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm not just some stupid bug you can step on whenever you want!' Naruto shouted back, losing his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru increased the pressure and said, \"See, that's where you're wrong. A bug under my toe is exactly what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru kept growing, his body filling up the little lake. Within minutes he was wedged inside, his butt the only thing still in water. He manged to pull himself out of the hole after that, easily getting to his feet. He towered above the trees, Naruto only about half the size of his toe if not less, Kiba a tiny figure on his shoulder. Shikamaru cracked his knuckles and looked around.He could see the village from here...going over there at this size though MIGHT cause a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...what a drag that would be...\" Shikamaru muttered. He grabbed Naruto up in his fist and started walking in the opposite direction.</span></div></div>",

He loved being able to praise him, rub his feet, and sit comfortably on his well defined shoulder. He WISHED that he was in Naruto's position; being able to rub, and be stepped on the massive thirteen year old's feet, and the thought of it was... just... amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Shikamaru shouted, \"My feet are getting tired... I need a bit of a foot rub, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNauto began struggling in the behemoth's hand, shouting \"NO WAY!\" but, Shikamaru simply dropped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall was really painful, and as soon as Nauto was able to stand, a massive foot was placed above him, blocking his view of most of the sky. \"Get rubbing, or be squished like the bug you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cursed to himself as he got up, but was knocked back down as Shikamaru sat down atop the tree's. He walked towards the huge foot in front of him, and began rubbing. Kiba was placed in front of his other foot, and began rubbing without any complaints. He rubbed his face against Shikamaru's sole, and then continued rubbing. He was a devoted bug! But, Kiba felt uneasy after a while. His clothes felt... tight? He scratched at his back, and continued rubbing. Of course, until his clothes literally started shredding off of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba watched as his body rapidly began inching upward at an unbelievable rate, with no signs of stopping! His jacket and t-shirt quickly ripped off, revealing his massive pecs, and six, no- eight pack!  His monstorous thighs ripped his pants at the seems, giving them room to expand and develop, while his calves jutted out all of a sudden and grew bigger and rounder every second. His feet quickly pushed over the edges and sides of his sandals, ripping his strap in no time at all. His sandals weren't visible soon as his massive, growing feet over took them, and he moaned, his toes digging into the dirt as he flexed his feet, since soon the lat of his clothes besides his boxers burst off. His manhood was clearly outlined in his skin tight boxer's, not looking more like underwear at this point. Kiba continued to grow until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Since the foot was resting, heel on the ground, Kiba was as tall as the foot, his face looking between Shikamaru's big and second toe. Naruto, whose view was blocked by the heel he was rubbing, being far too small to reach any other part of Shikamaru's foot while it was positioned like this, couldn't see what had become of Kiba. Shikamaru, who had a better view of both boys but currently had his eyes closed, lost in the feeling, also didn't see how Kiba had grown. Kiba smirked as he looked himself over. Man...he had no idea that growing could feel so good! Watching it happen to Shikamaru had been very exciting but actually experiencing it was a whole new world. He wondered briefly if he would keep growing...then he looked up at Shikamaru and smiled warmly. Would he get bigger than Shikamaru? It would be exciting to be sure, but even if he didn't, he still had the privilege of watching as Shikamaru continued growing into a lazy titan. Plus, he could still enjoy these massive, amazing feet! He rubbed his face against the toes, breathing in the manly scent of the foot, hugging it close to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru's eyes opened as he felt the sudden change in rubbing on Kiba's side. Where before he had felt incredibly tiny hands rubbing against the very bottom of his heel, he was now feeling something HUGGING his foot. He pushed against Kiba lightly, forcing the dog ninja to let go and take a few steps back. Shikamaru looked surprised as he put his foot down, seeing Kiba looking MUCH bigger than before. \"Woah...you really took my order yesterday to heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked a few times as Shikamaru said this. Judging by the smile on his face he had intended it as a joke..but what if that was true? What if, whatever was causing this, was somehow connected to Shikamaru's will? It would explain why he was growing (to avoid work and getting bossed around, able to do what he wants, when he wants) and it would explain why Kiba had grown big enough to be more than a bug to the giant Genin...but that didn't do anything to explain why Naruto was growing. Still, for now, it seemed like a plausible idea...one that Kiba would have to test later. Then again, he could always tell his idea to Shikamaru and let him experiment...which would be better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru poked his toe in Kiba's face and said, \"Hey...what are you thinking so hard about Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just smiled up at Shikamaru and said, \"Nothing! Don't worry about it!\" He would keep this little idea to himself for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smiled and moved his other foot, slamming it down in front of Naruto. The ground shook violently and Naruto fell to his butt, looking up hatefully at Shikamaru's grinning face. \"Looks like you're falling behind Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the heck are you...?\" Naruto said before catching sight of Kiba. His draw dropped in disbelief. No...this couldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba bounced his pecs and smirked down at Naruto. \"Looks like you're the bug now fox boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grit his teeth and just...bared it. There was nothing he could do now. His only hope was to somehow make himself grow and that just didn't seem possible at this time. He was totally at Kiba and Shikamaru's mercy! He was only about up to Kiba's ankles now. Even if he COULD defeat Kiba by some miracle, Shikamaru could put an end to him with a single movement. Shikamaru scratched his chest a little as he watched Naruto shake in fury. He grinned as he said, \"Hey, Naruto. Go and rub Kiba's feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!?\" Naruto said, looking up at Shikamaru in disbelief. Shikamaru's smile widened as he said, \"You heard me. You're way too insignificant to do a good job on my feet, and I'm not about to let you get out of work, so get rubbing Kiba's feet. From now on, you'll do whatever either of us says, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and said, \"Hell yeah! I got a new foot rubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shoved his foot against Kiba again. \"Just don't forget about your own duties dog boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned pushed against Shikamaru's foot. \"Don't worry, I didn't forget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru closed his eyes again as Kiba began to rub his foot. Naruto, happy that he was rubbing a much smaller foot now, but still pissed he was rubbing ANYONE'S feet, sulkily rubbed Kiba's foot. \"Stupid jerks! Just you wait...I'm going to get a lot bigger than either of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pressed his foot roughly against Naruto and said, \"Pipe down and get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foot rubs continued...</span></div></div>",

Kiba walked around his giant body as he noticed that Shikamaru's boxer seems to be tighter, pitching upwards from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba digressed as he moved on towards the kitchen as both of these giants would surely be hungry in their wake.

Kiba tried to ignore it and continue to cook, but as time passed on the sound intensifies as Kiba started to hear moans coming from Naruto. Kiba couldn't resist his urge. It was disgustingly appeasing as Kiba just turned around and watched Naruto jack off in his sleep. Naruto stroked faster and faster as pre-cum started leaking and spreading on his abs and thighs. The motion of his hand intensifies as Naruto led out his last scream of ecstasy before squirts after squirts of semen began flooding out of his dick. Naruto was sitting in such a position that all of the cum fell all over his body, glistening his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all his semen had came out, he dropped his hand on the floor as his stiff hard tower of flesh soon softened itself into its flaccid state. As normal as all of this had been, something weird started to happen. The cum that was all over Naruto's body began to glow as it was absorbed into Naruto's body. Naruto's body began to glow in response to the eccentric phenomenon. As the glowing stopped, the floor began to shake as Kiba stood up alarmed from the amount of energy Naruto was exerting. The floor shook violently as Naruto's sitting body began to expand everywhere. His head crashed through the ceiling as his torso soon followed. His shoulder widened and destroyed the walls as his increasingly huge frame expanded. His legs stretched outwards towards Kiba as it soon extended out towards the other wall. Naruto's colossal foot soon trapped Kiba against the wall as the foot itself already covered half his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tried to pry the foot off, but it was useless. In his attempts, Naruto had continue to grow and before he realized it, the foot was blocking Kiba's entire vision as it outlengthed  Kiba's height. Naruto's body had grown out of the kitchen and now crashing into the living room. The walls that he was laying on gave way as Naruto fell onto a lying position. Naruto's foot crashed through the walls as Kiba caught on the foot and marveled at Naruto's growth. The house collapsed down as Naruto's body had outgrown the length of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all this ruckus, Shikamaru woke up and cleared the rubble around him to see what was going on. He fell into a state of shock as he wakes up to see the figure of the now humongous Naruto lying on the ground. Shikamaru examined his body and was able to come to a conclusion that Naruto was now around 80 ft in height and twice as huge as Shikamaru.</span></div></div>",

Feeling the sun at his face, Naruto began to wake up, he opened his eyes and saw the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? I'm sure i was at Kiba's house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're OVER my house\" replied Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool\" Naruto looked around and saw debris everywhere and noticed something, Shikamaru was smaller than him, about half his size. \"I'm the one who gives orders now and my first order is that you have to rub my feet.\" He said with grim smile. Then he looked at the tiny Kiba, he was way too small to give a proper foot rub.  \"Hey Kiba, get over here, my pecs want a good rub\" He ordered bouncing his enormous pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What a drag. This is so troublesome\" Shikamaru thought while rubbing Naruto's feet. Kiba, on the other hand, was a bit of aroused, his hands were too small for Naruto get a good rub so he had to use his entire body. The two smaller ninjas did their job for about and hour until Naruto's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm pretty hungry since someone stole my ramen yesterday\" He said looking at Shikamaru who gulped. \"So, you'll have to bring food to your master, Shikamaru, a lot, and if you don't...\" He pushed his foot over Shikamaru's face. \"You'll get more than my foot in your face. Understood?\" \"Y-yes\" \"yes what?\" \"Yes, master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me master?\" Asked Kiba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will stay here, I have more body for you to rub\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master\" Said Kiba pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Shikamaru, Kiba is a good pet and he have my trust\" Said Naruto petting Kiba's head. \"but you are a bad slave and you don't have my trust, so this guy will go with you to make sure you don't try to scape\" He made a hand seal and a shadow clone appeared. \"Now go get my food and don't try to scape 'cause I'll know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were leaving Naruto glanced at Kiba \" You must be pretty sweaty with those clothes. Strip\" \"Yes m-master\" Replied Kiba shyly then he turned around started taking off his jacket, his shirt and finally his pants. Naruto stared at Kiba's broad back and nice naked bubble butt. He wasn't wearing underwear! \"Not that I complained but why you weren't...?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It get too tight there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew each other since kids but Naruto had never seen Kiba naked before, but Kiba had saw him, not that Naruto knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grabbed Kiba by the waist and \"Wow\" was the first thing he could said as he felt that enormous SOFT cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are a shower Kiba\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are a grower\" Replied ironically \"but also am I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see that\" Said Naruto as he placed Kiba over his cock. \"If you take a good care of mine I'll reward your\" He said while rubbing Kiba's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba started to rub Naruto's manhood with his entire body and after a few minutes of work Naruto started to moan loudly, he picked Kiba and placed him on the cock tip. \"Hold on tight Kiba, here cums your reward\" Kiba tried his best to stay but Naruto's cum was too powerfull and he went flying and landed drenched on Naruto's cum soaked pecs. He tried to got up but cum keep on raining over him as rope after rope was launched from the huge cock. Two minutes later the rain stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the cum started to glow and was absorbed by Naruto's body. Naruto felt a surge of power as more and more cum was absorbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you are going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Kiba, I'll get even bigger\" Then he started to grow, his muscles developed even more and his balls and cock grew even more in comparison with his body. Last time Naruto had cummed he grew to 80 feet but this time the amount of cum was several time bigger, he was going to be colossal. He keep on growing until he stopped at 600 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba stared at each other. Kiba was speechless, Naruto's body was amazing before, now it was god like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your reward Kiba?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious\" Replied Kiba while licking the remaining cum from his lips. Kiba had drank all his master's cum he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at Kiba's now erect cock, Kiba didn't lied, he was shower and a grower, it was the biggest \"normal\" cock Naruto had ever seen. Suddenly, Naruto smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, I think your reward will be mine too\" He said as Kiba started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I was a grower too, master\" kiba said as he felt his body starting to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grabbed Kiba against his chest. \" I want to feel you grow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grew until he was</span></div></div>",

Unsatisfied, he then grabbed Naruto's share and began eating it whole before Naruto could do anything in protest. \"Hey! What gives?!\" Naruto stood up in anger towards Shikamaru's action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru stood as he glared down at Naruto who only came up to the top of his chest. Naruto stared back up at Shikamaru's face before feeling the sense of fear sent through his body. Deep in his mind he knew very well that he was not able to defeat Shikamaru at this state. He took his eyes away from Shikamaru towards the corner of his eye, clenching his fist in frustration. He let out a sigh before sitting down admitting his defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a drag,\" Shikamaru sighed as he looked towards Kiba. \"Get me more food,\" he ordered as he pointed his fingers toward Kiba. Without any thought of protest, Kiba submissively took his order and swiftly exited the house to buy more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Kiba is not here, you'll be rubbing my feet,\" Shikamaru ordered as he lifted his foot and placed it on the table, which had separated the two giants. Naruto stared back in defiance, as thoughts of anger filled his mind. \"Do it NOW!\" Shikamaru emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...\" sounded Naruto as he eventually brought his hands to rub Shikamaru's foot. Satisfied, Shikmaru reclined as he closed his eyes to enjoy the moment. <i>Why must it be Shikmaru?</i>, thought Naruto, <i>Oh I'm going to get it back to him good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs feeling of vengeance fueled his anger, Naruto started feeling a tingly sensation inside him. He was too fixated to notice it at first, but then he started noticing that the foot did not rise up as high as it once did. Naruto's face was gleaming with joy as he knew very well what was going on in his body. The tingly sensation increased greatly as Naruto inched up higher and higher. Tears started to form throughout Naruto's shirt, while Shikamaru fell asleep through his laziness. Naruto released his hand from the foot as he reached around his shirt and tore off the remains revealing Naruto's magnificent body. His height neared to the ceiling as his pecs ballooned in size and became harder than rock. His biceps swelled up as power flooded through the course of his body. His abdomens were next as it made way for an extra row to develop boasting what he had to show. His thighs thicken outward, effectively tearing down his pants and leaving him in his tight brief which was dying to properly hide the swelling beast inside. His shoulders broadened as his bones cracked throughout his growth. Naruto bent down slightly as his height has long peaked through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Naruto! When did I tell you to stop?\" Shikamaru exclaimed as he opened up his eyes to see what was going on. Gaping in awe Shikamaru was left speechless as Naruto's figure filled his vision, effectively intimidating him.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the store clerk saw Naruto, he nearly screamed, though he held it in. Naruto walked up to the store clerk, still having a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any clothes in my size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I would have to take some measurements,\" the clerk answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as the clerk opened a cupboard and took out a measuring tape, and also grabbed a chair. The clerk walked up to him and got ready to measure him. The clerk wasn't as scared of him anymore, realizing that Naruto was just a young teen, though the he wondered why Naruto had came in tight, slightly ripped, boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to measure your height and the size of your feet. I would measure your waist, but I've already got a pretty good idea of it's size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up straight and watched as the clerk stood up on the chair, still barely reaching his height. The clerk took out the measuring tape, and got ready to measure him. Naruto measured to be about 8 and a half feet tall! Even the clerk was shocked, though Naruto's smile just grew wider. The clerk now got ready to measure the size of his feet. Again, the clerk was shocked. Naruto's feet were a massive 19 inches long and were about 8 inches wide! He knew now for sure that it would be hard to find clothes for this, as the clerk saw him, teen giant. The clerk went into the store's storage room, and, after a few minutes, came out with the largest sandals, orange jacket and orange pants he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll have to work with these. You should know, that the sandals were surprisingly easy to find, though it took me forever to find an orange jump suit at your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat down so he could try on the clothes. He slipped the sandals on his feet, and to his surprise, they fit perfectly! The clothes almost also fit perfectly, the the sleeves of the jacket and his pants were slightly to short. He also could only zip his zipper half way to the top. Naruto knew that he would not find anything better, so he paid the clerk, and got ready to leave. When he opened the door, he noticed that his hair was now brushing the top of the nine foot tall ceiling. His clothes also felt a little tighter than when he had tried them on, and his toes were also slightly hanging over his once \"Perfect fitting Sandals.\" But, Naruto just got happier.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was just bending down to walk in the door, when he ran full tilt into someone who was just walking in. The boy who had just walked in bounced back a little, though not as much as Naruto would have expected since he was at a steadily growing over eight feet tall. He bent down a bit more to see under the door frame and was greeted with the sight of Kiba. Naruto grinned and said, \"Hey Kiba! Imagine running into you here!\" He snickered, ready for Kiba to freak out about how huge he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up at Naruto and said, \"Oh..so you're growing too huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naruto got a better look at Kiba and noticed...he was only about a foot shorter than Naruto currently was! His coat was unzipped and only reached halfway down his torso, showing off his bulging pecs and his rock hard six pack. The material was stretched tight across his broad shoulders and the fish net shirt he normally wore was straining to keep attached to his body, only managed to cover down until Kiba's second row of abs. His shorts were no better off, tightening across his thighs, small tears visible all over them. His big feet were crammed into his sandals, the material splitting along the top of his foot and half of his foot hanging off the edge of it. He looked pretty uncomfortable over all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the heck happened to you? Why are you so big?\" Naruto asked suspiciously. He knew how he had gotten big. That scroll with that dust. But how had Kiba grown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell should I know?\" Kiba asked angrily. \"I just woke up this morning and I was half a foot taller than I was yesterday! I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stopped talking and groaned a little. Naruto watched in amazement as Kiba began to grow bigger before his very eyes! The dog ninja swelled up and out, his biceps shredding his sleeves as they tightened around the massive muscle, a tear running down his back as it flared out, the jacket forced open wider as his pecs pushed out. His shorts were next, each pant leg exploding as the thigh that filled them bulged with more size and definition. The sandals finally gave out, the material bursting open completely while his big feet crushed the bottoms into the dirt. Before he knew it, Naruto was looking UP at Kiba as he stretched taller and taller, stopping when Naruto came JUST below the level of his pecs. Kiba sighed, relief washing through his body as the constricting clothes finally were gone. He looked around in confusion before looking down at Naruto. \"Aw dammit! Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran out of the store to get a better look at Kiba. Most normal people weren't even as tall as Kiba's brief clad bulge! He was enormous! \"What do you mean AGAIN? How many times has this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scratched his head and said, \"Well...I've grown three times. Once when I woke up, again an hour later by about...one foot I think. And again just now. How tall are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto said, \"Um...over eight feet.\" He couldn't give an accurate measurement since he had grown since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that would make me about ten feet tall I guess...\" Kiba said, looking himself over. \"Heh...you know..this isn't half bad! I'm starting to like being huge! See you later Naruto! I'm going to get some better clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba ducked down and entered the shop, the sound of the shopkeeper screaming and dropping something issuing out. Naruto crossed his arms in annoyance and began walking down the street, thinking. Kiba said he had grown half a foot the first time...then he had grown by one foot...and now by THREE feet...It seemed like every time he grew, he grew more but the spurts only came every hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I can't let Kiba get bigger than me! I've gotta be the biggest guy around here!\" Naruto said, clenching his fists. He needed to grow more! And fast! He dashed back to his house and squeezed through the front door, pulling out his trashcan and grabbing the scroll. Damn...not a single speck of dust left! Naruto was about to toss the scroll back into the trash when he noticed something was written on it. The dust must have covered it up before since he couldn't remember seeing it last time. He spread it out at his kitchen table, the only chair in the room screaming in protest as he sat down on top of it. Naruto's eyes moved back and forth as he read the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My life's work, condensed in this scroll. To open it is to release forces beyond any mortal comprehension. Such influence...how could humans create gods? If you've opened this scroll, then you are on your way. But be warned. You will not be the only one. Others will join you. At least two others. The roulette is turning. Who will be chosen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the heck does that mean?\" Naruto scratched his head. It didn't make any sense. Gods? Others? Whoever wrote this scroll sounded like a nut. He shrugged and tossed it back into the trash. There was no help here. He was going to need to find some other way to stimulate his growth.</span></div></div>",

It was unfair! He had been growing for what, three days now? And he now stood taller than eight feet tall! But, Kiba had only started growing this morning, and was already bigger than him! Some how, some way, he needed to get bigger... and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought well and hard about the last few days. Every morning, he'd always wake up a LOT bigger than the day before, and then he'd slowly expand throughout the day. But, he had always trained for a while before that. So, maybe him training, than eating before he went to bed had some kind of significant affect on how much he grew while he slept, and how much he grew throughout the day! But, Naruto didn't have time to train... Kiba was growing every hour, and ended up growing more each time! He decided there and then that he would just eat, and take a nap. But, when he said eat, he meant feast on as much food as he could find! Naruto then stood up, ducking slightly as he ran to the fridge for food. He smiled when realized that he had bought enough food to feed him for three days at the size he was at the moment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... you won't be the biggest for long Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto warmed up ALL the instant ramen packages that he could find, and grabbed about four jugs of milk. The feast then began! He ate as much as he could, as fast as he could, without paying attention to the mess he was making. Within minutes, he had ate and drank everything in his path! Naruto let out a loud burp, and stretched out his arms. It was time for a nap! He jumped onto his bed, sending a loud THUD throughout his house, and got ready to sleep. His massive feet could now touch the floor from the end of the bed, and his arms were also hanging off the edges at this point. His clothes had once again tightened around his growing body, ripping in a few places, while his muscles felt as if they were try to show their glory. Naruto's toes and a small part of his sole were now hanging off his sandals, and the strap was getting painfully tight, but he was too focused on sleeping at this point. He soon fell asleep, and smiled as he thought about how big he was going to get. </span></div></div>",

He kept dreaming about growing big enough to easily step on Kiba and make him beg for mercy. How awesome would that be?!? Finally, after awhile his eyes snapped open. He grinned and sat up, his head inches from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah! I'm even bigger!\" Naruto exclaimed excitedly. His clothes were totally shredded, except for a few scrap remains and his overly stretched green boxers. He had crushed his bed under his bulk, the mattress nearly flat while the wood frame was in pieces all over the room. He got to his feet and slammed his head into the ceiling, breaking through head, shoulders, and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Naruto said playfully. \"Looks like I'm outgrowing this little apartment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew there was no way he was going to be able to find clothes that fit him now...then again, even if he DID find clothes that fit him there was no way they would last. He STILL was growing after all. Plus, every time he ate and every time he slept he grew bigger, FASTER! He rubbed his hands together, bent down and started crawling to the front door. With a simple push of his hand the door flew off the hinges and crashed into the building across the street. He tried a bunch of different ways to get out the door....and they all failed. Feet first, arm first, one hand, one foot...nope, there was no way he was going to be squeezing himself out the door. He got to his feet, passing through the roof again. He pushed his hands up through the roof and pressed them against the floor upstairs. He pulled his leg back and kicked out. HARD. The entire wall of his apartment burst outward like a bomb went off. Naruto bent down again and easily crawled out, stretching to his full height again. He stretched his arms up and rolled his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unngh!\" Naruto said loudly. \"Man! It feels great to be able to stand up straight in the open again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting quite a few stares form onlookers but Naruto ignored them...for now. He was way too concerned with finding Kiba and showing off. The only question was...where would he be? He decided to head toward the Training Field. That was as good a place as any to start searching for him. At his new size he was able to easily make it to the Training Field in only a handful of minutes. He looked around...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn...he's not here...\" He turned around and slammed into something. He fell on his butt and shook his head. \"Hey! What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth dropped open as he looked up...at Kiba! He had grown again. Naruto scrambled to his feet and found himself face to...crotch. He was HALF Kiba's size now! Kiba had also saw the futility in trying to keep himself clothed. He had tied a sheet around his waist in a loincloth like set up, wearing absolutely nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hey again Naruto. What's up?\" Kiba said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Not again! Why are you so much bigger than me? This isn't fair!\" Naruto shouted, jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stuck a finger in his ear and rotated. \"Jeez...shut up! You're so loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few other ninja who had been in the training area quickly vacated. They did NOT want to be near those two if they started fighting.

He WAS huge, but he wasn't that much of a prick, so he'd wait for him to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so big? And why is that guy bigger? Can you make me as big as you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed. \"Can you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Konahamaru yelled, \"Not until you tell me how you got so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just growing boys!\" Kiba yelled, snickering. \"NOW can you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!

Kiba grinned at this, and began walking back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an idiot.\" Kiba muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, Naruto got back up, looking his bruises and scrapes over. It was hard to admit, but Kiba was way to strong for him. But, he WOULD find a way to get bigger no matter what! He realized at this point, that his jacket had burst off when he was flung by Kiba. His sandals were long gone, and he wiggled his massive toes as he felt the soil under his soles. For these few seconds, he was happy about being huge and growing again. But, Kiba being bigger was ruining everything! Naruto stomped to the village, being completely and utterly pissed! This wasn't over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why were they being so mean to him? If he was bigger he could show them a thing or two! He kicked sullenly at a rock in front of him. He didn't even really question WHY they were so big. You see a lot of weird things, being a ninja and all. He just wanted to know if there was a way that he could get that big too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked along the road back home he started feeling a little strange. His scarf was feeling a bit...tight around his neck. Not to mention that his shirt was starting to feel tight...his shorts too...AND his sandals! What the heck was going on? He stopped and looked over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's happening...to me?\" Konohamaru asked, as he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was...growing! His body stretched slowly upward, his arms growing longer, his shirt riding up and showing his stomach, slight muscle definition also beginning to appear. He flexed his arms and watched as the bicep slowly, but surely, swelled up, stretching his sleeves to the ripping point. He grinned as he watched his feet fill up his sandals and begin to tear them apart, his toes and the soles of his feet slowly moving off the edge of the sandal. He eagerly ran over to a nearby guard house and measured himself against the door. He was already a foot higher on it then he normally was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm growing! Just like the boss and that Kiba guy!\" Konohamaru shouted out in excitement. \"Maybe I'll get as big as them and teach them a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru giggled as he watched his body continue to expand. His shirt soon only covered his chest, his shorts hiking up to around his thighs. His muscles were swelling up at a faster rate as well, his thighs bulging thickly, his calves sticking out behind his legs, his biceps swollen balls of pure size, and his pecs pushing against his shirt, the muscles clearly outlined against the thin material. With a grin he leaned forward, flexing his biceps as he did so, his back flaring out. With a loud ripping sound, his shirt tore straight down the back, the shirt falling to pieces around him. His shorts clung tenaciously to his hips, holding tight even as his thighs started punching tiny holes all over the place. His thick feet had burst the material, the sandals splitting in half and falling on the ground. Konohamaru kicked them away, smiling as he noticed the door frame was level with his eyes. He was so huge! And he was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once small boy began running back to Naruto and Kiba, ready to show them a thing or two! All the while he ran he continued to grow taller, his muscles growing thicker and stronger. Whatever was causing him to grow was blessing him with fast growth, reaching eight feet tall and surpassing it within minutes rather than the hours it took Naruto and Kiba to get there. He was looking forward to teaching Naruto and Kiba a lesson. He saw Kiba standing in the Training Field still, stretching. He grinned and ran up to him. \"Hey Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned around and said, \"What do you want now you little...squirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked UP at Konohamaru's grinning face. \"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru cracked his knuckles and said, \"Time for you to respect the NEW boss!'</span></div></div>",

You're dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba reared his arm back and slammed Naruto into the ground, leaving a crater twice Naruto's size and shattering the windows of the surrounding buildings from the massive shock wave that ripped through the air.

He was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRR...Let me GO,\" Naruto shouted up at Kiba who merely shook his head and applied more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Kiba growled down to him, still upping the pressure on Naruto's spine. \"You're going to pay for biting me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to struggle against the hand against him, trying to milk out every bit of strength he had.</span></div></div>",

Naruto only replied with a deep and bellowing roar as he stood. Naruto was once again growing, but faster than ever before. His pecs bursted with power and his abs became a gigantic 8 pack. Naruto's bicep grew more and more with the rest of his arm and his hand growing too. <br>\r\n\"This is great\" exclaimed Naruto. His eyes looked down only to be blocked by his enormous chest. Instead, he used his hands to feel the development going on below. His legs gained more power and his feet grew to amazing sizes too. Finally, he felt his crotch. He then found his boxers gave up, leaving him naked. <br>\r\nIn delight, Naruto stood up to his full height. Kiba cowered in fear as he stood in Naruto's shadow. He was now face to crotch with Naruto! Naruto was about 60 feet tall and rippling with rock hard muscle. He let out a booming laugh as he saw his opponent only half his size. <br>\r\n\"You scared Kiba?

It's not my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and Kiba both stood up at the same time, ready to continue the argument, until they saw each other. Naruto was shocked to see that Kiba stood a few inches taller than him. His muscles were even slightly thicker and more defined than his own!  Kiba had also left his house without a shirt today, leaving him only in his tight pair of pants. His feet had outgrown his sandals, which was weird. Even at his size, his sandals shouldn't have burst off. Naruto snickered as a thought ran through is head. Dog boy had big feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... bigger than usual.\" Naruto said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"I could say the same thing to you! I thought this was only happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they began walking along the streets, talking. They both seemed to be happy that they had found someone else who was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wierd...\" Kiba said. \"I just started growing a day or two ago for no apparent reason.

He had stocked up on a lot of different foods and drinks for the sleep over tonight. He smiled as he pulled it all out, putting it into the cupboards and fridge. He had never had a real sleepover before. The other kids had kind of ignored him or only put up with him while he was in class. This was his first true slumber party with a real friend. He laughed a little and pulled out one of the sodas he bought and cracked it open. He was really looking forward to this. It helped that he was going to end up probably growing bigger through the night. He bought a few caffeinated drinks as well to make sure they would both stay up all night to totally experience the sensations of growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I wonder what it feels like to grow...\" Naruto said out loud. The growth process usually happened to gradually you could barely tell it was happening. The way his body was growing now, however, he would be able to feel every moment of it. He didn't worry about it hurting or anything since if it DID hurt he would have felt it in the night, when it happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...I hope I grow bigger than Kiba!\" Naruto said with a laugh. \"That would be so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said that, but he was more glad that he wasn't going through this whole process alone. It was amazing and he was REALLY glad it was happening to him but being huge alone might be kind of lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud knocking sound from his front door. Naruto grinned and ran over to it, pulling it open. \"About time you got here Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pushed his way past Naruto and said, \"Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you were waiting with bells on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and looked around. \"So this is where you live huh? It looks kinda small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shut the door and said, \"You're kidding right? You're like over eight feet tall. EVERY place is small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this is just like three rooms! You've lived here your whole life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you get used to it. There's only one bed so you're going to have to sleep on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and stretched, his knuckles scraping the ceiling. \"Yeah right, good joke Naruto! I'll be taking that bed if we do any sleeping tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's my house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm a guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto crossed his arms and said, \"Okay, I know how we can settle this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down at the kitchen table and slammed his right elbow on top of it. \"Let's arm wrestle for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and sat down opposite Naruto, lifting his arm up against Naruto's. \"Alright! You want to start this sleep over by me humiliating you that's fine with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped Naruto's hand and said, \"Here are the rules! One hand only! If any part of the hand touches the table, you lose! No whining, no cheating! The stronger guy wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Fine! Sounds good to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gripped each others hand, hard, staring into each others' eyes with a grin. \"On three then?\" Kiba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! One...two...\" Naruto began to count down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THREE!\" they shouted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly both boy's put their full efforts into beating the other, their biceps bulging massively, Naruto's sleeve straining while no material was holding Kiba's muscle back. Veins erupted all over Kiba's mound of muscle, fueling his thick and powerful arm. Naruto was already starting to sweat, his arm trembling just slightly. It didn't help that Kiba had a few inches on him or that his arm was thicker. Kiba grinned fiercely and increased the pressure, moving Naruto's arm slowly, but surely, towards the table. Naruto wasn't about to give up however! He increased his force, pushing Kiba's arm back to the starting position...and started moving it toward HIS side of the table! Kiba grabbed the edge of the table, the wooden surface splintering slightly as his powerful hand crushed it. He pushed back, once again putting them to the starting position. Kiba's chest was glistening with sweat and Naruto's palm was growing sweaty. It was pretty much evenly matched...but who would come out on top?</span></div></div>",

They told each other how each of them started growing, what they had done in the last few days, and how much they were LOVING it! They were SO excited o grow throughout the night! Though, they could only wonder when they would start growing. It was already close to midnight... and, they had grown more than two feet taller throughout the day, so imagine how much they'd grow tonight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled. \"Why don't we compare a few things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... why not?

Naruto moaned as they stood back to back, realizing that Kiba was almost half a foot taller than him. Plus, he could tell that Kiba had developed more in the muscle apartment than he had. Naruto turned around, smiling... he had to catch up. They sat down after this, and put their right feet against each other. As soon as they did this, Naruto's jaw dropped. Kiba's feet were at least three or four inches bigger than his! He really did have big feet, even at this size. Kiba blushed, and crossed his legs once again. Usually, people didn't notice this... but, now that he was growing, more people were noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" He said, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here, stand on the other wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed Naruto straight against the wall and drew a line over Naruto's head. \"Okay! Now every hour we're going to remeasure ourselves to see how much we're growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said, \"Cool! That's a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that he was looking up slightly more now. He didn't let that thought bother him though. He was having too much fun at his first sleepover to care about who was bigger...at least right now. Kiba set the pen down and a low rumble filled the air. Kiba chuckled and said, \"Looks like I'm hungry! Got any decent food in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pointed out the kitchen and said, \"I bought a bunch of different stuff so eat whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and dashed into the kitchen. Almost instantly Naruto heard the sound of cupboards opening and closing as Kiba pulled out a bunch of different foods and snacks to eat. He had a REAL ravenous appetite it would seem.</span></div></div>",

A dab of drool could be seen hanging from Kiba's mouth, and he started eating without hesitation. But, before Naruto could start, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Kiba answered, having trouble talking as he chewed. \"Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wondered... who could be here at this time? As he opened the door, his questions were answered, and he was also pretty shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Boss, heard you were having a sleepover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down, but not as much as he usually did, to see Konohamaru. But, he was facing his chest, meaning that he was at little over six feet tall! His shirst was in tatters, barely blocking any parts of his upper body, but his muscles weren't very impressive at the moment. He was still a young child, and it was hard to form muslce. Konahamaru's pants were still in tact, but they looked as if they were a pair of shorts that were too small for him. His buldge was noticeable, and the material around it was being heavily strained. Naruto looked down to see Konohamaru's now massive bare feet, which had probably destroyed his sandals when he grew, and watched as he wiggled his toes in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of the big guys now, so I can join in the sleepover, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grabbed Konohamaru by the hand, pulling him inside, and then slammed the door shut. Before anything else, he asked Konohamaru how he had grown. He simply retorted that he had began growing yesterday at a gradual rate, and it hadn't stopped since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed. \"Fine, you can stay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! YES!\" Konohamaru yelled. \"This is going to be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew that Konohamaru was growing like him and Kiba, so he didn't want him, and then them to get caught. Plus, he liked the fact that he had another person at his sleepover. Suddenly, him and Konohamaru heard a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I already brought most of it out! How much more could he want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys made their way over to the kitchen where a strange sight greeted them. Kiba was sitting on the floor, amongst a few pieces of splintered wood...and his head was almost at the ceiling! Both Naruto and Konohamaru gaped as they looked up at Kiba's sheepishly smiling face. \"H-Hey guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had started growing, his weight being too much for the chair, shattering it, while his body took up more and more space. His head pressed against the ceiling, which forced him to duck down, leaning against the sink, knocking the taps off which caused icy cold water to splash against his now exposed back, his shirt long since having ripped off due to his immense new physique. His muscles were even more impressive now, his wide chest looking thick and powerful, his abs more defined, as an extra row had appeared on his torso, giving him an eight pack. His arms, one of which was smashing into the cupboards now, while the other was putting major pressure on the wall, were bulging with muscle, his forearms looking thick and powerful, his fingers easily putting holes in the walls, though he wasn't strong enough to push them down entirely. His head pressed up against the ceiling again as he massive knees followed, cracks radiating out from all three areas, Kiba's pecs squashing up against his chin, his toes slightly bent against the wall as the growth came to a stop, leaving Kiba crunched and uncomfortable in the now tiny kitchen. His enormous bulge, barely kept hidden from sight by a pair of underwear, was shoved against the doorway, blocking it, right in front of Naruto and Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was silent except for the creaking and groaning coming from the kitchen. Kiba twisted and turned and tried to break free but he was wedged in just such a way that he couldn't break down any of the walls, and he couldn't even move! \"Grr...raaagh...dammit! I'm trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally found his voice and shouted, \"Forget about that! Look at what you did to my kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes and said, \"Shut up! It's not like I did this on purpose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't talk to the boss like that!\" Konohamaru piped up, shaking his fist at Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, you let the kid in here too?\" Kiba said, unable to see Konohamaru from his position. \"What did you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's growing too! Since yesterday!\" Naruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!? Him too? Even that pipsqueak?\" Kiba shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pipsqueak anymore! I'm going to grow up even bigger and stronger than you and then I'll show you a thing or two!\" The ambitious boy shouted, sticking his tongue out at Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you'll REALLY put me in my place.\" Kiba said sarcastically. \"In the meantime, can we PLEASE find a way to get me out of here? I can't move at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...let's see...maybe we can, I don't know, break down the walls somehow?\" Naruto suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great idea Naruto, but HOW do you suggest we do that?\" Kiba asked in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's blow the walls down!\" Konohamaru suggested, pulling out a few bombs from his torn pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! We're not blowing up my house!\" Naruto said, taking the bombs away from Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You could bring the whole roof down on my head!\" Kiba shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! It was just an idea!\" Konohamaru pouted, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three boys continued to bounce off ideas from each other...</span></div></div>",

It's not like I'll be using it once I get your size, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said, \"Yeah, but how should I get out without the roof crashing on my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the one with the idea this time, saying \"What if we just lift the roof off! If we keep it in one piece, and if we're strong enough, we can just pick up the whole roof, then Kiba can climb out of from the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then said, \"That's not a bad idea.

I'm growing too!\" Naruto blurted out in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy\" Kiba mumbled. There would be less people to be able to help him, and he might lose his spot as the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't care, however. He was loving this too much. He sat down on the floor cross-legged, facing the door, as he didn't have room to stand up anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew, his bulging and expanding muscles tore through his shirt and pants, leaving him in his green undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest broadened, his pecs getting thicker with muscles. His biceps became closer and closer to being spherical, as they became thick with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis abs became more well-defined, and he was developing a solid 8-pack. Even his legs became like tree-trunks, and were bulging with muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of bulge, his was growing, becoming larger even for his current size. It strained his green boxers more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto sat, his head began getting closer to the ceiling once more. He had to scoot back to make room for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got larger and larger, setting his knee on his bed, his butt hitting the couch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed a little as he felt the fabric of his boxers rip completely, and soon after that, the waistband snapped. The material rested on his huge package, obscuring it for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was only about a foot shorter than Kiba, his growth finally stopped. He sat with his legs crossed and his knees in opposite corners of the room. One of his feet was sticking into the door to the kitchen, and his big toe ended up touching Kiba's package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a little more wiggle room than Kiba, though, as he was a little smaller, and the room was a little larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cut it out!\" Kiba yelled as he felt the sudden sensation on his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru sighed in relief as he left the room, but he wouldn't be left out of the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on the balcony outside Naruto's apartment as his height grew quite fast. Like the other two, his muscles grew quite a bit, but not nearly as much. He looked scrawny compared to the other two, though he still looked like a regular body builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his clothes ripped off, and he took off all the scraps. His undies were holding on, containing his package, though barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Naruto's roof was about chin level to Konohamaru, though he was still feet shorter than even Naruto, much to his own disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, now it would be much easier to get the other two out. He could just lift up the roof with their help.</span></div></div>",

She quickly righted herself before slipping off Narut's shoulder. She knew that Naruto had a crush on Sakura (and lets face it, he doesn't do much to hide it) and was probably going to show off to her. There wasn't much she could do though. She'd just have to go along with it and see how it all turned out. Thoughts of these troubles were driven clearly from her mind as Naruto began jogging through the streets to find Sakura. People dived out of the way as the giant ninja ran by. Naruto wasn't paying much attention to the people below so it was no small wonder that no one got hurt. Hinata was clinging onto Naruto for dear life, hoping not to fall off and get trampled under Naruto's fast moving feet. Finally, he spotted Sakura near the edge of the forest. He grinned and started to run over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had in fact been following Sasuke but he had eluded her in the forest. This was the third time this week Sakura had followed Sasuke and everytime he had lost her in the woods. It was like he disappeared once he got there! She sighed and turned around coming fact to leg with the giant Naruto. She slowly traveled up the length of the body and stared Naruto in the eye. He grinned at her and said, \"Hey Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's eyes rolled up into her head and she fainted dead away. Both Naruto and Hinata sweatdropped at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even I didn't faint.' Hinata thought. Though to be fair, she did run away in total fear. Naruto shrugged at Hinata and he picked up Sakura's limp body laying her in the shade. There was other things he wanted to do today and sitting around waiting for Sakura to wake up wasn't one of them. She'd be fine here.</span></div></div>",

The green dust worked its way through his chakra channels increasing the flow and increasing the potential amount to nearly unlimited levels. As he slept his feet grew over the edge of his bed and were soon resting on the floor of his house. His right arm moved into his kitchen and his fingers eventually broke through the window. His left arm splintered his front door and passed through it. His back inched up the wall until his head hit the ceiling. It was at this time Naruto woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, whuh, what's going on?\" He muttered to himself still half asleep. He rubbed his eyes and looked around. \"Whoah! Everything's so small!\" He brought his hand up to his eyes and saw his fingers slowly stretching out. \"No way! I'm growing!\" He looked down at himself and saw his ripped pajamas. \"Gah! I'm naked!\" He looked around for something to cover himself with. He couldn't see anything but something forced his closet door open. He was surprised to see the jumpsuit he had been wearing that day was flowing out of the closet. Whatever had made him grow was making his clothes grow as well. Naruto grabbed his pants and tried to pull them on. Since he was now completely sandwiched inside his own house this wasn't easy. His left foot kicked out through the wall and when he tried to sit up his head went through the ceiling. The more he tried to move and adjust himself the worse the damage he caused. Finally, he was left sitting in a pile of rubble. He quickly got dressed and stood up. Judging by the house next to him he was nearing at least sixty feet in height. Not only that, he was still growing! Thinking fast, Naruto jumped and managed to make it to the outskirts of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't cause any damage out here.\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched the village shrink away as he grew and grew and grew. Soon his toes were larger than the nearby houses and still he grew larger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big am I going to get?\" he wondered, seeing even the Hokage Mountain shrink away to a half inch before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stopped. Naruto kneeled down and was shocked by how small everything looked. He could scoop up the entire village in the palm of his hand if he wanted to. He grinned in spite of himself. No one would mess with him or his village ever again! Not only that, there was absolutely no one who could even think of opposing him as Hokage! He laid on his stomach so that his chin was resting on the ground in back of the Hokage Mountain. No matter where one stood in the village they would have a clear look of Naruto's godly face grinning down at them. But not with malevolence. Naruto may have been mistreated as a child by these villagers, but he knew there were people who cared about him and as Hokage he had to protect this village. He smiled and waited for everyone to wake up. He was eager to start his rule as Hokage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stared down at the village, waiting impatiently for day to break. But he'd only been asleep for a few hours when he started growing and day was a long ways away. His eyes started to close and he quickly opened them again. He wouldn't fall asleep! For the next hour he slowly toed the line between sleeping and wakefullness until, around one in the morning, he fell back to sleep. Luckily for the villagers his breath was high above the buildings and he didn't snore. But for all this good luck, there was a substantial amount of bad luck. As he slept, he started to drool. For Naruto, this was a couple of drops, a thin stream at most. For the villagers, this was a deluge! It started out slow. Drops no bigger than rain pattered the rooftops. This was no bother for most of the villagers, but Shikamaru, who'd been having trouble sleeping anyway, was annoyed by the pattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a drag!\" He moaned, crawling out of bed and forcing his curtains open. His eyes bugged out of his head as threw open the window and looked at the sky. A humongous face was sleeping at the edge of the village. And, judging by the trademark whisker like markings on the cheeks, the giant was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just perfect.\" Shikamaru said sarcastically. Before he could pull his head back in a drop of drool landed on his head. He quickly pulled his head back in and felt the spot the drool had landed on. \"And now I've Naruto's spit on my head. I should've just stayed in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the bathroom and washed his hair before crawling back into bed and pulling the covers over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shikamaru actively ignored the pattering, knowing it to be Naruto's drool, Naruto slept on, his stream of drool increasing. Soon, it began to puddle on the edges of the village and flow through the streets. Within the hour, a full five feet of standing drool was washing through the village and as Naruto slept on, more and more drool exited his mouth and hit areas all over the village. Shikamaru sighed as he heard something splintering next door. He moved to the window and was disgusted to see it covered in drool. He threw it open and was shocked again to see the amount of drool flowing throughout the village. Looking up as best as he could, he saw the drool falling from Naruto's slightly parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he doesn't stop that, the whole village is going to go under!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shikimaru came to this conclusion, villagers all over the village started awakening to the flooding. In the next hour, every villager was awake and screaming as they saw the massive giant slowly drowning them in drool! Naruto remained blissfully unaware of this and slept on. With six hours before dawn, there was a good chance the entire village would be wiped out before Naruto woke up. Anbu Black Ops had been dispatched and were currently peppering Naruto's face, trying to wake him with shuriken, kunai, and any jutsu they could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hours later, as the sun began to rise, the village was completely covered in drool. The villagers had all evacuated to the inside of the Hokage Mountain. The drool was flowing thickest there, in a waterfall, but they entered via a few secret passages. They would just have to wait this storm out.</span></div></div>",

He then brought his hand slowly up removing the village and a chunk of the surrounding land. The village rested comfortably in the palm of his hand and Naruto titled it ever so slightly, draining the worst of the drool from the village streets. It was the best he could do since if he tried anything else he would probably end up causing more destruction then helping. But he also knew if he didn't keep the village someplace safe, he might lose track of it and end up destroying it. He couldn't risk that, so he was going to keep the village with him at all times. In order to do that, he had to find a place big enough on his body he could place the village. He thought about putting it on his head, but he would probably end up shaking them off. The same problem presented itself with his shoulder. In fact, there was almost no place to put it that wouldn't fall off of him. Finally, he decided to keep it on his sandal. He eased it in between his big and second toe and found that the village fit quiet comfortably under his toes. As long as he didn't wiggle his toes, the village would be perfectly safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the village was safe, it was time to start traveling to the other villages and laying down the new law.

He looked down at the ground and watched as it continued to move away from him! He was growing even more! Whatever was in that scroll, it was extremely powerful! Naruto looked down at the village to make sure it was okay and it was. Slowly, his toes grew larger and larger around the village until it fit completely between his big and second toe with quite a bit of room on either side. Naruto grinned, happy that the village was now small enough to be placed comfortably on his body. He licked his right index finger and lifted the village up with his left index finger. He very carefully placed a drop of spit on the bottom of the village and laid it back down on his sandal. It adhered instantly to the sandal's material and stuck in one place. Now Naruto wouldn't have to worry about it sliding off into oblivion. He noticed he had stopped growing for now. He wondered if he would end up growing even more before this whole thing was over. Who could say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Konohagakure was starting to settle down in it's new position. The villagers left the safety of the Hokage Mountain and looked around. Most of the drool was long gone, though it was going to take an intense cleaning to wash it all away for good. Luckily Naruto had showered yesterday morning so his feet didn't stink. As long as he kept up with regular washing, they wouldn't have to worry about beind suffocated and it was true that nothing could touch them with Naruto's massive toes on either side of them. Not to mention the extreme drop of Naruto's sandal. Yes, all in all, this wasn't such a bad turn of events at all. Within the hour, the villagers were cleaning up the mess Naruto had inadvertently made and would be done by the time the day was over. Shikamaru had managed to evade Ino and was lazing around on someone's roof. He was on his back and looking up at the sky. He could see just beyond Naruto's toe to a massive pillar of flesh clad in orange rising into the sky. Beyond that, there wasn't much to see. Shikamaru sighed as he stared. Leave it to Naruto to leave them in a situation that required so much work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shikamaru! Get your lazy butt down here and start cleaning with the rest of us!\" Ino shouted waving a mop from the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed again and rolled off the roof, sliding down the wall and landing on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you nag. Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Ino said. \"Let's get to...wait a minute!

The small amount of light that was able to reach them grew more diffuse as the toes rose higher.blocking out more light. Tsunade stood on the balcony of the Hokage building and watched as the area grew darker. Since there was no way to fight Naruto, the village had decided to accept him as a natural entity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to find some way to make sure light can still reach us.\" she thought to herself. \"It would be too gloomy living in eternal night, with only the electric lights to see by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to her desk to make a note about this before addressing the current group of ninja that had arrived in her office.

He looked down at his foot and saw a speck of dust that was the Leaf village. He grinned, knowing that everyone was looking at him. They were acknowledging him as someone who really mattered. Someone who had their lives in his hands. The idea of so much power was intoxicating to Naruto. He wondered if he would ever stop growing. Why should he? Why shouldn't the whole world be able to be cradled in his arms? Naruto laughed at this idea and continued searching for the other hidden villages. After awhile, though, he gave up on it.

The genin, now so gargantuan that even mountains were nothing to his toes, was truly godly in stature, a force that no being on Earth could dream of challenging and emerging victorious. In addition to his size, the Hidden Leaf Village was barely clinging onto the minute amount of space between his toes as it was; one angry wiggle of Naruto's phalanges and the entire settlement would fall miles to their doom, killing everyone upon impact. After planning out the outcomes of both choices, there was really only one thing the village could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady Tsunade, you can't do this!\" Shizune protested as she followed the village leader to the top of the Hokage Mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What choice do we have, Shizune?\" the buxom blonde sighed in defeat. \"It's either do this or have everyone die. Besides, he won't <i>really</i> be the Hokage; it's just a title that'll satisfy his ego. As long as we remain alive, we can figure out something to stop Naruto and bring him back down to size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope you're right, Lady Tsunade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wasting no more time lest the orange ninja become impatient, the Fifth Hokage began to perform a series of hand signs, readying a unique jutsu that was limited to only the strongest of jonin, along with the members of the Yamanaka family. \"Ninja Art: Mind Link Jutsu!\" she shouted as the jutsu was complete, a mental connection established between her and the towering giant above them. \"Alright, let's just hope this works. Naruto, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh?!\" Naruto asked in confusion, his voice heard for thousands of miles. \"What was that? Grandma Tsunade, was that you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ugh, just don't talk, you moron!\" the Hokage barked as she covered her ears just in time to avoid going deaf. \"Yes, it's me. I've established a mental connection to your mind, so I'm able to talk directly into your thoughts. Anyways, I have something to tell you, but only if you'll think it instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think you're callin' the shots here anymore, Grandma,\" he answered with an arrogant chuckle. \"You can tell me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ugh, fine! Well, on behalf of the village, I've decided to step down for the good of everyone in the Village Hidden in the Leaves. I hereby appoint you, Naruto, to be my successor as the Sixth Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh, you mean it?\" Naruto replied with glee. \"You're not just sayin' it, right? You really mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course I do, Naruto,\" Tsunade lied, making sure to pretend she sounded sincere in her answer. \"I can think of no one better to run the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awesome!\" Lifting up his other foot, the giant ninja stomped the ground in triumph as he fist-pumped with his right hand, accidentally wiping out several smaller villages beneath his sole. \"Hehe, well, in that case...I don't want to be Hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"<b>WHAT?!</b>\" the entire village protested in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm a god now, and gods can't be lame heads of villages,\" he explained. \"No, if I'm gonna do this, I need to be something better, something worthy of someone like me. From this day forward, there will be no more Hokages. From now on, there is only me, Naruto Uzumaki, the First - and only - Hinokami of the Village Hidden in the Leaves! Worship and obey your Hinokami, and I'll rule the Leaf Village better than any Hokage ever did! Believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You have got to be kidding me...\" Shizune sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That idiot!\" Tsunade growled as she disabled the link. \"I swear, I'm gonna kill Naruto if we ever get him back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then,\" Naruto pondered, \"what to do as my first order as Hinokami...?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto's foot sweat had effectively glued the village to his foot, preventing it from sliding off into the abyss. Tsunade stared out at the new landscape, her eye twitching. She had been able to force the village to adapt to the sudden changes, but she was starting to get annoyed by Naruto's indecisiveness. The boy, it seemed, could not just pick a position to put the Leaf Village in. \"But we can still live like this.\" she reminded herself. \"As long as Naruto doesn't crush us, we can still live like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Shizune and said, \"Send word to every available carpenter in the Leaf Village. We'd better start constructing that statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded and quickly set out to spread the word. Tsunade looked out the window and said, \"Now we just have to find a place to put it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, Sasuke was sitting at the top of the Hokage Mountain, staring out at the landscape of Naruto's foot. Looking up he couldn't even see the massive face of his friend and rival. All he could see was a pillar of pink skin that eventually changed to a pillar of orange. Sasuke felt totally inferior to Naruto. It wasn't a feeling he normally had, or liked. Right now, Naruto had enough power to wipe out all existence on the planet if he wanted. Sasuke felt jealous and frustrated. Why did this power go to Naruto? It wasn't right, and it wasn't fair. Little did Sasuke know, the same power that caused Naruto was grow, that strange green dust, had blown throughout the village since Naruto's growth. While most of it was lost, enough had found it's way to the Mountain and Sasuke was now breathing it in. Soon, he would start growing as well, though at a much slower rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race was on.</span></div></div>",

He had no idea about the changes he was about to undergo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to walk along, expanding and loving as his large feet crushed the world below. He wondered how large he'd get, but secretly hoped he would never stop growing. Then the whole universe could worship and adore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was probably going to be difficult, as Naruto's rival was about to become some tough competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked up, and was stunned. It looked like the entire village and mountain was shrinking beneath him. However Naruto's toes didn't look any smaller. The village was diminishing, and soon Saskue stood taller than the mountain. His bare feet stood on the bare earth that was Naruto's toe-skin, as they grew larger and larger, lengthing. Pretty soon he was staring down at the tiny village that could fit under his big toe. It was still shrinking, and soon it was small enough to fit under his little toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of heat, Saskue raised his foot, enjoying the sensation of being larger than something else. He lowered it, and completely flattened the entire village underneath his bare soles. Grinding his foot like someone grinding a cigarret butt, Sasuke then looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto seemd to be shrinking. And it finally dawned on Sasuke, Naruto wasn't shrinking, he - Sasuke was growing! It seemed like the village was shrinking as Sasuke and Naruto grey in sync, but now Sasuke was expanding at a greater rate.

Sakura, Ino, and others were cheering on his sudden change, preferring being stuck to Sasuke then Naruto. However, that elation didn't last as Sasuke raised his foot over the tiny village and slowly brought it down. Everyone had different reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Sasuke how could you?!?!?\" Sakura screamed in fear, while Inner Sakura raged and threw things around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Sasuke could be so cruel!!\" Ino shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and said, \"I always preferred Naruto to this guy. At least Naruto was leaving us alone..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade slumped over the railing around the balcony of the Hokage tower and said, \"This is why I never wanted to be Hokage!\" She sighed and stood up, looking out over the village. \"There may still be a way to save some of us though...\" Tsunade thought. \"I'll have to move fast though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tsunade darted around the village, grabbing Shikamaru, Kiba, Shino, and Choji before Sasuke's foot reached the village. Running out of time, Tsunade tossed several seals around the group and cast a barrier jutsu. Seconds after the jutsu was cast, Sasuke's foot pressed down on the village, grinding it into dust. Tsunade strained to keep the barrier whole. Luckily Sasuke already considered the village far beneath him and didn't waste much time crushing it. With his growth increasing, he ran down the skin between Naruto's toes, ready to overcome him. Tsunade released the barrier and wiped her forehead looking at the destruction around them. It was cataclysmic. Absolutely nothing had survived. It tore Tsunade apart inside to see the village her loved ones had cared so much about destroyed. She felt guilt at seeing the bodies of those she had sworn to protect, obliterated until nothing was left. But now was not the time to be mourning. With Sasuke growing like Naruto, and already showing no care for the village, it was time to end this madness. She didn't know what was causing them to grow, but it would only take a few tests to find it out. She turned to the boys she had saved and said, \"Alright men! We're going to find out what caused this sudden growth spurt in Naruto and Sasuke, and reverse it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned and said, \"What a drag! How long is this going to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Once I find out what caused them to grow, I'll be able to work on an antidote to bring them both down. But with my skill in medical ninjutsu it really shouldn't take more than a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you need us for then?\" Kiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and said, \"If worse comes to worse, I might need someone to grow to their size and fight them down to apply the antidote. I therefore chose not only young ninja who no doubt would grow more and faster due to their developing bodies, but also those of you who have dealt with Naruto and were in the immediate are. Actually, I would've like Neji to be here, but he was out on a mission, so it couldn't be helped. Now let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group got to work. As all this was going on, Sasuke was growing faster and faster. Within seconds he was jumping off of Naruto's toe and landing on the ground. He could tell that Naruto was still growing, but it was at a slower rate. Soon, Sasuke was half of Naruto's size, and then, the same size! He stopped walking behind Naruto and said, \"Hey Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked back in shock as he saw Sasuke the same size as him! What the heck was going on?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke! How did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" He said. \"I'm going to be a lot bigger than you soon anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naruto started looking up in shock as Sasuke grew bigger and bigger. Naruto felt something bump into him and was shocked to see Sasuke's massive toes bumping into him. \"No fair! Growing was my thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smirked and said, \"You're just a loser. You could never use this power right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto growled at hearing his now much larger rival taunt him. With a yell, he jumped onto Sasuke's foot and started charing!</span></div></div>",

He had grown so much so fast that Naruto, the massive Naruto was shorter than his toe nail. Naruto couldn't even see over top of the big toe of Sasuke. Naruto had tried to attack, but as the tiny villages had all learned, you can't hurt something that big. And as Sasuke kept growing, Naruto effectively seemd to be shrinking in comparison. Soon he was as tall as Sasuke's toe nail was thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad for the world. Naruto could crush cities, mountains, lakes all in one foot step. In comparison Sasuke could crush countries underfoot. His big toe could take out many smaller countries in one go. His size was too much for the earth, as his feet had effectively heated up the planet's temperature. His head was no longer in the atmosphere, and yet that didn't worry him. Somehow he was surviving, and he'd adopted a zen attitude with his growth. What would be, would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's feet continued to lengthen, and soon each monstrosity was slightly longer than the planet's length.

He wasn't about to sit down and let his rival get stronger than him. Naruto knew to stay on the ground was suicide, so he powered chakra to his feet and hands and clung to Sasuke's enormous toe. With as much speed as he could muster, he began his ascent up Sasuke's still growing big toe. Naruto finally managed to get to the top of the toe, where he stopped to rest. The first part of his plan had succeeded. At this point, he at least wouldn't be crushed by Sasuke. From his vantage point, he couldn't see what was happening to the earth as Sasuke's feet began to overcome it. Slowly, he brought his feet closer and closer together, as the earth shrank down to apple size, then ping pong ball size, then marble size, and then, nothing. When Sasuke lost sight of the planet, he instantly lost interest in it. By a miraculous stroke, the planet, though badly damaged, had still survived! It was lost among Sasuke's feet, but still there. How long it would last, was yet to be seen. Naruto, stuck on Sasuke's big toe, unknowingly had brought more survivors with him. Tsunade and her small crew of genin were still performing experiments on Naruto to try and find out what caused his growth, how to reverse it, and how they were even going to find a way to get him to take it. At his current size, they were barely able to use dead skin cells to test on. But Tsunade was determined. This had gone from a simple matter of protecting the village to a colossal matter of protecting the planet! She worked tirelessly, using all the skills she possessed as a Sanin, to discover this abnormality in Naruto. She had decided that it couldn't have been something that was created naturally in Naruto's body since Sasuke had also started growing. Therefore, it must've been something both boys were exposed to. The question was, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, having rested enough, looked out at the plain of flesh that lay out before him. He was so angry, angry that that jerk Sasuke had stolen his order away from him, his power. No matter what, he would grow bigger than Sasuke and crush him like the arrogant over proud bug he was!</span></div></div>",

I've made this chemical more potent than Naruto's so you'll easily pass him up. I'm almost positive I've made it stronger than Sasuke's dose as well so you should at least catch up with him. All you have to do is subdue Sasuke and Naruto long enough for me to finish the antidote. Once the antidote is finished I'll inject Naruto first. When he shrinks small enough, we'll transfer to Sasuke and inject him as well. Finally, when Sasuke is small enough, we'll inject you. With any luck, we may still be able to find our way back to the earth and rebuild after this whole mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade said this, though without much hope. When this whole thing was over, they'd be lucky to be in the same part of the galaxy as they were. But she couldn't just stand back and watch as this devastation continued. Without any further regrets, she injected Kiba straight in the neck, pushing the plunger down and forcing the growth chemical into his bloodstream. Everyone waited, wondering if it would work. Suddenly, Kiba started to grow! It was working! He looked on in shock as everyone seemed to shrink around him, slowly becoming smaller than his knees...then his ankles....then his toes...and then, they were specks...and then, they were gone. Kiba, thinking fast, took a big step over the spot he had last seen them and tried to move away as best he could. He didn't want to accidentally crush the others. Looking up, he saw he still had a ways to go to catch up with Naruto and even further to catch up to Sasuke.</span></div></div>",

Soon what was a great continent turned into a great country, and with that Kiba was making headway. To Naruto, Kiba had only moved a thousands of a millimetre or so on the tip of his toe, but to Kiba he was already thousands of miles away from the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerspective certainly plays a part in everything.</span></div></div>",

He looked down and saw... Kiba's face?! Kiba's leg?! Before he had blinked twice, Kiba's toes had grown to be another wall of flesh before him! \"I... I can't believe this crap...

Every inch of him was tingling with power, size, and pleasure. He couldn't help but love it, lost in the moment. This was bliss. This was paradise. He just kept growing and growing, the mission he was on in the first place replaced with the single desire to get more and more huge, watching the cosmos shrink and get smaller and small compared to his feet.

Every fiber of his being felt absolutely amazing.<br>\r\nSince there wasn't much reason to have them anymore, he stripped away his clothing - as soon as he did so, the clothing stopped growing with him, and within moments it was gone as he outgrew it all. Now a nude giga-giant, Kiba took notice that the growth seemed to have buffed him up quite a lot! He flexed one of his biceps and was pleased at the big peak that formed. He flexed his other muscles, admiring his own physique one group at a time. Then he layed back in the nothingness, putting his hands under his head. This was the life.

A wall of 8-pack abs. And finally, one extremely pumped up muscle-ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, guys, we finally got another one!\" the ninja said, smiling.

The entire planet had already disappeared from view somewhere on his foot. How had Kiba and Sasuke even grown? Was there residual dust floating around? Would another ninja usurp his position as a god and outgrow even Kiba? Naruto felt another surge of anger and gritted his teeth, his hands clenching into fists. No! No no no no no no no no no no no! He wasn't going to let this happen! This was all supposed to be his! And it would be his at any cost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though responding to Naruto's fierce emotions the dust that had caused his amazing growth in the first place reactivated stronger than ever before. Within seconds his body started expanding, larger and larger, his muscles bulging up under his clothes. Naruto noticed his growth picking up, exceeding Sasuke's rate of growth and increasing speed every second! He grinned a feral grin of pleasure as he urged himself to grow larger, much larger! He wanted to make sure that both Sasuke and Kiba became less than bugs at his toes! The dust was more than happy to oblige increasing his growth even more! Within seconds Naruto's muscles had grown to the extent that they burst his mesh under shirt along with his black t-shirt, forcing his jacket open. The jacket bottom only reached halfway down his torso as his pants shredded into shorts while his feet burst out of his sandals. Naruto suddenly saw Sasuke appear, fully, in his sight and the expression on his face showed his surprise. Sasuke could only gape as Naruto grew on, watching in glee as his rival disappeared somewhere on his big toe. Naruto laughed, loving the feeling of expansion that ripped through him. Naruto's muscles rippled and expanded again, shredding the last remnants of his clothes, leaving him totally naked. Just as suddenly as Sasuke had appeared before him Naruto suddenly found himself surrounded by blank whiteness. He managed to catch a glimpse of the universe, or what was left of it after having two giant boys expand out of it, leaving behind a still rather massive boy who would not be catching up any time soon if ever. Sasuke has always relied on others when it came to power and was ill equipped to better himself like Naruto had always been able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kept his focus up.

However this didn't continue ad infinitium; as soon Naruto's bigger-then-the-universe body gained a red tinge as his chakra became visible. The Kyuubi within him had grown as well, and grown in power. This made Naruto grow so fast and so muscular that there aren't any words to describe the quickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto saw just pure white, followed by the tanned walk of flesh, than a toe, foot, leg, and so forth, Naruto didn't stop, wouldn't stop, couldn't stop.

But never had they seen someone grow that fast! Yes, this was the Realm of Eternal Growth, but even that got boring after while. Naruto was far beyond any size they had ever bothered to try and get to, since the only thing they could compare sizes to, was each other. This turned them all on more than they had in a very long time, especially Kiba. This sent the whole group into a massive orgy (massive as in...well...you get my meaning). In fewer words, Kiba got introduced to everyone very quickly, and he introduced himself back (I'm sure you can guess how). Despite the sex, one rational thought still went through his mind, \"Would Naruto ever calm down and stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto of course had no clue about the sex craze he had just started, as his rage was absolute now. Truly was he a mindless slave to his own growing. All he desired was to grow, and all he got was growing. But even so, a single rational voice spoke out against his own mind. It was in fact none other than Kyuubi's voice. But now Naruto was beyond the Nine-Tailed Fox's power and control, only his growing mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had grown past the infinity of the universe and into a place where you can never stop growing. But even they were mere dots on his small toe now, and becoming ever smaller. Truly, the question is, CAN Naruto ever escape his own rage and stop?</span></div></div>",

Naruto turned around and was met with Kiba's grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking Naruto. But let's just stay here for awhile. I mean, it's not like we can't just keep growing later. Why not relax for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned at Kiba's nonchalant attitude and was about to shrug Kiba's hand off his shoulder and leave him behind when Kiba suddenly moved forward, reached around, and grabbed Naruto's dick with his other hand. Naruto gasped and his body tensed. He hadn't been expecting this. Kiba continued to grin as he slowly moved his hand back and forth. Naruto grit his teeth as he felt his cock stiffen, blood rushing into the shaft. Naruto had a rather large cock and as he grew harder and harder Kiba was able to grab the shaft with both hands, his own dick hardening and pressing against Naruto's back. Naruto started thrusting his hips into Kiba's hands as pre-cum started oozing out of his slit, running down the shaft onto Kiba's hands. Kiba used the natural lubricant to make jacking Naruto off all the easier. Naruto's cheeks flushed as he felt himself getting closer and closer to climax. With a few shuddering jerks Naruto's cock spasmed and blew forth a torrent of white gold. Naruto screamed in ecstasy the normal feeling of orgasm increased dozens of times over thanks to his new size. In this moment Naruto's mind briefly blanked and he suddenly shot up a few feet. Kiba found himself flipping over Naruto's shoulder and landing on his back on top of Naruto's dick. It was wide enough that he could lay easily on it without fear of falling off. He grinned up at Naruto who was giggling at Kiba's predicament. Naruto focused his mind and shrank himself back down to \"normal\" size. Kiba put his hands on Naruto's shoulders and said, \"Time to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lowered himself to his knees and found himself face to crotch with Kiba's thick cock. It swelled in front of his eyes, longer and thicker as Kiba made it and it alone enlarge. Naruto eagerly opened his mouth wide and took Kiba's monster dick in, his big mouth filled completely with Kiba's meat. Saliva pooled around the organ mixing with the pre-cum as Naruto slurped, his tongue darting in and out of Kiba's piss slit. Kiba moaned in pleasure and slowly rubbed his shaft, his hands running over the veins that were bulging out. Naruto managed to pull the cock out with a loud \"pop\" just as it erupted in a stream of cum. The cum flew forward and suddenly disappeared into nothingness. Kiba, panting from the release, barely heard Naruto say, \"Hey, why did his cum disappear like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja that had first talked to Kiba smiled and said, \"It disappears because it's leaving the Realm of Eternal Growth and filtering down into other universes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Universes?\" Kiba panted out. \"There's more than one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! There are hundreds of different universes out there. You just can't see them from here. Our cum disappears down into those universes and sometimes lands on planets. If it lands on worlds that have humans on it the cum turns into that green dust that you two must have found and waits until it can infect someone. When it does, that person begins to grow and, depending on the will of the infected, will keep growing until he gets up to us! See, the cum only works on human males because our cum comes from human males.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys aren't all from the same universe are you?\" Naruto asked, pointing at the various other males there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we mostly came from the same universe, the same universe that you two come from. It's like the cum traveled back down our growth paths until it landed back on our planet. The biggest differences among us is that we come from different villages and different time periods. But none of that matters anymore. I mean, what's the point of being loyal to a village that is microscopic in a microscopic universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba nodded, agreeing. Naruto glanced down at his toe and wondered if the village was still on it somewhere, lost among the folds of his flesh. Heck,if it was still there it would have fallen into one of his pores by now and entered his body. Naruto pushed the thought from his mind. There was nothing he could do about it anymore anyway. Instead he turned to Kiba and said, \"So what do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Something about being this big seemed to keep his derriere a lot more open to pleasure and immune to pain. Nonetheless, it still felt quite full - he'd never taken it up the tush before.

So far the village had been lucky enough to survive, but could it really stay that lucky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand she had to consider her role as Hokage.  There was the possible risk of a ninja from another village starting to grow, one that would be less sympathetic to Leaf. That was a terrifying thought unto itself.  There could be no doubt that by this point other villages, at least if they survived to this point, were looking in to creating their own giants.  She had to grow someone who could take control of the situation, and that would be restrained enough to protect the village until she could finally come up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on the gathered ninja, she really only had one option.  \"Shikamaru, I'm putting the trust of the entire village, if not world, in you.  Do whatever it takes to get the others to stop growing and hold still until I find a way to reverse the process, and be careful to guard yourself so you don't get lost to this as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked ready to protest, but Tsuande shot him a glare that shut it down.  He was to wild, uncontrolled for what she needed here.  In fact she was even tempted to wait until one of the Jounin like Kakashi or Genma could be found, but the risks in that seemed  likewise high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Hokage didn't know is that she wasn't the only one planning a response.  Someone else was eying the growth chemical Tsuande held.  She stepped towards Shikamaru...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It feels great!\"       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO!!!!!!!\"  Naruto screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke turned to the source of the sound, and saw Naruto still tied to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEAVE.......HER........ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehhehehhe, you want her? Well come over here and get her!\"  Sasuke laughed squeezing his toes together very hard.  Sakura screamed even louder, she felt as though her head was going to pop open.    </span></div></div>",

Nothing happening, nothing to do, just one big stretch of boring. It was days like this that brought about the easy missions. The missions that were really, when you got down to it, nothing but chores. One such team, the team of Shikamaru, Ino, and Choji, were performing one such menial task. They were up on the side of a building, the back side, away from the street, and were repainting it. Ino was the only one who at least had some focus on getting it done. Choji was alternately helping, and alternately eating. But Shikamaru was laying down, back to his teamates, listlessly brushing the same spot over and over again with a paintbrush clutched between his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno glared at him as she noticed him slacking off. She tossed her paintbrush back into the pot, walked over to Shikamaru and grabbed him by his ear, dragging him to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW, hey! What are you doing?\" He yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Shikamaru! This isn't hard and the sooner we get done, the sooner we can go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, right. But why aren't you yelling at Choji? He's not exactly working hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me! She already yelled at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno huffed and said, \"Someone's got to take charge around here! Now get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nag, nag, nag!\" Shikamaru muttered under his breath. \"Is is so much to ask for a little time off once in awhile? Man, why can't I ever do what I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what you want?\" a voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru jumped and opened his eyes. There was a woman leaning out a window, watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to do what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's it to you lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and said, \"I think I have something that might help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disappeared and shortly returned with a small bottle. Wrapped around its neck was a little sign that said 'Drink Me'. She handed it to Shikamaru. He stared at it and said, \"You're kidding right? What is this going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman winked and said, \"Try some and find out. It's an heirloom that's been passed down my family for generations. It has a strong imprint of chakra on it, so it should be of some help to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaur mumbled a thanks and picked his brush up, continuing with the work. He glanced back at the window, but the woman was gone. He shook it off and kept on painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they were done. Shikamaru took his leave, letting Ino and Choji go to Asuma to report the completion of the work. He went back to his house, went up to his room, and laid on his bed. He pulled out the bottle and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this stuff really can let me do what I want...\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe uncorked the bottle and a small hissing sound was heard. Should he really trust some random woman and drink something like this?</span></div></div>",

If it was harmful, he probably wouldn't take enough to do much damage. If it was helpful, he could find out what it did and decide if he wants to increase the effects. It was a pretty good plan, so he tipped the little bottle up and took a swallow. He then set the bottle on a table and corked it again. It was a strange sensation. He could feel the liquid burning as it went down his throat. But it wasn't a harmful burn so he didn't think it was poison. He felt it pool in his stomach and slowly burn out. Then he felt a sudden rush of chakra through his body, pushing into all areas of his body. The feeling was incredible! He'd never had so much energy coursing through him! He felt it pushing, as though trying to escape his body. It was then, that Shikamaru noticed he was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out slow. His perspective was suddenly rising and everything seemed to be lowering. He stood next to the door frame and watched as he grew even with the top, then passed it. He bent down for a second, trying to decide if he should try and get out of his room, then decided to wait it out. He stood back up and felt his head hit the ceiling. By this time he'd stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah. Didn't see that coming.\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling of his room was about ten feet high, and he was slightly bent over so that probably put him at about ten and a half feet tall. This wasn't anything like he had expected, and yet it seemed to work. No one could tell him what to do at this size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless of course a group of people gained up on him or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on his bed and thought about this for a second.

He grabbed the bottle and put it into his pocket before squeezing out of his room and running down the stairs. The stairs creaked alarmingly at every step making Shikamaru glad his dad wasn't home at the moment. He finally made it to the door and threw it open to get whoever was knocking to quit it. Ino stumbled into the house, nearly tripping as she had been pounding so hard and fast on the door. Shikamaru stepped back and closed the door behind her while she straightened up saying, \"It's about time Shikamaru! Why are you wasting time around here when you should be with me and Choji preparing for our next...mission...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and up at Shikamaru's face hovering somehwere near the ceiling. She pointed and shivered and said, \"Wha-wha-wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and said, \"Please for all our sakes dont faint! That would be so cliche!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno lost all intimidation and shouted, \"Faint?!?!? Are you nuts?!?!? Who do you think you're talking too?!?!? I'm not Sakura for goodness sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru covered his ears and said, \"Alright, alright already, sheesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno calmed down a little but continued to shout, \"I want answers Shikamaru! How did you get so big? This isn't normal! Did Choji teach you this or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and said, \"No, when we were painting that house a little while ago, a woman gave me this bottle and told me it would let me do whatever I wanted. So I drank some of it and this happened.\" He pulled the bottle out of his pocket and showed it to Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to grab it but he held it up out of her reach and said, \"No way. This stuff is for me and me only thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! Shikamaru you're so greedy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno tried to jump up and grab it, but it was always just out of her reach. Finally she got frustrated and said, \"Fine! You can keep it all to yourself for all I care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru lowered the bottle to put it back into his pocket, when Ino pounced and made a grab for the bottle. She managed to get a few of her fingers around it before Shikamaru jerked it free from her grasp. Unfortunately, it sailed out of his hand and right out the window. Both Shikamaru and Ino gasped and ran to the window. Shikamaru pulled the window open and Ino stuck her head out, looking all over for the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\" Ino yelled pointing at the street. Shikamaru looked and saw it rolling along, getting kicked around by people who didn't notice it. He ran to the door and was about to open it and run out when Ino slammed her hand on the door, pushing it back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?\" She said. \"You can't go out there like that! What'll people say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't care. I want my bottle back so people can't force me to do things I don't want to do anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to open the door but Ino was fierce and held it in place with both hands, arms shaking with the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'll go get it and bring it right back here for you alright? Just don't cause a disturbance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru let go of the door and said, \"Fine, go ahead. But I wouldn't try and drink any for yourself. I've booby trapped the bottle. If anyone but me tried to open it, a bomb will off and destroy the bottle along with everything inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno didn't know whether or not he was bluffing, but Shikamaru was smarter than he let on, so she decided not to risk it. She nodded and ran out to go after the bottle. Shikamaru walked back to the window and bent down to look out it, watching as Ino ran down the street, her eyes focused on the ground. She looked left and right for it, but couldn't see it! Little did she know, someone else had already picked it up.</span></div></div>",

He brought it close to his ear and shook it. He definetly heard someting swishing around inside and said, \"I wonder what this stuff is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruto wasn't nearly as careful as Shikamaru in these kinds of situations so he put the bottle in his pocket without even thinking about what it could be and ran home to taste it just as Ino ran out the door and started searching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto got back to his apartment he uncorked the bottle and smelled the liquid inside. It smelled fruity and Naruto was pretty thirsty, so he took a few good gulps of it, drinking over half the bottle. Mysteriously enough, the bottle didn't seem to run out of liquid at all. It was still as full as when Shikamaru first drank from it. Naruto corked the bottle again and said, \"Man that stuff was good! Whoever dropped it was a real idiot, letting something that good go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto put the bottle in his pocket and started walking to the door when he felt a burning sensation in the pit of his stomach. He groaned and held his belly, wondering what was causing this sudden pain. As though answering his question, chakra began to flow wildly through him, overloading him to the point that he nearly blacked out from the power. He managed to stay concious however and was left sitting on the floor, panting from the sudden surge of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that?!?\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got shakily to his feet and headed for the door again. As he reached it, he started growing. Naruto yelped as he saw the door seemingly shrink away from him. Within seconds his head hit the ceiling and he sat down hard, clutching his head only to have it hit the ceiling again. Naruto got to his feet, causing his head to burst through the ceiling and out the roof. People in the street screamed as Naruto's giant head suddenly burst through the roof, showering the street in debris and continued to panic as his shoulders and the rest of his torso appeared after him. Naruto stepped out of his apartment as soon as his knees were clear and stood in the street, being careful not to crush anything. He continued to grow until he was sixty feet tall, most buildings only up to his shins. He looked around and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is pretty great! I've never felt so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the bottle and said, \"And it's all thanks to you, little bottle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Naruto the bottle was a lot smaller and he was still as clumsy as he ever was. He squeezed the bottle a bit too hard, but it was made of tougher stuff than glass and didn't break. What it did do was shoot from out between his fingers and straight through a window into someone's room. Naruto didn't see which building it landed in but he definetly noticed it missing. He frantically began to search for it, wondering where it had landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ino had had no luck finding the bottle but noticed the streets seemed strangely deserted. Her eyes had been trained on the ground and she therefore hadn't seen Naruto explode out of his apartment. But looking up now, she saw him bending over, searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great! Naruto has it! I've got to go tell Shikamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back to Shikamaru's room to tell him about this new trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, the trouble was only beginning.</span></div></div>",

Finally, the door opened and Shikamaru said, \"About time! Did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno put her hands on her hips and said, \"If you can't ask a little nicer, why should I bother telling you anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed. Ino was such a pain! But he wanted his bottle back so he said, \"Fine. Can you please tell me if you found it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded and said, \"That's better! And no I didn't find it. Naruto did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\" Shikamaru shouted. \"How did he get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when we were fighting, he must've found it and took it home, because he's like sixty feet tall now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned and said, \"So that's why everyone was running. Well, since the village is probably evacuating, no one should notice if I go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to trick Naruto into giving me that bottle back.\" He said, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno didn't like where this was going. With Shikamaru and Naruto fighting over a bottle that could turn them both into rampaging giants she didn't know how safe it was to stay in the village. She walked outside with Shikamaru and was nearly knocked on her butt as the ground started to shake. Shikamaru looked up and saw Naruto, but he was holding still and looking towards an apartment a few streets over. Shikamaru couldn't see the building from his vantage point, but it didn't matter as the whole building was suddenly torn down as a massive Kiba grew out of it. Kiba grew up and up until his foot was the only thing left standing where the apartment used to be, making Shikamaru and Ino smaller than his toes and Naruto only slightly taller than them. Ino turned and ran as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Shikamaru called after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting out of here! This place is way too dangerous for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was gone. Shikamaru sighed and said, \"Man, what a drag this is turning out to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran over to the giant Naruto and jumped on his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Look down already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tore his eyes from the collosal Kiba and looked down at Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shikamaru. What are you doing down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming to get my bottle back, but I can see you already lost it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that was yours huh? Isn't great? Look how big it made me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and said, \"Yeah, I know what it does, but I want it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm going to get it for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you two are forgetting about someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru and Naruto both turned and looked up as Kiba's huge foot crashed down in front of them. He grinned and said, \"That bottle is mine now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where is it?\" Shikamaru said. \"You're not holding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kiba looked at his hand and saw it was true! He must've dropped it when he started growing! \"Oh crap! I've got to find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way you big idiot! That bottle's mine!\" Naruto said, running towards where he thought it might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was unceremoniously tossed from Naruto's foot onto the ground. He stood up and said, \"Well, no one's paying attention to me, but I'm going to find it first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they all started looking.</span></div></div>",

Shikamaru was practically naked too although he was almost decent in comparison.

So I'm going to tie you up to ensure you don't escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up some strings from his clothes that had ripped off of him in his growth and handed one to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tie Naruto up.\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba did so and as soon as he was done, Shikamaru grabbed him and tied him up. Sighing he laid back, dropped the two smaller giants onto his stomach, put his hands behind his head and fell asleep. Kiba and Naruto struggled for awhile, but to no avail. Naruto had almost rocked himself right into Shikamaru's belly button. THAT would've been a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Naruto and Kiba, the power of the bottle was fickle indeed. The bigger you became, the quicker you eventually shrank! The only way to keep huge size was to constantly drink from the bottle, but neither of the ninja knew that, and it was a difficult rule to figure out. By the next day, Shikamaru would've shrunk to half his current size. And, being so lazy, Shikamaru could be out of it for awhile...</span></div></div>",

There was however one benefit, if you are ant sized to someone else, you are as unnoticeable as an ant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru moved to make sure his body was outside of what was left of the village and sat down.  He was still rubbing the back of his head while mumbling something about \"how troublesome\" this whole thing was.  It was then Kiba saw an opening.  Shikamaru's other hand was near the ground, he might never get a better chance to get that bottle back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanneling chakra to his legs Kiba took off, running at the bottle at full speed.  For some reason the bottle had gotten bigger along the way, but every time a giant grew it would be proportionately smaller then them.  To Naruto it would be larger then him, to Kiba it would be something well over sized, and to Shikamru, it would be tiny.  Tiny meant he couldn't get a good grip on it.  Not having a good grip on it meant it could be knocked free.  That meant an opportunity Kiba could not pass on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba reached the bottle and while Shikamaru was still distracted by the tiny village, pulled it free.

However, there were a certain few that stayed behind and didn't evacuate. These were the people who decided to take advantage of the village's disarray to profit themselves. One such notable person was Konohamaru. He had watched, from the Academy grounds, Naruto expanded into the sky. Knowing something big was going on he managed to slip away while Iruka was gathering the other students to evacuate and made his way towards the giant Naruto. A few minutes later he had been thrown to the ground as Kiba erupted from an apartment building, totally dwarfing Naruto. More determined now to know what was going on, the ninja in training ran full tilt towards Naruto. By this time both Kiba and Naruto (and Shikamaru, though Konohamaru didn't know it) were searching out the bottle. By the time Kiba had grabbed both Naruto and Shikamaru, Konohamaru was only a few steps away. Of course, no one took notice of him and he didn't even have to worry about trying to disguise himself. He had been about to approach Naruto and find out what was going on when he saw Shikamaru drinking from something. When Shikamaru jumped down to Kiba's foot Konohamaru saw that Shikamaru had a bottle in his hand. It didn't take a genius to be able to put two and two together especially when Shikamaru started growing. Konohamaru quickly ran from the expanding feet, nearly tripping and getting overtaken by the lazy ninja's growing body, but successfully escaping death by hiding between Shikamaru's toes. He caught his breath as he tried to figure out what to do next. It would extremely difficult to even think of taking the bottle from Shikamaru at this point. The genius ninja was more like a living mountain to Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a stroke of good luck Shikamaru stepped outside the village and sat down, near to where Konohamaru was (which was next to the gate). Konohamaru was about to go after Shikamaru when he saw Kiba dash past him over the gate. Konohamaru knew a shortcut out of the village and quickly took that ending up next to one of Shikamaru's hands. He watched as Kiba stole the bottle and ran into the forest. Konohamaru wasted no time and followed after him. He caught up with the dog ninja when he was opening the bottle. If Kiba drank the contents it would be over for him! He'd no doubt get even bigger than Shikamaru making his attempts totally futile! Thinking fast Konohamaru pulled out several smoke bombs and did the only thing he could think of doing: he launched them directly into Kiba's eyes. The smoke bombs exploded with full force blinding Kiba. The smoke was then inhaled into his super sensitive nose blocking out all of Kiba's senses except for abject misery. The bottle came crashing down from his hand, landing a few feet in front of Konohamaru knocking him to the ground. This was his chance! The bottle was bigger than he was but he wasn't going to let that stop him! When he drank from that bottle he'd be recognized as more than just the Third Hokage's grandson! Something much, much, more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed up the bottle and looked into it. It was filled with a mysterious liquid that he had never seen before but he wasn't about to let that stop him. He knew exactly what it would do when he drank it. Leaning over he stuck his face into the liquid and started inhaling, gulping down mouthful after mouthful. Kiba, his eyes finally clear and his nose no longer howling with pain, looked blearily down and saw the Academy student drinking the bottle! He reached down and flicked the boy off the bottle , sending him flying into a clearing. He brought the bottle to his lips again and was about to drink when </span></div></div>",

His goal of growing stronger then sasuke driving him forward, he stumbled into his small ratty apartment kicking the door closed behind him. His orange jumpsuit was stained through in several areas with his sweat, clearly he had come home just relax after a hard day, he walked into the kitchen. He dug into pantry and pulled out a container of cup ramen, and turned his stove on to heat the kettle.  He placed the container of ramen on the stove and walked out of the room to relieve himself and switch into his normal nightwear. He heard the hiss of the kettle just a few moments after dressing, he figured he would catch a shower in the morning and go back to his routine of training if his squad did not get selected for a mission. He walked casually into the kitchen unaware that this was about to his change his and many lives forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually pulled the top off the cup ramen and carefully poured the kettle water into the cup (all of it, naruto gets the jumbo sized cup ramens due to him having to buy so much of it to sate him.)  he then took the slightly hot cup into his living room and sat down on his crumpled and damaged sofa, all his furniture the little that he had were in poor repair due to him being given extremely used ones instead of buying new ones. He quickly began to scarf down the jumbo cup of ramen, not even bothering with any silverware or utensils. A moments later he had finished the cup and set it on his coffee table which was littered with similar objects already. He felt a familiar warmth settle in his stomach as the noodles began to digest, but then suddenly he felt his stomach lurch forward. He fell off the sofa and landed roughly on the floor of his apartment , he let out a slight curse at the pain and just clutched at his stomach which was rumbling quite loudly. \u201cA-Ah, what Is going on was that poisoned?\u201d He muttered as the pain in his gut just intensified if he was in less pain then he would realize that his night outfit which had always been a little snug was just beginning to tear apart at the seams. He was distracted by his lurching stomach pain when he opened his eyes from their clenched shut state and realized that he was quickly filling up his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already about fifteen or so feet wide and about double that in height, he was pushing against the walls and yet he just continued to grow! The clothing which had been fraying and turning to in scraps up until now just gave up and broke, the walls of his apartment were groaning in protest, as was the floor (he was on the second level of the apartment)  suddenly he lurched forward once again and hit his head on the wall\u2026.For about ten seconds then the wall gave away and he was in the next door apartment and he just kept growing and growing, thirty feet came and went and was replaced by forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, by the time he reached a hundred feet tall the blonde just stood up from the ruins of what he had been his home since childhood (his apartment) and stared around. Only the tallest building in the area the hokage tower was larger then him, the rest came up to his waist, the blonde just stared about in wonder. A faint smile laced across his lips as he realized that he could indeed be the strongest ninja ever now.  He let out a chilled bit of laughter, it was late at night and most people were heading to bed or already there themselves but his laughter came out like a blow horn and most people walked into the streets in their sleepwear or peeked out their windows and stared at the blonde titan in shock. Shikamaru  meanwhile who had been laying on the second hokage\u2019s head just staring at the village having given up on watching naruto a few hours as it was too boring just stared in horror at the large naruto. \u201cSo that was what most of the bottle will do\u2026\u201d He thought grimly about the tiny portion he had left for himself, he doubted it would make him grow a foot little lone a massive being like naruto now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLISTEN UP KONOHA I AM YOUR NEW HOKAGE AND GOD!\u201d the blonde boasted, his voice like a announcer at a super stadium.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dog ninja slowly approached them closer they had scientific labels on them but he couldn\u2019t understand them. But he did know any one down here would be up to no good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there a wush of air and some one was in front of him, it was the dark figure! Kiba barely had time to curse as a wooden bat was rammed against his head and he slumped to the ground unconscious.

From the clanking it was making when he pulled up, it was probably some sort of slab. He couldn\u2019t see anything for a long time but suddenly massive surgical lighting turned out revealing he was in some sort operating room. He glanced around and noticed he had an iv running into his arm, it had nothing in it but he also noticed old of those old rusting drums of fluid, and oddly enough when he peered over he saw that looked like a crystal clear liquid like pure water. Kiba struggled and struggled to get free from his binds but they were good old fashioned leather restraints used for mental patients and prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He used all of his speed and training to keep himself from losing the figure again, but from the way the figure was bobbing and weaving, it was clear he or she had the same training. You\u2019re a ninja! The dog accused as he ran after the figure who remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba continued to follow the figure down a large passage when the figure suddenly stopped and turned to face kiba. And then kiba realized why he had only seen a shadow, the figure was decked in all black, his cloak blowing slightly through a unknown breeze. So you saw me did you mutt? His tone oddly familiar to kiba, it doesn\u2019t make any difference that you know about this place, you will and this entire ungrateful village. This hateful bigoted place will burn I assure you the figure said before walking into a previously unseen room and kiba slowly followed after drawing a kunai knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside kiba was in awe of just the sheer scope and size of the room, it could easily fit two or three jumbo jets in here, and it was nearly as tall as the hokage building.  The room was all also loaded with various containers and vats, kiba realized those vats could very well be some sort of chemical weapon. Are you a rouge ninja? The figure appeared in front of kiba as if It was nothing and merely gave him a back hand that sent him flying into a wall. Kiba kiba kiba the figure chided, you figure after you getting your ass kicked by me before that would enough for you he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba finally realized with a sudden horror he knew who the figure was. Naru\u2026. Naruto! Why? Why are you doing this? The figure reached back behind his veiled hood and pulled a bloody anbu mask off his face and merely sent a glare towards kiba. Why? WHY! Look at this village! I am a freak and outcast due to no fault of my own, kiba opened his mouth to speak and naruto punched him in the jaw. No kiba as if naruto was reading his mind, this is not simply because I do my occasional prank, it because this stupid fox is locked inside my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru\u2026 naruto I never viewed you as a monster in fact, there are several people who lo\u2026.

Like who? Me and shikimaru for one the dog ninja said pleading, iruka and your own teacher of course.

What those fools up there don\u2019t realize is that I have saved their village more times then I care to recall naruto screamed.

So fuck them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba realized grimly that naruto had a point, but kiba reached out and grabbed naruto\u2019s hand, oddly enough kiba realized he enjoyed the feeling of the hand, the warmth in it, it made him feel secure, he supposed that was the dog in his personality. What about those who don\u2019t think of you like that? what about your friends and people who love you! name one person who loves me naruto said, his face blank as if he already knew kiba would say no one. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that was of course kiba\u2019s mother; naruto himself had never even known his mother. For this was naruto and kiba\u2019s favorite game to play with each other house. naruto was the daddy and kiba was the mommy and they had great fun playing the game until kiba\u2019s mother had caught them and told him not play with such a vile creature. Kiba didn\u2019t understand until much later what his mother had meant by that, it wasn\u2019t that he and naruto were engaging in a homosexual act it was that he was a demon vessel.  But the next time he went to the play ground naruto wasn\u2019t there, and he never played \u201chouse\u201d with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------End of flash back-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba merely smiled and had his tender lips brush against the blonde; all that warm pleasure of another just engulfing you was overwhelming them both. Kiba wrapped himself atop naruto protectively as they made out, their tongue\u2019s clashing for dominance but like back then he lost out to the blonde who eagerly took kiba\u2019s reluctant surrender for his tongue to once more plunge into the warm cavern that was kiba\u2019s mouth. This went on for a time before naruto slowly with a grunt removed himself from under kiba and began to brush himself off. So naruto will you abandon your insane quest to kill every one?

He had been causing trouble for Iruka at the Academy and his grandfather had had enough of it. He was therefore stuck in his room for the rest of the day. But he wasn't going to just stay put of course. If spending time with Naruto taught him anything it was that you don't always follow the rules. If you wanted to do something you just had to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had waited patiently for everyone in the house to be gone and then had snuck out of his room. He was about to head outside and go find his friends when he ran by his granfather's room. Normally this room's door was coninually closed and locked but today it was open. Konohamaru couldn't resist looking inside. Unfortunately it was disappointingly normal. There was a bed, a closet, a bathroom, a desk covered with scrolls and a window with a curtain. Konohamaru sighed and walked over to the desk, shifting some scrolls over and looking for something interesting. His eye fell on a scroll that looked like it had come from the Akimichi's. Konohamaru remembered that his grandfather was prized as knowing every jutsu in the Leaf Village and this one must've come from the Akimichi family. He noticed that some of the hand signs had been altered as was evident in the fresh ink. Konohamaru knew he'd never get another chance like this, so he performed the hand signs and waited to see what would happen. Konohamaru had improved his skills greatly and easily performed the jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakra flowed around him and he felt slightly worried that he had performed something dangerous. Luckily, the chakra all flowed into his body and he felt perfectly normal. Then he started to grow. He looked around him in surprise as everything started getting smaller. He stopped a few feet from the ceiling, at about ten feet tall. Poor Konohamaru's clothes, however, were not designed to hold when such a drastic transformation occured and were now much to small for him. His shorts had shredded leaving him in his briefs while his shirt had torn down the back. His goggles and ripped off as well as his scarf. He felt exposed and surprised and didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, he tried to get out of the room. Unfortunately, the door was much too small and the doorframe itself was ripped out of the wall. That was a problem that would have to be solved later. Konohamaru tried to release the jutsu, but it wouldn't work. Whatever his grandfather had done to tamper with this jutsu, it wasn't releasing when he made the hand signs and his chakra wasn't being depleted. Frustrated he just sat down in the hallway and thought about this whole situation.</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for his head to hit the ceiling of the hallway and his body to become wedged in it. His shoulders were pushing into the groaning walls and his hips were making dents near the floor. His arms were jammed painfully toward each other in front of him, while his feet disappeared down the staircase. Konohamaru continued to grow larger and larger until his head burst through the ceiling and entered the attic. He sneezed explosively at all the dust in the room. The wind he caused blew throughout the room, stirring up more dust and knocking things over. As more dust flew up his nose he sneezed again and again. The last sneeze had enough force to blow open the window up there. Fortunately, all anyone in the street saw was a cloud of dust coming from the attic window. They assumed someone was cleaning up there and went about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge groaning erupted all around Konohamaru as he felt the walls bowing away from him and floor sagging under his weight. His feet had made it down the stairs and were pushing towards the doors, his legs taking their place on the stairs. If he didn't stop growing soon everyone in the village would be greeted with the sight of a pair of giant feet bursting from the Hokage's mansion. This thought was quickly interupted by an enormous crack that came from the walls on either side of him. By this time, his head was pressing into the ceiling and that was beginning to splinter. Hearing this crack, Konohamaru tried to bend down and see what was happening, but he couldn't see through the hole that his shoulders had created. Konohamaru tried to move his arms and to his delight, he found he could! The splintering must've been from the walls giving way. Before he could celebrate, however, the floor gave way beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people around the mansion definetly heard that and all looked toward the mansion, wondering what was going on. The Anbu Black Ops would normally respond to such a disturbance, but they were all off on other duties in and around the village. It was troubling times and guards were needed everywhere and not just around the Hokage's mansion. This was lucky for Konohamaru who wasn't hurt, but was getting annoyed. The hokage mansion now consisted of one floor instead of two not counting the attic. Konohamaru waved away the dust then looked himself over. He was still growing, but his briefs were holding out at least! He quickly drew up his legs so his feet wouldn't burst through the door and wrapped his arms around his legs. He continued to swell steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just great!\" He thought bitterly to himself. \"How much bigger am I going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though to answer his question, the growth increased and Konohamaru slammed his head into the ceiling again. He gasped in pain and his legs shot out, smashing through the wall and into the street. People screamed and ran as a huge pair of feet connected to an equally huge pair of legs suddenly appeared in the streets. To increase their panic, a gigantic pair of arms erupted from the other walls and planted themselves on the ground steadying the enormous body within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's head took up the entire attic and he was able to look down at the trouble he caused through the attic window. He swung his arms around smashed through the walls, bringing the roof down on his head. Bracing himself, he stood up to his full huge height, pieces of the building falling from his body. He quickly checked himself to make sure his briefs had survived and sighed in relief when he saw they had. The few people that were left looked up in shock at their Honorable Grandson standing in the ruins of the Hokage's mansion. Konohamaru didn't know what to say and was embarrased by all the attention people were giving him.</span></div></div>",

I have to say, I haven't felt this horny in ages!\" he flexed his three-foot long cock, the leaking pre flying into air, splattering onto the ground and hitting his stunned son in the face. \"Whoops, sorry buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoruto's tongue instinctively licked the pre off the side of his face. His father tasted good. Boruto blatantly checked his dad out, looking at his massive pec shelf and the dim shadow it cast over his rock-hard eight-pack, each little cobblestone deeply cut and toned to perfection. Bulging biceps and ripped triceps framed his dad's arm, easily with enough strength to level a small mountain. His calves and thighs were the stuff of legend, and that cock, oh heavens that dick. Pointing up at an angle, veins pumping blood through the enormous organ of love-making, twitching with pre flowing from the massive sack resting on the ground. Boruto gulped. He had never been so attracted to the male form. His cock, semi-hard already, quickly reached its peak, equally as large as his fathers and dripping its own lubricants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho, does someone like what they see?\" asked Naruto slyly. He began to approach his son, who stood up in response. \"I helped you out, so how about you return the favor, whadda ya say, son?\" Naruto smiled a wicked grin, watching his son grow so massive had already riled him up, and his own growth had just about pushed him over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoruto quickly complied, overwhelmed by his father's appearance and sexual aura, and began sucking on his dad's cock. \"Oh yessssssss, that's it.\" moaned Naruto. \"Faster!!\" he growled. \"HARDER!\" He grabbed his son's head and began pushing him harder, deeper onto his massive cock. \"MORE,  MORE, MORE, SUCK ME OFF, MAKE ME GROW HUGE! Naruto summoned a pair of clones, equally as large, naked, and horny. \"Why don't you boys help me boy out huh?\" The clones began to do their work, one began sucking off Boruto, while the other began kissing and worshipping his chest and abs. \"I'm gonna, I'm gonna-\" began Naruto. \"CUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the horny Hokage began to pump his son full of seed, he began to grow. With every shot, one foot grew the massive man. The Hokage roared in satisfaction, he was gonna HUGE, HOT, HUNG. Sixteen shots in total. The Hokage's size had doubled to 32 feet tall. His cock, now 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, popped out of his son's mouth. The Hokage gripped his hefty package, attempting to squeeze out anymore drops. He was in heaven, and his dick immediately began to harden as he watched his clones finish pleasuring his son. Boruto gave out a sexual roar surpassing his previous one. As he shot into the clone's mouth. Shot after powerful shot, the clone couldn't withstand it, and poofed away aftera mere three shots. But Boruto kept on going, for a full minute of sexual release. He grew all the while, bigger and bigger, having consumed his father's seed and received head from a clone. Boruto grew to a massive 40 feet tall, dwarfing his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoruto collapsed onto the ground equally as exhausted as the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked disappointed. \"Ah well, his body might just not be able to handle so much growth. I definitely have more endurance.\" Naruto looked around at the white, sticky mess his son had made. Then down at his raging hard-on. \"Mmm\" he pondered. \"Should I clean or catch up?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not saying they can't be there, just not as giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No toilet stuff please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No hard vore. It's gross to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Keep the sex, if any, to a minimum. Unless a storyline specifically makes them older, they are just kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No limits. I don't care how big they are, as long as there is still interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>EDIT: 1/30/11--NEW RULES</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"> 6. For the love of all that is good people, STOP with the excessive choice chapters! There should only be choice chapters dealing with characters at the  beginning of the story not in the middle of a storyline. If you want to introduce new characters than write a chapter introducing them. Any further choice chapters that are merely a few sentences long that appear in the middle of a storyline will be deleted NO QUESTIONS ASKED.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">7. PLEASE use proper spelling and grammar when writing chapters! I'm not a grammar nazi, but I do like to have a certain level of quality in my stories. Please proofread your chapters before adding them. It doesn't take long.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">8. All chapters, beyond BEGINNING choice chapters, MUST be at least 5 decent sentences long.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Add on if you read, and let's have some fun!</td>",
