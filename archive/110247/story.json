He had Jon over and the two were recording some episodes of Game Grumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookit that dangass pokemon, who does he think he is!?\" Jon exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArin laughed. \"I dunno dude, he looks so pompous. Kind of reminds me of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arin, I am geniunely hurt right now!\" Jon murmured with a saddened expression. He struggled against a rising grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished up the episode and took a break, Arin grabbed two monsters out of the fridge and threw one to Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way dude, do you wanna hang out tonight?\" Arin asked, sipping his bubbly drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sounds fun. I think my friend is having a party tonight and I can drag you along... or, I think you still owe me a beer from that bet I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh yeah..\" Arin mumbled, blushing as he remembered that night. They had hit up a Barcade in L.A. -- Jon was a little buzzed, and Arin was a little trashed. Arin was surprised he could remember anything. He vaguely remembered betting Jon that he could never smack Arin's ass in public, but Jon proved him wrong right then and there as a wild look came into his eyes. Jon spanked Arin and reached his other hand in to squeeze his junk, too. Arin told himself he would have been mad if he weren't so drunk... but he couldn't deny the way Jon made him feel, drunk *and* sober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArin thought he saw a mischievous smile playing on Jon's lips, but he couldn't be sure. Arin pondered the choice. \"Well, hanging out here could be fun, but so could that party..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Arin returned the warm smile that Jon was giving him, and his anxiety melted away as he took a seat next to his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wha- uh, what do you wanna do then?\" Arin mumbled, his face still flaming hot from all the stupid shit he was remembering Jon had done that night. Jon seemed to notice, and he carefully snaked his hand around Arin's. The longer haired man sighed, and squeezed Jon's hand. \"I'm too fucking shy and bisexual for this, Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon couldn't help but burst out laughing at Arin's perfectly set joke, and fell head first onto Arin's shoulder, his laugh being slightly muffled by the fabric of Arin's t-shirt. Arin smiled and let his head rest against Jon's, and he didn't feel so flustered with holding hands anymore. Yeah, the party probably wasn't nearly as fun as this was. But it was a good thing that they had decided not to go, because Arin was in the mood for...</span></div></div>",

He would pull Arin up onto his knee while he sat on his icy throne and Arin always felt like he was on top of the world when he turned around and saw the entirety of the great hall stretched out in front of him. The king had told him in his booming voice, <i>\"They're not something to be taken lightly, Arin. It's said that they're bits of the universe falling down to take us on when it's our time to leave this world. Simply using one as a mode of transportation is a quick way to get yourself in trouble.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArin is a curious boy with a mischievous streak, though, and when he found one floating innocuously at the top of a hill while out walking the frozen plains of their Shiver Star he could not resist grabbing onto one of the warm, rounded points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broken leg and multitude of scrapes and bruises that followed his crash landing served as a lesson he would not soon forget. When he had finally made it back to the castle, his face was caked with crystals of ice from his crying and the king had stood there shaking his head with a knowing smile as the nursemaid fretted over Arin and treated his injuries. Arin hadn't been scolded, but the quiet words his father had shared with him that night as he pressed his hand to Arin's leg, radiating enough cold to numb the broken limb had been enough. <i>\"You knew better, Arin.\"</i> Disappointing his father, the revered king of Shiver Star, and the person Arin looked up to and regarded so highly, was a worse punishment than any petty time out or whipping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArin had always assumed the warp stars were unique to Shiver Star--like most children naive to the world. It seemed to him as though their Kingdom in the middle of the icy tundra was the entirety of existence. He had no reason to think the dark, twinkling expanse of sky was filled with life, miles and miles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd perhaps he never would have discovered otherwise if it wasn't for the Sickness. The awful plague that claimed the lives of nearly everyone in the kingdom and turned all of the creatures inhabiting Shiver Star feral and dangerous. Many had called it foul magic or the work of some angry god, but his father had always known it was Dark Matter. Everyone in the Kingdom knew of Dark Matter, as they had all heard the ghost stories as children. Huddled with their siblings or friends they shrieked and giggled at the grandiose descriptions of great balls of dark energy with huge, bloodshot eyes terrorizing fantastic lands. Maybe that was why the belief of mysticism being the cause for the Sickness was so widespread, because the people simply could not believe the horror stories they had heard so long ago were very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would throw itself into the wells and contaminate the water, bury itself in the fields and foul the crops, and even infect the people directly, flying into their chest like a hurled spear. His father had told him after the first case was discovered--two families living at the very edge of the city found dead, apparently having torn each other apart with their bare hands--that it was the work of Dark Matter making itself known. He had pleaded with Arin to please, trust him, and stay within the castle. To stay safe and away from the madness until he found a way to purge it from the Kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArin had pleaded with him to stay as well--he hadn't understood why it was up to him to deal with Dark Matter. After all, wasn't it the soldiers' responsibility to protect the Kingdom? Yet his father had only smiled at him and hugged him close, letting Arin cry silently into his furs. Arin remembered the words whispered into the crown on his head like they were etched into his brain, because it was one of the last things his father said to him while he was still wholly himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The soldiers' responsibility is to follow my orders, Arin. My responsibility is to protect the people who depend on me, and the ones I love. To protect you, my son.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere weeks later when he had stood by the king's bedside as he lay there with terrifying, bloodshot eyes, Arin found that he resented him. His father had promised to protect him and the people, but what about himself? He did so much to make sure Arin was unhurt yet he faced this nightmare monster straight from a storybook alone and now he was going to die, just like so many others before him. Arin wanted to scream at him; wanted to tell him that he should've listened to him and let the soldiers deal with it, or simply ran. Why should he be the one to die in an effort to save the people? Arin hadn't been able to do anything but stand there and weep silently over what used to be his father's body, though, his tears flowing so hot and fast they couldn't even freeze on his face. He stood there even when the nursemaid barreled into the room screaming his name, begging him to come with her and escape with the warp star on the roof of the tower. She had physically pulled him away, gathering him up under her arms as they climbed the steps and he found his voice, screaming at her the entire time to go back, go back and make him well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arin saw the peculiar yellow star waiting for them at the top of the tower, his father's words came back to him like an embrace and he stopping fighting the nursemaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's said that they're bits of the universe falling down to take us on when it's our time to leave this world.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father was gone, on his own warp star away from the corpse below their feet. And now it was his time to leave, too. He had wrapped his arms tightly around the top spire, closed his eyes, and the world around him had fallen away with a rush of wind.</span></span></div></div>",
