People had first started coming over at around seven, but it hardly felt like almost five hours had passed. But you hadn't been keeping track of time lately. The party was at your friend Sara's place, and her parents were cool with it, or so you'd heard. Some people had passed out on the couch, though you hadn't seen any sign of alchohol befoehand. Some of the more annoying people who had shown up already left once no one paid any attention to the, so it had worked out by the end. Still, the party wasn't winding down yet, and Sara had suggested that they could just stay the night if they were worried about driving back so late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was pretty big, you had to say. From what you knew Sara and her family were pretty fortunate, and had money to spare. That's probably why everyone hung out there so often. The place was just shy of a mansion, by the look of it. You feel a slight wave a nausea, but dismiss it as an after effect of something you had been dared to eat off of the floor a few hours prior. It was disgusting, but you had money at risk if you didn't finish your dare. You were always getting sucked into gambling, despote how much you were trying to get over it. As far as bad habits go, gambling was the worst. Especially if you're not good at it, you think with a chuckle. But there were matters to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two more minutes, you try to search the room for a certain someone. It was your crush, a girl you'd known since you were a freshman. With no sign of the girl, you decide it's not all that important that you talk to her now and just wait. Eventually the girl would come by, unless she had decided not to spend the night. However, you had noticed that a lot of people were planning on leaving now, and to your dismay all the guys seemed to be leaving. Most of them were your friends too, and you return a wave from your Mark as he heads outside. Crap, now the girls were going to sit you down soon and have a \"heart-to-heart talk\" or something like that again. Rolling your eyes, you suddenly feel a sharp pain in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching your gut, you double over in pain. What the hell was going on, a heart attack or something? These wree your first thoughts. The world appeared to spin around you, your eyesight fuzzy and drifting in and out of focus. Dropping to your knees, you see that no one has even noticed your fall. But how was that possible, surely they had seen... wait, why did everything look so huge all of a sudden? Quickly you look down at yourself, and notice that this can only mean one thing: The world wasn't getting bigger, you were shrinking. It was impossible, that was for sure... yet it was happening. In seconds you have dwindled down to a mere half inch in height. You fall unconscious, sinking to your knees....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>12:00 PM.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to start, where are you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be hard to get a positive idea just from a pair of feet, but you might be able to if only you could see their faces or what they're wearing. The table above your head hinders you from doing anything like that, which was why you were unfortunately having to dash toward the feet before knowing who you were dealing with. As you reach the edge and maintain a relatively safe distance from the feet (roughly a foot away, as in twelve inches), the realization comes. After you had craned your neck up as far as it would allow and set your eyes on the giantess who stood before, you see that it is none other than one of your school friends, Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had flirted in the past, but had never talked anything serious. Still, she had no quarrels with you that you'd ever known. She was one grade below you, and fourteen years old if you remember right. People's birthdays always melded in your memory, they were so hard to keep track of. But you were a sitting duck here in Sara's living room, at the ground where so many giantesses would now be walking. So far Beth was still standing still, talking to someone you didn't recognize even after seeing her enormous visage. Well, there were an array of options for you now, but keeping your head and making the logical choice would make all the difference. These three decisions are:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking in the full scale of your predicament, it dawns on you just how small you truly are. Looking at the foot of the giantess again, your next target, you notice that her big toe is as tall as you are now. Quite the humbling experience, since you're about to try and contact this girl, regardless of the repurcussions. True, she held nothing against you that could be seen on the surface, but from what you know about people there are always little things here and there that people secretly want to exact revenge for. But once she saw your dilemma that would most likely melt away, and you'd like to think that way, even if it didn't occur. Best to think positive when you're an insect among goddesses, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this had been racing through your brainscape just as you reached the toes on Beth's left sandaled foot, unmoving as her earsplitting chatter above crashed down on your ears. It wasn't so much that she was being loud, although she had to raise her voice above the music playing in the room, but everything seemed loud to you since shrinking. It was logical that this would happen, but you could really do without the headache that was beginning to form. Pushing away the festering pain for now, you tell yourself there will be time to address that after you were safe in Beth's hands. Facing the imposing monolith of a teen, you gulp slowly, palms sweating. Do or die, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your arm up to strike, then think better of it. Punching or any sort of physical assault could easily be mistaken for an insect's bite or movement after all, and that wasn't a light you would want to be seen in once the giantess felt you and looked down. Thinking better of it now, you decide that tickling might be a better option. Still, that might not be enough to actually arouse suspicion, especially as your pink-haired friend is in a conversation with that stranger. However, how many courses of action were left, if not to hit the foot? Climbing; that was possible after all, theoretically. The gravity of the situation is causing your nerves to tense. You'll have to make a determining choice now, before you lose your chance.</span></div></div>",

Besides, if anyone in the immediate range would help you, it would be her. Or so you suspected, since the two of you got along well. Not having the luxury any longer to not make such a big decision, you raise up your arm to hit the foot with all your might. Scurrying over to the side of the foot so you wouldn't get hurt if Beth recoiled from the pain (although it was unlikely that she'd even feel it) you get to a safer position. And hopefully where you now stood would be in plain view for when the goddess look down at her feet and saw you. With that hasty plan refined, you commit the act, slamming your tiny fist into the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute ripple was all the evidence you could see that your punch had even made an impact, but it was no up to her nervous system to register the pain, if it was even enough to alert the girl. Waiting in the shadow of the colossus now, your palms continue to sweat from your increasing anxiety. You're also tempted to steal away now and find someone else, when suddenly the conversation between the two giantesses pauses, and you see Beth's titanic visage facing downward, her eyes scanning the floor by her feet. This was perfect, now al you would have to do was run into sight.

Why, where have I seen you before?\" The giantess asks, true confusion resonating in her voice. Unsure what to make of this just yert, you place your heads in your hands, getting more worried by the second. Could she really not recongize her own friend, or was she playing dumb for some potentially deceitful reason? Or maybe neither, a third, more creepy possibility. You look back at the girl, face pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what going on, but we've been friends for years. Here, bring me closer to your eye, you'll be able to tell by then,\" you tell her, hoping and praying that the only reason you had been mistaken for a stranger was your tiny stature. Beth obliges, bringing you up to her huge eyes, like an orb-shaped searchlight in the sky. A shaken head in response, and the girl shrugs. You gesture rapdily for her to take you somewhere away from all the party's noise, and she nods. Next thing you knew Beth brought you into the bathroom adjacent to the hallway, locking the closed door behind her.<br>\r\n\"Even though I can't recall ever meeting you, that doesn't mean I'm just going to do nothing.

Good, you think to yourself, I've got plenty of time. But as you adjust your tiny feet to stay put on her now large, tall legs you find that it may not of been such a good idea. Your hands wrap around her and as you take in a deep breath and hope you have the energy to climb her, you feel a jerk that forces you to fall back to her ankles. You catch yourself just before falling completely off her foot. You look up. She was just adjusting her feet. Whew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you climb back up slowly and with every thing your tiny little body had until finally you reach her calves. You're completely exhausted, however somewhat proud (odd, I know) that you made it this far. You look up once more. Sweat had already started beading on your tiny forehead which was distracting your view but beyond what you were able to see... you spotted the color pink and I'm not talking about her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, at this point your arms and legs feel unattached to the rest of your body and keeping them pressed against her legs was almost impossible at this point. You look around hoping for someone... something... anything that could help.. but all you found was a bag that belonged to the girl Beth was talking to. It was just the right height to jump.. but do you really want to do it? Sure it would give you time to calm down and rest and then you could presume climbing Beth to get her attention..But before you could think of any other way, Beth's body began to part from the girl and you could see the bag getting further away.. Do you jump? Or do you take the chance of falling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It might be little more than justification for yourown cowardice,but you were in a surreal situation for which there were no precepts to look back on. For all you knew, it would be suicide to continue scaling Beth as you currently were, and you had gotten lucky to survive even her most idle movements. Using a few seconds of preparation for the leap, you make it to the bag successfully, with a close call when you nearly failed to hoist your body up after your arms landed in the bag first. You had clutched the malleable fabric and utilized an upper-body strength you didn't know you possessed to spare yourself a fatal fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickening humor in all of this was that your pink-haired friend had no clue that you were scraping out such a meager existence at her feet,or else she would be inclined to help you out. Until you made it to somewhere that you felt comfortable getting Beth's attention from, your life was essentially in her hands. You adjust yourself to drop into the bag, vainly hoping it would be exclusively soft items. Your brief drop concludes with you hitting your ass on what felt like a cell phone. There could have been worse things to land on, but you still muttered a string of curses as you hunted for a soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour horrible luck seems to turn as you find a half-opened box of Dots candy. They were like beanbags toyou, and might even double as a potable food source after you'd inspected them. Prying the thin package open, three Dots spill out, nearly bowling you over. You pick the closest one and just lean on it, letting the fatigue ebb from your limbs. That's when the bag began to jostle a bit, and the prodigious face of Beth loomed over the beg. She had placed it onto her lap, sitting now, and was peering at its contents. Naturally, the alarming realization that she had come for the candy was overshadowed as an unescapable hand descended toward you.</span></div></div>",

You lean against the inside of the table leg, observing the world outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic pair of feet were walking past the table now, making noises louder than you could have imagined as they passed.

She must still be close, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harmless peek from behind the table leg showed you she was still there, but you wish you kenw who it was. Hunching over so that the top of the table wouldn't obstruct your view, you can't help but gasp. The giantess was Bekah, and your own blood was your closest lifeline, right?

Although you were about the size of a pin and were about to venture into uncharted territory, there was little else left to choose from. If you didn't grab the attention of the closest passing giantess, who was to say you would ever survive in this harsh new world? You are still retreating into your thoughts, you realize, and face straight ahead. Bekah is en route to the other side of a wide expanse of carpeted floor, which you would be obligated to cross if you planned to flag down your cousin before unwanted attention arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicked ideas of what unmentionable things could happen if someone you didn't trust spotted you fuels your motions, and thus you leave the table behind. Strolling across this forest of carpet strands wouldn't be easy, but at least the quaking tremors of the partying giantesses was far enough away that you felt relatively comfortable. Conveniently, some of the blasting music changed a more suspenseful sound, fitting the mood quite nicely. Bekah adjusts herself in her seat on the couch ahead, and you put your eyes on the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to what you would have expected, at this size every aspect of your fetish was increased. You even start to have arousing thoughts about your dear cousin, even as you try to keep them out of your mind.

The feet are moving of course; her toes wiggle absentmindedly as she pulls out her cell after getting a text. This would be the opportunity of the night, then. Wasting less time would be a good idea too, you decide as you stand just an inch from the domineering big toe of your female cousin. Grasping it tightly, you hoist yourself on top of the gloss-painted toenail, hugging the side of it for support until you have successfully made it on entirely.

After all, blood was  thicker than water, and if anyone would help you out in this massive house it would be your own cousin. Besides, you and her were pretty close, and had gotten each other out of a fair amount of scrapes in the past. Of your options for giantess assistants here, Bekah was undoubtedly the most logical choice. Still, it wasn't very comforting physically as you now found yourself clambering over a bare foot about the size of a small freighter from your perspective. This had better work, you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about if she found you, so helpless and vulnerable like this, and was tempted? It was a sobering thought; especially since there was very little you could do to stop your giantess cousin if she decided not to keep her end of the bargain. Then again, there wasn't much you had to offer to convince her but your desperate plea of family. Still, Bekah was far from a heartless girl, so there shouldn't be any doubts. As if on cue, however, you suddenly find your legs falling out from beneath you, and your reach out for a support, grabbing only fistfuls of empty air. In the wake of this you suddenly realize (albeit too late now) what had caused the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had seemed like idle wiggling before had spread to the entire foot. One such movement had sent you falling down through the space between her toes. Before you could sink too deeply into the gap, though, you raise your arms spread-eagle to make a bridge of yourself in the gap. You felt like you were hanging from a pole over a chasm, with your arms taking the place of the pole and the chasm was the floor below you. Fear one again grips your nerves, but you know that your fall could have been much worse if you hadn't had as much time to act. One of the wiggles had in fact given you more time and momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was not to last as the toe-wiggles continued. You lost your grip on both as the big toe rose higher above, and only one of your arms was able to grasp it in time. The other grasped the same nothingess you had beforehand. But it was going up faster than your arm could, and you force yourself to let go before it could snap your arm right off. In a disheartening heap you hit the floor between Bekah's big toe and its companion beside it. All of your body seemed to be one unified ache, which is surprising after such a relatively short fall.

Still under the looming shadow of both Bekah's retreating form and the couch, you look at the room around you, nervous. To your right was the table you had awoken under, and now you still were behind this couch. Bekah was at the other end of the couch now, still making her way somewhere. Across from where you stood was another couch, facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collective voices of all the people at the party is deafening for you. You can see a group of girls, some your age, a few older. They were far away though, for you anyway. In reality they were across the length of the room, but equidistantly to your size it might as well have been about half-a-mile. Well, maybe not, but your fears had a decent foundation. Life would be tough from now on, and from what you knew insects didn't last long in a world full of giants. Or in this case giantesses, since to your knowledge every male had already left after the party got boring for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, for all social purposes the party was in full swing. You suppose that was why there were so many females still here, and Sara hadn't ended it. When the shrinking began it had been about midnight, maybe even exactly, but you have no idea what time it is now. For all you know you could have been out for hours, though it's kind of irrelevant. Three options were still within reason, and you were already feeling like everything you'd eaten today was gone. Stomach now rumbling in protest, you know that getting a source of food is on your list for tonight. </span></div></div>",

You deduct that the logical place to begin that search is the hallway to your right, so with one last look at Bekah, who was reaching toward a table for soemthing. Every instinct told you to bolt ahead now, because this was all about timing when there are people wandering around oblivious to you. Ending up downtrodden so soon after shrinking would be absolutely pathetic, and besides you planned on living on past tonight, even if you were a half inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering yourself and your thoughts you make your dash, planning to head on past the group of girls that were standing in fornt of the hallway. You hoped at least Bekah would stay so you could seek her help later, but getting noticed by strangers isn't too appealing to you. Nevertheless they are obstacles, so you'll have to pass them accordingly. The feminine giggles among the stories that were being told by the goddesses above you is a bit unnerving, but at least they wouldn't see you if you kept going. Now was the hardest part, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing through three pairs of feet was necessary but a little scary. You climb over the first one quickly, sidling across and dropping off in a matter of seconds.

Speaking of which, where was the seemingly-colossal hostess anyway? Come to think of it, you hadn't seen her since about eleven.

With a dive purely by reflex, you manage to dodge a sandal-clad foot that would have crushed you; a girl entering the kitchen just a little too close to the wall.

The next pair of shoes that passes is your target, and you rush ahead quickly and dive, arms stretched out in front to get a handhold once you land. A thud and a sharp pain in your groin accompany this lurch, but by nothing short of a miracle you get a fistful of shoe lace just before you would have gone sliding over the edge and into the din of walking people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding had been the hardest part, so all you do now is lay against the tongue of the sneaker you had taken refuge on and wait for your chance.

Even you had headed over here first thing to fill your rapidly-emptying stomach. When was the last you'd eaten? Right before the party, so about five. Not so long, but you must have lost a lot of food during the shrinking process or something. That coupled with the fact that it's about 12:30 AM now.

In your current philosophy, the only way to survive being so small was to take big risks, risks that would help you form the premise on how you would live long enough to get normal again, however or if ever that happened. Starting while there's still time, you start from the ground up and climb the tongue of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you've reached the cuff of the jeans and found an effective way to move quickly up the vertical cliff.

She takes her step forward, since the line has progressed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmitting a cry of surprise, you somehow gather the strength to stay on the ledge and boost yourself up.

Ignoring the pain in your limbs and fingers you reach the summit, just above the stomach, since the counter is relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust glad to have finally reached your goal, you leap from your perch at a haphazard angle and land safely on the very edge of the white, smooth surface of Sara's kitchen counter.

The giantess is still oblivious to your cries, which you hadn't realized you qwere still making, so you quit the excercise in futility to focus on staying aloft. With each footfall you become more height-conscious, but at least your grip on her leg is reliable enough to sustain your worry. Funny how you had been concerned with a fear of heights at such a small size, you think to yourself. She continues on, never breaking her stride as you begin in climb...</span></div></div>",

It was fortunate that the girl wasn't wearing flip-flops or anything, because you could at least stand on a close-toed shoe like the one she currently wore. You didn't know the name for it, but it seemed to be in vogue lately. Shimmying to a more conducive part to climb, you begin to make your long, vertical journey toward salvation. Just then a new thought strikes you like a grandfather clock. Why do all of that dangerous scaling up the side of the foot, when you could make her notice you from down here, if you played your cards right? It brought with it a slew of misunderstandings she could have, but you were desperate enough to consider this to get your crush to notice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little ironic, though, since that was typically the sense of desperation you felt in social terms. This could be a breakthrough. Maybe you'll live happily ever after, normal-sized with her as your girlfriend. But to get there she would have to see you first. Taking a quick but deep breath, you pinch the piece of skin closest to you, giving it all the power you could muster. Her leg (the one you're on) moves a bit in shock, then swings over as your crush ceases walking. Her shadow envelps you as she gets down on one knee to inspect her ankle. It worked, you think, smiling to yourself as you see the perplexed face of Alexa, your crush, looking down in your direction.<br>\r\n\"Ah, what now? I wore better shoes just so this wouldn't happen,\" Alexa laments, not seeing you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your cue, you suddenly realize. Rushing around the corner of the girl's foot to a more visible location, you do whatever you can think to do, which translates to leaping up and down on the soft flesh. Her gaze immediately trains on you, and you can feel your heart leap in your chest. Her face was somehow more beautiful like this, magnified a thousand times over by how tiny you now were. Alexa's mouth formed an almost perfect circle, before she spoke:<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, this can't be real, this can't be -- Is that you, _____?!\" she whispers raptly.</span></div></div>",

There wasn't much reason behind running though, Kelcie was bound and determined to get just a taste of that moist, delicious cake everyone had been raving about.  She'd been trying to watch her weight, keep that girlish figure of hers, and a whole piece of cake had far too many calories for her to consider.  However, this bite-sized, lonely piece of cake that had fallen from the whole was just enough to wet her tastebuds.  Reaching down in a swooping motion, Kelcie set her hand behind the piece of cake, and you, and pushed it into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, unsure if you would rather take your chances diving towards the ground, or with Kelcie's appetite, were not given much of a choice in the matter though.  It seemed you were going to get a little of both worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind you, Kelcie's hand dwarfed the cake crumb, easily.  The crumb itself was about as big as the pad of her thumb, and you were about the size of speck, or a grain of sand. Honestly, you weren't sure, but it mattered very little, when you saw that crumb sliding toward you, powered and dwarfed by the fleshy wall of the teenager's hand.  Try as you might, you ran for the edge of the table, but only succeeded in making it half the distance, before that cake crumb tumbled over you, the moist surface tousling you around, and burying you within it's sugary goodness, like an avalanche would a skier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother split second of rolling, before you found yourself airborn, almost.  Kelcie knocked the crumb, and it's victim, off of the counter, towards her empty hand hovering below the table's edge.  Landing in the goddess' hand, the cake crumb fell apart, partially, and you tumbled into the vast field of teenage hand-flesh, covering in even smaller crake crumbs, and more dizzy than injured.  The warmth of Kelcie's hand immediately became very uningnorable, as did the shadows of her towering fingers, as they began to curl menacingly above you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you attempt to break through the rest of your cake-enclosure, you find yourself tumbling over again, as Kelcie lifts her hand up to her face.  You're given an undeniably intense ride up to the raven-haired giantess' face, and stop just below her chin.  Above, you can see her face.  She seems to be unsure of her decision.  You don't know why, but it seems as though she is very hesistant to make a snack of this little crumb.  Youre not sure why.</span></div></div>",

Yeah, I know sounds kinky. My eyes felt like they were bulging from their sockets. My lungs felt like they were about to give up completely as they screamed for one last breath.

Although it sounded deepened by size, there was no mistaking that the tone belonged to Sara, the party's hostess and the one who had invited you here. Some party this had become, though, you think grimly. You are still hanging precariously, but you had since gotten to a more controllable position by the back of the package. It was all too surreal, though, seeing this macroscopic world zip by you as Sara briskly walks back through the door and into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you realize that the box's strap is swinging like a pendulum, a movement that had nearly made you fall to your death earlier. A proverbial lightbulb flashes over your head, as you see the direction you'll in mere seconds be swinging in. Pursing your lips in determination, you decide to make a leap at the apex of the swing, allowing you to sail through the otherwise small distance (several \"feet\" for you) toward Sara's body. As calculated as the jump had been, you didn't land at all where you had expected... and it was a little embarassing. You now hung from the outside of Sara's shirt, just in front of her bra. You silently ask whatever entities that were in charge of your shrinking just to keep Sara from noticing you at this point, where you are right now. She'd never forgive you for the invasion of privacy.</span></div></div>",

You try to look up, to see who this behemoth is, but your view is blocked as the vast jean pillars move again, and the figure goes down to the next step. Now you can see who it is -- Sara. She turns on the step, and her voice rumbles, \"WHERE DID IT GO?\" As your head clears and your ears stop ringing, you see her face looming over you, eyes scanning the stairs. You take a step back. Suddenly, her eyes flashed over to where you were, trying to sense any more movement. You froze, sweating, as she hovered for a moment longer.

You instinctively clamp your hands over your ears to halt the sound's progress, and then also crouch below the step just in case. You're haven't really articulated the pros and cons of being spotted to yourself just yet. Besides, who knows who this even is, coming out of the house? The screen door opens as well, then clangs loudly as it is closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suspense by now is killing you, and the similarities from what media you've accumulated told you not to look. That was always how the stupid people were killed off; they tried to get a good look at the danger without having a safe place to run to.

Without further hesitation you start to scale the step, just as you notice a titanic, snadal-clad foot sailing over you and settle several inches to the left of where you had been waiting before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are still clinging the the craggy step, the foot's pair goes over you as well, and this time it actually lands where you had been sitting. So acting quickly had paid off after all! You could have just as easily met an untimely end if you hadn't chosen to scout ahead when you did. But you weren't out of the fire yet. The anonymous giantess was sitting two steps above yours, allowing her legs to rest on your own porch step. That meant that whoever this was had decided to sit down here for an indefinite amount of time. This made things more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, her thigh was just a few inches out from where you hung, and the foot lower still, about the size of a freight train. You could either continue climbing into what appeared to be the girl's pant leg, or drop off entirely and just navigate past the feet. And the third option would be that you just wait here and see what she does. For all you know she might rise up and leave sooner than you expected. A dreary sigh is released from the giantesses lips, and you realize who it was. If the voice was hers, it was definitely Kelcie!</span></div></div>",

You hold on with all your might as Sara taps her toe again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally are able to pull yourself up, and immediately find yourself clinging to the laces. This was good move, as Sara takes a step to her right in her menial task of refilling the snack table. You take a moment to breathe, taking comfort in the fact that you weren't crushed like a bug by your friend. But you didn't take much comfort of the motion sickness caused by Sara's shift to the right. It's time to make your next move.</span></div></div>",

Come back to the party!\" A feminine voice shouts from the other room. \"Be there in a second,\" Sara shouts back, her voice booming above you. You start to panic as Sara puts down the chips and starts walking. Her step causes you to stumble , but you catch on to the loose laces. You grab the aglet of her sneaker as soars through the air. You hang on tight as the G-forces attempt to pull you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! Her foot lands, causing the laces to bounce a little. You fly back up to the tongue of the sneaker, and quickly decide to hide in there. You grab hold of the canvas stitching and lay down on Sara's surprising soft socks as she continues walking back to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours of torture, Sara arrives at her destination, you look up out of her sneaker to see a sea of female legs dancing to the party music. Maybe catching a ride wasn't the best choice, because now you're in a minefield of life-crushing feet. You stand in awe looking at the towering giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want, Bekah?\" Sara says over the loud music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness. She might be able to help,\" you say to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dance with me, Sara!\" Bekah shouts, obviously wasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or not,\" you quickly say as Bekah yanks Sara by the arms, taking her into a spin. You attempt to hang on to Sara's shoe, but it might be best just to let go.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome, here's the basic setting of the story, although the beginning depends on your first choice at the intro:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're awake at a party that's sort of going late into the night, so most people are just going to stay over. You're there with some of your friends, just acquaintances from school, bullies, enemies, etcetera. The time is quickly reaching 12 AM, but it's hardly winding down. Suddenly, as the clock strikes midnight, you shrink to roughly a half an inch. Where that happens will be up to you, but chances are you're going to find yourself in a dangerous position in this much larger world around you. Try to survive, maybe indulge in some fantasies; we'll see how it goes. Get ready to enter the night of your tiny life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Character (YOU):</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is your name, so don't make one up. Just either don't mention it in dialog or leave a blank, I don't mind either way. I am going to say though, that you're roughly fifteen or sixteen. You're a fairly well-liked guy, but you have your enemies, and some of these are at the party with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Starting Characters:</b> (These bios may be expanded as the story progresses)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBekah: Your older cousin, eighteen years old. Black hair, brown eyes. Average height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelcie: Fifteen, in a few of your classes. Black hair, tan skin, tall for a girl. Barely knows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth: A freshman at your school, about fourteen. Has always been nice to you. Pink hair, blue eyes. Shortish for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara: The resident of the house, also party hostess. 17. A friend of yours for a while. Brunette with green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina: Goth girl you've recently met, about nineteen. Black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Important Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Giantesses only. I'm adamant about this. No other males, this is from a straight, shrunken man's point of view.<br>\r\n-No scat or piss stuff, please. It's a plague to these sort of interactives.<br>\r\n-Please use correct grammar to the best of your ability. <br>\r\n-Sizeable chapters, and by the I mean at least a paragraph. Exceptions being choice chapters. <br>\r\n-Not too crazy about the sexual aspect of all of this, as it is for the most part unaware<br>\r\n-Also, I reserve the right to delete any post included in the story that does not meet the standards I've just explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven you've abided to these relatively simple rules, have fun with it! I know it seems like a lot, but it'll make this story great if people participate and make this interactive interesting. And again, welcome to the story and thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGP Will be given based on quality of chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
