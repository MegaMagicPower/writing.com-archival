This is because when you were given these powers you were forbidden from the outside, but you rebeld, you escaped. You are now an outlaw from the government, they have posted a reward for your capture, but thankfully you can change your appearance as a result of your ability. you may be powerful but you have your limits, so you flee every time you are revealed. You have been moving a lot lately but where are you now?</span></div></div>",

It will be almost impossible for them to find you, how could they, you haven't used your powers for three years, since last they found you. It has become difficult for you to remember your actual appearance, you haven't seen your real face since you escaped, and sadly you probably never will again. Luckily you were able to find a job and a place to stay, but at minimum wage it's hard to keep it; not many people ask questions about why a 16 year old kid has an appartment, but you figure it's because it's new york, and there have been weirder things. You have made yourself to look like a 16 year old tom cruise, and it seems to be getting a lot of attention from girls. Anyways, you were walking home one night when a man tried to sneak up behind you to kill you and steel from you- and this is where you made your mistake- in the heat of the moment you used your powers to end it, knocking the man back 30 feet into a wall. When you turned a women was standing around the corner peaking at you, when you looked at her she turned and ran, \"wait stop, please I won't hurt you!\" you yell, what does she do?</span></div></div>",

With no immediate tasks pressing you, you decide to take a little walk to warm yourself up, and to help you figure out exactly where you are.
