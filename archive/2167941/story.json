Whether the be pictures, family heirlooms, or fads of times forgotten (looking at you, Furbee), there was always something of interest to be found.  The Handbasquette household was no different.  After 28 years of marriage, Bruce and Helena had acquired a number of goods that time had forgotten.  There was your regular assortment of cheerleading outfits from the girls' younger days, old musical instruments from passions lost, and old-timey steamer trunks full of items inherited from other family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this, Jeremy decided to take a peek upstairs to see if he could find anything of interest.  It was going to be a long summer, and he figured he might as well try to dig up something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so damn hot up here,\" Jeremy said under his breath as he wiped the sweat from his brow.  Three weeks into summer vacation, he had beat all of the video games he owned and was now looking for some new adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" he said as he tossed aside an old cowbell.  Same with a pair of roller skates, and even a strange looking medallion with two varying shapes on each side.  \"Who would ever want that,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it caught his eye.  The book was bound in leather, with gold calligraphy on the binding.  It seemed to almost call for him.  Much like a moth attracted to the glimmer of a lightbulb in summer, Jeremy couldn't help but approach the strange, timeless text.  Dusting off the adjacent trunk, he grabbed the book and placed it on his lap to peruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you,\" he murmured, wanting to investigate more.  As he opened the pages, he found several different headings.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy's eyes flickered open as he shook his head in an effort to wash away the disoriented cloudiness from his mind.  Looking around, he was still in the attic, and must have fallen over, as he was looking straight up at the bare-boarded ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in...,\" Jeremy said, not immediately recognizing the sound of his own voice, \"...that book?\".  His voice was... different, but still very familiar.  He definitely had heard it before, but why on earth was it coming out of his own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he said, again testing the soft alto voice in his throat.  \"This is too weird,\" he said, starting to panic slightly at the strangeness of his situation.  If he didn't know better, he could swear he sounded just like his 50-year old mother.  At this point, his heart started pounding more noticeably than his head as he was trying to make sense of his current situation.  Knowing that at some point he would have to get up, Jeremy decided to face the facts and try to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking the teeth in his mouth, Jeremy could tell something had changed.  The texture of his tongue just felt different.  He cleared his throat a few more times, none of which made any bit of difference.  With the bravery of a small child checking under their own bed for a monster, Jeremy lifted his hand, only to be more shocked.  His youthful skin had been replaced with a tanned, petite hand.  The left ring finger donned a simple wedding band with a singular, sizeable diamond.  Trying his best not to panic, Jeremy continued his inspection.  His knuckles were small, but proportionally jutted out from his thin fingers.  The bangle on his left wrist fit snugly on his fleshy forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this,\" he said in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Jeremy was even more shocked.  If he didn't know better, he could swear he had breasts!  Large ones, at that.  Since he was still on his back, they looked enormous as the smooshed together and blocked his view of the rest of his body.  \"Okay... this is really weird,\" he said as he quickly sat up.  The motion could be felt all over his body as his new assets shimmied and jiggle nearly out of control.  A wisp of blondish-brown hair fell across Jeremy's eyes, and he instinctively blew it out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up now, Jeremy could feel the full weight of his new form.  He spied a mirror in the corner of the attic, and decided to figure out what, or more accurately who, he was.  Each step sent crazy signals to his brain as he could feel his breasts jiggle, thighs rub together, and ass shake with each and every step.  As he peered around the corner of the the mirror, he almost passed out at the sight and reflection of his own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring right back at him was the spitting image of his own mother.  Her blue eyes and cropped hair looked disheveled as her mouth stood agape with an expression of surprise and confusion.  \"Oh no... no... no,\" Jeremy pleaded as he kneaded the pudgy cheeks on his new face.  The sum of his situation started to set in on him as his pendulous breasts lifted up and down with each shallow breath, under the dark grey blouse his mother was wearing.  He could feel her bra digging into his shoulders, and noticed how her slight tummy was pressing against the waist band in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, if I'm her, does that mean,\" he said, planning out his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/91d99c306450406\">The New Helena Handbasquette</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/91d99c306450406\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></div></div>",

A pang of panic rose in his stomach as he realized something very strange was going on.  He could hear the wind rustling in the trees, as well as the sounds of folks playing beach volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I,\" he whispered, realizing that something was very wrong with his voice.  He tried to take in the new environment, quickly recognizing it as the local beach.  \"Why am I here,\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing up, Jeremy felt very, very off.  His body felt like it was jiggling and shimmying in ways he couldn't control.  That's when he caught a glimpse of his own hand, petite, yet weathered.  The nails were painted a metallic yellowish-purple.  He noticed that his left wrist donned a dainty charm bracelet.  As his heart started to race, Jeremy started looking over himself, which is when he got the biggest shock of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he was greeted by two pendulous breasts with cavernous cleavage.  They were barely contained by the red t-shirt he was wearing.  Below that, he had a small paunch of a tummy that was hanging slightly over the belt of the skirt he was wearing.  His hands began rubbing up and down his body, trying to figure out if this was reality or not.  His behind jutted out, and was much wider than what he was used to.  His legs, exposed to the elements, were smooth, curvy, and just a little pudgy.  Finally, Jeremy noticed the sandals he was wearing.  The leather straps crossed over his feet and between his large toes.  They were flat and easy to walk in, but the vertigo of the new body nearly caused him to fall over, so he took a seat, trying to figure out his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topheavy.com/thnewnew/plump/archives_2013/08092013/thp08092013_39.jpg\"> Tanya Kravitz </a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://topheavy.com/thnewnew/plump/archives_2013/08092013/thp08092013_39.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></div></div>",

He reached up with both hands and used his fingers to feel the softer lobes of his new ears. Sure enough, he was now wearing his mom's earrings, and he could tell he had different, feminine ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap.\" Jeremy muttered, continuing to feel his lobes and what were now 'his' earrings'. Looking down as his mom continued with the laundry, he could see she now had his ears, and was none the wiser.

That is until her ample breasts started deflating under her top. But she just kept fumbling with the laundry, even as her bra cups emptied of the flesh she'd had since puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy moaned and stumbled backwards a little as he felt his chest get tight all of a sudden. He looked down as his t-shirt started pushing outward with his mom's tits... the fabric being stretched little by little as her boobs blossomed on his chest, his nipples enlarging becoming erect, poking through his t-shirt. \"Holy fuck!\" He exclaimed, his hands shooting up to grasp the still growing breasts. They were far from perky, but they were quite big and to him at least they were heavy. As they finally stopped growing, his dick strained again his pants as he fondled his new flesh. \"Oh god, mom's boobs feel awesome!\" He admitted, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted them a couple of times and let them drop, the flesh jiggling as he did so.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">During summer vacation, Jeremy Handbasquette is fiddling around the attic at this parent's house.  There's the usual old clothing, used furniture, as well as some steamer trunks full of this and that.  While perusing these lost relics, he comes across a leather-bound book that practically calls his name.  When he opens it, he's confounded by the origins of this text.  Why would it be in this attic?  Where did his parents get such a book?  What was the purpose of this text?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jeremy</b> - A 16-year old boy on summer vacation.  Jeremy loves his video games, hanging with his friends, and lives a pretty good life.  He's 5'10\" and weighs about 150lbs.  He's always had a penchant for fantasy novels, but is largely grounded in reality, always the skeptic of claims of magic and the such.<br>\r\n<b>Jennifer</b> - Jeremy's 19-year old sister.  She's home from her first year of college, being paid for by her water polo scholarship.  Jennifer is athletic, enthusiastic, and loves to party.  At 5'7\" and 140lbs, Jennifer is mostly muscle and takes remarkable shape of herself.<br>\r\n<b>Tiffany</b> - Jeremy's 24-year old sister.  Having taken a job at the local school district, Tiffany sees her little brother regularly during the school year.  Since she lives so close, she frequents the family's home.  Tiffany is more of a homebody, and stands a mere 5'4\", but lack of regular exercise has left her a stout 160lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Helena</b> - The matriarch of the of the Handbasquette family.  She's happy her family has grown and is learning independence, as she likes to spend time with other mothers in the neighborhood.  At 5'6\" and 160lbs, her mature stature states plainly that she has been a mother for quite some time.<br>\r\n<b>Bruce</b> - The man of the house has been working as an engineer for quite some time.  He's a loving father and budding scientist in his spare time.  He tinkers around the garage, but loves nothing more than a good family outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>More characters to be added</b></td>",
