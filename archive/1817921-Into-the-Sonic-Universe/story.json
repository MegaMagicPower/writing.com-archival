You have been trained in the ancient ways of self defense and preservation ever since you were a young boy. You are considered a protigy by your peers and your master takes great pride in your teachings. However, you are known for one thing in particular, your kicking. Your kicks have developed into something so deadly you have been forced to register them as lethal weapons. The nickname by which everyone knows you is, The Kicking Demon. Even with all these accolades however, you find it more important to be humble, honorable and live by a strong moral code. Your life has become pretty mundane and predictable lately, but that is about to change. Your master has been out of town all week on business, so you have been teaching class in his place. As the day comes to an end you say your goodbyes to all your fellow students as they leave and you lock up for the evening. You begin walking home, you own a car but you find it better for the enviornment and your physical fitness that you walk. As you are walking you look up at the stars, pondering all of life's great mysteries as you normally do to pass the time when suddenly you hear a loud thundering sound right in front of you. You drop your tote bag full of your martial arts equipment taking a defensive stance, ready to face whatever it is that's in front of you. As you take a closer look however it seems like some sort of greenish swirling portal. As you look closer and closer it begins to pull you in, you however maintain a strong stance remembering your training, but the suction is too strong and eventually you are overwhelmed and are swallowed by the portal along with your tote bag removing any evidence that you had been there and just as you are swallowed up the portal dissappears. The question at this point is, do you merely get hurled into the Sonic Universe, or does something else happen to you along the way?</span></div></div>",

You look at your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhands and notice that you are now wearing gloves, but that's not it. Your hands are a lot bigger than <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey were before. You look down and see that the same thing has happened to your feet, they're huge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to freak out a little and notice that there's a pond close by. You crawl frantically to it to look at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour reflection and what you see shocks you to your core. You're a four foot tall, blonde furred, blue <br>\r\n<br>\r\neyed hedgehog! You stagger away from the pond and fall flat on your but stammering. \u201cH-how can this <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe possible\u201d! You exclaim. \u201cI'M A GODDAMN FURBALL\u201d! You shout as you flop onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start breathing in and out deeply to calm your nerves. \u201cOkay, I'm a hedgehog. Nothing I can do <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabout it at the moment\u201d You say standing back up. \u201cFirst thing I need to do is try to find some form of <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncivilization....and hopefully find some way to reverse this\u201d. You begin walking only to trip and fall over  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour pant legs that are now way too long for you. You look at your clothes and realize that they are far <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntoo big and baggy for you. \u201cWell this isn't going to work\u201d you say. You rip the sleeves of your top and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrip the pant legs from your pants to match your new height. As you toss away your shreds of discarded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nclothing you see your tote bag with all your gear in it. 'Oh sweet' you think to yourself as you reach into <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour tote and grab your ninja-to (ninja sword) and tie it to your waist. You then grab the tote and throw <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit over your shoulder. \u201cNow to find some help\u201d you say as you begin your trek. You walk and walk for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat seems like hours. 'God, it feels like I'm a hamster on wheel here' you think. 'I know if I go at a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfaster pace I'll make better progress, but if I run and exhaust all my energy without finding any help I'll <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe in serious trouble....What should I do'?

You then pick up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe pace and begin to run for a while. 'Huh' you think 'That's strange, all this running and I'm not even <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe least bit tired.....I wonder'. As you think this you start running as fast as you can. When you do, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat you see surprises you, you're fast as hell! \u201cHOLY CRAP\u201d! You say out loud as you come to a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstop.

You say as you zoom across the grassy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nplains. At this new pace it takes no time at all for you to see what looks like a city ahead. You stop to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook at it from a distance to see if you should seek help there.  As you look closer you see a sign that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsays \u201cKnothole Kingdom\u201d you look down upon this kingdom to see a wide array of houses and markets <br>\r\n<br>\r\nalong the streets as well as it's many inhabitants, all encompassed by a large protective wall. However, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat really catches your attention is the gigantic castle in the middle of it all. \u201cIt certainly looks <br>\r\n<br>\r\npromising enough\u201d you say as you approach it. As you reach the entrance to the kingdom you are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconfronted by two guards who look like rhinos. \u201cHalt\u201d. Says the one on the right. \u201cState your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbusiness\u201d. \u201cI was hoping I could get some help\u201d you reply. \u201cYou see, I woke up in some field after I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas sucked through a weird po-\u201d \u201cThat's enough\u201d! exclaims the one on the left as he interrupts you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have you escorted to the Princess, she will decide your fate\u201d. \u201cBut first we will need to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconfiscate your sword and bag\u201d The one on the right says as he goes to grab your sword. You step back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nplacing a hand on the blade \u201cNo one...touches...the sword\u201d you say with a serious look on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards grab their axes, ready to take it by force if necessary. \u201cHold it\u201d. Says another voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom above you. You look up to see another guard but in a different colored armor on top of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet him keep it\u201d he says \u201cIf he tries anything we'll take him down\u201d. \u201cYes sir\u201d say the guards in front <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof you in unison. \u201cPrivate Briggs, Private Staple\u201d! Yells the one on the left. Two more guards run up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand salute him. \u201cYes sir\u201d! They both say. \u201cEscort him to the Princess so that she may pass judgment\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSays the guard while looking at you. \u201cYes sir\u201d they say again. \u201cFollow us\u201d says one of them. You nod <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand begin to do so, while still staying on your guard. You look back up to the guard on top of the wall, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nremembering what he had said before 'If he tries anything we'll take him down' you think. 'As if you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncould' while keeping one hand on your blade just in case. You continue to make your way to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe castle all the while being watched and observed by the citizens. \u201cWhat's their problem\u201d? You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\none of the guards in front of you. \u201cThe people here are always suspicious of newcomers, don't take it <br>\r\n<br>\r\npersonally\u201d. She replies. \u201cI guess I can't blame them, considering the way I look\u201d you say looking at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour torn martial arts uniform. \u201cYou look fine to me\u201d replies the female guard as she winks at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks\u201d you say while the other guard just rolls his eyes at his comrades behavior.

I'm sure she'll be willing to hear you out\u201d.

He says standing in front of an enormous <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwooden door. CLANG CLANG CLANG he knocks with the door handle. \u201cYou may enter\u201d says a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrather sultry voice. The door suddenly creeks open and you are escorted in by the two guards. As you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalk in you notice how lavish and exquisite everything within the room is. From the velvet red carpet, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto the marble floor and columns, all the way up to the ceiling adorned with paintings that could rival <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaVinci, and in the center was a large golden chandelier with diamond crystals hanging from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d is all you can say. You then look towards the end of the room to see the person who was to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndecide your fate. There she was, sitting on her magnificent throne. Upon closer inspection you could <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsee that she was a squirrel wearing a blue vest and blue boots. 'Hmm, not the usual look of royalty I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas expecting' you think to yourself'. \u201cWell, this is quite a surprise\u201d says the Princess. \u201cWhen I was <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntold to be expecting a hedgehog, you weren't exactly who I was expecting\u201d. \u201cYour highness\u201d says the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmale guard. \u201cThis hedgehog was trying to enter the kingdom for unknown reasons, so we brought him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere to see what you wanted us to do with him\u201d he states. \u201cHmmm\u201d the Princess thinks out loud <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlooking you up and down intently. \u201cWell, if anything, I'd say your outfit is definitely unique\u201d she says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchuckling \u201cOh my where are my manners, I am Princess Sally Alicia Acorn\u201d she says as she walks <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncloser to you. \u201cAnd you are...\u201d she inquires \u201cOh\u201d, you stammer for a moment \u201cMy name is Ryan, Ryan <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordaine\u201d you say bowing to her out of respect for her position as Princess. \u201cIt's a pleasure to meet you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour highness\u201d you say as you take her hand and kiss it. \u201cMy, you certainly are quite the gentleman <br>\r\n<br>\r\naren't you\u201d she says blushing. From up close you can make out all the details of her figure and begin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthinking to yourself. 'Wow, you know, now that I get a closer look at her, her eyes, her hair, she's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nactually really pretty' as your face turns slightly red. \u201cSo, tell me Mr. Cordaine, why have you come to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmy kingdom\u201d? She asks breaking your train of thought. \u201cAhem\u201d you say clearing your throat. \u201cI um, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nactually came here seeking help\u201d you say. \u201cOh\u201d?

You go on to tell <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher all about your predicament, about the portal, the world you came from, and how you used to be <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhuman. \u201cWow, you've certainly been through a lot\u201d she says. \u201cTell me about it\u201d you reply dropping <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour head in despair. \u201cMy friends, my students, and my Master, I may never see them again\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoking up, tears forming in your eyes. \u201cHey\u201d says Sally sympathetically embracing you in a hug. \u201cIt'll <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe okay, I may not know how to get you back home, or revert you back to your human form, but you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare welcome to stay here with me until we figure it out\u201d. \u201cT-thank you\u201d you say returning the hug. \u201cIn <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe time that I've been in this world, no one has showed me as much kindness as you\u201d \u201cAnything I can <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo to help\u201d she says smiling back at you.

Looking at your sleeveless Gi top with Japanese writing on the back, torn pants <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand the black belt around your waist. \u201cOh' heh\u201d you say rubbing the back of your head. \u201cWhere I come <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom this is the traditional attire of a martial artist\u201d. \u201cA martial what now\u201d? She inquires scratching her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhead. \u201cYou know, someone who's trained in the art of combat\u201d you answer. \u201cOh okay, so your a really <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngood fighter then huh\u201d?

You begin to look up at the sky, thinking about the world you were taken <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom. \u201cIt's almost eery how much this world reminds me of my own\u201d you say as you continue to look <br>\r\n<br>\r\nup at the sky. \u201cReally\u201d? asks Sally. \u201cYeah\u201d you reply. \u201cThe blue skies, the luscious green grass, the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntrees and the plants, they all look so similar\u201d you say. \u201cWell that's good, just remember that you're <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwelcome to stay here as long as you like Ryan\u201d. She says smiling at you. \u201cThank you\u201d you say \u201cI hope <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou don't mind me asking though....\u201d \u201cGo ahead\u201d she says. \u201cPlease don't take this the wrong way Sally <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut, why are you being so nice, I mean, as a Princess I'm sure you get pleas for help all the time. So <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhy was my case any different\u201d? You ask looking at her inquisitively. \u201cOh, well umm...\u201d She says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsurprised you asked her something like that. At this point she has her head down looking at her boots, <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwiddling her fingers nervously. \u201cY-you see, I um...\u201d she continues to stammer \u201cI get awfully lonely <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeing in this big castle all by myself, a-and I was just hoping you might um, stay for a little while. She's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstill looking at the ground and you ask \u201cBut why me of all people\u201d? \u201cWell...\u201d She says, her face turning <br>\r\n<br>\r\nred now. \u201cPrincess, yous summoned me\u201d? Says the Commander as he enters the courtyard and bows to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally. \u201cOh, y-yes yes, I...did..\u201d She says catching her breath after being startled by the big rhino. \u201cWhat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nis it you need your majesty\u201d? He asks. \u201cI want you to have a sparring match with our guest\u201d she replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\npointing at you. \u201cWhat\u201d you say slightly confused. \u201cThat is, if it's okay with you Ryan\u201d she says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwinking at you. \u201cI don't mind, but-\u201d \u201cBut what\u201d? She interrupts, leaning in closer to you. \u201cBut, I don't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwant to hurt anyone\u201d. You say. \u201cHA\u201d! Laughs the Commander. \u201cLike you could hurt me\u201d he says as he <br>\r\n<br>\r\napproaches you and Sally. You then notice 'Wait a minute, this is the same guy from earlier, the one that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas on top of the wall' you think. \u201cLets do it\u201d you tell him as you look into his eyes with a very serious <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook on your face. \u201cGreat\u201d! Exclaims Sally, I'll just watch from over here, try not to hurt each other too <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbad okay\u201d. \u201cYes your highness\u201d says the Commander. \u201cAlright\u201d you say smiling at her as she waves to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou taking her seat. \u201cGood luck\u201d! She yells to you. You give her a thumbs up, reassuring her you would <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe okay. You untied your sword and placed it on the bench next to you, you wanted to fight this guy, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnot kill him. \u201cHere's the rules\u201d he says \u201cwe continue to fight until one of us gives up, gets knocked out, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nor cant get up for a ten count\u201d. \u201cSounds good to me\u201d you say as you bow to him. \u201cI hate to have to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmake you look bad in front of the Princess and all, but I do have my orders\u201d he says. \u201cNo hard <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfeelings\u201d you say  smiling at him \u201cDo what you have to do\u201d. \u201cAlright then, you asked for it\u201d! He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas he charges at you. 'If my strength has increased as much as my speed' you think 'then I'm going to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhave to be extremely careful that I don't kill this guy by accident'. He throws a punch but you side step <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit easily. He throws a few more and you avoid them again just as easily. \u201cNo more fooling around\u201d he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsays as he throws a barrage of punches at you. You continue to move about dodging all of his strikes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith little effort. \u201cYour punches are strong and precise, but brute strength alone isn't going to get you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanywhere if your opponent has any kind of speed\u201d you say. \u201cGrrr...\u201d is all he says as he continues his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nassault, but it's apparent that he's beginning to run out of steam as he slows down. \u201cLooks like you need <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto work on your stamina a little bit too\u201d you say. \u201cJust shut up and fight back already\u201d! The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander exclaims. \u201cIf you say so\u201d you reply. You form a fist and bring it to within an inch of his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchest and lightly tap it within the blink of an eye. \u201cGWAH\u201d! Is all you hear as he is sent flying back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand lands ten feet away with a THUD. 'HOLY CRAP'! You think as you look at your hand and back to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim. 'I did THAT'! You run over to him to see if he was okay. \u201cOh man! Are you alright\u201d? You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u201d is all he says. \u201cHe's out cold\u201d you say. \u201cRyan\u201d! Yells Sally as she runs up to you. \u201cIs he okay\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks. \u201cYeah, he's out like a light, but he'll be okay once he comes to\u201d you reply. \u201cThat was <br>\r\n<br>\r\namazing\u201d! She exclaims. \u201cYou knocked him out with one punch and you weren't even trying\u201d. \u201cDon't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nworry big guy\u201d you say as you lift him up, putting an arm over your shoulder. \u201cWhere can I take him so <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe can rest\u201d? You ask Sally. \u201cOh, come with me. The infirmary is this way. You drop off the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunconscious rhino and begin walking with Sally back to the main chamber of the castle. \u201cHow did you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo that so easily\u201d? She inquires. \u201cHe was the Commander of the entire Royal Guard. He was the best I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhad\u201d. \u201cI...have no idea\u201d you say looking at your hands. 'This new body has abilities I could never even <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDREAM of attaining back in my world' you think. \u201cI don't know about you, but I sure am hungry\u201d says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally. At that moment your stomach grumbled at the mention of food. \u201cY-yeah\u201d you say embarrassed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I'm hungry too. I haven't eaten anything since I came to this world\u201d.  Sally giggles pulling out <br>\r\n<br>\r\na small cell phone looking device from her vest pocket. \u201cNicole\u201d she says. \u201cYes Sally\u201d? Replies a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfemale voice. \u201cHave the chefs begin preparations for dinner please\u201d. \u201cRight away Sally\u201d. \u201cThanks <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, Oh, and before I forget, have a couple of the servants prepare a room for our guest Ryan\u201d. \u201cOf <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncourse\u201d says Nicole as the screen goes black. \u201cWhat's that\u201d? You ask. \u201cThat's the first piece of <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntechnology I've seen since I've been here\u201d. \u201cThis\u201d? She replies holding up the device. \u201cThis is Nicole, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe's a computer program I made myself\u201d.You both make it to the main chamber of the castle and Sally <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoes on to tell you about her advancements in technology and all about Nicole. \u201cWow\u201d you say \u201cYou <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmust be really smart\u201d. \u201cHeh heh, thanks\u201d she says as she twirls her hair with her finger. \u201cYour majesty\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncalls the chef, \u201cdinner is ready\u201d. \u201cGreat\u201d she says clasping her hands together. \u201cLets go\u201d she says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmotioning for you to come with her. As you make it to the dining room you are shocked at the wide <br>\r\n<br>\r\narray of pallets displayed across the table. You both take a seat and she says \u201cGo ahead, eat as much as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou like\u201d smiling at you hospitably. \u201cDon't mind if I do\u201d you say, mouth watering. You begin shoveling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfood in your mouth like it's nobodies business. This makes Sally giggle, seeing your lack of table <br>\r\n<br>\r\netiquette. \u201cFwhats fscho ffunny\u201d you say, mouth full of food. \u201cOh nothing\u201d she says as she begins <br>\r\n<br>\r\neating.</span></div></div>",

After finishing wiping it you set you hand back on the sand a few seconds later your eyes widened from relisation. Looking down at your hand you see it's larger and have white gloves on them. You examine the rest of your body and even check your reflection in the crystal clear water of the bleach. You were now a four foot black hedgehog with red stripes running along your arms legs and quills You also had a black trenchcoat with various metal straps. You took many minutes to calm yourself. \"Oh what else can go wrong.\" you ask putting your hand back on the sand. But you palm landed on something solid. Looking down you saw a red chaos emerald in your hand and your eyes widened before it started glowing in a bright white light.
