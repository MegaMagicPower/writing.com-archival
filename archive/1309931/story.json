You were humming your favorite song until you felt that someone was watching you. You felt uncomfortable so you finished up and decided to head back to town. As you walked you continued to feel someone following you. <br>\r\n   You began to run but you can still feel someone following you. You ran faster and faster passing through tree branches and bushes. You are pretty much running for you life. You kept running until a figure caught you by your arm. You tried to fight their grip but they held on tightly. \"(your name) stop it, you're going to hurt yourself\" the figure said with a chuckle. You open your eyes to see it was \"Dang sis are you always like this when you're picking flowers.\" Kilik said while laughing. \"You'll be like this too if you were being followed by a big jerk\" you snapped while punching Kilik in the arm. He took it and said \" I'm here to walk you home squirt.\" And with that he patted you on the head. You swat at his hand \" I'm not a little girl anymore.\" you say. \" Yeah but your still my little sister.\" he said lovingly. You look down at your feet like a little kid. After that you both decided to walk back to town.<br>\r\n \"Before we go home we need to get something to make dinner.\" you reminded your brother. He agreed and tried to figure out what to buy.He kept arguing with you but ended ended up buying what you wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we're having (your favorite food) tonight.\" he sighed. You smile in triumph but felt a little bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, I'm going to make your favorite dessert tonight, okay?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!!\" Kilik screamed with excitement.<br>\r\n You smiled and tried to hurry him home so you can start baking. You began to run from your brother hoping he will chase you.You saw he was chasing you and ran faster.You ran around the corner and down the street to your little flower shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't know if you should be scared or intrigued. You stare at him in silence until he noticed you. \"oh no, he saw me! what should I do?!\" you thought. He simply smiled at the confusion on your face and came towards you. You try to back up but he grabbed your wrist holding you in place. \"Don't be frighten I don't bite....much.\" he said with a chuckle. Your face turned pale as you realized this young man was a vampire. You try to break free from his grip but he just apply pressure to it. \"L..Let m..me g..go p..please?\" you managed to make out in your trembling voice. \"Now why would I do that?\" he said playfully. You cried out your brother's name to save yourself and Kilik came running to see you with the vampire. \"Kilik help me!!!\" you cried out with tears in your eyes. Kilik looked at the vampire then you. \"So your Kilik.\" said the vampire. \"And you must be Duzzell.\" he replied. \"Why does my brother know this monster?\" you thought. \"Brother, How do you know this vampire?\" you asked.\"You still haven't told her yet didn't you?\" he said.\"Tell me what?!\" you said frighten. Kilik took a deep breath, \"(you name), in order to save the town one of the vampire princes ask for one thing in return for not attacking the town..you.\" You had nothing to say, you were dumbfound to think that the entire town would sacrifice you to save themselves. As the anger boil your blood Duzzell sensed the hostility and said\" You brother argued to the last second of the town meeting to find some other way than this.\" You raised your head to look at your dear brother's face to see tears coming from his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Its time to go now.\" Duzzell said. You rushed to your brother and hugged him tightly as he stroked your hair \" Good Bye Sis.\" he said with a forced smile. <br>\r\n\" I don't wanna say good bye.\" you said crying. <br>\r\nKilik looked at you with teary eyes and said \"your right its not good bye its just see you later, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"O...Okay.\" you said smiling at your beloved brother, then you looked at Duzzell.<br>\r\n\"Come.\" he said offering his hand to you. You grabbed it as he held you close. You took one last look at your brother before thousands of bats surrounded you and Duzzell. Kilik couldn't do anything but look at you disappeared into the night sky with the prince of vampires.</span></div></div>",
