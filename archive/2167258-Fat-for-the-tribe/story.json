I just wished to inform you that, since it has been already three weeks since you arrived, the management decided to offer you a loyalty reward for being here with us until now, hoping that you will stay here even longer. In a few minutes some of our staff will come and assist you to collect your prizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Darren left, the three men couldn't contain their excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! This place has to be the best in the world, wouldn't you agree guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Joey, smiling, as he kept munching on a cookie taken from a bowl at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Best vacation ever! *Mphm*...It's so good I don't want ever to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbled Chandler as he kept munching on the chicken wings his robot was feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Urp* Heck yeah. Joey, can't stop thanking you for taking us with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three kept eating, three beautiful girls entered the pool, each of them was scantily clad and moved with grace toward the three guest, helping them standing as they started to guide them toward their 'Loyalty awards'.<br>\r\nA short moments later, the three girls led the guys to a vast hall chocked full of balloons and banners, on which there were printed the names of the three guests. The girls, though, didn't stop there and guided forward the three americans each toward a table dedicated only to them, not so close that they could touch each other, but neither so distant that they couldn't talk between themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from behind a column, emerged the figure of Facilier, as sh addressed the three chubby guys, with a smile plastered to her face, as she did her best to not lick her lips too hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, Chandler, Ross, we wanted to show you our pleasure in having you all here in our resort and so we decided to prepare a party for you guys.<br>\r\nAnd to show you how good it feels to have you here, at the end of the party, we will also give you three an award.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, enough talking...and let's start partying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the woman clapped her hands and from behind her appeared some other beautiful girls, each bringing within their arm a large, golden, cloche plate. as they arrived beside each of the guys they opened the cloche and left the plate full of food in front of the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at his plate and couldn't believe at what he was seeing. In front of him rested a large platter with the biggest hamburger he had ever seen. it was easily as wide as his open hand and he saw that there were at least three big patties inside, along with melted cheese and various strips of bacon. As he stared at it, he could feel his hunger, fueled by weeks of excessive meals, demanding him to eat that thing as fast as he could.<br>\r\nAt the same time, Chandler, took a good look at what the girl had left in front of him. At first he was envious of Joey but, as he saw the large bowl full of fried chicken, covered in barbecue sauce, with at the side a smaller, but not by much, bowl of onion rings he licked his lips in anticipation. Last, but not least, Ross received his plate and he too began drooling at the sight of his course. On his plate was resting a very large square of lasagna, within it he could see the cheese, the meat and the sauce all mixed together to perfection. So enthralled he was by it that he couldn't stop himself from sniffing it, enjoying its aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacilier words suddenly brought the guys back to the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to wait, dear guests. This celebration has just started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the three Americans began eating in earnest, each of them enjoying the flavor of his own dish. Joey, began taking big bites out of his burger, munching and, quickly, swallowing each load, loving the fact that the bun was so compact and meticulously prepared that not even a drop of sauce fell from it. Ross also had started to cut his lasagna in smaller pieces, eating them as fast as he could. After the first bite he felt in heaven and, if he only could, would have taken the entire thing within his mouth so good it was.<br>\r\nChandler, instead, had decided to go whole hog with his chicken and, without caring of the grease covering his hands, he started to tear as much meat as he could from his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying themselves immensely the guys made a quick work of the plates they had received and the room began to fill with the sounds of their appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Facilier had said, that was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after they had cleaned their plates, more girls began arriving toward them, each of them bringing forth a new deluge of treats for them to consume, and that they did. Plate after plate, course after course, the three guys kept eating, enslaved by how good those plates were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it showed. Each of them was now sporting a good sized potbelly, slowly filling up with tastier and tastier food. Facilier enjoyed the view of the three porker growing, still she knew that soon, due to how heavy were those dishes, they were going to stop. But she couldn't have any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the three of them had grown chubby since their arrival but the yearly festival of her people was due by the year's end and she needed the three guest of honor to be in Full shape for that time.<br>\r\nTaking aside one of the waitresses, she explained to her to start using that 'spice' on the next dishes they were going to serve.<br>\r\nThe girl gave back a quick nod, while smiling widely, showing her own pure white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler, meanwhile, was caressing his own tight packed belly, while burping in one of his hands. He had never eaten so well and still, he was beginning to feel full. After his chicken fried feast he had devoured a large steak with fries, he still could feel the meat melting in his mouth, a seemingly small mountain of chicken nuggets and some delicious deep fried sausages in various sauces, loving every minute of it. He had loved it so much that, even though he was feeling full-ish, he didn't want to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss and Joey were in similar positions, both had eaten a massive amount of food, but instead of feeling sickeningly full, they both were enjoying so much that they wanted more. Joey, while massaging his stomach, kept recalling the delicious oversized hot dogs or the massive portion of burger-lasagna he had just wiped out. Similarly, Ross, was recollecting of the large pasta dish he had received at some point. It had been so full of cheese, cream, eggs and bacon that he had loved every bite of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts were suddenly interrupted when three more plates were brought to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys, even though were wishing to continue, started to feel full and were worried that this marvelous feast could soon become a nightmare if they kept at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacilier smiled at them, knowing full well the effects of the spice she had ordered to apply to the plates, and tried to goad them to eat some more. She knew that they were getting full, it was enough to check their full tummies to know it but, she also knew that if they brought the spice within their systems everything would have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spice in fact was a...</span></div></div>",

The spice she had ordered to be mixed in the plates was a natural appetite stimulant and that would ensure that the three men would surely keep eating a little bit more, before stopping.<br>\r\nSure, she wasn't going to give them more of it that same night, for as it gave hunger, it didn't have any healing property toward the digestive tract, but every once in a while she knew could give it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following hour and half the three guys kept shoveling food down their throats as if they were starving and, from their point of view, they surely were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, as soon as he had swallowed the first bite of his bacon burger, felt himself ravenous. His hunger seemed to spike out fo the blue, but he was too under it to wonder the why's of it. He simply inhaled the bun he had in his hands and eagerly started on his next course, which was rapidly delivered by one of the waitresses, as he sent a glance toward his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't in a much different position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler had just given a small bite to the chicken drumstick that one of the waitresses had brought him when he felt himself compelled to eat more. Like an animal he began cleaning drumstick after drumstick, his lips and cheeks getting covered in grease, while one of the girls stood at his side cleaning him every time she could without interrupting his frenzy. Ross instead, as soon as he had swallowed the small forkful of Fettucine alfredo's felt a strange taste in his mouth but, any thought related to that got overruled by the hunger he felt growing within himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time passed, each of them began slowing down. Even though they were still feeling peckish, each of them was stuffed as their full, and taut as a drum, bellies could prove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...*Urp*...Can't believe how much I ate...'t was good though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler mumbled by himself as he kept burping and belching, trying to relieve some pressure from his lead ball of a stomach. Ross and Joey agreed whole heartedly as they too tried to relieve some pressure, while the waitresses cleared their tables and, after that, returned to their side to massage their stuffed bellies. In all of this, Facilier, had seemingly disappeared, as she had consumed her own small meal,  but quickly returned when the guests were being massaged by the beautiful girls at their sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the dinner was up to your tastes, honored guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss answered for all, as he saw that the other two were way too taken with the massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Never, ever, have eaten such good plates. Almost wish it could be like this at every meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Facilier with a smile \"...I think that it can be arranged, if that is your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe-*Urp*-Awesome!\" shouted Joey with excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, though...\" started again the woman \"It's time for your rewards! My husband, Mazu, will give them to you right away. <br>\r\nMazu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the end of the hall a set of double doors opened and in entered Mazu, followed by Darren and by one of the waitresses. The three of them had each an object within their arms but, as it was covered with a sheet, it wasn't possible to understand what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazu stepped forward, taking the word and addressing the three Americans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my wife has said, we thank you deeply for your presence here. We're honored to have you all here with us and we hope you'll want to stay as much as you want. But enough of that, I am here because we have a gift for each of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned to the waitress to move, and she did so until she was at the side of Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Ross, we have decided to assign to your persona one of our own waitresses. She'll be at your side to pamper you and to assist in your every whim, for all the time you'll be at our resort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then took out the sheet and revealed a glass case containing some kind of remote, which she swiftly gave it to Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that remote...\" contined Mazu\"...Ross, you'll be able to call for her assistance whenever you need, at whatever time you'll need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss gave a look of uncertainty toward the girl, which just blushed and whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Suzana, it's a pleasure to assist such a good man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ross began to blush beet red, Mazu turned toward Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, For you we decided to give you something you may have desired since arriving here. Darren, if you would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren walked toward Joey and, when he was at his side, revealed the content of the box he was holding. Inside there was a simple looking pin. As Joey took it in his hand it began to glow and a mechanical figure emerged from behind his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Joey, is F33-DR, but we simply call him Chef. We saw how excited you were with Chandler robotic assistant and so we all agreed to provide you with a similar model for your own use. He'll be always ready to answer any of your calls at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, even though was still enjoying the massage, couldn't refrain himself from raise his arm and shout in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yeah! Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mazu finally turned toward Chandler, which seemed to be envying his two friends, but also quite excited at the prospect of his own incoming gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chandler, for you we have discussed long and hard on what to give you. We wanted to show you our appreciation and so we hope that this will suit your tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mazu spoke, he also moved forward and extracted a little remote from the box he was holding. As soon as Mazu used the remote, Chandler heard a light whirring sound and actually saw the floor giving away from him. At first he began to feel scared until he realized that the chair he was own wasn't a normal chair but a floating one. Suddenly excited he began looking at the hundreds of buttons that began to appear on the handles until he just smiled in happiness toward Mazu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear guests\" Facilier took word moving to stand by Mazu \"We hope you enjoyed this celebration and we wish for you all a wonderful rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I just spoke to our personnel in the kitchens. As you asked, from now on, all of your meals will be arranged as they were for this celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three friends walked/waddled away, helping themselves with their gifts, Facilier, Mazu and Darren moved closer to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good idea you had, dear wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mazu, Between the gifts we have given them, the spice that we will use from now on and the every day multi courses meals, they will sure fatten up until they reach the right size for the Yearly Festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle? Aunt? How big do you think they'll get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As big as we can make them\" Facilier answered \"But we need to keep them stuffed, in the dark and as lazy as they can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as night time approach...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, you\u2019re right on time. Please, sit anywhere you like.\u201d \u201cWhen is everyone else supposed to get here? I thought this was an audition.\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cOh, yes. Good news! I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d prefer you for the role I had in mind.\u201d \u201cReally?!\u201d Exclaimed Jackson. \u201cThat\u2019s great! What\u2019s the role, exactly?\u201d \u201cIn due time. In the meantime, eat your fill. You\u2019ll need to put on some pounds for this role.\u201d The two looked at each other uncertainly and began to peruse their options.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have to say, you have such a trim figure. I\u2019m almost jealous.\u201d Jim said with a slightly mischievous tone. \u201cThank you?\u201d Jackson said confused. Jackson exchanged some perplexed glances over this sudden comment on his appearance. \u201cLooks like that\u2019s a thing of the past. Keep eating.\u201d Jim said with a smirk. The boy continued eating plate after plate, but began to slow down, eyes watering in discomfort. Finally, he  leaned back in his chair, belly round and distended. \u201cUgggh.\u201d Jackson moaned in discomfort. \u201cI can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d<br>\r\n\tJim\u2019s eye twitched in annoyance. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop now. You can\u2019t stop until you eat everything on that table.\u201d He said sternly. The boy\u2019s eyes widened in shock, looking at the veritable mountain of food that still lay before them. The buffet was enough to feed well over 20 people! \u201cI can\u2019t eat that much!\u201d Cried Jackson. \u201cI thought you really wanted the part. This is to show me you\u2019re committed. Now eat. Once that table is cleared, we can discuss your  role.\u201d Jackson  exchanged some looks and reluctantly went back to eating, doing his best to ignore their aching stomachs. After just one more plate, he recoiled and grabbed his throat, caustic bile welling up and threatening to come spilling out. Swallowing, he leaned back in his chairs and took a few ragged breaths, only just barely having avoided throwing up all over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(how will they continue the \"epsiode\")<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, due to his natural charisma, his leadership skills and his trustworthy appearance, he had never been caught or been suspected of anything when those players shamed themselves on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking them easy prey for him to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, his reputation increased, even without producing any notable progress in the teams he worked for. Now that he had the possibility to catch one of the most famous players in the world, he wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything. Quickly he had arranged a meeting with the team owners of Cristiano\u2019s team and had been granted to train the team, with the small clause that he could focus on one of them if the case was to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat in his office, looking through the reports of each player, he quickly fished out the file of Cristiano Ronaldo and scanned it for any bit of useful information. The person was a mean killing machine, the perfect soccer player and yet, he had to bring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James had an idea, The idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked tirelessly the entire afternoon to put in motion his plan, by making calls, by spreading false information and even coming down to directly bribe some important people. In the end he had everything staged and ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to change the dietary plans for Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day an insane number of medical reports was going to be issued by the medical section of the team owner\u2019s company.  Each and any of these reports were going to prove that Cristiano was in a severe health condition, that he was so malnourished that in a few months his organism could simply collapse under the stress. Then he, James, was going to be chosen to make sure that Mr. Ronaldo followed through with the new diet to balance his condition before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course everything was a complete lie, even the diet was going to be prepared by him, and he for sure was going to pump his new meal-to-be full of countless calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day events progressed just as James predicted. It was a day full of shouting, of people phoning other people, of experts being called and of proofs being verified. But in the end, as the day progressed to its end, he received a call from the CEO of the team\u2019s company, granting him full power to manage and \u2018restore\u2019 Cristiano well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the following day, James called Cristiano to his office. He knew the player wasn\u2019t happy about those reports, Cristiano openly said that those were complete lies but, within himself he was scared that it could be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Cristiano, I think you know why I called you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about yesterday, isn\u2019t it? Man, I can\u2019t believe it. I feel fine. I don\u2019t feel \u2018malnourished\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do. To be completely sincere I don\u2019t think this will last long. Still, no harm in play along for a bit? If it\u2019s a lie, as you said, you\u2019ll just have lost a few days\u2026but if it\u2019s true, then you\u2019ll have the upper hand, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano thought deeply about this and had to admit that his coach was right. What had he to lose? At worst, he would have to spend a few more days in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026Yeah I get you. Ok. So, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put, they have sent me your new dietary plan. Therefore, I\u2019ll follow you at meal times, and whenever you need me, so that I can give living proof that everything is going on as they asked. Don\u2019t worry, everything will settle down. You\u2019ll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow come, since we are both here we can start already. The earliest we start, the earliest we finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames began to lead Cristiano to the mess hall of the training facility they were in, where a full team of chefs were already hard at work in making sure that whatever Cristiano was going to order, he was going to get it at the best of their abilities. <br>\r\nJames led Cristiano to a table and told him to wait him there as he went to speak with the man at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m James Podrick, Cristiano\u2019s coach. I\u2019m here to make sure he follows the proper nutrition as per his medical records. So, since it\u2019s almost lunch time I would say that you can prepare a couple of things for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, let me show you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, as Cristiano and James were idly chatting at the table, a waiter arrived and left some platters right in front of the player, uncovering them and quickly moving back toward the counter in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano stared wide eyed at the food he had received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in front of him, there was a big plate of macaroni and cheese, with a heavy looking sauce coating the whole plate, then there was a slightly larger platter with a large steak, almost two inches of height, with a conspicuous amount of fries and fried bacon as a side dish. But there was also a last plate with a seemingly small-ish slice of devil\u2019s food cake and a large bottle of soda, should he feel thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me\u2026This is my lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember Cristiano, what have you to lose? You can fight against it and people might find that suspicious\u2026or you could just do as they say and if something doesn\u2019t go as planned, you\u2019ll have the upper hand. Plus, a break from all those skimpy meals doesn\u2019t sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm. Didn\u2019t thought about that. Thanks, Coach! Man, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get used to these massive portions, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano then grabbed his utensils and began scooping up the rich and heavy pasta, softly moaning from the rich taste at each of his bites. It didn\u2019t take long for him eat most of the pasta but, in the end he had to stop from cleaning his plate, as he moved toward the steak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, as morsel after morsel found its way into his mouth, he couldn\u2019t stop from moaning in pleasure. The steak was perfect, neither too cooked nor too raw, it simply seemed to melt on his tongue. Same thing happened with the fries, which he covered in lots of ketchup and mayo, blinking toward James who watched him raptly, finishing then with almost clearing all of the bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping in pleasure, Cristiano stopped for a bit, as he massaged his bloated stomach with one hand, as he felt all that food rest peacefully in his belly. With a few minutes rest, he finally brought closer the slice of cake and once more the taste almost overwhelmed him. It was so rich, and yet so tasty and light that he found himself wishing idly for a little bit more as he realized he had practically inhaled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026*Urp!*\u2026Oof, \u2018scuse me, Coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. So, how was everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUtterly perfect, Man. So good\u2026Will I eat like this at every meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Mostly. Think you can manage for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano grinned to James, as he patted his full, slightly bloated, belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get used to it but, Ok. I\u2019ll bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days began to pass, so James kept close watch on Cristiano as he began his descent into the hedonistic pleasure of gluttony. Still, even though he began eating much more than he had ever done, the guy was still working out in the gym and performing training and exercise on the field and so the changes in his body weren\u2019t so visible as James had hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good. If he keeps working out, he\u2019ll never become tastier. Need to have him to stop for a bit. He has to slow down\u2026Or maybe would be better to just increase the numbers of meals he\u2019ll have to consume?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmh\u2026must think on it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James had reached a conclusion, it didn\u2019t matter how much Cristiano ate every day if he just kept working out in the gym and on the field. For that reason he had to stop altogether. That, along with the heavily caloric meal plan he was on, would surely fatten him up good. James rapidly took the phone and began making a series of calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I need to speak with Mr. Clarkson, the deputy CEO. Yes I\u2019ll wait on the line. Hey Frank, yes, it\u2019s me. I need to call in that favour\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Can I speak to you in private?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure Coach. \u2018Sup guys? See you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cristiano left the team and reached James he was still sweating a little from the exercise session he had on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Coach? What\u2019s the matter? I\u2019m following the meal plans as ordered\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do, Cristiano. But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d Here James did his best to appear as if he had been ordered to do something he hadn\u2019t agreed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Administration team of the Company thinks that having you sowing on the field could provide a \u2018Marketing Apocalypse\u2019, as they said, if you were to collapse. For that they\u2019ve instructed me to \u2018ask\u2019 you to take it easy on the training for a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano grew angrier by the minute as he understood where James was going with his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? They\u2019re still yapping about those health reports? Man, I\u2019m fine!\u201d<br>\r\nJames quickly brought one hand on the shoulder of the player, encouraging him.<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you feel and I tried my best to let them understand but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut those wussies think only of the money\u2026I know I can count on you Coach. So, what I have to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBasically they\u2019re asking you to take a two week long vacation in an hotel they\u2019ve provided, without performing any kind of physical exercise. Naturally, I\u2019ll come with you to help you and be there if you need me. Who knows, maybe you will see that it can\u2019t be as bad as you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoach\u2026Thanks. Sheesh\u2026some people really believe anything, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes they do, Cristiano. They totally do.\u201d<br>\r\nSaid James as he grinned like a cat with a cornered mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days later, Cristiano and James were in the fancy resort provided by the company, which in turn had received the suggestion from one of their own, who was secretly on the pay check of James Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had chosen very carefully the place where he had to keep Cristiano for those two weeks. After all, he had only this chance to change the soccer player to turn him in the sluggish and lazy glutton he needed. The resort was located on a private property island in the Mediterranean Sea, near the coast of Greece. Moreover, most importantly, it catered to only a certain set of people; those who were in the fetish commonly known as Feederism. <br>\r\nHere, in this resort, James was sure that he was going to be able to turn Cristiano from the fit player he was to what He really needed him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delicious, fattened, meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo, Coach, what I\u2019m supposed to do here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Cristiano, you could go and take some tan on the beach, or maybe do some sightseeing around the place. I have heard from one of the girls at the counters that every day there countless activities and shows to have around here. As long as you don\u2019t exercise and you keep on following the schedule they\u2019ve given you, I don\u2019t think there will be any problems. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh-mh\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t sound too convinced but, he wasn\u2019t there for his desire. Still, the idea of having nothing to do for two weeks was new to him and so, as first thing he decided to just relax and enjoy his first day there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Coach. I\u2019m gonna just try to rest a bit for now. Could you, please, ask them to send me my lunch here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, Cristiano. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soccer player seated on the bed watching some TV, James went out of the room and called for the room service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Coach Podrick. Yes, the guests of the luxury suite. Yeah, I wanted to ask you to bring up to our room one of your own Lunch Combo Special meals.<br>\r\n Yes. No, the other guests isn\u2019t\u2026affiliated so to speak, I\u2019m sure you understand.<br>\r\nOkay, thanks. We\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fifteen minutes later, just as James was going to call back the kitchen, the waiters brought inside the suite, right next to the bed where Cristiano was laying, a couple of trolleys. With an efficiency that James had rarely seen, the two waiter girls quickly placed all the food on a mobile tray so that Cristiano could eat without leaving the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir. As per instructions received from your company representative, we\u2019ve got here your lunch. Please, enjoy.<br>\r\nIf you are in need of anything else, don\u2019t hesitate to call us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano suddenly found himself surrounded by a plethora of food. In the past few days he had gotten used to eat a little bit more on the heavy side and so he didn\u2019t said anything aloud but, he could see that the people here had been forewarned of his coming. There was no way that the meal he had under his nose was something not prepared for him specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared with a satisfied glint in his eyes, the place was known to cook on the heavy, and fattening, side of things and the meal they had brought wasn\u2019t short of his expectations. Still, Cristiano didn\u2019t seem to mind as James saw him start the meal without any of usual fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James watched, Cristiano began on clearing plate after plate, fried shrimps with a sweet, but highly caloric, sauce, then some fried mix with various tasty bits of various fishes. Passing then onward toward the main courses, clearing out bowls of Chinese pork noodles, made extra tasty with heavy addition of oil and grease, then some fruit candy, to freshen the meal, without losing any calorie gained. And finally , dessert, a rather large slice of a strawberry cake.<br>\r\nEverything along with a couple bottles of fine French wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cristiano cleared out almost everything, he felt completely stuffed and yet, he still couldn\u2019t say that it was starting to feel good to have this kind of diet implemented into his life. Still, as he lay on the bed, caressing his bloated stomach, he began checking the activities of the resort through the digital pamphlet on the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames though, had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh. Cristiano. Don\u2019t forget why they\u2019ve sent us here\u2026As much as I don\u2019t like it, if They hear that you\u2019ve followed a beach volley tournament here, we\u2019ll both be fired.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUrg\u2026*urp*\u2026and so? What should I do then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here today, rest a bit, watch some TV\u2026and maybe later on we can go to the arcade. I heard that they\u2019ve got quite a big soccer simulator in there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrue? Well\u2026alright\u2026*yawn* I guess I\u2019m getting a little bit sleepy\u2026I guess we can go there\u2026tomorrow\u2026to check it\u2026out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, due to the heavy meal he had just cleared, Cristiano fell asleep on the bed, while James moved closer, as the player was loudly snoring, and began to rub that bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Cristiano. Eat, sleep and do nothing else. I need you to grow more for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first three days passed uneventful for the duo, James and Cristiano didn\u2019t do much in those days, except for staying in the room and eat, or going to the beach for some tanning and eating. Cristiano began to see the truth in James words, as much as he had loved going to the gym, there was something in staying all day in bed, eating his meals and, occasionally, having a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Cristiano wasn\u2019t having only a few snacks along the day but he was more grazing throughout the entire day. Still as the first week passed away without any incidents, James could see as Cristiano began to act more lazily. Not only he had stopped waking up in the early hours, preferring to rise not before the nine in the morning but he also seemed to grow more apathetic against the world surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the fourth day that something seemed to be starting to stir in Cristiano\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James quickly intervened, he had to make Cristiano as lazy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? Just\u2026just cleaning up a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHere, get on the bed and don\u2019t worry. Attendant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as James called two beautiful girls entered the suite, one began to clean everything around, while the other moved beside Cristiano, massaging his shoulders and, occasionally, giving him a few pastries to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see? It\u2019s their job. You wouldn\u2019t like to steal it from them, would you Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, once more comfortable on the bed, began once more to watch the TV, as he kept munching on the pastries that the girl beside him kept on giving im.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026Coach. Man\u2026sure is tiring\u2026being here\u2026gotta admit there is something to\u2026just rest.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! Now, rest some more and then I\u2019ll have Dinner brought in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYup, Coach. *Gulp*\u2026Dinner shounds\u2026sho good\u2026*urp*\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first week passed, James could see he was onto something. Cristiano barely had moved from the bed as he kept eating all of his meals and kept on grazing throughout the days  on all the snacks the attendants brought to him. Sometime, just to be bold, James tried to double the player intake during lunch or dinner and the results had been optimistic. The player managed in both cases to clean out almost everything and still he kept on snacking through the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could already see the first effects that this new lifestyle was having on the player. Since Cristiano had dropped the gym and the exercise he was really starting to chub up, his belly now began to droop a little on his tight shorts, giving him a slight muffin top, while his moobs had also begun to bloat up becoming small puffy hills. Overall he was getting chubby but, for James, chubby wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhi, Coach? I\u2019m putting on weigh or what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026what do you mean, Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player was now checking himself in the mirror and was particularly staring at his torso, noticing the soft layer of pudge he had on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean this Coach\u2026Did I have it already? Man, I\u2019m confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames played it as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything different. Wait; let\u2019s see from an external opinion. Girls? Do you think my friend here has changed in any way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two attendants, which passed basically all their time in the suite with them, turned and looked meticulously to Cristiano but, both smiled as they answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSincerely? I just see some guy who could look really great if he wasn\u2019t so thin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeems just the same. I can\u2019t see anything different\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Cristiano? I think you\u2019re just letting your worries getting to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026you\u2019re probably right Coach. Anyway, Coach, what about having lunch earlier today? And, about that soccer simulator you told me about, well maybe we can go there tomorrow? I don\u2019t really feel up to it today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cE-Earlier lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was caught off guard and so answered back questioningly, but the player didn\u2019t seem to worry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019m getting hungrier than usually. Must be that I skipped breakfast today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick grinned wickedly within himself. <br>\r\n\u2018Skipped breakfast? But if just today I gave you two times as much as you usually have? Well, if you want more, I\u2019ll give you more\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Cristiano. It must mean that you\u2019re getting back our strength if you\u2019re getting hungrier\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James left the room, Cristiano went back on the bed and began once more to do some zapping as one of the attendants fed him donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026so good. Keep \u2018em coming babe.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. As you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James was talking with the kitchen staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, It\u2019s Podrick here. Yeah. No, actually, my friend here is asking for something earlier today. Yes. Yes, I was thinking of two of yours Lunch Combo Special meals and an All Dessert Dream to close the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I\u2019ll call you back to let you know if it need to be made the new normal from now on. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James returned inside the room, he smiled as he saw Cristiano. The guy was really becoming an hopeless lazy glutton, just what he needed to be. Still, it was always better to play it safe and so he decided to bring in the game a weapon he had learned to love when it was time to fatten up quickly someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, Lunch should be here soon. Meanwhile, why don\u2019t you try one of these health bars\u2026The sponsors guaranteed that they\u2019re the best. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano gladly took the oversized chocolate bar from James and quickly unwrapped it, as he kept muncing on the donuts that the attendant fed him. He looked at the bar for a few second, apparently without noticing how big it was, and as soon as he had swallowed his morsel, he gave a big bite to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026*gulp*\u2026Damn, Coach! Theshe are good! Tashtiest health bars I\u2019ve ever had\u2026Strange though\u2026I\u2019m starting to getting hungrier\u2026Who cares. They\u2019re health bars, so they\u2019ve got to be good for you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExactly so, Cristiano. Eat as much of them as you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to take bites out of the chocolate bars, but still he kept having mouthful of donuts as well, munching on both the soft texture of the donuts and the delicious flavour of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed, his stomach seemed to bloat out faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes, Cristiano. Eat as many as you want. There are enough calories in there to equal a normal meal, and the hunger stimulants that they contain will give you the extra boost you need to grow in the meal I need you to become.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment the doorbell ringed, as the waitresses entered the room with the oversized lunch, easily three times as much food as Cristiano had ever previously had. Yet, the player didn\u2019t seem to find anything wrong in it, as he felt starving, and so literally dived into the food like a beast, beginning to clean each plate they had brought to him. There was only one last dessert to clean out and he would have finished everything, but he didn\u2019t feel up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026*urp*\u2026I think I ate too much\u2026Can\u2019t keep on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames though had other ideas. He wanted to speed up the process and needed to have Cristiano as fat and lazy as possible at the end of that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cristiano? Why don\u2019t you have just one more Health bar? Just to, cleanse the pallet, as they say?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Coach\u2026I don\u2019t think I can fit anything else in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish the sentence, as James had given one of the bars to the girl seated beside the player, she broke a large piece of it and pushed it in the player mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, Sir. It\u2019s good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano could only swallow but, as he did so and tried to say something, another piece of that chocolate bar was pushed between his lips. As he munched on it he began to feel his belly rumbling for more. Confused he looked at the bloated belly he was sporting toward and at the last dessert that still was under his nose. Burping with satisfaction he quickly motioned to the two girls to keep feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were\u2026right Coach\u2026Must be\u2026hungrier than I thought.

IF he had to give an estimate, he would have said that Cristiano now was edging in the two hundred pounds range, more or less. Still, James had to be sure that once returned to the training facility Cristiano kept on with his lazy lifestyle. <br>\r\nTo verify that he had already concocted a devious plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had checked the local soccer simulator and had verified that it was just what Cristiano needed in his life. Within the simulator, the player would feel just as if he was on the football field, but without the discomfort of having to move around and all that. If he could make Cristiano addicted to that machine, he could then just purchase it for the soccer player when they were back home and so he could keep on fattening him up while maintain the pretense that the player was still training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. James had only to convince the now lazy Cristiano to leave the room in which they had arrived a dozens of days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player was on the bed, staring transfixed at the screen of the TV as the two attendants kept on feeding him, one giving him those health bars, the other stuffing him full of pastries and chocolates. He munched on, as if unaware of what was happening around him. And, James knew, it probably was so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started to call them \u2018Cristiano\u2019s Eating Trances\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a certain point the soccer player just zoned out and kept on eating whatever it was offered to him, without making any fuss or any complaint, even if his belly was stuffed full of food already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, James had work to do and so, shushing the girls away he moved closer. He still couldn\u2019t believe how big Cristiano was getting. His whole body had started to round up, growing a thick layer of fat everywhere. Even his arms had begun to form some small bingo wings, as a double chin was forming under his face. His belly then, pooching down over the shorts he was wearing, starting the slow descent toward his crotch, while at the side his muffin top grew larger and larger. And how could he forget about his moobs? For sure he was going to need to wear a brain order to contain them if he ever had needed to run back on the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he could run for long, no sir. Not with chunky legs he had developed.<br>\r\nOverall, he had fattened up quite well, but James had to make sure that he kept on fattening up and so had to wake him up from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Cristiano!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? Wha\u2019? Oh. It\u2019s you, Coach? What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, do you want to come with me to chek that soccer simulator we spoke about?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMm..I don\u2019t know, Coach\u2026I just don\u2019t feel it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is true but, don\u2019t forget that you still need to have some activity throughout the day. This simulator seems the right answer to our problem. Think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as of now you cannot play on the field due to this illness that you have right? But, if you don\u2019t practise at all you\u2019ll end up ruining you\u2019re A-game. With the simulator instead\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Oh! I see. Man, that\u2019s\u2026why you\u2019re\u2026the Coach. With that\u2026thing, I can practice\u2026but without\u2026 exerting myself\u2026and so I don\u2019t\u2026risk any collateral effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s cool! Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, as Cristiano tried to rise from the bed he didn\u2019t manage it on his own. His muscles had slightly atrophied and so he stared confusedly around him as he tried to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, Don\u2019t worry\u2026that\u2019s just the illness that has to be manifesting with its first symptoms. Here, I\u2019ll help you stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long trek, during which Cristiano still managed to drown several slushies and even some of his health bars, they finally reached the arcade room and soon, in front of them there was the soccer simulator. It was a large sphere of metal sheets, inside which there was a comfortable looking chair, an helmet with some tubes coming in and out of it, some gloves for the virtual reality immersion and some more gadgets. Quickly, James had Cristiano seated in there, wearing the helmet and the gloves. As a final addition, he placed one of the tubed mask that were linked to the cabin, onto his mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re all set to go. The gloves and the helmet will provide you with the audio, vision and touch senses. The mask, obviously, will provide coverage for the last two senses. This way, you\u2019ll fell just as if you\u2019re on the field. <br>\r\nReady? Go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James started the simulator, Cristiano found himself plunged into a soccer field, with his old body as he began sprinting and playing, running around as he played a mock game with his AI controlled teammate and adversaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, instead, James and the two girls could admire Cristiano as he seated comfortably and, at his every movement, how his body fat jiggled this way and that. It was a magnificent show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls? Have you brought what I\u2019ve asked you to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two attendants smiled widely as she showed a small trolley filled with large water flasks full of a brown liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. We melted as many of those \u2018health bars\u2019 as we could and filled them in these bottles. Can we proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, be my guest. Pour it all in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James kept on watching, the girls began to pour the melted chocolate bars into a nozzle on the side of the simulator, as a meter began to rise showing how much liquid was stored inside the machine. At the same time, the brown colored sludge began to travel inside the tubing of the simulator until it reached the mask attached on Cristiano face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared gleefully as Cristiano began to swallow the heavy caloric, appetite stimulant sludge without any fuss as he kept on playing at the simulator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Cristiano. Enjoy the game\u2026Soon, that will be you only way to be in a soccer field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, an overstuffed and bloated Cristiano shut off the machine and barely managed to stand from it, as James and the girls quickly gathered around him to help him stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Cristiano, how it was?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026Oh, Coach,\u2026that is\u2026awesome! I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t stop\u2026 your idea was\u2026the best. I really\u2026need to\u2026have one of these\u2026back home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll call the Company and will make it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks man. God, I feel as if I run for hundreds of miles\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Cristiano. You did. It was a simulation but you still ran that long.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Gotta be right\u2026So hungry though\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned as sent the tired ex-soccer player to return to his room helped by the two girls, as he moved toward one of the help desks of the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Cristiano. Since your exercise was so harsh, I\u2019ll ask them to send something more tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Coach\u2026so\u2026So Hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James saw the three move away, he could clearly see the two girls began feeding Cristiano with the remaining bottles of chocolate sludge, and he drank them all without any care in the world. He, instead approached the young man and began his order for Cristiano\u2019s meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m Coach Podrick. Can I order? Wonderful.<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see\u2026for tonight dinner, is your Humongous Combo Meal the one with the breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert feast, all in one? Good. Send two of them to our room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom tomorrow, instead, you can easily triple the current normal order for all of his daily meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that would be all. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, Cristiano, I\u2019ll make you huge.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those last two days at the resort, Cristiano seemed to blow up with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was, almost, always hungry he ate without any break. And as he also spent as much time as he could on the simulator, he felt like he was really exercising and so didn\u2019t find anything strange in the fact that his meals had gotten suddenly huge. Another factor was that since he had accepted the idea of being ill and of having been malnourished up to that moment, he stopped questioning his physical changes. <br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t see them but, more that all those around him told him there weren\u2019t. So he decided that it had to be his mind playing tricks with him, as it was supported from his Coach, who had always been at his side.<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t be lying, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the final day rolled to a closure, since the following morning the two of them had to return home, Cristiano decided that a celebratory feast was in order and so asked James to order as much food as possible. Very soon, countless trolleys of food entered the room, filling every nook and cranny with food as an oversize Ronald kept on laying on his king sized bed, almost filling  a good three quarters of it all by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was still beside him, admiring his masterpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow  Cristiano\u2019s gut now was divided in two large rolls that covered up to his crotch. Or his now very definite triple chin, as it cascaded down on his neck, or his pendulous moobs, so large and puffy that were really gonna need a bra to be kept in check. And what about his ass. What a masterful piece of art. Those two huge, flabby, jiggly mass of ass cheeks Cristiano now had as a rear. James could have sworn that he could have used that ass as a desk for his laptop if so he had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Cristiano had transformed hugely in those two weeks but, better yet, he now was ready to be brought to the next level. He was now enough of a lazy glutton to be able to keep on getting fat until he got immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all that mattered was to bring him home and manage to let him stay still on the team roster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James already had various aces in his sleeves\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As James and Cristiano moved from the resort, there were some snags bound to happen. Naturally, James tried his best to play in advance and he could compliment himself for a job well done. Foreseeing mobility\u2019s issues with Cristiano, he had enlisted the help of the two resort attendants as if they were personal nurses. And they proved their value as they assisted the overfed soccer player in moving around, boarding the private jet and kept him always stuffed to the brim during the entire duration of the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother issue arose as soon as they arrived at their destination. As much as they tried to move in secrecy, some journalist had heard the scoop and tried to take a few shots at them. Luckily, James had already hired a decoy, using an actor to imitate Cristiano, thus managing to land the real deal in anonymity.<br>\r\nFinally, as soon as they were in the training center, the last problems already were taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had thought that the other team members might victimize Cristiano, if they were to see him, so it was released the news that he was ill and had to follow a harsh regimen of rehabilitation, before being able to join them all on the field. This way, the renovations done to Cristiano\u2019s room were also justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick smiled as he and his entourage entered the new rooms of Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed had been reinforced and enlarged, and a huge television had been added right in front of it with as many channels as possible. The Soccer Simulator also had been installed and upgraded as per James specifications. With a maximum weight tolerance of five tons, it had to be sturdy enough for Cristiano. In addition, just to be sure that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 didn\u2019t ever leave his room, a Chef, personally chosen by James, had been hired. So that the guy could be fattened up without any issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be right on par with James plans for Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy himself didn\u2019t seem to take too much notice in all of the changes, he simply waddled slowly toward the bed, helped by the two girls at his side and, as soon as was there, he relaxed on top of it, huffing and puffing as he had overexerted himself in just walking around for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026Gotta recover\u2026 soon, from this\u2026illness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cristiano. I\u2019m sure you will. Now, since it\u2019s almost time, I think we could have an earlier breakfast, but before that don\u2019t forget about your health bars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano, at the mention of food, began to feel a low rumbling from his large gut, as hunger began to manifest itself within him. Yet, even though breakfast was going to arrive soon, he still began to motion to his girls to start giving him a little snack. Both girls, quickly moving on both side of him, began giving him food, alternating between his health bars and brownies. Cristiano ate both moaning in pleasure, as he felt his belly grumble more and more noisily as the hunger stimulants began to have their effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later that the Chef began to bring forward the breakfast platters to Cristiano, which helped himself from those huge platters without realizing how big they were. As he seated on the bed, he moved closer the mobile tray with the first platter, easily covering his own width with its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it he saw that there were almost a dozen peppered egg whites, with a side of thick and heavy fried bacon slices, along with some huge fried sausages, easily the size of a small coke bottle. As He began to ate the meal, the chef, brought forward another platter, placed on a mobile trolley, leaving a second tray chocked full of massive hot dogs, heavily loaded with sauces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano simply grunted in acknowledgment, as he began grabbing some of those hot dogs, using them as bread to collect the eggs from his first platter. Useless to say that he soon began to cover his face in grease and other sauces, as the residuals of his meal began to accumulate on his cheeks and on his triple chins. The attendants though were there to clean him up and to push more and more of his health bars, within his mouth whenever they could. Therefore, the overfed player kept on eating, feeling his hunger grow to higher levels at all the times. As he cleaned the first two platters, he began to slightly rub his swollen, bloated gut, burping away freely to ease some more space in there. Still the Chef kept coming, bringing him more to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he placed a vast bowl as close to him as possible, this salad bowl was chocked full of fried chicken pieces, along with even more fried bacon strips. Then he left on a nearby trolley another tray, this time they were burgers, huge five decker burgers, and each patty at the very least two hundred grams of pure pork meat. These were left beside him, as a small pool of grease and oil began to exude of them in the same plate. Yet Cristiano began to scoop them up, taking vast mouthful out of them, enjoying the rich flavor, feeling the grease and oil flow down his chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stood still, enjoying the view. Here he was, watching one of the most proficient soccer player in the world eat himself toward true obesity. Even now, as he imagined him at being almost at three hundred pounds, he still wasn\u2019t content. Cristiano had to grow more before being considered acceptable to become his meal. Yet, he also had to maintain a modicum of pretense in order to appease to what little resistance the player could still bring on.<br>\r\nAs the Chef brought forward more tray, each of these loaded with desserts, James moved closer to his pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Cristiano, enjoy your breakfast but after a well needed nap, remember that you\u2019ve gotta practice some more in the simulator, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player just grunted his agreement to that request, as he dived face first in the large assortment of cakes that they had brought to him. As he did so, his belly continued to bloat out more and more, growing more stuffed at each morsel he ate, and yet he kept on eating, careless of what damages he was inflicting upon his figure.  When he finally had cleared all dishes, Cristiano was already feeling drowsy. All the food, stuffed in his bloated gut, was already being digested and so he simply fell asleep as the pounds already seemed to appear on his growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, the girls woke him up softly and, as they helped him stand, they brought him forward toward the simulator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u2026want to\u2026practice but\u2026I\u2019m getting\u2026hungry again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll ask the Chef to whip up something for you as a mid-morning snack. Now go work out a bit in the simulator.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, Coach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days began to pass by, a sort of schedule began to take form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would feed a large pre-breakfast to Cristiano, right as the sun emerged at the horizon, only to let him sleep on it for a couple of hours, waking him up just in time for a hearty breakfast, which would keep him occupied for almost an hour. Then he would nap a bit more and then practice in the simulator, as more desserts and his health bars sludge was fed to him through the machine, right until lunch time. It was then that the Chef would go all out on Cristiano, feeding him a whole seven-course meal, letting him have as many seconds he wished for, keeping him there for at least three hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was going to be once more naptime for the over engorged player, until was time for another snack, and right after that some more practice in the simulator. Along with its complementary sludge feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs practice finished, Cristiano would be so hungry that James knew he could keep him eating right up until dinnertime and beyond.  Then, right before midnight, after a small nap, they would wake him up once more to fed him an all dessert meal, keeping him eating for as long as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was going to be a new day and the cycle would start all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the schedule, James also reinforced in Cristiano\u2019s mind the idea that for all his practice with the simulator, he was spending precious energies and so had to eat always more than the day before. Cristiano, soon, convinced himself of this and, even when not exercising, he would always request more and more food, thus eating and stretching his stomach every day more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames kept watching from the sidelines, as he began to detach from the now obese player, as he kept on growing fatter and larger, enjoying how big Cristiano was getting, In just a few days, Cristiano seemed to have grown of at least another hundred pounds, bringing him to a very obese four hundred pounds\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he woke up, he slowly began the arduous task of placing himself against the bed stand. It never dawned on him that it shouldn\u2019t have been such a hard task to perform. Still, by pushing with all his might (for what strength he still had), he managed to place his back vertically, reaching a seated position on the bed. Yet, he was now left tired and covered in sweat, as he wasn\u2019t used anymore to exert any kind of exercise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as tired and hungry he was, help was right beside him as one of the two \u2018personal nurses\u2019 was right beside him, with a large platter filled with donuts and pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Sir, here have some of your pre-breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t even reply, he simply opened his mouth and began eating away at whatever he was receiving. The nurse, Nastassja, was enjoying the presence of the fattened-up player. She had accepted that job because she knew that he had the potential of becoming one of the biggest. She had enjoyed working in the Resort, the possibility to be around feeders and feedees, to be there watching them grow and be stuffed was something she loved but, they always left after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Coach Podrick had asked her and her colleague to join him she accepted at the condition of being able to stay at Cristiano\u2019s side forever. Nastassja was brought back from her reverie when she heard a pitiful whining just beside her, looking down she realized that Cristiano had already cleared out the platter and was whimpering from hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Sir, it isn\u2019t over yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply placed the empty platter on the floor and quickly took a second one from a nearby trolley, starting once again to push more food into Cristiano, as he began to fall into his eating trance once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched from afar, through one of many hidden cameras he had placed in the room. He spied on Cristiano, watching as he kept on eating and growing fatter. It had been already a week since they returned from the Resort, and yet the player had never said anything against the deluge of goodies that everyone around him kept pushing on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled wickedly at the thought that soon the player was going to be shamed publicly and, as soon as he was going to be left alone, He could swoop him up and do with him as he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick licked his lips as he imagined the massively obese Cristiano slowly roasting in a pan, prepared just as if he was a Thanksgiving turkey. Yet, the obese soccer player could still grow more and so he brought those thoughts back into the deepest part of his mind. As he resumed watching Cristiano standing up and preparing himself for the, almost only, exercise he kept on doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing, while kept upright with the help of the two nurses, Cristiano looked even bigger than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had softened to the point that his cheeks seemed to be stuffed with small balls, his three chins were almost constantly jiggling, as a fourth one began to make its appearance. His moobs, huge globular sack of fat, fell blobbily on his chest, slowly moving to either side of him, pushed away by his ever-growing gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a belly it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDivided in three belly rolls, it truly was an apron of a gut, covering his man part and, lately, starting to reach for his knees. His belly button was deep and wide, it could almost suck two fingers within itself. His hips had also grown wider, other than fatter, forcing him to waddle slowly to avoid, as much as possible, to chafing his thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Cristiano had truly reached a new level of obesity and Podrick saw confirmation in this when he checked the scale hidden inside the bed through the laptop he was using within his private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u20186-8-4 \u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix hundred eighty-four pounds of ex soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt his head spinning as he read that three-digit number. Cristiano, world known soccer player had grown past six hundred pounds of fat in one month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, James had had to use chemicals and stimulants to push him further and further but, still\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the guy didn\u2019t seem to notice. Well, also that wasn\u2019t true. Cristiano had tried to fight back but, thanks to his ill placed faith in him and the constant onslaught of food, any thoughts of going back had simply disappeared. And thus, the New Cristiano had been created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn always hungry eating machine, which passed more than twenty hours, each day, stuffing his mouth even though he wasn\u2019t aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n James decided to close his laptop and join the nurses into Cristiano\u2019s room as he saw that the player was going to enter the simulation to start his exercise session for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick entered the room he was greeted with the magnificent sight of Cristiano as he tried to place his titanic ass on the small-ish seat of the simulator. As the player realized that his coach was there, he tried to turn toward him, while still being hand-fed by his nurses, only to find himself stuck inside the simulator cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cristiano, already up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesh Coach *ulp*! I wanted\u2026to practish\u2026shome more\u2026before going\u2026to breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good but, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re still on rest, so don\u2019t push yourself too much. If you don\u2019t feel up to it, just let it go for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026really\u2026think\u2026so\u2026Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Cristiano. It never pays to over-exert yourself. You might end up hurting yourself even worse.<br>\r\nC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go back to bed. Take a break for today and tomorrow you will practice some more. Rest up and load up on energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano burped quite loudly as his body continued to process and digest the massive amount of food it already contained, trying to make room for what more was coming.  And yet he smiled at the thought of taking it easy with his practice sessions. He always felt tired and utterly spent of energies after his practice on the simulator, but he couldn\u2019t realize that in truth it was his own body that was making him so tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his atrophied muscles, and all that fat on his body, it was already a miracle he could still waddle, albeit slowly, but for James it wasn\u2019t enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano had to become an immobile blob of a man before becoming his meal. And yet, the thought of seeing a barely mobile Cristiano, wearing his way too small soccer suit as he moved slowly on a soccer field, under the silent stare of thousands, made James shiver in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was that the correct course of action? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Cristiano was still able to move, he still could be saved. While if he was to be fattened up to immobility, the chances of him recovering were very slim. But to lose the chance to utterly humiliate him and disgrace him in front of thousands of witnesses was very alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a Cannibal Coach to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day, as Cristiano was waking up and beginning his daily activities, he saw his coach enter the room with a huge smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo\u2026Coach\u2026what\u2019s\u2026the good\u2026news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames simply smiled even more as he quickly ordered the two nurses around to help Cristiano stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Cristiano. I just got news from our sponsors that you\u2019ve been selected to try a new kind of fitness therapy. Thanks to this therapy, so they say, your recovery should speed up way faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrsitiano smiled weakly at the news, only the mentioning of any kind of physical activity was unconsciously treated as a bad news from the overfed soccer player. Still, for his coach to be this excited it had to be something so, he simply nodded and, helped by his nurses, he slowly followed Podrick toward the bathroom in his room. Once there, he saw that the jacuzzi pool wasn\u2019t actually filled with water, but with some yellowish liquid which, in truth, caused his own belly to rumble hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is...that...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, Cristiano, is melted butter. Apparently, it should help relax and reinvigorate your body. As per the new therapy that you\u2019ve got to follow, you\u2019ll have to have at the very least two immersions each day. Don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m sure you will love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t seem as excited as James was but, with nothing to lose he moved his body toward the pool and slowly entered it, until only his head was breaking the surface. As a few minutes passed by, he began to feel nice in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe melted butter was kinda greasy but, its warmth was doing wonder to help relax the ex-soccer player. As he sat in the pool he didn\u2019t seem to realize that he alone was almost occupying the entire pool and, before he could muster any thoughts, his nurses came to him carrying with them a funnel, some small kegs of beer and several trolley\u2019s worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Sir, as your Coach instructed, we will proceed with the new therapy plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per instruction received, as you dip and relax, we will provide you with booze and food, the first will help you reach a deeper sense of calm, the second will be part of your new diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cristiano could say anything the two nurses had placed a tube into his mouth and, through the funnel, they began pouring liters of beer inside of the obese soccer player. He, from his side, couldn\u2019t do much but sit back, relax and swallow, and so he did. After a while though, Cristiano felt the tube between his lips being taken away, as his two nurses moved closer, bringing him the food for his new diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed his blubbery gut with slow circular movements, starting to enjoy the feeling of all that butter surrounding him, he saw that the first platter they brought to his lips was a huge triple decker burger, with lots of sauce and fried bacon. That burger was so greasy that already a small pool of it was starting to accumulate on the platter but, for Cristiano nothing mattered but to have that within himself in the shortest time possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost two hours the nurses continued to feed Cristiano with greasy food and beer, until they noticed that the level of melted butter in the pool had drastically reduced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the two helped Cristiano get out of the jacuzzi and, still dripping buttery goodness, they brough him toward a large massage bed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Sir. Please to lie down here so that we can provide you with a nice massage. Afterward, we will move to your bed so you can rest a bit before having your daily exercise regimen into the simulator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, absentmindedly licking his own fingers, simply did as he was asked and soon found himself in a new kind of paradise. As he lay on the bed, one of his two nurses massaged him slowly but forcefully, kneading every inch of his fattened body, while the other brought to him even more snacks and food for him to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, Sir, you need to load up all the energies you can muster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano felt in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his still sensitive skin being massaged and the delicious sweets that he was eating he honestly felt at his best. Still, for one moment, he began to wonder why he was eating so much but, it was nothing but a fleeting thought, soon swept away by the avalanche of delicious goods passing within his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, feeling full to bursting, Cristiano was slowly moved from the bathroom toward his room and, in the fifteen minutes he needed to change room, he began to feel himself grow hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that he had eaten all morning, he just felt his stomach rumble hungrily, demanding sustenance. Food had become his staple and the absence of it something that his body feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nurses smiled between themselves and, without even asking, they began once more to push more and more goodies into Cristiano\u2019s mouth. He greedily accepted everything that was given him, it didn\u2019t matter anymore about his \u2018illness\u2019 nor the thought of his needing to load up energies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate because there was food within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as James realized that Cristiano was stopping to care about his surrounding a wicked smile twisted his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Between the new Therapy and the constant feeding, if I can get to have Cristiano forget about anything but eating, then he will be one step closer to being ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost seems a shame to be so close to my objective but, I\u2019m also excited to know how tasty he will be as soon as he reach the ton mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t take long at this rate\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, Cristiano began to have his therapy baths two times each day, along with the beer drinking, food stuffing and body massage. As good as he was feeling he simply stopped caring about everything else, all that mattered was to reach that heavenly feeling and to have his gut full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick closely followed Cristiano as he plunged deeper and deeper into the gluttony abyss, as he forced him to have each meal bigger and more fattening than the last. Between those and the buttery baths, Cristiano seemed to balloon even faster, adding to his body another two hundred pounds in less than a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one fateful morning, almost two months since meeting with Podrick,\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two more months had passed, and Cristiano had done nothing more than eat and sleep, while taking the occasional butter bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick couldn\u2019t have been prouder of how big and fat the once soccer player had become. The guy was now almost completely immobile, he could barely stand, and only with someone\u2019s help. The once soccer player was already beginning to lose his own human shape, growing more and more like a small blubbery mountain. His arms had grown so large that were roughly the size of another person thighs, and his legs were even bigger. His whole body was beginning to overtake all his legs, when seated, leaving out of this belly apron his blown-out feet\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to be capable of ruining the momentum that Cristiano had reached but, alas, something did happen. On a fateful morning Cristiano had just finished having his buttery bath, and was now enjoying the feeding/massage session with his girls when, out of nowhere, as James passed in front of him, the hugely obese player blurted out something that made James feel a cold chill behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Coach\u2026was\u2026wondering. Can...I meet\u2026my girl\u2026one of\u2026these days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, unable to give a proper answer right back, took time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t give a clear answer and was glad when the nurses started again to feed Cristiano, shutting him up for the moment. Still here was an issue as big as a house\u2026better yet, as big as Cristiano! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the Company, the rest of the world knew that Cristiano Ronaldo was in a sort of break, nobody knew what had really befallen him but, how could James prevent Georgina Rodriguez to reveal the truth to the world? He had only one possibility.  <br>\r\nCristiano was going to meet his girl\u2026but she wasn\u2019t going to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had thought long and hard on this and finally, as he was surfing the net, an idea came to his mind. What if Cristiano could meet someone that seemed to be the exact copy of his fianc\u00e9e, but wasn\u2019t really her? There were risks, no doubt about that but, there didn\u2019t seem to be much of a choice. Quickly James began to contact people from the shady part of the deep web, handsomely paying in advance for a certain product that would allow him to play the role of a certain someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he paid quite a hefty sum to have the product finished in the shortest time, a month still had to pass before the product was finally within his hands. As James observed the item he had just received, a wicked grin appeared on his face. With this he could take two doves with one stone. It was an oversized VR device and, along with it, came a nice little DVD package containing the installer for the custom-made software requested by Podrick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter toying a bit with both the VR and the software, James felt confident enough to bring the good news to his soon-to-be overfed meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James entered the room, he clearly saw that Cristiano was starting to grow restless. Although being constantly fed with a deluge of treats and sweets, there was animosity on his swollen face. James could see the anger growing within the ex-player as he munched harshly on whatever bit of food he had in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Urrff!* Yeah\u2026Coach? What do\u2026you want\u2026now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wanted to thank you for your patience. I may have figured out a way for you to meet with your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the ultra-obese began to distend himself, letting go of the anger he was nurturing within himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026Coach? But\u2026you said\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was James turn to make everything believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said that you couldn\u2019t meet her in here, since nobody has to know about your condition. In fact the Company would react harshly if I was to ask for something as foolish as to invite someone in here, when everything is done in secrecy to keep you hidden. <br>\r\nBut, with time and a little bit of\u2026ehm\u2026grease in the right places\u2026 I may have found a solution to this problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to jiggle in excitement, although he managed to move for barely a minute before stopping, feeling himself tired and void of any energies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026Feel\u2026there is\u2026a but\u2026somewhere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, Cristiano, there is one. You shall not be able to meet her in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, through some friends I may have smuggled something from outside to here and to your fianc\u00e9e house. Something that will enable the two of you to be in contact, even though only visually, with one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that James showed to Cristiano the VR device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, Cristiano, is a last generation full immersion headset. With it, one can go and meet someone in a previously prepared setting. Basically, while in a room like this one you could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2026finally meet\u2026Georgina!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! As I\u2019ve said, though, it would still be a connection through internet but, thanks to this headset, you\u2019ll be able to experience almost any sensation while using it. Sense of smell, of taste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026is so\u2026Cool! Thanks\u2026Man! It\u2019s a\u2026shame\u2026I cannot\u2026meet her\u2026 face to face\u2026. but\u2026How\u2026Can I\u2026repay you\u2026for all\u2026these\u2026troubles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour happiness and confidence in me are all the gifts I may ever want. Trust in me, Cristiano.<br>\r\nIf you\u2019ve got a problem\u2026I will find a solution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames brought the device to Cristiano, helping him to wear it as he explained to him how to make it work and letting him know that his girlfriend had been already instructed on how to use it. All Cristiano had to do was to call and wait for her response. Ronaldo smiled as he grabbed the strange looking helmet and put it on, but his smile grew wider when he turned the machine on and found himself in this 3D recreation of the same room he was in. Although he couldn\u2019t see his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in front of him he realized that a form was beginning to appear, grinning excitedly he slowly saw the form of his fianc\u00e9e appear right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Georgina? Is it really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled as she watched him, bringing a finger to her lips, as she bit slowly her nail while smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am, Baby. I was getting worried about you. But then this Podrick guy contacted me and\u2026Wow! We\u2019re finally together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl said so she launched herself at Cristiano, which in turn hugged her back and felt her body against his own, felt her perfume in his nostrils. She was there, with him! True, they weren\u2019t physically there but, feeling as he was in that moment, he couldn\u2019t care less about reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Georgina\u2026I\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Cristiano jiggled to and fro on his bed, carefully watched by his two nurses, James was sitting comfortably in his own private room, as he checked and clicked on his personal computer. On the screen he could see the avatar of Cristiano and, at the bottom of the screen, whatever he was saying at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes\u2026This has been a marvelous idea. Not only that fool thinks to really be with his girlfriend, but I could even use Georgina\u2019s to push him even more into the abyss of gluttony! All I must do is to keep using this Georgina model to trick Cristiano and soon I could have him do whatever I wish\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, I could even force him to\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If they want to keep things quiet it must be that they\u2019re afraid of something so, don\u2019t go against them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t, Georgie\u2026for you, anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano sat on the verge of the illusionary bed, in the holographic room he was in, while keeping within his arms his fianc\u00e9e, completely unaware that the person he was talking to was, in truth, James Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, babe, I must say that you\u2019re looking terrific. Whatever they\u2019re doing to you is making wonders on your body\u2026I wonder what would happen if you asked to intensify your treatment\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to feel excited, it wasn\u2019t often that Georgina came onto him like that so he quickly nodded to her proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u201d he stammered a little \u201cI\u2019ll see what can be done but, are you sure about that, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, love. Whatever it is, you seem to be way more buff than you ever were\u2026If things keep going this way I\u2019ll have trouble not to think about you\u2026all day long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cristiano finally ended his session on the VR he felt hot and bothered, he would have loved to be able to stay with Georgina in real life but, he knew, that it wasn\u2019t yet possible. Still, thanks to his wonderful coach he at least, could see her occasionally and that was good enough. As he placed the visor on the bed, he soon found himself once more to what his life had become. Him eating as girls at his side fawned around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he kept on eating, he tried to look at himself and, although he couldn\u2019t see much, he seemed to convince himself that what Georgina had told of him had to be true. He truly seemed to have been growing bigger (and in his deluded mind buffer) than before. And yet, the proposition of his fianc\u00e9e had taken root in his mind and when he saw Podrick coming to see him he broached the subject to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Coach\u2026 Was\u2026wondering,\u2026 the\u2026therapy\u2026and\u2026all\u2026seem\u2026 to\u2026 be \u2026 going\u2026great, but\u2026maybe\u2026we\u2026could\u2026enhance\u2026 it\u2026a \u2026bit\u2026more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Podrick, who had just entered the room, had been waiting for that request for a long time. It had been two long weeks of him impersonating Georgina until he managed to convince Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, he had managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he had to maintain his image and so he adopted for a dubious glance toward the massive man, almost completely paralyzed on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnhance it? Mmm\u2026I don\u2019t know, Cristiano. I don\u2019t make the rules here. <br>\r\nI just bring you what the Management has agreed upon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026yet\u2026if\u2026I\u2026was\u2026to\u2026increase\u2026the\u2026pace\u2026wouldn\u2019t\u2026I\u2026 heal\u2026faster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s true. But are you sure about that Cristiano? If we increase the pace, you will have less time to spend with\u2026 you know who.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026I\u2026know\u2026that. Still\u2026I\u2026guess\u2026could\u2026be\u2026better\u2026for\u2026me\u2026and\u2026my\u2026career. Please\u2026Coach\u2026I\u2026feel\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026gotta\u2026do\u2026all\u2026I\u2026can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll ask for them to produce an enhanced plan for your recovery. I\u2019ll let you know by tomorrow morning what they decided to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days James gleefully watched as Cristiano went under a drastic change in his daily schedule. <br>\r\nHis rest times were cut by half and substituted with intensified feeding sessions of the \u201chealth bars\u201d sludge he was growing addicted to. Moreover, it was included into his mealtimes a special feeding session in which he was instructed to consume a double lunch meal in a liquefied format. This not only meant that he could ingest more calories than usual, but also that his overfed, apron like, belly would absorb the nutrients at a faster pace than before, forcing him to feel his hunger grow again sooner than before. The liquid diet, also, had the exceptional advantage that didn\u2019t seem to tire him out, since he had only to swallow without any chewing from his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a week passed with the enhanced diet and Cristiano already began to grow steadily fatter from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf before he had seemed to slow down in his gains, with the new regimen he pushed himself out of the plateau and began to grow bigger and larger once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could barely restrain himself watching the ex-soccer player inflate with food and fat, as more time passed, it was getting harder and harder for him to not show his own desire to prepare Cristiano as his own meal. Often he found himself caressing the bloated and/or stuffed form of the player, massaging his belly rolls and playing with his belly fat as he imagined him ready to be placed in a roasting pan. Other times he found himself all over the guy as he was passed out from his eating, hugging as much as he could of the man body wishing only to sink in his fat and sleep there. Yet, everytime it happened he managed to recover himself before Cristiano could notice him doing and so, without arousing any suspicion. Yet, it was becoming increasingly hard to just watch the fattening of the soccer player without any of his participation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano, instead, was pushing himself more and more to increase his own mass, still delusional about what effect that diet was really having on his body. No matter how hard he found it, he constantly pushed himself to consume always more than the day before. In his mind were engraved the words of his fianc\u00e9e, which wanted him to grow bigger and stronger than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this objective in his mind it wasn\u2019t long before he\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the food that Cristiano was being fed with and all the addictive chemicals he was taking, it wasn\u2019t really a surprise for Podrick when he realized that having Cristiano satisfied from his huger was a nearly impossible task. From the beginning James had done all he could to maximize the soccer player laziness and gluttony and he finally had managed it. The problem now was to try and keep Cristiano satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a problem he hadn\u2019t imagined before, and yet, between the liquid meals and the constant assistance from the two girls, everything seemed to be feasible. Cristiano itself had started growing once more, growing bigger than ever, even losing his normal humanoid shape in the process. The ex-player in fact had begun growing so fast that his body couldn\u2019t really keep up. Apart from his head, which had also softened, the rest of his body seemed to be growing fatter every minute, giving him a blobby and flabby appearance. Already his head had begun drowning in a sea of flabby chins, as his body grew wider and larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moobs, for example, had grown hugely, spread apart on to each side of him they touched the ground near his bed, with aureole\u2019s as big as platters. His belly then cascaded down onto him, covering almost all his body, with only his swollen feet emerging barely from under it. That tent like gut also stood proud and high, divided in four large belly rolls, since it was becoming difficult to have it filled up. Finally, his hips and ass, there the gain had also been astonishing, giving to the ultra-obese player cheeks so much filled with fat that any kind of movement sent them into a jiggling frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew it was almost time to finish it with Cristiano and yet, he postponed it, thinking that maybe he could grow some more before reaching his final size. What he didn\u2019t know was that all this delay was going to present him, soon, with a difficult choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, as James was busy impersonating Georgina and fawning over the still over-confident Cristiano through the VR internet connection, the door to Cristiano\u2019s room opened as someone entered slowly, as to not disturb the ill player. This person, though his intentions had been all in the right places, didn\u2019t realize of the dangers he was exposing himself to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as he stepped inside, he initially saw only a couple of hot girls dressed as maids, a strange looking machine in the middle of the room and a rather large bed completely covered in a huge mass of some kind of gelatinous brown-ish thing. Perplexed, the person turned around and verifying that he was indeed in the right room, he realized with a start, that there was a large hose connected into the jelly-like mass, pumping who knows what inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, after a few seconds, he also realized that the hose wasn\u2019t only pumping that thing up\u2026it was also that thig that was gulping down whatever substance the hose was bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization forced his troubled mind to really see what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brownish mass, so jiggly and flabby, was in truth a human being. Someone so hugely fattened that had completely lost any resemblance to a normal human shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since he was in the room of the soccer player under the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the one who had fell ill long time before, it was rather quickly that he realized who that human being was, even though it was unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cristiano\u2026!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the person shouted that name, Podrick was forced to close the connection hastily with Ronaldo, hastily making up some excuses with his Georgina character, and hurried through his bedroom door to the main room where Cristiano was, realizing that someone had just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the guy he didn\u2019t recognized him immediately, James had bigger problems than that. He had now to figure out a way to keep the intruder mouth shut, while keeping the news of the fat Cristiano from being spread around. In truth there were a few methods to do that, and hastily he acted toward them as he approached the guy from behind and knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the intruder fell to the floor unconscious, James had finally time to see who it was and, based on that, on how to keep him quiet\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As James realized that it was another quite famous soccer payer that had intruded on Cristiano sanctuary, he knew that he had a very limited choice of option in dealing with him. The most obvious, and the most satisfactory for him, was to force the new guest to stay there with them, to be fattened just like Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only a few problems with that plan. First he had to figure out why the guy had come and for which reason he was in the building. Then he also had to make sure that he had contacts in high enough places to cover for the disappearance of the new soccer player. Swiftly he began to pace around the room while making calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun had begun to set on the horizon James had finally managed to solve most of the situation. Thanks to some blackmailing and to the calling of old debts, he had managed to make it so that Sergio Aguero would be considered infected with the same illness of Cristiano, forcing him so to remain there along with the other player to try and cure himself. Always under James guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also managed to find out why the guy was roaming in their building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player had heard of Cristiano illness and had wanted to visit to just comfort the player. James almost laughed out loud at the ingenuity of his new guest. Yet, there was one last problem that had to be solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready with Cristiano in his current condition there was barely space to move around, if James were to add another player, the room wouldn\u2019t surely be enough. So it was time for renovations since they couldn\u2019t move Cristiano from where he was, due to his huge size. Was it expensive? Yes, but the company that James contacted was renowned for their capacity of keeping a secret so, not one of the workers that came to bring down one of the walls, to  merge Cristiano\u2019s room with the following one, said anything as they worked in record time to provide the enlargement requested by Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than three days, James\u2019s Sanctuary was now large enough to host two people of Cristiano size and, since Cristiano did nothing but being stuffed with his gain shake, there was room and time to take care of Sergio Aguero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player, woke up rather groggily feeling as if he hadn\u2019t had a single drop of water and/or food in the last few days, which was actually true since James had been forced to keep him pharmacologically sedated. But now that he was awake, he blearily looked around trying to figure out where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing he remembered was seeing a hugely mass of jiggly jelly which, at the time, he had thought to be Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to get his bearing, he realized he was strapped down to a bed, unable to move. Just as he was going to scream for help, he saw a figure approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Why am I strapped to this bed? Where are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Aguero. I\u2019 deeply sorry of having to make your acquaintance in this way but we had no other choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames spoke with a grave tone in his voice, trying to make it sound as if something very wrong had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to explain things to you calmly but first, you need to have something to drink. I\u2019ve been given this serum which will provide your body with the basic nutrients needed for a fast recovery\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that he moved, closer to Aguero, an unmarked container with a straw emerging from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio began slowly to suck from the straw, accelerating his pace as soon as the liquid passed on his taste buds. James smiled within himself, please to see that yet another player trusted him completely just because he had the face of a simple man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was true that the shake was full of nutrients, it also had some of the chemicals he had used to facilitate the fattening of Cristiano. As Aguero kept drinking, Podrick continued to explain the situation to the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, as you probably know Cristiano Ronaldo has fallen prey to a strange illness which had forced him to retire from the scene. What you probably didn\u2019t know is that this malady is also mildly infective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was chosen to take care of him due to my immunity to the illness but, as you entered in contact with him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Aguero, which had quite rapidly consumed all the content of the provided container, began to close his eyes, already knowing what the guy in front of him was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince the encounter, you have been tested and the results indicate you\u2019re positive to the illness. I\u2019m truly sorry but, you must remain here and follow the treatment as we try to have you avoid the same fate of Cristiano.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then, seeing as Aguero had begun to lick his lips quite often, while being completely unaware of the slight rounding out of his stomach, rapidly offered him another unmarked container, this time filled with a home-made gain-shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, sir. Have some more of it. Doctors told me you may have a craving for it at first...it should pass in a couple of days...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, still unable to move began drinking once more, stopping only once to ask a question to James, before returning to his drinking, still unaware of the effects that drinking all of that gain shake was going to have on his athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. So, who are you and what\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m James Podrick, former coach of Cristiano and now his caretaker. You\u2019re in a wing of the quarantined area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here on out you\u2019ll be staying here following the treatment that the higher up decided for you to follow. One thing I can guarantee you is that you won\u2019t have any contact with the outside world, since nobody has to know about this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick continued to speak, Sergio assumed a more relaxed stance, as the intense hunger he had felt in the pit of his stomach was getting abated by whatever he was drinking. Still he began to grow worried once more when he heard James talking about the loss of contact from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026*hurff*\u2026What do you mean? I...*urp* whew...that stuff sure is good...But, you mean I can\u2019t contact ...my family while I\u2019m here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but any contact is denied. Your family will be informed by the company legal representative.<br>\r\nNow, if everything is clear I\u2019m going to untie you but I reiterate. You\u2019ll have to follow what they tell me to have you follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days, Sergio was able to stand freely in his room, although he couldn\u2019t leave it, not even to talk with his fellow player Ronaldo. That was bothering him but what troubled him the most was that he had still cravings for that strane shake thing he had been offered when he woke up. Not that it tasted bad, the problem was the opposite. As he drank it he felt like he could keep drinking it for months, and that scared him a little. True Podrick had warned about that but, lately, he was finding hiself wishing to always have more of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t make any sense to him that he wanted more of that thing, since he was feeling well but, as his caretake had said to him once \u201cThe issue is that also Cristiano said the same some time ago. At that time the company didn\u2019t press the issue\u2026and now you\u2019ve seen the results.\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, although it made him mad that he had to abandon his vegan lifestyle, he kept drinking that shake, even though he noticed that, somehow, instead of reducing the quantities, they seemed to be giving him always more than the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, as he was secretly spying his new guest through hidden cameras, could only smile as he saw the player dig into the new  oversized pitcher of Gain-Shake that one of the maids had brought upon him. If with Cristiano he had to be pushy and force the player to follow the \u2018Diet\u2019, with Aguero things were easier. After all, Sergio didn\u2019t want to share the same fate of Cristiano and so complied immediately. Probably they could pass him the full gallon size of gain shake before placing him on the fattening diet that forced Cristiano to stay in bed all the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had only to decide what to do with his new test subject\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For that reason, he began to pass his days laying on the bed, watching television and doing not much else.  As James saw that the guy had started to relax, he knew it was the perfect time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith four days of permanence in the quarantined area, James entered the room where Aguero was staying, he kept a grave expression to let him understand that the situation was dire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr.Aguero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player was currently laying on the bed, watching a tv show, but he turned the TV off and moved his gaze on his caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? And call me Sergio, please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Sergio, I\u2019ve just received new directives regarding your stay here and the illness you\u2019ve found yourself subjected to. Basically, the Medical division has given me a plan that you\u2019ve got to be following with extreme precision. I\u2019m truly sorry about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAguero didn\u2019t say anything for a log while then, suddenly he burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Man! I\u2019m not dead yet. You\u2019re just too serious\u2026What is it? They already have taken me out of any exercise. This is basically a vacation\u2026so, no worries man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the player took the meal plan that James was bringing him, his expression first seemed shocked, then seemed to be growing angry and finally showed simply acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they want me to follow his massive diet, uh? Well, what to do\u2026If that\u2019s what they want.<br>\r\nI\u2019ll just lose the extra weight as soon as I\u2019m out of here. No point in wasting time, bring it on and I\u2019ll chow it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that morning Aguero began to follow the massive meal plan that Podrick had brought to him, starting to eat almost constantly throughout the day. At first the guy seemed to show a little of resistance but, after a few meals, he simply began to lay back and accept whatever it was brought to him. Podrick couldn\u2019t believe how easy it seemed to be. Even now, as he was watching Aguero going through his third breakfast, devouring it with a voraciousness that he had never seen before, the guy kept eating without a single complaint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when his belly began to bloat outward, over the shorts he was wearing, he didn\u2019t voice a single peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the following days the situation remained unchanged, Sergio Aguero kept swallowing whatever they brought him and, naturally, his body began to absorb all those calories turning them into fat. Already Podrick could see that Sergio\u2019s body definition was faltering, his six pack had melted away, substituted with a small potbelly, with related love handles that pooled out on his shorts, giving him a little muffin top. His legs had also lost definition already, as his arms did as well. Yet, for some reason, what seemed to be growing at an outstanding speed were his moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, they were practically nonexistent, as it normally is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as more and more calories were pushed inside his system they seemed to be growing out at an outstanding speed. Already, with Sergio losing his muscles and replacing them with jiggly fat, his moobs seemed to have reached a size between the A and the B cup. Aguero though didn\u2019t seem to be noticing it. In fact, apart from following the \u2018Diet\u2019 he didn\u2019t seem to be recognizing much else. As a test, James, brought to him a double portion of his current meal, a pre-first lunch snack, which meant that instead of two Baconators meals with related fries and two slices of apple pies, he was currently bringing him four of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Sergio seemed to simply lick hi lips as he assaulted the trays of food, gorging like a starving beast on the food. James noticed that he was starting to eat a bit more messily than usual, uncaring toward where globs of sauce were ending to, as long as more food went into his maw. And yet, the footballer, managed to consume everything up to the last fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo\u2026man. This is good. Really good *urp*\u2026So, they\u2019re upping the portions now? <br>\r\nS\u2019good\u2026s\u2019good\u2026was getting mildly hungry lately. *belch*\u2026And we can\u2019t have that\u2026can we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat James couldn\u2019t know was that Sergio Aguero had reached a conclusion in all that story, between his illness and the massive diet he had to follow. They wanted him to slow down. Maybe he had been going too fast on his conquests on the field, or maybe his prices were too high. Still They wanted him to get down and be a humbler player. That had to be the reason for all that scene about the illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was still scared of what happened to Cristiano Ronaldo but, he was sure that something like that couldn\u2019t happen to him. After all, all he had to do was to follow their diet and become what they wanted him to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can stop whenever I want. They haven\u2019t hooked me with their lies, I won\u2019t fall easily into their trap.</i>\u2019 He thought smugly, although a second thought snaked into his mind, unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Still it\u2019s all so good\u2026I wonder if I could get some more to munch on\u2026am starting to feel quite hungry again\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, in truth was began to get worried. It was way too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be something that he could do to verify why the player was so willingly accepting that treatment. Although he could just forget about it and push even more food onto him. Still he had to come up with something later, for now he had to meet Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick changed room, going into the one now occupied by Cristiano Ronaldo, he remained, once again, mesmerized by the size of the ex-footballer. Cristiano had lost all contact with the human world, becoming a huge amorphous mass of fat which had still similarities with a distorted human figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head, now definitively sunken beneath a cone of blubbery chins, was hidden from view, unless James went up a ladder to see things from above of the fleshy fat wall that his chins had formed. His shoulders didn\u2019t exist anymore, merged into a sea of fat which ended with his fattened finger emerging barely from the overlapping fat of his arms. Everything else was hidden behind the hugely mass of his ultra-fattened belly. It covered everything from his torso down. Even his feet were submerged, and the girls in charge of cleaning him out had to wear breathing mask when they had to go under it. It was too risky otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, between the constant feeding and the VR headset, Cristiano was blissfully unaware of anything. Sure, he had to wear it 24 hours a day, now, for t was the only way he could still be able to talk, but James didn\u2019t care. He was so happy with the astounding size of him that he truly wasn\u2019t sure if it was worthy to transform all that jiggly beauty into a meal\u2026or if it was better to let it grow more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after admiring that work of art, feeling his inside grow fuller and fatter every minute, James returned to the sums of his issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, If Sergio was so willing to eat more, who was he to stop him, especially since it served his scope? OR maybe it was better be careful and see what Aguero was thinking before going all out on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cristiano\u2026Turn him into a most delicious meal or not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Push Aguero to his limits, uncaring for the reason behind his willingness James starts to up his portions day after day, wanting to have a bigger Sergio, as quickly as possible. Cristiano sadly has reached his potential and need to be dealt with, also with the space freed James could find someone else to share te space with Sergio. Fattening two footballers at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 Investigate on Sergio, go at him through hypnosis and find out why he\u2019s so willing. While he\u2019s under hypnosis James could always make him see something, he shouldn\u2019t be able to see anymore. Take care of Cristiano, turn him into a vast reserve of ready to be consumed meals, maybe they could become so good to be addictive for James? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Push both players to consume even more. Let Sergio mingle with Cristiano, let him understand what his future is going to look like, maybe Aguero will show some fight then, when he realize he\u2019s truly trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 Or maybe something else entirely, maybe someone else finally decided to break through the quarantine zone and find out why great Footballers are vanishing so suddenly. Someone might have noticed, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Writer\u2019s choice\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been so focused on her career that she had a nearly mental breakdown and, with her husband away filming a movie in New Zealand, she had needed to just rest somewhere while doing absolutely nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, even though she had warned her collaborators of her break, people kept calling and disturbing her relentlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this could not go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Therefore, I was calling, Frank. I can\u2019t go on like this. You\u2019re my manager, what do you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Angie. The answer is easy. Hire a personal assistant to take care of this load from you. If you want, I know someone who could fill this spot easily\u2026or, as I know you like to do charity for the third world countries, I\u2019ve heard of a new agency born in west Africa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongo, I believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard around that they\u2019re good and trying to get their name known worldwide. Anyway, give me five and I\u2019ll send you both the CV\u2019s of my contacts and the agency internet site so you can check and decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina mulled it over for a couple of hours, she quickly scanned the CV of the person forwarded by her Manager, but she was fascinated by the idea of helping out to an African agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she went and checked their site and remained very surprised in finding out how professional and prepared they seemed to be. As she scanned their site, she saw exactly how the process would start.<br>\r\nShe was to provide details on the job and the location, then the agency would forward a selection of their employees selected exactly to her specification, for her to choose which one she would prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself getting excited she quickly filled out the requester form, providing as much information as she could, finding herself quite surprised when a chat-box opened informing her than an operator was going to contact her right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Miss Jolie. I\u2019m Joao Cumbu, your referral for the purpose of hiring one of ours employees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, Angelina began typing away on her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Mr. Cumbu. I actually wasn\u2019t expecting such an immediate response.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, it\u2019s our pledge to be of service to those who are in need, especially considering your case. With how much you\u2019ve done for our countries how could we not give you our best?<br>\r\nNo, Miss, it\u2019s an honor to serve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the discussion progressed, Angelina began to have a better understanding on how things were going to work out and, a few minutes later, she was already checking the CV\u2019s they had sent to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one was a middle-aged man, named Felipe Mbutu. He seemed to be quite a big guy, almost seven feet tall with a quite impressive amount of muscles on his body. He was supposed to be able to speak three languages, including English and French, and apparently was a masterful Chef with a degree taken in an institute in France.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond one was also a male, quite young-ish. From his picture, Joao Kingstone, seemed quite the sly guy. While not as broad as the one before him he still seemed to be quite toned. Also, he was able to speak three languages, including English and Portuguese, and while he was able to cook, he wasn\u2019t a real chef. But he had under his special characteristics section marked himself as a fitness therapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast one was a girl, Felicia Joao Macunda. She appeared like a thirty-something, bubbly, little thing, staring at the camera with a happy smile on her face.  As the other two she also was an expert in the latest software and had mastered the English language, but she also had remarkably good organizational and household\u2019s managerial skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina checked their CV\u2019s her eyes fell once more on the list of names provided to her by her Manager, wondering if she should try with this agency or if maybe could be better to ask Frank to find someone capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the Headquarters of the Agency Angelina was in contact with, Joao Cumbu was giving the news to his staff members, with a smile plastered to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood News everyone! We may have a new Client that will bring fame and fortune to our Tribe and Company!<br>\r\nAs of now, the world-renowned actress Angelina Jolie is taking into consideration to hire some of our brightest to help her as personal assistant. Now, it was decided that three of you had to be chosen as candidates and, while it was difficult, the Elders reached a decision\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all the employees stood from their chairs, turned toward their Manager and Tribe Leader, a total silence fell into the room, until it was broken by Cumbu who announced the three chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe Mbutu! As a Shaman for our tribe you are the most competent in the culinary skills, so if she chooses to have you, it will be your duty to fatten her up to epic proportion so to let our Tribe able to feast on her bounties for months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoao Kingstone! As our Lead Hunter who better than you to feign innocence and get her to do whatever you wish? And don\u2019t worry about food. America is one of the most fattening places on earth, all considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, but not the least, our beloved Felicia Macunda!<br>\r\nYou, have always acted as our bait to lure the foolish into our hands, letting them feel comfortable around you as you fed them to immobility and beyond. Do the Teeth Gnasher Tribe proud, child, and bring back to us enough Angelina to have an endless feast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina then decided to hire\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had already been briefed on his duties, both officially and unofficially, all that remained was to meet the employer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting between them went on cordially, from the start Angelina requested to keep things informal and throughout the day she began pouring on Felipe all the information needed for him to perform his duties. In all that time Felipe made up a show for Angelina, to show her his capabilities leaving her impressed regarding her new hired assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Felipe. You sure are something else. You\u2019ve done a terrific job today. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to serve one such as you. You\u2019ve helped my people a lot in the past, it feels right to help you back. On this note, I was wondering if I could prepare you dinner? Just to show you how much I appreciate working here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, feeling rather embarrassed, couldn\u2019t do much more than nod, and so as she remained sprawled on the couch, watching her television, Felipe was busying himself around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going to be on the menu, tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Miss. I\u2019m going to show you a taste of Africa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh yes. You\u2019ll see Angelina. Not for nothing I\u2019m the shaman of my tribe. Nobody knows as much as me about herbs and spices. I\u2019ll make you a meal that will place you right where I want you to be.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, we find Angelina asleep on her couch while the television keeps on babbling about. She\u2019s enjoying the peaceful rest and, somewhat ruefully, she wakes up hearing the voice of her assistant calling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Miss, dinner\u2019s ready. Miss\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...What time is it? Oh, Felipe? It\u2019s already time for dinner? You should have woken me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss was sleeping so peacefully; I couldn\u2019t force myself to wake her up before everything was ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she rose from the couch and walked toward the dining room, but upon entering the room she stood on the doorway speechless. On the table there wasn\u2019t, literally, an inch of free space that wasn\u2019t occupied by some plate or dish prepared by her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026F-Felipe? Did you invite an army for dinner? That is way too much food only for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t mean to prepare this much but, I wanted to thank you for the chance you\u2019re giving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, appreciating the gesture, the actress sat at the table, inviting her assistant to join her, as she still looked dumbfounded at the quantity of food spread out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026From which dish we should start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let me, Miss. Here, this is a typical stew from the ancestors of the south of Africa. It is prepared with various cuts of meat, potatoes, onions and some banana\u2019s peels\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept going in describing the recipe, he also poured a substantial amount in Angelina\u2019s plate, adding in the end a bit of spice he had with himself, making sure that the actress wasn\u2019t watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina tried the stew her expression changed. A smile a mile wide appeared on her face, as she began to consume eagerly the stew, feeling as it spread a pleasurable heat within her body. Even though it wasn\u2019t a small portion, the actress polished it off in a matter of minutes as she began to let her hungry star wander around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, you could try some of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said moving a plate with a perfectly cooked steak and some roasted onions toward the actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one has been prepared through an old family recipe. After preparing the steak, before placing it on the stove to be cooked, you let it rest a few minutes within some palm trees bark, letting the aroma from the tree bark to flow into the meat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following hour Angelina found herself unable to stop eating. Everything tasted so good that she couldn\u2019t stop, even if she wanted to. Still, even though lots of food was still on the table, as soon as Felipe judged that the actress was nearly full, he intervened and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Is getting late\u2026Since tomorrow will be a busy day wouldn\u2019t be best if\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress stopped herself just as she was grabbing some more bread buns from the table and, gulping down her bite, she let out a small giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Felipe. Still, all my compliments. Everything was perfect. If it isn\u2019t too much trouble, would you mind\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman grinned wickedly as he nodded to the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. It will be my pleasure to prepare all of your meals if that is your wish...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026everything tasted divine\u2026If I weren\u2019t so full, I may still have something else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman smiled inwardly, thinking back to the spice he had used. It was a rare combination of herbs that in the tribe was often used to help their meals to willingly fatten themselves up. Not only was it odorless and tasteless, but it was highly addictive, and it also acted as a slight hunger enhancement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe chuckled within himself as he saw Angelina Jolie walk away from the dining room cradling her stuffed belly, and he couldn't stop himself from imagining how would she look like a few months in the future if he could manage to plan all of her meals and daily activities.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felipe first day started quite early, as he began following Angelina around, informing her and taking notes every time a change of plan or a new business meeting appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning progressed Felipe had several calls, following with all the persons who wanted to submit a request for Angelina to take in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe took notices of them all, making sure to clarify that from that point on all communications had to pass through him, otherwise would be immediately rejected. As he kept updating his own appointment calendar, he already began to sort out those offer he was going to downplay and those he wanted to have Angelina take in consideration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was sorting them out, he noticed a missed appointment from the last month and decided to investigate upon it. Quickly he found out it was a meeting request coming from a consortium made of the major Fast Food Companies trying to hire Angelina as a spokesperson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Felipe saw an opportunity and began taking steps to correct the situation, as he called the number used as reference.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Felipe Mbutu, Miss Jolie Personal Assistant. As I was checking through her schedule, I noticed an invitation to a meeting bearing this number. Could I have some more information, for I believe there has been some miscommunication issue in this regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Uh-uh\u2026Oh, I see. Yes, there must have been some misunderstanding from my predecessor part. No, no, I\u2019m sure Miss Jolie will be quite interested in this proposition, especially if some of the points indicated in the circular here are placed under a major focus.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUh-uh\u2026Yes\u2026Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I mean. Correct, also, if I may be so bold, I would suppose there could be some more incentives included for Miss Jolie. No, nothing as petty as more money but, maybe, something that could also be\u2026let\u2019s call it \u2018free publicity\u2019 for your employers Companies as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yes, exactly. I see we understand each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no compensation is needed, nor wanted, on my part. I\u2019m just trying to perform my job in giving the most lucrative while most relaxing opportunities to my employer. Yes, I shall inform her the soonest. Have a nice day, will call you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe hung up a new plan was hatching in his mind, one that would help him speed up the growth of Miss Jolie under his care. In addition to that, as they stopped for lunch, he didn\u2019t have to pry too much in having Angelina decide to have lunch at McDonald. And that alone was a small, victory for his plans as he wanted to start promoting the job offer, he had discovered only that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered in the McDonald, they both sat at a booth, ordering up as per their own tastes. Felipe ordering a medium sized meal, while Angelina decided on a very small meal consisting mostly of a Caesar salad. As they slowly ate Felipe decided to broach the matter of the new job offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Angelina, as I was checking your appointments to fit in your weekly schedule I noticed a job proposal coming from a Consortium of Fast Food dealers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph\u2026Not so fond of those. Still, it can\u2019t hurt to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, their offer surely has to be checked in detail but, as far as they anticipated they were asking for your presence to join in a few commercials for some of their affiliates. Apparently it won\u2019t be a long job but it should bring good profits\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot inter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, they were talking about some fund raising to improve sensibility toward third country nations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026that is new. Did they say anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she asked for more info, she didn\u2019t realize Felipe had moved his fries toward her and was watching with glee as she begun eating them one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually they mentioned quite the offer but, before proceeding with any details I thought it was best to have your confirmation. Also, comparing this offer to other, while less popular, it surely seems less tiring and more adapt to a more conservative plan long term.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true I wanted to have a break from all activities, but it also is true that I can\u2019t completely go sitting on laurels.<br>\r\nAlright, take contact with their representative and start the discussion with them, be sure that they\u2019ll have to proceed with that fund raising and be aware that I won\u2019t work for less than\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, more and more snacks passed from Felipe\u2019s hand to Angelina\u2019s stomach, without her recognizing how much she was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, when they returned to the mansion, Angelina did notice that she appeared to be somewhat bloated. Fortunately, she dismissed the thought as she decided for a quick shower before going to the gym for her daily exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, although sorry of seeing her burn all those calories he had forced onto her during the day, didn\u2019t do anything to prevent her, knowing full well that in a few weeks her schedule was going to change completely. After-all, he now had to contact the Fast Food Consortium and had to use all of his negotiation skills to obtain as much as he could, while having Miss Jolie do the less work as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Angelina emerged from her shower after a long workout session in her private gym, as she dressed in a pair of short shorts and a t-shirt she moved toward the dining room where she found Felipe applying the finishing touches to the table already covered with a few platters from which a delicious aroma emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe, I can\u2019t thank you enough. Not only you\u2019re taking care of my schedule but you also are cooking for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure, Miss. Now, sit and enjoy, I will gladly serve you dinner, as I will tell you what job offers I have received today for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat, Angelina soon fell prey once more to the delicate, and yet delicious, plates that he had prepared for her. As good as they were she found herself enthralled with them, taking no notice of how much she was actually eating. Also, she was only half hearing as he talked to her about the various job offering, letting him decide which he thought would be best for her. As dinner was reaching the end and only dessert remained, he decided to make his move toward the only offer he thought was best for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and so, Miss Angelina, there is the offer from the Consortium we received this morning. In the afternoon I went in detail on their offer and tried to get as much as possible without appearing grabby. In the end, we agreed on a certain set of conditions which are already into the draft of contract I will give you, all toward having you to be their spokesperson for twenty-four months, while having to do no less than three short commercials and a few photoshoots for them in the span of two years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve agreed on these terms considering your desire to keep yourself active, while having also time for your own relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, her mind clouded with food, nodded slowly as she happily dug in the pie slice Felipe had given her while talking. But even though she was engrossed in her dessert she had to admit to herself that he had done a really good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterall, it was her directive to have a less tiring role in the foreseeable future and so this job offering seemed good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about\u2026*gulp*\u2026the fund raising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that. It took a while but I managed to have it confirmed and also, if you\u2019re ok with it, I managed to fit something else in it too. Basically, for every product you, or yours, will be purchasing from the affiliates of the Consortium, an amount calculated on a certain percentage will be included in the fund raising so to increase its actual value exponentially, while your own expenses will be covered by the Consortium itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026*munch*\u2026If I understood correctly, I buy from them with their money, and they will increase the fund raiser by a fixed amount? That is great. Although I don\u2019t know if I would have to buy so much from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut even a small amount would be beneficial to the fund. Plus, just think of how much the fund itself could grow with your free contributions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, having finished the slice, began to tiredly nodding to the proposal, giving her written confirmation to the contract by signing it as she began to rise from the table cradling her, once more, stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Felipe question if she wanted to review it herself she simply answered that with the excellent job he had done she was sure there was nothing to re-check. Saying her good night to him she began walking toward her bedroom, when she was stopped by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? I\u2019ve noticed that you may feel quite\u2026bloated. If you need I can prepare you an herbal tea that will solve that issue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Felipe. That would be a godsend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will come right away then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe prepared the tea, he had only to decide which effect he wanted to achieve with it. He could prepare a Tea that would slow down her metabolism, making her sluggish and more prone to laziness, or maybe he could mix a few spices and herbs and have her hunger grow steadily stronger as well as enabling her to eat more and more in one sitting. Or maybe he could prepare a drink that would make her body more receptive toward fat, making her gain weight way more easily. Or, to play it safe, he could simply make her a soothing tea to help her feeling better.<br>\r\nSo many choices\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Angelina went to sleep, with the herbal Tea in her belly, she quickly fell asleep feeling better already, unaware that her own body chemistry was going to change severely in the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days passed, a routine began to establish itself in Angelina\u2019s Mansion. <br>\r\nFrom morning to evening, she and Felipe would go through their daily appointments. With him checking and screening them from her eyes, making sure that the following weeks and months were as work free as possible, while Angelina began to rest more and more, enjoying the break in her life. However, as she rested all day long, taking a liking to Felipe\u2019s Tea, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that her meals and her snacking sessions kept increasing both in frequency and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days of this trend, as lunchtime approached, she stopped Felipe from making one of his meals, asking him a favor instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe, I\u2019m feeling quite puckish today, could you please order me something from one of the affiliate from the Consortium? This way I get also to increase the fund raising, won\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. So, what should I order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know\u2026How about a\u2026no; make it two medium sized Big Whooper meals. With fries and soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for dessert\u2026mmh\u2026could you prepare me some of those brownies you made a few days ago? They were really yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. Also, don\u2019t forget to have your tea before Lunch, so to increase the soothing effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream to forget it. Since I started drinking your Tea, it seems I haven\u2019t had any other stomach pain. Thanks Felipe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina returned to her break on her couch, Felipe quickly went into the kitchen heating up a few platter of his famed chocolate brownies, made from extra chocolate with the addition of being extremely addictive. As the brownies were heating up, he also ordered the requested food except, he didn\u2019t order medium sized as it was requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and please, could you supersize it all? Why, thank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe wasn\u2019t taking any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that most of her appointments were over, by having most of them screened out through Angelina\u2019s food addled decisions, he could focus on having Angelina start relaxing more and more. Sure, he couldn\u2019t yet go all out on her since she still had to have a presentable figure to show for the McDonald commercials. But if he managed to train her to eat more, to stop exercising and to avoid detecting her own gains, he would be in a very good position to have her reach the first milestone of five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still a long way away but he could do it. <br>\r\nHe was certain of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to take out the first two platter of twenty-four brownies from the oven, he heard the doorbell ringing. Knowing it had to be the delivery guy he swiftly went to door and collected the goods from the guy, quickly bringing them to Angelina which accepted the load without any fuss, focused as she was on the soap opera on screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stood motionless, watching as she gave the first bite to the big hamburger, chewing it slowly, as a low moan of satisfaction escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2026I so needed this\u2026I swear, I must be working out too much. I\u2019m always craving food\u2026gotta have to slow down a bit from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe heard that, he felt like he was going to heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, thing first, though. He had to bring her the brownies and had to organize as soon as possible the commercial shoot, so after that he could completely focus on fattening her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to Angelina he almost gasped in delight in seeing her chewing fries by the handful, as her belly began to stick out from under the tight t-shirt she was wearing, and yet she kept shoveling those oily treats into her mouth, as she kept watching the tv show. As he saw this, Felipe, went and called his contact from the Consortium, hastily reserving a spot for Angelina the following day to take the commercial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, the two of them spent the entire morning and most of the afternoon at the designated location for Angelina\u2019s commercial of McDonald and their food. Due to the urgency of the request, they barely stopped for lunch but also this worked as an advantage for Felipe\u2019s plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as soon as they were back at the mansion, as Angelina was feeling starving, she didn\u2019t comment on having Felipe preparing her dinner while also ordering out some Chinese takeout. As he prepared a plentiful dinner, he listened attentively to the sound coming from the TV room where Angelina was now parked watching her favorite show, while scarfing down some Chinese food. As soon as he heard her stop, he quickly moved to her side, enjoying the view of the beached Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was laying on her couch, more asleep than awake, as she unconsciously caressed her taut stomach, which seemed to be glowing under the lights coming from the TV. Felipe almost shrieked in joy as he realized that his Mistress was laying there with her shorts unbuttoned as her belly requested more room that she had available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Miss, everything ok?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, still half asleep murmured contently as she heard his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026just resting a bit\u2026feel so tired\u2026worked too much today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe knew that apart from a few lines said in the commercial and a few photos taken she hadn\u2019t done that much but, why he should have pointed it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Miss but, see it this way. Now the next event you\u2019re requested to participate in will be in a month. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh\u2026good.<br>\r\nFelipe? When dinner will be ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably an hour or so. Do you need anything?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I should go for a workout but I feel so drained, so tired\u2026do you have anything that could \u2018pick me up\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled widely as he bowed slightly, she had just eaten a small sized Chinese dinner and yet she was asking for something more. It was a good opportunity to test the capacity of her stomach after she had used it for almost two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could prepare you a bit of a Health shake, to give you a small boost of energy, if you desire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Felipe, do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the man returned to Angelina, bringing with him a pitcher full of a dense pink shake, leaving it near his Mistress, with a straw emerging from it so she could simply drink it without having to move an inch. As he saw Angelina began drinking from it, smiling as she did, he couldn\u2019t refrain from thinking back at what was inside the \u2018Health Shake\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Heavy cream, sugar, powdered vanilla, six spoonsful of a bulk-up powder and a pinch of my herbal hunger mix. I wonder if she will be able to finish it and have dinner also\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina felt like she was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drank the energy shake Felipe had prepared for her, she felt a soothing heat spreading throughout her body. Still laying on her couch she drank fervently the shake, enjoying the taste of it, without noticing that her belly began to poke more and more from under her t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there, mesmerized by the TV show, suddenly waking up when she heard the sound from her straw as it scraped against the now empty pitcher bottom. Stifling a burp, she rose from the couch, feeling her pants a little snug against her body as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t connect that feeling to all the food she had consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she could recollect from her, so tiring, day she hadn\u2019t eaten all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Probably it just shrank in the washing machine.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn\u2019t want to be seen in a tight-fitting pants, even though she was in the privacy of her own home. But, as she entered the hallway, she smelled the delicious aromas coming from the kitchen and was torn between the desire of going in there to have a bit of appetizer and the need to go change herself in more comfortable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the best thing to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as she was in her room, she quickly stripped off her clothes, although she found some difficulty in taking off her t-shirt and for a moment, she stood in front of her mirror looking at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that her abs seemed less definite, while her body overall seemed slightly thicker than she used to remember but, in the end, she dismissed such thoughts. Her belly was just bloated, and she probably was too tired to be able to see such slight differences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once, she thought back to all those junk food meals and snacks she had in the previous days, or about the long dinners Felipe had prepared for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything simply was dismissed from her mind as she just grabbed a pair of somewhat larger sweatpants and roomy sweatshirt, putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling now comfortable, she left her room and went to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crossed the hallway, smelling the aromas coming from the dining room, she felt her belly grumble in anticipation and so she moved a little bit faster, arriving just in time to see Felipe placing a dessert plate on the table, motioning her to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, since you\u2019ve had such a hard day, I prepared a slightly more filling dinner. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Felipe, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, If you don\u2019t mind\u2026Now that your weekly schedule is more malleable, I was thinking if you would like for me to plan your daily activities, so to match the rest you so much desire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, as she filled her plate with a couple of portions from the pan of lasagna he had prepared, simply nodded starting to wolf down the heavy and rich dish, moaning in pleasure at the amazing taste exploding in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph\u2026*gulp*\u2026oh yeah, Felipe. Please to do that. This way I will be able to rest completely at peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Miss. Will start working on it right this evening and will try to bring it to you tomorrow morning. <br>\r\nHow is the lasagna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s perfect. Such a taste\u2026No wonder you\u2019re a masterful chef.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thanks Miss. But try also the veal, I prepared this sauce to go along with it that should have made the meat to almost melt in your mouth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal progressed, Felipe was happy to verify that Angelina\u2019s consumptions had increased greatly. Even though she had already eaten a small dinner and a large pitcher of heavy cream shake, she also ate most of what he had prepared for her for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Angelina kept on eating, bite after bite, morsel after morsel, without noticing how her own belly was bloating up from all the food she was scarfing down.<br>\r\nSure, it was hidden within the sweatshirt but, still he could see the faint outline of it as it grew with every portion she consumed. Alas, although her hunger had been strengthened in the past weeks, she eventually reached the point of fullness as she had just scarfed down a third helping of dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u2026*urp*\u2026ohh\u2026that was\u2026so good, Felipe. I\u2019ve never been so content in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it Miss. Could I offer you something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026No, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even some chocolate cookies to have as a small snack to go along with your after-dinner tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t\u2026oh, alright. But just a small plate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled, as he handed her the 1-liter bottle of his herbal tea, along with a bowl chocked full of chocolate cookies, which he had prepared personally, adding way more butter to the batter than needed. And he smiled even more as he saw Angelina take the bowl without a fuss regarding the size of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had her all for himself, he was surely going to let her grow as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, from her side, went directly to bed; snuggling under the cover as she started the plasma screen TV she had mounted on the wall. As she did some zapping, she began chugging down the tea she had started to love, feeling it soothing her overburdened stomach. Yet, after a few minutes, she laid in bed she felt herself compelled in trying a cookie from the bowl Felipe had given to her. As she tasted the first one, she was immediately hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are so Good! Goodness, they\u2019re so soft and yet so tasty. Mmmm\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept eating the cookies, she began unconsciously to caress her bloated belly with her free hand, easing the tightness she was feeling there. And yet, she couldn\u2019t refrain from having more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the bowl was half-full she began to drowsily lay back in her bed, feeling completely sated and satisfied, as she was lulled to sleep by the television that was still on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, the television was still on and left on a specific channel that, without her knowledge, was going to influence her through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe channel it was left on was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, as Angelina slept, the channel she had left on was giving a marathon of all episodes from the series \u2018Man Vs Food\u2019 and, unconsciously, as the actress slept so her dreams and her mind were influenced by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll night long, she dreamed about finding herself in these strange eating-places, having huge portions of deliciously prepared meals, feeling their taste in her mouth as they filled her belly. And although she dreamt of these massive meals, in her dreams she never gained an ounce. She just ate and ate with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning rolled on, Angelina woke up feeling strangely ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered about dreaming something spectacular, but she couldn\u2019t put the finger on what it had been so good. Yet, as her belly growled once more, she rose from her bed and began to take off her PJ\u2019s while wearing a spandex outfit that hugged her figure well, while also having a small pre-breakfast with the few handfuls of cookies that had been left in the bowl she had the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she freshened herself up, she left her room and found Felipe hard at work in the kitchen, while a place at the table was already prepared for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Miss, I hope you\u2019ve rested well tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I had a few good dreams tonight and am feeling refreshed and ready for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Also, I prepared a little bit of breakfast for you, to start the day in the right swing and your daily schedule, if you want to give it a check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina nodded silently as she began reading the schedule while, at the same time, she began eating the breakfast Felipe had prepared her. For starters she assaulted a large bowl chocked full of dense chocolate cream, having spoonful after spoonful to her lips, moaning silently as the taste enveloped her. As she cleaned the bowl, she didn\u2019t stop there, grabbing the nearer plate and revealing a large stack of cluffy pancakes smothered in butter and drowned in syrup. Once more, the taste surrounded her and, without even noticing, she cleared the plate in a record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept clearing plate after plate, she also checked the schedule Felipe had prepared her but didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Sure, there were a lot of rest times and snack times in it, but as she was distracted by the onslaught of food in front of her, she dismissed the issue, focusing only on what she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally cleaned her third plate, mostly cookies and some pop-tarts, she burped lightly and looked toward Felipe with a strange glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhi, Felipe\u2026Could you do me a favor?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss. What do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you prepare, for next time, some slightly bigger portions? I\u2019m feeling still quite hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss. So, can I offer you something more? I was just preparing some brownies for later but I can give you some, if you need it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina didn\u2019t reply she simply cleaned her mouth and eagerly awaited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes later, she was happily eating away at her first dozen of brownies, as the second and third dozen was placed right beside her by an enthusiastic Felipe. As the day progressed, the actress didn\u2019t move from the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, eating away at whatever concoction Felipe urged onto her, uncaring of her own belly, which began to grow more and more round as food kept being shoveled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress was in heaven, she wasn\u2019t exactly hungry but, the food was so good she just couldn\u2019t stop shoveling it down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was that as much as she wanted to stop, every time Felipe left a new platter beside her she just couldn\u2019t stop herself from having some of it\u2026and then some became all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlate after plate, she kept eating away all morning long, as breakfast food like pancakes and fried bacon, became snacks like small cakes and pastries, until it almost arrived lunch time and so Felipe began giving her burgers and fries. With an all morning and lunch feast, it is comprehensible to say that by 2 PM, Angelina was at her very own limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed beyond her wildest dream she simply lay there on her chair, a mountain of empty plates surrounding her, and her own belly so big and round that, she could start using it as her own table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe watched her with pride in his eyes. She had performed so well, all it was needed was a bit of hunger enhancement in her food and she had eaten up to exhaustion. Yet, he couldn\u2019t afford to let her see how much she had really eaten. Therefore, while she slept and digested in her food coma, he quickly cleaned most of her dirty plates, leaving just a couple around her. This way, when she woke up, he could convince her to have been eating only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, nothing could prepare him to what he was going to hear as soon as she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was preparing some more food, just in case she requested something else when Angelina suddenly woke up from her slumber. She tiredly stretched a little bit, feeling some tightness in her clothes but dismissing it as a more powerful desire forced its way through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe? Do you know how much did I exercise today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026quite a lot actually. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Mmm\u2026I\u2019m just so hungry\u2026 I want...No, I need you to order me some takeout\u2026and could you give me something to tide me over until it arrives? I was thinking Mexican or even Chinese\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled as he joked, \u201cWhy not having both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile disappeared when the actress smiled drunkenly as she answered \u201cWhy not, indeed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been an exhausting week for Felipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what happened, his hunger enhancement herbs hadn\u2019t ever caused such an effect, so he was raking his brain for something that could explain the different behavior in Angelina. She had acted as if starving all week long, always eating up to her bursting point. He wanted so bad to feel proud of her but, in truth, he was worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had grown slowly, she would have had the time to grow accustomed to eating massive meals. But that sudden spike in hunger could very well cause her to realize how big she was getting and disrupt everything he had worked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time for breakfast rolled in, Felipe began preparing a large sized breakfast for his Mistress, keeping ready seconds in case she was still that hungry. Eventually he heard her footsteps coming from the hallway and greeted her gently as she appeared at the doorway, even though he had faltered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina surely had grown in her hunger fueled week of feastings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felipe had arrived in the US Angelina was roughly around the 140/150 pounds of nicely distributed weight, but after their first week together and the last week of complete gluttony she seemed to have jumped right up to the 200 pounds range. As she walked toward the kitchen table Felipe could see the muffin top and soon-to-be-gut appearing from over the short shorts she was wearing, as also her sweater shirt failed to cover it from above. Her ass too seemed to have absorbed a lot of damage, growing plushier and wider, and it jiggled slightly at her every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Felipe\u2026I feel so tired lately\u2026am also quite hungry for some reason\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss, You\u2019re working out so harshly in the last few weeks, it\u2019s only natural to feel tired and hungry.<br>\r\nDon\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina sat, feeling strangely more comfortable on her chair, staring at the spread of food on the table she smiled at her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Felipe\u2026you\u2019re a godsend. Still, if you see me overwork myself remember to stop me\u2026Also that is part of your job. You\u2019ve gotta help me keep track of what I am doing. So, if you see me go away from the weekly schedule, let me know at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe could hardly contain himself, not only she seemed to have returned to normal, but she also told him to stop her if she was over-exerting herself. That was a huge advantage for his quest to have the actress fattening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, Miss. And, if I may, you should start right away with breakfast, otherwise you will be late for you tanning session late this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina licked her lips as she grabbed a large twinkie from the table, diving it into one of the large shakes in front of her, before chomping on it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you start right away. That\u2019s *munch* good Felipe. Mh\u2026Delicious\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress then began mowing down all plates in front of her, clearing out pancakes smothered in butter and syrup, fried bacon strips and even a couple of quite large slices of devil\u2019s food cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!* Oh, sorry\u2026t\u2019was so good\u2026everything\u2026tasted divine, Felipe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Miss, I\u2019m happy you enjoyed it. Now, it\u2019s time for you tanning session. I\u2019ll come help you out in two hours\u2026in the meantime, here, have a little shake to give you a boost of energies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, even though had just cleaned out enough breakfast food for a family of three, gladly accepted the heavy weight gain shake, as she began drinking from it with gusto. As she made her way toward the tanning room, her ass and hips seemed to swell slightly larger, as well as her belly that was rounding out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the tanning room Angelina quickly undressed herself and began to lay on the tanning bed, when she noticed that right where the headrest was, there was a strange straw awaiting her. Quickly scanning the room she realized it had to be an innovation from Felipe and, as she sucked a couple of times from it she moaned in pleasure feeling the same shake she had just consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued she moved closer and noticed a note left on the wall, right above the point from where the \u2018straw\u2019 came out of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Miss Angelina, <br>\r\nI\u2019ve prepared a little something should you get tired as you tan yourself.<br>\r\nEnjoy.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress smiled as she, unknowingly, caressed her bloated belly. Still she soon laid on her tanning bed and, straw between her lips, began to enjoy the delicious shake as she lay there. She couldn\u2019t know that all that shake she was drinking down was going to add way more than a few pounds on her body. After half an hour, she already was filling out, as he body worked overspeed to store all the calories it was receiving as fat. Her whole form began to slowly bloat up and fill out, her ass growing larger and more jiggly as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the wall, Felipe worked hard and long to constantly refill the barrel of gain shake from which Angelina was drinking while tanning. It was hard work for him, but he knew it was necessary to let her grow accustomed to having more and more calories pumped in her system until it became the new normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he could focus on making her even lazier and hungrier, making so that her new normal was going to seem only a pittance of what she needed to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He had only to keep feeding her as much as he could\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angelina Jolie began to lose track of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she followed the plan that her assistant prepared for her she soon found herself often spacing out in front of a television screen, either watching some soaps or playing a few games he had suggested her to try. More often than not, during these times, she also had quite a bit to eat. It was easy actually, as she simply sat there watching, listening or playing, she would just grab a handful of candies, or some chocolates left lying around and brought them into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste soon began to be the only thing she would remember of those sessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer working out time seemed also to be reduced more and more as the weeks passed on. Felipe often chided her for stressing out too much on it, even though she had felt to be doing it only for few minutes. Still, he had hired him just for that and so, when he called her, she stopped what she was doing and resumed the weekly schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMealtimes instead had seemed to be occupying most of her time. <br>\r\nLonger breakfast, lunches and dinners became soon the usual, and when she got used to them a lot of snacking times seemed to pop up everywhere. Still Angelina could see that everything was having a beneficial effect on her, all things considered. She was surely more relaxed and laid back than ever, she barely cared about what was going on outside her apartment and her working schedule had been equally forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe had said to her once, \u2018Why worry about a job that is only stress inducing? You have more than enough to live comfortably until the end of times. It is so cruel to just lay back and rest?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized it wasn\u2019t and had to thanks only Felipe for that. Still, there were sometimes situations that seemed to awake her from her relaxing stance. That morning, as example, three weeks after her first tanning session with Felipe\u2019s shake, she had just woken up and rapidly consumed her pre-breakfast fit for five people all by herself. As she swallowed down the last morsel of fried bacon, she began to dress herself, which was becoming a chore lately, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began by sitting on her bed and grabbing the sweatpants that she usually used. These were a bit tight the week before, but she hadn\u2019t really taken notice of it. Sure, she had felt them getting tighter but, since food was often presented to her right after that her concentration slipped and she focused on the tasty morsels presented to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that morning she placed first one foot and then the other inside the pants, then she began to lift them up but notice that, right after the knee, the pants did seem to meet some resistance. Thanks to her three weeks of unbridled gluttony, Angelina had gained quite a big amount already, including also the spices used by Felipe to boost even more her own capacity and hunger, it wasn\u2019t hard to see how easily she had gained weight. Still, Angelina, heaved harder and harder trying to fit a pair of pants three sizes too small on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBewildered, she did let go the pants and, slowly, managed to stand up on her own. For a moment she looked at herself through a mirror. She noticed that her face seemed less squared and more rounded up, as her arms also seemed fluffier ad with a hint of jiggle in them. Then she looked at her middle, where once she had a definite slim belly, now there was only a large gut protruding forward. Curiously she grabbed the last belly roll and lifted it, noticing that even her undies seemed to have started becoming tighter on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned around and saw her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile always appeared on her face when she saw it iggle at her every movement, as if she was admiring a nice plumped ass, and not the huge, fat filled, monstrosity she had. Turning a little bit more, she realized that something seemed to have been placed there and, with a quick manual check she realized it was the herbal tea container shehad thought of having lost from her morning breakfast. Not even for a moment she though f having an ass so large that it was a shelf by it own presence. She simply grabbed it and emptied it i her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had to dress\u2026or did she? Since nothing seemed to fit, except a large t-shirt she had started using as pajama, due to her maid doing the worst laundry ever, she simply decided to go down into the kitchen as she was. After all, Felipe didn\u2019t seem to mind.  As she moved she realized also that by walking normally her thighs began to rub against the other, with a low growl she simply spread her legs apart and began to waddle, without realizing she actually was waddling. As Angelia reached the kitchen she saw Felipe already at work, greeting her and starting with what had become their daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Felipe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to start a new day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Felipe motioned her to come over, noticing how she had become to waddle, pointing to a usual spot on the floor where a scale had been placed a few weeks ago. Angelina then would simply walk upon it and Felipe was to warn her for any fluctuation in her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there, waiting in silence, she couldn\u2019t refrain herself from licking her lips from time to time. After almost a month of constantly snacking it was difficult for her to pass the time without eating anything. Seeing that, Felipe swiftly passed her a pan of freshly made brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss. You might start with this before proceeding with your first breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs The once lithe actress gulped down the sweet confectionaries, Felipe checked her weight, smiling widely in seeing her in her almost naked glory. He had no worries about her being able to see the scale, her globular belly was big enough to cover it completely from her point f view. As she kneeled he was happy to mark in his own notepad that she had gained another four pounds since the day before, bringing her to a rather hefty two hundred and eighty six pounds. As he stood up, taking the now empty pan from her hands, he was glad to announce her that she hadn\u2019t loss, nor gained anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026There is a minor fluctuation but we\u2019re talking of grams\u2026so no need to worry about that, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina could only smile I appreciation. It had been a condition she had placed before following his schedule and was glad it was working. This way she could see immediately if she was relaxing too much or not. Still, with that taken care she quickly took place at her usual spot, covering two chairs with her own ass, and swiftly tied a rather large napkin at her neck, preparing herself for her first breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Felipe, began to provide her with several huge portions of breakfast food, from muffins, to pancakes, from donuts to pies, from slice of cakes to tubs of ice cream. Angelina happily ate at her leisure, feeling the pleasurable weight of all that food in her growing belly. As several plates were being cleared, Felipe gave her the herbal tea she had grown used to drink every time she finished a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hadn\u2019t realized that a few minutes after having drank that her hunger returned. Still, as she cleared her twelfth plate of food, she finally laid back, caressing her stomach soothingly feeling it under her fingers quite soft and squishy. After no more than fifteen minutes, as she felt her hunger returning to her, Felipe told her it was time for her second breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile she began to dig in once more, uncaring toward the fact that her over-sized shirt had become to feel a little bit tight on her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, she slowly rose from there and began the slow waddle, made even more slow due to all the food she had consumed, until she reached her next stop for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once there she sat down, feeling her bloated idle slap heavily against her thighs and began to watch the soaps to which she had grown addicted to. Felipe had sai that they were a good way to defuse stress but she had never imagined she could actually end loving them to that point. As she sat there, legs spread widely to give her belly room to breathe, she once more felt herself growing peckish. Not for a moment she thought that her third breakfast had ended less than twenty minutes before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply was getting hungry again. Luckily for her Felipe ha arranged the schedule by himself and knew when the Actress would start feeling hungry and when she was going to be full, so, just as Angelina was thinking of calling for a snack, here arrived Felipe carrying a couple of trolley with himself. At first he simply began to stuff Angelina\u2019s mouth with food, almost forcing her to swallow hot dogs and chicken nuggets, but then, as she appeared temporarily satisfied he simply began to surround her figure with more and more plates of junk food. Huge, greasy hamburgers, oversized hot dogs, Deep fried chicken in carton buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe moved back since he loved seeing this scene, it was something that everyday repeated. One of the few constants of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he saw Angelina\u2019s hand move along the goods surrounding her, stopping near one of the nearest plate and grabbing one of the huge triple hamburger he had left at her side. Then, the hand grabbed it and lifted it, bringing it to her mouth where she passed the next few minutes biting, chewing it and swallow it, until the hand was empty and moved back to search for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as he enjoyed watching he wanted to try something. True, she was capable of feeding herself, when in this state but, what would have happened if it was him providing her with food, letting her hands rest down, so she wouldn\u2019t move a single muscle in her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he wanted to enjoy the view of the fattened Angelina from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering his courage, he approached her just as her hand was moving again toward a new bowl, stopping her from finishing the move. Then, as he felt her pitiful attempt to get free from his hold he whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss, let me help you with that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina didn\u2019t reply but, her hand fell softly within his hold and she nodded slowly so Felipe moved swiftly beside the growing behemoth and brought to her lips, making sure to not obscure her vision, another of those large hamburgers. He kept it there, against her lips, letting her have half of it in her mouth, before biting on it and starting to chew it. He then kept it close there, waiting for her to swallow, and in the meantime, he used his free hand to feel her growing belly. As he heard her gulping down her mouthful, he quickly directed the rest of the burger toward her lips, as he stood there mesmerized by her mouth as she took the other half of the bread within her lips. Still, his free had didn\u2019t stop, it kept rubbing and grabbing, playing with her luscious, and growing, belly, as it hang over her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This process repeated itself for the entire two hours of the show, and Felipe was relentless in providing more and more food to Angelina, even when she tried to show some restraint, as if feeling herself reaching again her fullness point, and yet with delicious food placed right under her nose and in front of her lips she couldn\u2019t resist but start once more eating. Still, as the show ended, Felipe quickly moved away, letting the actress to return in herself finding, as it had now become the norm, herself stuffed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMm\u2026Oh hey Felipe\u2026Guess I got distracted by the show\u2026everything is alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is, Miss Angelina. We still have half an hour before first lunch, if you want to refresh yourself or have a quick nap\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, loudly yawning, brought her jiggly arms in the air, until she just placed herself back on the couch, feeling that a quick nap was going to be just the perfect choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah..I think a nap does sounds good. Please, wake me up when Lunch is ready\u2026I don\u2019t want to fall behind the schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe bowed and left her sleeping, as he confirmed that he was going to wake her up in time. As he returned to the kitchen, to verify how the food was coming along, he couldn\u2019t yet stop remembering the feeling of all that soft, squishy, fat under his fingers as he had played with her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he checked the various pan and called one more to the various food delivery he had contacted for lunch, he also took out a phone he hadn\u2019t touch since arriving in the US and began to make a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Felipe Mbutu on the line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the phone he heard the voice of his Tribe Chief asking him for an update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s coming along nicely. Soon we will hit the big three. By year\u2019s end I count she could be ready to be transported home. There we\u2019ll just have to let her grow some more and then she would be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing some minor comments and his praises, the Tribe chief hung up the call and Felipe returned to his pans. Soon, though, he heard the doorbell ring and sent one of the aids in the house to go and collect the food. And few minutes later a whole lot of junk food lay on the kitchen table, ready to be consumed. As he applied his finishing touches to the lunch of Angelina, mainly adding spices that were going to boost her consumption and the caloric absorption, he checked the time and went to collect Angelina, waking her up and helping her waddle to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there he stood his ground watching as the woman that had hired him almost a month before, began once more to eat an ungodly amount of food, clearing out pans of lasagna, rows of greasy hamburgers, buckets of fried chicken, all by herself, before stopping feeling her hugely bloated belly weighing her down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, Felipe\u2026Everything you make is so good. I swear, I could grow so Fat if it wasn\u2019t you who prepared these dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, still seating on her two chairs, kept caressing her bloated middle as she spoke to her trusty aide who swiftly offered her the herbal tea, she was so fond of. Felipe, sensing an opportunity, proceeded in giving her directly the jug of tea, instead of offering her the cup filled with it. The actress didn\u2019t seem to mind as she simply grabbed the jug and emptied it in one, long, sitting. Few minutes later as she was still enjoying the sensation of her full stomach, she felt herself growing hungry once more. Used now to this effect, she simply reasoned that the diet on which Felipe had placed her was working normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026*urp*\u2026Felipe, it time for second lunch, already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is, Miss. Please, enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn\u2019t wait more than few moments before she was digging again through the mountain of junk food he had brought under her eyes. She felt her hunger as it seemed to be much more demanding than usual but, she didn\u2019t put too much thought into that, until she heard her bra snapping out from under her oversized shirt. Only then she stopped for a moment and turned an enquiring glance toward Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026Have you noticed, perhaps, about a shortage of my clothes lately? I mean they seems to be shrinking every week lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant had already thought about that and was prepared for such an eventuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t want to disturb you unnecessarily but, yes. It had caught my attention. The person in charge of your laundry has been already punished severely for her mistakes. I\u2019m confident it won\u2019t repeat again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress nodded, making her double chin jiggle for a moment, as she grabbed an entire apple pie from the table, biting through it with a ravenousness she didn\u2019t know to possess. As she munched on it she still turned toward her aide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026I was\u2026thinking\u2026that\u2026*munch*\u2026as long as\u2026 I don\u2019t go out\u2026I can still\u2026*gulp*\u2026 just stay in my pj\u2019s. I think it would be much more comfortable for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Miss Angelina. I will be glad to inform the maid about this decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026\u201d From the on, for the following two hours, Angelina kept on stuffing food down her throat, if she had been more in herself she would have asked herself how cold she possibly keep on eating after a full morning of nothing but that. Unfortunately, the constant gorging had left her blind to almost anything, excluding food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stood there smiling and, occasionally, helping her out when a baked treat she wanted was out of her reach. Her shirt, soon, began to rip at the seams as her belly kept growing more and more stuffed but, it was only in the early afternoon when she stopped eating and moved back to her couch to enjoy a post-meal nap. Felipe, once more followed her, enjoying the view of his, soon to be, titanic mistress, sleeping so deeply she didn\u2019t wake up when he jostled her body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe quickly glanced at the clock, it was almost the 3 PM, and in two hours or less, she was going to have her first mid afternoon snack. He just had to keep adding the spices needed to boost her appetite and her body calorie absorption ratio and in a few months she could become an unstoppable eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as he stood there admiring her ample, jiggling forms, he didn\u2019t notice that the phone was ringing and by that distraction something could potentially disrupt his plan\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As evening came, Felipe went to check the stock in the larder, to make sure that he had everything needed to prepare the scrumptious meals for Angelina, when he noticed that the door for the larder was slightly ajar. Silently, he moved closer to the door and peered inside. As he did so he saw Carmencita, one of the maids in the household, peering inside several boxes in the storeroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at her, he saw that she was quite the young woman, barely 26, with a nice toned body, with all the curves in the right place. Sporting a pair if nice big breast, D\u2019s or DD\u2019s cup, from where he was standing, with a nice booty, JLO style. Her skin was the of a light-ish brown, with dark, long hair, styled in a long ponytail. All in all, a nice example of a Mexican beauty. As far as he recalled, from earlier interview with the mansion servants, she had appeared to him as a nice-looking girl, maybe not very bright, but not hateful or spiteful of her Mistress shows of hedonism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was going to open the door loudly when he noticed that the girl, in fact, was opening the boxes of pre-packaged sweets and began to polish a few items from each, making sure that as soon as she had finished everything seemed untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, we\u2019ve got a burglar in the house, eh? No worries\u2026I shall help you satisfy your need then.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRetreating quickly from there, he went back to the kitchen, to start a little punishment of his own. As he entered the kitchen though he found on the floor the opulent form of Angelina, still licking her lips and caressing her humongous belly, as she lay on the remains of what had been a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping her up he soon found out that she had wanted some sort of midnight snack and had wandered into the kitchen, since she didn\u2019t want to disturb him for something so trivial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, there is no need to encumber yourself. Whenever you need me, you may call me. Now, was everything up to your satisfaction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, the cake was\u2026*urp!*\u2026delicious! I don\u2019t know how you do it, Felipe, but\u2026Your cheesecakes are just so good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Miss, thank you. Your enjoyment of my cooking is the biggest reward for me. Now, let me help you go  to bed. Just give me one moment so that I can have one of the maids to clean up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said so, Felipe grabbed a few pans of brownies from under a cupboard, where he had left them to rest to be ready the following morning, leaving a few of them on the table, along with a few more snacks, while placing some of the rest in a bowl; which he then gave to Angelina, as a post-snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he helped the growing behemoth at his side he called for Carmencita, while leaving her a note on a table, near the treats left on there. While helping the, still gorging, actress to her bed, he couldn\u2019t wait to see the following morning how said maid would have reacted to his note in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hardly wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen, meanwhile, hearing herself being called closed hastily the last package of glazed donuts in the storeroom, and quickly chewed down any evidence in her hands, as she moved toward the kitchen, making sure to enter the room with no evidence of her late night binge. As she entered the room she noticed the absence of her Mistress underling, Mister Mbutu. The guy was good looking and, had quite the gentle smile on him and yet, she found strange that since his arrival Miss Jolie had steadily ballooned in the lardass zeppelin she now was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he didn\u2019t seem to have done anything but his jobs regarding her, so maybe it was Miss Angelina who had left herself go. In any case, Carmencita, or Carmen as she preferred to be called, began to check the kitchen to see if there was any note left for her. As she did so she began to think back to the goodies she had snuck out of the storeroom in the last few days.<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t call it stealing, even in her minds, she justified it on herself as if she was taking some tips, some advances on her salary. Sure, her Mistress didn\u2019t know about it, and yet it didn\u2019t harm anyone. Plus, lately the food in the servant\u2019s pantry had always been either fast food junk or tasteless salads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted something with taste. Moreover, with her high metabolism, she wasn\u2019t going to gain an ounce so why not taking advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as she reached the counter, and saw the various treats left on it, she saw the note for her Mistress Assistant. Picking it up she quickly read it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmencita, Miss Jolie had just had a quick midnight snack. Please to clean up the kitchen and bring anything left over to the Servants breakroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Felipe Mbutu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the note back on the table, she quickly looked at all the food still on the counter, a couple pans of Chocolate muffins, still quite hot, a vanilla short cake, a baker\u2019s dozen of donuts and a small pile of gooey chocolate brownies. Absentmindedly, she grabbed a muffin and began nibbling on it, unaware of the fact that everything on that counter had mixed in it the special herbs of Felipe, so to make it quite addictive and less filling than it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid then, began to slowly clean up the counters and the floor, without realizing that every few minutes she was going back to the oven pan to grab a new treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Dios mio, these things are good\u2026Better than the ones in the larder\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than half an hour everything had been scrubbed clean, including the two pans of muffins, which had been transferred from the pans to the quite bloated stomach of the maid. Still, feeling quite peckish, she took a seat at the counter and grabbed one of the donuts from there, munching on it as she thought of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can\u2019t bring everything to the breakroom\u2026It would take me several trips and I would like to get some sleep tonight\u2026Mmm\u2026Strange. I thought there were some ore muffins. Must have been less than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, probably the Mistress had cleaned them up before I came.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept thinking, she didn\u2019t seem to realize that, as she was sitting there, she was taking donut after donut, munching on them as she felt her hunger grow steadily more powerful with each bite. And yet, she didn\u2019t felt satisfied. Quickly polishing off the dozen donuts, she burped softly, caressing her bloated stomach and moved closer to her the short cake, taking quite a large slice for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Well, since there are only the brownies and this, I think I shall take, for sure, the brownies to the breakroom. I\u2019ll just have one or two slices of this cake and will see how much will remain for the breakroom.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a fork she took a piece of the short cake and brought within her lips, the taste and the flavor of it assaulted her taste-buds, leaving her stupefied for a moment. Soon, though, she recovered and began taking bites faster and faster out of the cake, finding her plate soon void of everything but a few crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Woah\u2026Mmh\u2026Must have taken a smaller slice than I thought\u2026So good though\u2026</i>\u2019 as she thought that she unconsciously caressed her over bloated middle, which had begun to hurt against the waistband she was wearing to keep the small white apron on.  As she cut herself another slice, easily a quart of the small cake, she unfastened a little the waistband, letting her belly have some more room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019ll just have this little more and will bring the rest for the others\u2026Just this last\u2026well\u2026Maybe another small piece after this\u2026So good\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost Two in the morning when she finally left the counter, she had cleaned the dishes she had used, and was leaving the kitchen while bringing with her the brownies. Of the cake there was no visible trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved though the mansion, she quickly went into the servant\u2019s wing but, instead of stopping at the break room she went directly toward her private room. Unconsciously she had already begun inhaling the brownies, popping them one after the other in her mouth, enjoying the marvelous flavor of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally reached her room, she seemed to wake up from her reverie, noticing that she wasn\u2019t in the breakroom, and she hadn\u2019t taken the brownies with her. Burping a bit, she simply shrugged it off, she didn\u2019t seem to notice her overburdened belly, nor the brownie crumbs I her cleavage. She simply gave herself a quick wash and went directly to bed, feeling quite good with herself for having had just a few muffins and only a couple of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following Morning, Felipe went into the kitchen and quickly checked the state of the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pristine, as if nobody had used it before. Quickly checking through the security camera\u2019s feed was able to see the gorging spree of the maid on the previous night. As he watched, he realized that she didn\u2019t seem to be really noticing how much she had eaten and thanked once more the spice he had used in the batter for the baked sweets he prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, although he had still quite a few reserves, he had to re-stock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early in the morning and, while Angelina wouldn\u2019t wakeup before Ten in the morning, the household servants were supposed to be already up and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluding a certain maid of his direct knowledge.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he prepared a quick breakfast for the other servants in the mansion, he requested Carmencita to come into the kitchen swiftly. While nobody in the household said anything, this request was quite suspicious and, since some of the other servants knew of Carmen ways of taking tips for herself, they thought that she was going to get what she deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was walking briskly through the corridors. She had woken up late and son had quickly put on her suit, even though it seemed tighter than before. Still, with no time to lose, she didn\u2019t put too much thought on it and went to the kitchen where Mr. Mbutu had apparently called for her specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Porque does he want to meet me there? Por favor, I hope is not about the tips I\u2019ve taken from the larder.<br>\r\nDios mio\u2026I cannot lose this job\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost out of breath she reached the kitchen and saw the guy sitting near the stove, as he cooked something there, as she neared him, she could hear the oil frying and smell the melting of butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good Morning, Mr. Mbutu\u2026I-I heard you w-wanted to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe turned, he greeted the maid with a smile, noticing the slight tremble in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>She must be afraid of having been found out. Well, it\u2019s true that I have but I couldn\u2019t ever fire her\u2026Can\u2019t have her spreading news of the New Angelina, around.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Carmencita. Please have a seat. I just wanted to thank you for taking care of that small favor I\u2019ve asked you last night. When I arrived this morning, the Kitchen was crystal clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s obvious to me that you take great care in doing your work. I know that our Mistress has been a little too\u2026Relaxed, lately. And I know that she doesn\u2019t seem to care about you all, but I can tell you she always speaks greatly of all of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept cooking, so the smell began to be intoxicating for Carmen, she felt herself drooling simply by staying so near to whatever the guy was preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor this reason, I wanted to show you my gratitude. From today, I want to prepare something special for you and your colleagues.  So, from today, I would like you to enjoy some of my cuisine here in the kitchen. <br>\r\nWhat do you say? Here, you can start with this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe finished his spiel, he placed a large plate of fried eggs and bacon directly under Carmen nose.<br>\r\nAs she looked down, she could see the large omelet, covered in cheese, while on the side there were thick slices of fried tomatoes and a small mountain of crunchy, perfectly fried, pork bacon stripes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected many things but not to be receiving compliments and, most importantly, not to be invited to have her meals prepared directly from him. All the maids knew that he was a talented Chef and many of them hoped to taste his creation. And yet, here she was, being offered just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s easy, isn\u2019t it? Just say yes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe smiled at the maid he quickly placed a few more plates near her, some loaded with sweets, other with some ham and cheese toast\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your breakfast. Oh, one more thing. I\u2019ve been noticing that you\u2019ve gone quite a few times in the larder recently\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Carmen woke up suddenly from her reverie, forcing herself not to visible tremble as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026And I appreciate greatly your effort in helping me sorting out what do we have in stock. For that reason, I\u2019ve decided to change your scheduled work. Instead of passing your day cleaning in and out of the mansion, I want you to keep a strict record of what do we have and what we don\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you notice we have something in shortage, feel free to apply an order for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it will come from you, I\u2019ll pass it on with no fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmencita, once more stood there speechless.  He not only had offered her the prize of eating his food every day at every meals, but he also assigned her to have free unlimited access to the storeroom, and to be able to order for it without any additional check! Now, if Carmen hadn\u2019t been the ditzy girl she was, she would have been suspicious of this turn of events, unfortunately she didn\u2019t see it as a warning sign, she saw it as if the Guy wasn\u2019t himself very bright in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I thank you very much, Sir. I shall do you proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you wil. Now enjoy your breakfast while I go and see to our Mistress needs. Then you can go and start your job at the storeroom. Remember, be thorough, if we are in shortage of something, do not be afraid to order it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe left the kitchen he could only grin widely. Between the hunger stimulants he had added to her food and her new assignment to the larder, he was sure Carmencita wasn\u2019t going to remain lithe for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the kitchen he saw Carmen as she began attacking the food with a ravenousness he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Still, he couldn\u2019t stay there and watch all day long. He had another lady to attend and make grow as big as possible. Swiftly going to Angelina\u2019s bedroom, trailing beside him a trolley loaded with goodies, he knocked lightly and entered, marveling, as he did every single day, at the figure which lay on the king sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina Jolie had been once a lithe actress, a joyful person and a smart woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince his arrival though, two of those things had been lost thanks to his intervention. Sure, she had kept her joyful and bubbly personality but, her mind had been dulled a bit by the constant influx of food in her throat and her figure, well, that had stopped being lithe and skinny for quite some time already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the curtains in the room, he stood watching the woman of whom he was in charge, as she kept snoring on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had grown kinda chubby and round, with her cheeks beginning to soften more and more. Her neck was now presenting to the world a second chin, and a third one seemed to be starting slowly beneath the last one. Her shoulder had inflated, growing softer and squishier to the touch, along with her arms, which had now started to have some decent sized bingo wings. Her breast had grown yet of another couple of cup sizes, losing all their perkiness they had become large meat sack which were good only to store more and more fat. When laying down, on her back, those would slide to either side of her, forced to stay that way by the next obstacle right below them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glorious, almost constantly, engorged middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, as she slept soundly, it was like a rather large mountain in the middle of some small-ish hills. In her current position it was divided in three belly rolls, with the last one hanging out, completely covering her undies and most of her thighs. Her hips and ass had grown too, jutting out behind her, he badonkadonk ass created a jiggly shelf on itself, often he had left some plates on her rear as he navigated her toward the next meal, and no plate had ever fallen from it. It was mesmerizing to watch, as it jiggled and quaked at her any movement, no matter how minimal. Her hips though had also grown wider, forcing her to move sideways through most of the doors in the mansion, except of course, of the double sized ones. And yet Felipe hoped to manage to reach the point where those as well were to become an issue, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he admired watching her, it was time for her first pre-breakfast. And so, slowly he began to wake her up in the easiest way possible. Simply, by sliding a plate with a dozen eggs omelet and almost a pound of fried bacon strip under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh\u2026It\u2019s you\u2026Felipe\u2026Good Morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Miss. I\u2019m sorry to wake you up but, it\u2019s time for your first pre breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, slowly pushing herself in a sitting position, noticing that it was becoming harder and harder as weeks passed, smelled heartily the delicious aroma\u2019s coming from the platter in front of her and all of her doubts simply vanished, as her belly grumbled in anticipation. Making quick work of the platter, she quickly cleaned out also the following five, and with that began the arduous task in her daily life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with Felipe assistance, she managed to stand on her own, although she still needed his presence for support in order to perform the daily weight in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a very slow waddle, Felipe directed her toward the large scale he had brought online, used mostly to weigh livestock and farm animals, it was the safest bet to be used with the growing Angelina. The woman slowly managed to step onto the heavy-duty scale and, as she waited a response, she munched on a large short cake he had provided her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe kneeled, entering the shadow of the belly goddess behind him and carefully read the numbers provided by the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling he saw that Miss Jolie had grown more and more since the day before. It was amazing, really, by having her gorge constantly he was managing to let her gain pounds upon pounds, in an always increasing curve. With that day, for example, in a couple of weeks she had grown in average of nearly eight pounds per day, bringing her to a massive three hundred ninety-eight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pounds short of the big four hundred! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had to push her some more\u2026but could he lie shamelessly or was best to keep it low as he was already doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile on his face he replayed to her that her weight was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He truly could do with her whatever he wished and to prove it to himself he decided to lie shamelessly to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026I\u2019ve got a bad news. Your weight is..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, in the middle of cleaning out the last bowl of muffins her assistant had given her, tried to look down in shock, only to see her bountiful breasts, and under them her large gut, obscuring everything below them. Still, as they were doing the daily weigh-ins she knew in the back of her mind that her shape was of no consequence\u2026especially since her weight was so low.<br>\r\nStill, the trembling voice of Felipe put her in quite the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Felipe? Tell me the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Miss, your weight is declining\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, hearing those words began to tranquilize herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have me on this diet for a reason, right? It\u2019s normal to lose weight as we\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss! That is not the issue here. The problem is that you seem to be losing weight fast.<br>\r\nToo fast to be healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on the actress face vanished. With their weigh-ins she knew to be still in her normal shape but, if Felipe was saying the truth she was starting to lose too much, too fast. She didn\u2019t want to become one of those anorexic skeletons, no matter how rich they could become thanks to their minimal bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why would Felipe lie to her? Angelina thought long and hard on that, as she kept munching through the sweets she had in her arms and reached the conclusion that he couldn\u2019t be lying to her. It meant that she was actually losing too much weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Felipe\u2026*munch*\u2026then what should we\u2026*gulp*\u2026do? What can I do to prevent\u2026*urp!*\u2026it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Felipe was waiting for. As soon as she had asked him that he knew he had her hook, line and sinker. Standing up he moved closer to her wide and overfed body, admiring her quickly, before returning to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll modify the schedule again, Miss. We will tweak a bit the schedule, adding some more resting time and maybe increasing the quantities of your meals of a little bit. And we will also take out any exercises session you\u2019re currently following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, Miss, soon you will recover from this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can trust in me to have what\u2019s best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, hearing the words from her assistant smiled at him happily, she was glad of having chosen him to help her out. With him at her side she felt like she could face the entire world. Still, she began soon huffing and panting, feeling tired and drained of all her energies, not realizing that only by standing there on the scale she had already consumed all of her energies. Waddling slowly, helped by her assistant, she moved toward her bed and slowly lowered herself on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was now laid down on the bed, her back against the wall so keeping a somewhat seating position, she felt Felipe pushing something in her hand. With a smile she saw that it was the remote for the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss, just rest and relax a bit. Watch some television as I\u2019ll have the maids bring you your three breakfasts. Don\u2019t worry Miss, all of this will pass. You\u2019ll see, with my help you\u2019ll never feel so tired again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his ominous words Angelina simply laid back and began watching her soaps, just as the maids began entering her room bringing her trays upon trays of breakfast food. Soon, surrounding her bloated, and ever-growing, body there were mounds and mounds of food. With a glance she quickly spied a few towers of pancakes drenched in syrupy goodness and butter, mounds of fried bacon strips with similarly sized mounds of sausages, piles of chocolate covered waffles and then countless cakes, pies and more sweets she could count. Without a fuss she began inhaling them, although with some difficulty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately she had noticed that her arms didn\u2019t seem to be working just as she wanted, it was as if they couldn\u2019t bend as they used to. Still, this little inconvenience didn\u2019t ring any bell in the ex-actress mind, since the maids were all around her, ready to act at a quick nod from her. And so they began, pushing morsels of food within her lips, pushing more and more food into her. And, as time passed, she found herself in a vicious cycle. The maids pushed fod on her faster and faster, since she ate it as fast as she could. And yet, she ate it as fast as she could, since the maids were pushing it into her just as quick paced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, lost in her hedonism, couldn\u2019t see her figure bloating up, her breast swelling larger and heavier, pushing to her sides losing every ounce of perkiness they once had. Her gut rising up in the air, filling up with pounds upon pounds of food, her intestines working overtime to digest, and store as fat, all that was being ingested by the woman. Her hips and ass, slowly outgrowing her bed, as they had beginning to spill out of the sides, as they grew larger and jigglier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll morning was spent I this eating frenzy, with Angelina stuffed so full of things to eat and yet, still hungry for more. Always full, but never satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, as he watched from the sidelines, could only smile in happiness, here she was, growing larger and bigger than a whale, and yet, she still wasn\u2019t big enough for his tribe. She had to grow much, much bigger before he could even think of moving her to his country. Maybe, he thought as he kept watching as she moved from breakfast directly to lunch, he ought to push her on a liquid diet made of shakes and batter. Filling the empty spots with his herbal tea, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something so beautiful in watching her gorge on solid food, watching as she ate through her own tiredness, forced by her gluttony to power through her own exhaustion. Or maybe, he could do a bit of both, get the best of the two worlds as they say\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, he had also Carmen to take care of, in fact, as Angelina was currently busy he could go and check how the maid was working in her new position\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still the two of them did love each other and wanted to find a more permanent solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile checking on the internet they suddenly saw an AD for a counsellor, which seemed to have a huge amount of fans and followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick search and confirmation of the info on the guy, they took an appointment and went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, the two of them entered his studio and seated on the couch as they waited for the guy to start their session. The Doctor\u2019s name tag Recited \u2018Dr. Sweet\u2019 and he seemed quite the average Joe. The only thing that stood out on him was a strange glint in his eyes, a glint that some people seemed to find unnerving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart for that, all reviews about him were extremely positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered and sat on a small couch right opposite to the married couple he smled as he greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Mister Pitt, Miss Jolie. I\u2019m Philodendron Sweet, but you may simply call me Phil. Now, I would like to keep this as informal as possible, if that is okay with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple silently nodded with each other, at which the doctor smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Already from this I can see you\u2019ve been a loving couple from many years. But it does seem you\u2019re having some issues lately. Don\u2019t worry though. We\u2019ll find a solution, together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started to delve deeper and deeper into the issues that the couple was facing, the doctor began to formulate a plan on how to solve the situation with his new clients and to solve a minor matter that had been persecuting him lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Philodendron had always been a different child. He had grown in a family that considered the rest of mankind as nothing more than an additional source of food. Growing up he was taught that to enjoy the taste of the human flesh was a good thing, something that most should have given out freely. But apparently he hadn\u2019t ever found anybody who wanted to share their personal bounty and so he had to reinvent himself to satisfy this need he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this that he decided one day to study the behavior of the human mind and, after mastering various degrees, he opened up his studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping people pair up\u2026and then chewing\u2019em down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two celebrities in front of him were going to be the icing on his figurative cake. He had just to let them grow together, both in happiness and in size, and then he could finally see if fame made the flesh taste better\u2026just like a normal steak and one prepared by a gourmand were two different worlds apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of discussion, being able to discern that the two of them were simply having a normal issue with their own respective careers, he decided the best course of action for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad, Angelina. I\u2019ll be sincere. The two of you look perfect together but you\u2019re letting your own greed getting in the way of your relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI personally say that there is an easy solution to try to solve this and prevent any further fights between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should try to take a breath of rest from your own careers, for a while at least, and following a specific schedule that I will prepare based on the information you\u2019ve given me, you shall try to rest, relax and enjoy life together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo have a better effect, I would suggest following you on a more personal level. By living with you and helping you on this journey. You will see that in no time you two will return to the best time of your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be acceptable for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise we could find some other solutions. I could follow you one by one, but it would require a longer period. Or maybe, I can give you two some different objectives, thus forcing you to decide which you prefer best, if the objective or your true love.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026I get the whole \u2018no work for a month\u2019 thing but also no exercises? No workouts? Nothing at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Brad, we are trying to bring peace and quiet within the two of you. Exercises bring the idea of competition and, through that, anger toward the less performing of the two of you. We do not need that. So, no work, no exercises, no workouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust rest and restful activities that you can do as a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Angelina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I was wondering\u2026er, is this meal plan accurate? I mean, six meals per day doesn\u2019t sound\u2026too much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a common misconception. It doesn\u2019t matter what you eat but how often you eat. See, to reach an easier peace of the mind, you\u2019ve got to be able to concentrate on what\u2019s really important. By eating often, you give your body a constant intake of energies that will grant you additional resources to reach the bliss. Otherwise your body would have to spend precious energies to always be on the lookout to satisfy its hunger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost half an hour the married celebrities kept on discussing with the doctor but, in the end, they had to accept all his proposals. They were a bit worried about this turn in their lifestyle but, in the end, as they started following the schedule they both began to grow more and more complacent as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that week the two of them didn\u2019t do much more that wake up late, watch television together, sleep together and, of course, eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they followed Dr. Phil\u2019s diet of six meals a day, with a constant stream of snacks out of the mealtimes, it was no wonder that both their bodies began requesting more than what they were currently having. Still, in that week, both Brad and Angie, noticed that there were no fights, no arguments but a simple calm and acceptance of what was going on around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil followed the two celebrities all week, watching them from afar, pushing them from time to time in the correct direction\u2026toward gluttony. And the results were promising so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two had gained that much in that simple week but, it was normal. Phil knew that the week he had instructed them to follow was necessary to instigate their bodies to start slowing down their metabolism and to get them used to eating more. And that they had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new week began Phil made sure to be always reachable and, while doing so, to always have time to provide a few more detailed suggestion or instruction to his client. That morning, for example, as he was brewing some coffee in the kitchen he saw Brad coming down from their master bedroom and sit at the table beside him, while ordering around their servant to prepare him a hearty breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsuelo? Please, could you make me a few eggs with fried bacon? Four or five eggs should be enough\u2026 Oh, Hi Phil. How\u2019s going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Brad. Well, shouldn\u2019t be I to make that question to you? It\u2019s fine, although, I wish I could see some better results from the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad began eating from the big plate he had received, he looked quizzically toward the doctor seated beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Brad\u2026Usually in the first week the couples grow closer through a common objective. You two instead are still on the \u2018Finding your own peace\u2019 moment. However, that\u2019s okay, we will try to make your next week\u2019s more relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, since we\u2019re talking of this\u2026I\u2019ve been thinking of increasing your daily regime a little bit. As a couple you guys are way too singlehandedly active. That isn\u2019t good. For this reason I\u2019m going to implement some required nap time that the two of you will have to follow together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Phil, how could we do that? If I haven\u2019t need for any sleep how would I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy. Let Dr. Sweet work on it. You\u2019ll soon see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, as Brad and Agelina sat on the couch together, watching some tv shows, trying to follow the schedule from their doctor, their servants brought them their snacks for the mid-morning, but both watched stunned as their usual small bowls of snack was replaced with a large Devil Food\u2019s cake for Brad and a large apple pie for Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two looked at the massive treat, Philodendron appeared behind them with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, guys, you need to relax. To do so, you will eat some snacks until the both of you feel sleepy. This way, you will snuggles beside each other and move forward toward the peace and calm you so desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI already instructed your servants about this, so don\u2019t worry about a thing. Just eat, sleep and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything will be taken care of.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh yes. Soon the two of you will get used to gorge all the time\u2026I can\u2019t wait to see it happens\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was near the end of the second week since Brad and Angelina had started to follow the advice from Dr. Sweet, and the two of them had never been as happy before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock ringed both woke up with a yawn, Brad was the first to rise to a sitting position, while scratching the beginning of a potbelly he was developing, while Angelina kept low on the bed but wide awake. Not a minute had passed since the clock ringing that their room door opened letting in two of their servants. These brought with them two tray, one for each actor, with their first pre-breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both celebrities sat in their bed, they quickly accepted their trays and happily started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad began taking bite after bite at his large portion of fried eggs and bacon, washing it all down with the thick vanilla milkshake, his portion had been steadily growing since the previous week, reaching now a size that could have fed two normal people. Yet, Brad felt he could trust the good doctor advice and so didn\u2019t see anything wrong in its size. <br>\r\nAngelina instead licked her lips as she surveyed her own pre-breakfast, it had been constantly changing in the last week but, apparently it had finally settled on a constant barrage of sweets. In front of her, in fact, there was a large bowl filled with chocolate brownies, a couple of large muffins and a big plate with a particularly large slice of devil\u2019s food cake, with a side of three dollops of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth celebrities did a quick work of both trays and, as soon as they were cleaned, the two maid quickly took the tray\u2019s away, leaving the two celebrities to rise from the bed, to prepare themselves for the continuation of the day. With a belly full of sweets, Angelina was the first one to rise and, as she did every morning, she began her day by taking a quick shower and then wear her usual attire for the day. A pair of  short shorts in spandex, with matching sports bra. As it had become usual, she quickly inspected herself, noticing that she had become a bit softer than before but, with her new relaxed attitude she simply dismissed the thought and went on with her day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad was in a similar position, after dressing up in a pair of sweater pants and shirt, he gave himself a good look in the mirror. He flexed a bit his slightly flabbier body and, as per instruction received he knew that by being bigger he was going to be stronger. As he finished, he too, left the room and followed his wife down toward the kitchen where their true breakfast was awaiting them, along with the good doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them were seated at the kitchen table Doctor Phil smiled and greeted them, while sipping a bit of coffee, as they began to consume the first proper meal of the day. Brad, seated at one end of the table, happily munched on a dozen hot dogs, as he kept staring at both his wife and to his next plate, chocked full of fried bacon and sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, always within reach, there were a couple of tall glasses full with an energy drink, spiked with some spoonful of bulk up powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite to him sat Angelina, she too was rapidly consuming quite a large breakfast while feeling decidedly content in refilling her belly with the food she was starting to get addicted to. In front of her there were several plates, the nearest ones were full of fluffy pancakes drowned in syrup and butter, then there were a few more with chocolate covered waffles and finally a large platter with half of a massive chocolate cake covered in frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina smiled toward Phil as she began to dug in the delicious food. She had shown some resistance at the beginning but, as the doctor pointed out, she had to live more relaxed to return to her old love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she was beginning to enjoy following that diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both cleaned out their respective plates, both actors lay on their chairs panting slightly. As it was becoming a normal occurrence, both felt tired after eating their breakfast and always needed some minutes to just recover from it. Their bodies though began rapidly to digest and process all the food they had consumed, something that Phil loved to be able to see right in front of his eyes.<br>\r\nStill, after a few minutes rest, the two quite bloated celebrities slowly waddled toward the couch where they would spend most of their day. Sitting there, side by side, they began to watch some shows on the TV, as their maids began bringing them some snack every few minutes. Distracted by the shows Brad kept chowing down on all snacks that he received from the maids, chewing noisily on hot dogs and burgers and sloppily drinking soda after soda. Angelina, seated right beside him, wasn\u2019t in a better position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too was so focused on the TV that she barely registered on how much she was eating, filling her mouth with more and more chocolaty snacks and treats. The maids, from their side, weren\u2019t aware of what was going on but, as they had been ordered to follow the Doctor\u2019s indication they simply did as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so for most of the morning the married couple kept on guzzling down food and drinks as they kept watching the television until, usually, Brad began to feel sleepy. It was at that moment that Phil, always checking on the two, proceeded to increase the quantities delivered to Angelina which, with more food on her hands, simply began to consume it faster and faster until she simply crumbled, falling asleep right beside her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the two stuffed love birds napping for almost an hour, Phil began to organize for their next main meal of the day. Lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the hour had passed, the maid went and began to wake up the two bloated celebrities, urging them to rise from the couch and, almost, pushing them to the dining room were their first lunch awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brad and Angelina, even though were still feeling somewhat full, couldn\u2019t deny that they were growing addicted to the constant gorging and so, without too much of a fight, both began to eat once more. If they hadn\u2019t been so focused on stuffing themselves to the fullest both could have noticed that their dietary regimen, apart from the sheer quantities, were very strange. Brad seemed to be following an all carbs and protein diet, with all of his meals consisting mostly in meats and baked breads. While Angelina was more on a carbs and sugar diet, being given for the most parts sweets and sugary treat and beverages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth celebrities tough, didn\u2019t seem to mind how much they were eating, especially since they were so focused on eating that they didn\u2019t seem to realize how much of it they were pushing down in their gullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, as the two were enthralled by their full six course meals that Doctor Phil began, as he did every day, to lay an additional insurance to have the two actors steadily growing bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad\u2026\u201d Phil began, whispering softly in the man ear, as he was still focused on eating away at the large one pounder burger in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad\u2026Keep going Brad. Keep eating. <br>\r\nRemember\u2026the more you eat, the more you grow\u2026the bigger you are, the stronger you\u2019ll become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd look at her, Brad\u2026isn\u2019t she beautiful? How could a skinny little thing like you stay with her\u2026unless you grow bigger and stronger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe strong, Brad\u2026be the biggest for her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words, the tone, everything in Phil voice was calculated to impact on Brad subconsciousness, to force him to see the world as Philodendron wanted him to see it. Brad, focused as he was, couldn\u2019t do much but listen to that voice and turn his world around it. Convincing himself that what the voice said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working his magic on Brad, Phil moved on Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngie\u2026you\u2019re such a good girl. Aren\u2019t you, Angie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut good girls will eat what they have on their plate. Eat Angie, eat and enjoy. <br>\r\nRemember, food is good. Exercise is bad.<br>\r\nLook at Brad, he\u2019s awesome, isn\u2019t he? But he\u2019s like that because he eats his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEat up, Angie. Remember, eating makes you grow more beautiful\u2026the more you eat the more amazing you become\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as lunch finished, Brad and Angelina collapsed right where they were. Huffing and puffing, both celebrities felt good, due to Phil\u2019s hypnotical suggestions, but as it was becoming a common occurrence, they both couldn\u2019t move an inch. Brad leaned back on his chair, slowly and carefully caressing his overburdened belly. Forced to open up the zip of his sweater shirt he laid there breathing slowly as the literal weight of all the food consumed kept him from moving. Angelina, seated opposite from him, didn\u2019t fare much better. Sure, she was wearing clothes more comfortable, without feeling them grow tight on her belly, but with the compulsion instilled in her by Phil, even though she was feeling full she kept on eating, trying with all of her resolve to lick clean her plates. Eventually though, she stopped and collapsed in a similar pose to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, as they were still full and overstuffed, they rose from their chairs and, helped along by their maids, they moved to their master bedroom, where they passed some time together. At first, they spent that time cuddling together\u2026but as the days passed and their forms began to grow bigger and fuller, the two of them began to spend that time by sleeping and digesting together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as this was the end of the second week, Philodendron wanted more from them... But what could he do with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossibilities were endless\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As weeks passed Phil decided to keep things quiet and let the couple to slowly fill out. And it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brad and Angelina kept following the dietary advices from Dr. Phil and, without any worries they steadily kept growing as their meals and snacks grew larger as well. It was barely one month passed since Phil entered in their lives and both were already showing some distinctive changes in their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad noticed how larger his paunch was getting, along with his arms and legs, and yet thanks to the hypnotical guidance from Phil he knew that he was building mass that would have grown into muscles, eventually. Still, he couldn\u2019t refrain, in the privacy of his bathroom, to play a bit with his paunch. Lifting it up and watching it as it jiggled when he let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main room, Angelina was also watching herself at the mirror. <br>\r\nShe was admiring her forms as they grew, in her conditioned eyes, more and more voluptuous, more feminine. She quickly passed her hands from her breasts, feeling as they had grew heavier and bigger, to her potbelly. She knew that once she had abs there, but she also could see how more beautiful she was now, it was way better the way she was growing. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t see how the rest of her body had been growing. Her butt was growing exponentially, along with her thighs, and it was a common occurrence for her to knock things down when she was walking. Her face also had grown rounder, starting to grow more cherubic, her chin softening up as a second chin began to slightly appear under the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as their bedroom door opened, both turned there their attention, eagerly awaiting their next meal. At the doorway one of their maids peeked through the door informing them that their first breakfast was ready. At this news, both Brad and Angelina quickly put on some clothes and walked slowly toward the kitchen, where they were greeted by a table choked full of delicacies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled as he saw that in front of him there was a large plate chocked full of fried eggs with a small mountain of fried pork bacon as a side dish. Using his fork Brad didn\u2019t waste anytime in take large mouthful of the eggs, and having some bacon strips every now and then, completely oblivious to the small rivulets of grease that were flowing down on his chin. Opposite to him Angelina was also going strong, as she had begun cleaning out a plate full of powdered donuts, while also having spoonsful of ice cream from the gallon tub that her maid had left near her. A couple of hours later, as both had cleared out several plates of food, both actors leaned back on their chairs, burping and belching as they tried to make some more room. <br>\r\nRight on time, Phil sat at the table with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brad, Angelina, how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!* G-Good\u2026but full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs Brad said\u2026*belch*\u2026It\u2019s so good\u2026though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to hear that. Maybe you didn\u2019t notice it\u2026but in the last month you didn\u2019t argue not even one time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that the married couple perked up, as they both caressed their own growing form with fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>And you don\u2019t even realize that by eating all the time you couldn\u2019t argue even if you wanted\u2026</i>\u2019 Though Phil with a smile before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, there is no time to rest. We still have a lot of work to do. For starters we must make sure that both of you are as relaxed as you can be. Then we can focus on some exercises to have the two of you enjoying some activities together.<br>\r\nAnd, final, if everything goes as it should, you will be able to enjoy a trip together that you will remember till your last days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>A special trip indeed\u2026right into my belly.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, the two actors began to be fed almost every time they could, and from that point onward they kept on being overstuffed constantly. Whenever they were, be the couch or the bathroom, one of their maids was constantly at their side pushing more and more food into their mouths. In less than two weeks Brad began to slightly outgrow his clothes, as he could see his belly began to peek out from under the sweatshirt he was using.  Especially if he was laying down, he could see how dome shaped it was beginning to appear. Yet, he knew in his mind that it was a good thing, that it was meaning he was going to grow big and muscular. Alas, he didn\u2019t notice that, along with his gut, his entire figure was rounding out, although most of the weight was centering on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina instead had been noticing that her clothes seemed to be shrinking, and yet she choose to fault their washer or the people using it, instead of realizing it was due to her consumption rate that she was ballooning up. And she was growing faster and rounder than her husband due to a constant onslaught of sweets and candies, cakes and pies. With a maid constantly at her side feeding her full time she truly seemed to be exploding out of her clothes. Still, both actors had their limits but Phil, and the maids as per orders received, didn\u2019t stop at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaroline\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m Full! Can\u2019t\u2026keep\u2026going\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was laying on the couch, unable to move due to how full his belly was. His gut was filled out, a huge round balloon that forced him to lay there with his legs spreaded out. Yet, the maid at his side, Caroline, moved closer to him, with one hand massaging the taut stomach, while moving a hot dog toward his, still closed, mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sir, you know the schedule by now, thirty hot dogs by three PM\u2026we\u2019re going to be late if you don\u2019t open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad moved slowly his head reaffirming his idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo full\u2026Let me nap\u2026a bit\u2026first\u2026at least\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Sir.\u201d The maid conceded with a smile, as she simply began to massage the taut rounded gut with her free hand as she used the other to place a straw in between the actor lips. Brad, as he fell asleep, kept slowly sucking from the straw, unknowingly going to consume an entire five liters pitcher of weight gain shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, by the pool, Angelina was in a similar situation.<br>\r\nShe was laying on a pool chair, her rounded out body engulfing the chair itself under its mass, her ass cheeks barely contained by it. At her side, with a trolley chocked full of sweets, there was her personal maid Sarah, personally assigned to her by Dr. Phil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Miss, one more slice and we can call it finished with this cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Urp!* Urgh\u2026too much\u2026can\u2019t have anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense\u2026I can feel plenty of room in here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, she grabbed more firmly the slice of cake in her hand and began to forcefully push it between Angelina\u2019s lips. The actress grunted in pain but in the end couldn\u2019t do much but open her mouth and accept the treat, chewing on it slowly until she painfully swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026no\u2026more\u2026\u201d She whimpered, but the maid seemed to be deaf to her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please, Miss. Don\u2019t be such a child\u2026here come some more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Sarah, grabbed another slice of cake from her trolley, this time devil\u2019s food, and pushed it once more against Angelina\u2019s mouth, who couldn\u2019t do nothing else but accepting it once more. This process repeated itself several times, each time the actress stomach grew larger and wider as more food was packed inside it. After some time, Angelina began to stop feeling pain and began to feel some kind of pleasure from being so much under pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A couple of pies later, Sarah felt the tautness in Angelina\u2019s gut and motioned to stop but, felt the hand of the actress on her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Belch!*\u2026Mf\u2026M-More\u2026*Urp!*Give\u2026me\u2026more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid looked at the beached whale in front of her. She didn\u2019t know why both she and her husband had decided to follow such a fattening diet, but it wasn\u2019t her place to discuss it. Returning to the present, she looked down at her mistress and, seeing that she truly wanted more she simply grabbed another piece from a sheet cake and brought it to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina happily accepted the treat, moaning in pleasure from both the pain and the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron was watching the scene from the camera feed. This was an unexpected result, and yet he wasn\u2019t going to refuse it. He didn\u2019t expect it from Angelina to grow attached to the feeling of being overfull, but he for sure was going to take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following weeks the gain for both the actors kept increasing steadily, as they slowly got used to the new portions and, as such, they had to be stuffed even more to reach the objective of stretching their stomaches. Angelina especially was growing at an astounding rate, quickly surpassing 250 pounds in less than three months, while Brad was still getting used to be slightly less than that. This increase though had quite the impact on both, as all their daily activities began to be harder to do, even the simplest one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was having trouble dressing himself up, as he could hardly lift his arms over his head and had to request assistance to do that. His wife instead, had way more trouble moving around as she was now constantly waddling around, her fattened body burdening her at her every step. She had to admit she kind of enjoyed how her entire body jiggled at her every movement, her burgeoning breast flesh sacks quivering like jelly, her gut slapping against her thighs. All of this she saw it as a sign that she was still growing more beautiful and so she redoubled her effort to grow even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was finding hard to reach the point of being overfull, but she tried at her best all the same.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is now almost five months since Brad and Angelina decided to follow the treatment suggested by their new marriage counselor, both of them have greatly changed in this time frame. Brad had reached the 300 pounds milestone, having to finally waddle around as his belly have grown so big that it started to overtake his crotch. His choice of clothes for the everyday also changed. Not being able to wear sweat, no matter how big, he\u2019s turned to wear a muumuu\u2019s that let his belly hang free and, without feeling constricted, he\u2019s been able to increase his consumption even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina instead, was growing at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had crested the 330 pounds and was now hurrying toward the 350. Wearing almost constantly bikini\u2019s she felt wonderfully, even though she had noticed how harder it was to move around the mansion. She had truly ballooned under Phil\u2019s guidance, as her body began to round out more and more. Her breast kept on growing larger, although they weren\u2019t perky anymore, being pushed up only by the bikini top she was wearing. Her belly had grown massively, dividing itself in two large rolls when seated.<br>\r\nHer ass also didn\u2019t stop growing wider, forcing her to move sideways when passing through doorways and, as of late, even through the hallways. The maids kept being around them 24/7, assisting them and feeding them all the time. Yet, Phil knew that something had to give, and he had to move first to avoid all this to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad, Angelina? I\u2019m seeing good progress here but, I still don\u2019t see a good connection between you. For this reason, I want the two of you to spend more time together. From now on, the two of you will be staying in the same room all the time.<br>\r\nDue to some issues, I\u2019ve had to upgrade your bedroom but I\u2019m sure the two of you will love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth actors had been so focused in their food lust that they had barely registered the renovation on going in their own house, but as they were helped to their master bedroom, they could see that it had been completely renovated. Gone was the king-sized bed, replaced by two large mobile beds, each big enough to hold up to their growing sizes for months to come. These beds were the apex of modern technology, having included some screens to comfortably watch TV, an electric motor to lift a portion of the bed, letting the user to actually sit without even moving and, most importantly, including a chute system that would take care of any \u2018trash\u2019 in a complete silent and odorless way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two once actors were placed on these beds, both enjoyed the feeling of comfort and their gains quickly increased as they now had no need to move at all. Between the maids feeding them and the possibility to simply \u2018go\u2019 whenever they needed, they simply stopped moving at all, constantly watching how their forms grew bigger and bigger. It was at this point that Brad, after months, began to closely watch at Angelina in a different way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterall, even with his conditioned mind, he soon realized that his wife had grown massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, something inside of him seemed to be telling him that he had to love it but, after a while, as he kept staring at her gorging and growing form, he felt himself grow tired of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Look at her\u2026How have I not noticed it before? <br>\r\nShe\u2019s growing to be such a pig. She\u2019s so grossly huge!<br>\r\nI wonder if she could stand on her own\u2026But I don\u2019t think she can\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad, being constantly beside Angelina had finally noticed how big she was getting but, he failed to notice that he was in the same situation. Still, As Phil noticed this situation to rise, he decided to take action to keep the two growing as big as they could. Quickly he checked within his records and found, within the maids, the girl he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, as the two actors had just finished their third breakfast, one of the maids moved closer to Brad as the actor was looking disgusted at Angelina starting on her fourth breakfast. The maid, Christie, placed her hand on Brad\u2019s thigh beginning to caress it gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actor, even though was eating again, turned toward the girl with an intrigued stare, just as she moved closer and began whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a shame that a wonderful man such as you have to be with a slob like her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cR-Really*urp*?...I-I\u2026I mean\u2026you\u2019re..right\u2026I\u2026deserve\u2026.*gulp*\u2026so\u2026much\u2026better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could give it to you, Sir\u2026You\u2019re so handsome\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christie kept whispering, so her hand began to massage more seductively his lower belly, just above his nether regions. Brad began to eat faster, as he felt more aroused than he had felt in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a handsome man\u2026If only you could eat more\u2026You could be the hottest hunk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christie began whispering more and more encouragements, so Brad kept on trying to eat faster and faster, falling line hook and sinker to the sweet words of the young and attractive maid, trying all he could to get to grow bigger for her. All thoughts of his wife beside him washed away by a desire for a younger woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad began to focus on the maid, Angelina seemed to remain in the dark about her husband desire. She simply ate more and more, trying harder to become what she thought was the epitome of beauty. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angelina, following the advices of Dr. Phil had been focusing solely on growing more beautiful and voluptuous for her husband Brad. As she did so she realized how good it felt to feel painfully overstuffed, and yet the main reason for her to grow this voluptuous was still solely for her husband sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as of lately, she seemed to notice that Brad appeared as if he was getting away from her, as if he wasn\u2019t interested anymore in her. Since they had a communication problem, as Dr. Phil said, she never faced him about the issue, but simply poured her thoughts to the good doctor that was following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Phil didn\u2019t seem worried at all, and only with that, Angelina felt herself less worried. If the doctor wasn\u2019t worried, things weren\u2019t as bad as she thought, didn\u2019t they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the good doctor instructed Angelina on how to proceed to get back the attention from her husband, in the specific he told her that she had to grow more beautiful for him, she had to renounce to her youthful figure only to assume a curvier one to entice Brad into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man, not a boy, Angelina. As a man he will be more receptive to a woman with real curves, and not to your current slim figure. You don\u2019t have to be a stick thin model anymore Angie, if you want to get Brad to notice you, you\u2019ll have to grow some curves\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Phil said that, Angelina was still on her bed, which had been moved from the room she shared with Brad, to a more private room where Philodendron could interact alone with the actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Angelina couldn\u2019t realize was that the figure to which Phil was referring to, she had already lost it weeks ago. In that exact moment, for example, as Angelina listened intently to her doctor advice, she was still being fed by her personal maid. And she really had the body to prove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was now racing through pounds, shooting past the 350 and almost reaching the big 400 pounds. The bed on which she lay, it seemed to be getting smaller as days passed, as Angelina\u2019s whole body grew larger and wider. Her ass had seemed to grow the most, no thong or panties could hope to keep it in, and as more calories were pushed inside her the more it kept growing. Similar situation was for the rest of her body, her billowy gut kept rising and was starting to obscure her most private areas. Her breast also grew larger and meatier, sure they lost their perkiness, but they increased in sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face also grew chunkier as time passed, another chin appeared under the first two, and overall her entire visage seemed rounder and rounder as time passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the actress couldn\u2019t see the truth for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her eyes she was simply growing slightly curvier, and apparently not enough for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026doc\u2026So\u2026gotta\u2026grow\u2026more\u2026womanly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Angie. For this reason, I\u2019ll ask Sarah to double the portion of your meals and to triple the quantities of your snacks. You\u2019ll see\u2026 a few weeks this way and you\u2019ll be your husband dream come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the actress barely had time to sleep, devoting instead all the time she could to eat more than she ever had, with the constant influx of food from both her own desire and the forcefulness of her maid, her growth began to show results right from the start. Angelina\u2019s weight began to skyrocket, if before she was gaining a good five pound per day, under the new regimen she began to put on eight to twelve a day. <br>\r\nAnd yet she tried as best as she could to go over her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure literally ballooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than two weeks, her fattened body began to overtake the bed on which she was staying, as her fat thighs and ass-cheeks began to overflow it. And still she soldiered on, focusing solely on the food, she began to lose sight of her surroundings. It started to happen, again and again, that she focused so much on eating that she simply forgot of everything and everyone surrounding her. In her quest to reach the ideal figure for her husband, Angelina quickly transformed herself in an unstoppable eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Philodendron noticed just how quickly the actress was ballooning, in short less than a month, although Brad had grown pretty massive too, reaching the 350 pounds thanks to the whispers coming from what he thought was going to be his lover, Angelina reached the 450 pounds, growing a vast hundred pounds heavier than her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron couldn\u2019t refrain himself, as he often began inspecting the growing couple, to touch more and more personally the growing form of the once lithe actress, caressing her every roll of fat, or simply by feeling her gut rising and falling as she breathed slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Soon\u2026Soon you\u2019ll be ready Angelina. Sooner than expected you\u2019ll be able to go on the last trip of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to wait for the both of you to reach the quarter ton of weight but, as fast as you\u2019re growing you may be a little too big to handle\u2026or maybe I could wait and see when you\u2019re going to plateau?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Due to her, he kept growing fatter and fatter at breakneck speed. He was still dwarfed by his wife but, as he kept eating to try to find satisfaction from Christie\u2019s compliments, he really began outgrowing himself. And yet, as he kept staring lustfully to Christie, he had to notice how small she seemed compared to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed, he noticed the vast difference in size between his wife Angelina (who was growing as big as a zeppelin in his eyes), himself (as he thought of himself as normal sized) and Christie, who seemed to be growing smaller and smaller. In those days, Brad began thinking about this matter. It was no easy task since, with the constant feeding and huge onslaught of food, he rarely had to think about anything except eating more but, powering it through, he realized what had to be the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was normal sized, and his wife was way too big, it had to be that Christie was changing from fit to malnourished. Since he was beginning to love her presence around him, Brad decided that something had to be done. Naturally, he had to bring in the good doctor Phil but, he wanted to keep his affair secret (although he didn\u2019t know it was all a scam prepared by the same Doctor).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, as soon as the Phil came into their room, Brad stopped eating and signaled the doctor he wanted to talk. Phil had already a hunch on what was going to happen, he had seen the results of the cameras feed and had been informed by Christie about the latest behavior of Brad. Still he requested a couple of maids to move Brad\u2019s wheeled bed to a different room so they could have a chat in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were alone, Phil sat nearby Brad, as he once more marveled at the sheer size the once actor had reached in those few months. The ex-actor had grown massive, although most of his weigh ended in the huge boulder belly he sported, the rest of him still had puffed up. As if a case study, Phil noticed how large Brad\u2019s hand had become, the fingers do puffy he barely could move them or flex them anymore. The rest of him, with so little physical activity had grown more and more jelly like, making him appear similar to an overfilled waterbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Brad, you wanted to tell me something? I know It can\u2019t be a progress update, since I gave you both a full report just the other day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026It is\u2026about\u2026Christie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristie? Uh? Oh, the maid following you? What about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026so\u2026thin. Could be\u2026she\u2019s\u2026not\u2026eating\u2026enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026Now that you point it out, it may seem so. But I\u2019m following the two of you, her lifestyle is not my business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish\u2026for\u2026her\u2026to\u2026stay\u2026healthy. She\u2019s\u2026loyal\u2026employee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil could see the strain in Brad, the toll that doing something simple as talking was taking out of him. It was yet another milestone in Phil\u2019s book regarding the growth of his two patients/future meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, Brad wasn\u2019t wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor when both he and his wife were gone, changed into massive food reserve for Philodendron, he would have to find something else to keep him be. Instead, if he could fatten up the servitude and, why not?, even some friends of the couple, he could stock on his favorite food for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Brad, this does you honor. To be worried as you are about your employees, shows how good natured you are. Angelina\u2019s lucky to have you. Anyway, I\u2019ll have a chat with her and try to convince her to follow a diet for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026Doc\u2026appreciate\u2026it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Brad. After all is my job to keep the two of you happy and together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the other maids moved Brad back in the main bedroom, right alongside his wife, Phil called to him Christie, having her seat in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Christie? How\u2019s going with Brad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing all I can to have him keep on eating as much as possible. As long you keep your part of the agreement, I will follow your instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that Phil smiled wickedly. He had hired her to woo Brad only because he had found a leverage to keep her lashed to him. And that leverage was none other than Christie\u2019s own family. The poor girl knew that her family, specifically her mother, was having financial issues and so Phil had volunteered to keep her secure at the cost of her help. It wasn\u2019t the nicest of things to do to trick your own employer but, she didn\u2019t have any other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re doing all you can, Christie, but there is something you could actually do to speed up things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it? What more could I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. From tomorrow, you shall be placed on a similar bed and keep him company from there. As if you were following their same diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? Are you crazy? I won\u2019t be fattened up like them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil smiled sinisterly as he looked at the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I won\u2019t have you fatten up. Second, you don\u2019t really have a choice, do you? Or you\u2019re ready to maintain your mother as well as your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Especially\u2026</i>\u2019 The doctor thought with a wicked grin \u2018<i>Since I had her moved on a twelve thousands calories per day diet, since she was moved in my facility.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026I guess not. B-But you\u2019re not going to make me grow as them, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you already, Christina. We\u2019re only going to pretend. <br>\r\nYou\u2019ll be fed a tasteless sludge which doesn\u2019t contain that many calories. So you\u2019ll just stay there beside Brad, faking yourself to be following an healthier diet and he will return to his usual addiction.<br>\r\nTrust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Brad noticed with glee that a new bed was placed beside his own, and on this one was laying his latest crush, Christie. As he saw her lay there, drinking away from a hose placed on her mouth he could easily deduce that the good Doctor had managed to convince her to follow the healthy diet he was following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling for his success, Brad, began eating faster and faster at whatever his maids were feeding him. Soon, Christie would become perfect sized again and he could finally make love to her without any fear of hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, as soon as the sludge entered Christie\u2019s mouth, she realized something for the briefest moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a single fraction of an instant, she realized that whatever was being forced in her mouth through the hose, was tasting divine. And that was worrisome, for the Doctor had said that it should have been tasteless instead. But, as more and more of that sludge was pushed between her lips, Christie soon lost interest in anything else, focusing only on the delicious stuff she was slurping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron looked pleased as he surveyed the master bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was Angelina Jolie, pushing near the 600 pounds, growing so largely pear shaped that her lower half had begun overtaking the bed. Then, next to her, there was Brad. He was now almost always trying to catch a look from Christie, as he was now reaching the 500 pounds and forcing himself to grow more for her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, beside him, Christie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil had promised her it was all going to be fake\u2026But he had simply lied to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to grow just as big, if not bigger, now that she was being getting addicted to the weight gain chemical he had also used on the couple. And so, the good Doctor now had three soon-to-be-meals to feed and prepare for the final moments. Angelina was obviously going to be the first one to go\u2026but before that he needed the two of them alive since\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Philodendron had first wanted to get the Brad/Angelina for himself but, as time went on and the two had grown way past his expectations, he realized he could start something he had only dreamed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing their mansion as his own base of operations he could now create a place where all who shared his \u2018dietary preferences\u2019 could join him and help him along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, everything still had to be kept under secret but, it was feasible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the master bedroom where his three pigs were growing Phil already had formed his plans. Yet, he only needed their confirmation so that he could start using their money to create his paradise. Entering the room, he was glad to see that everything was still under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina had slowed on her growth, with almost 650 pounds on her frame it was becoming obvious that solid food wasn\u2019t enough for her growth anymore. Even though she was fed every waking moment, be it willingly or forcing her, she still wasn\u2019t growing as fast as before. No matter that four maids were following her throughout the day, pushing more and more sweets, from wedding cakes to donuts, into her mouth, she still didn\u2019t seem to grow any larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, she was a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge form had to be moved on a new wheeled bed, since the old one couldn\u2019t keep her on any longer, and yet, due to her pear-shaped form, also the most recent one was having trouble to contain her. As usual, even though her breast had grown massive and her gut had grown gigantically, her butt was her biggest feature. So big and large that she was forced to lay on her stomach, it appeared as a veritable mountain of jelly like flesh, as it jiggled and wobbled at her every breath. Still, since he hadn\u2019t decided yet if she was ready to become a meal, Phil hadn\u2019t changed her feeding schedule and so she seemed to have reached her plateau. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad instead was still growing on. <br>\r\nSure, he was smaller than his wife, still at a mere 520 pounds, but thanks to Christie flirts, he was speeding up a bit, adding more and more rolls on his already fattened up frame. As his wife he also had assumed a specific shape. Contrary to her he seemed to have been focusing his weigh in his gut, which had grown grotesquely huge, covering all his lower body up to his feet. It rarely was empty, as his feeding was also constant, and so it kept rising higher and higher toward the ceiling as a domed semi-sphere. The rest of his body didn\u2019t fare too much differently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had still some mobility in his barrel like arms, but he was finding it harder and harder to move them as each day passed on. At his side, two maids were keeping him always stuffed to the brim, letting him rest a bit and then forcing him to eat more as soon as some more space freed in his growing gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was growing too, at a slower pace than her two room companions, but still growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the most recent but also, the one most affected by Dr. Phil\u2019s diet as she was, in truth, an experiment. True, Brad had requested her to be \u2018healthier\u2019 but the good doctor saw it also as an opportunity to test the effectiveness of an all liquid diet. The sludge she was constantly feeding off was nothing more than a glorified weight gain shake overloaded with chemicals to result addicting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she truly couldn\u2019t stop herself from having it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her thoughts about her figure, her worries, even her precious family had been washed away by the heavenly tasty shake she was being fed with. She ballooned from a scars 140 scrawny little thing to the 200 plus chubby gal she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Phil could see how addicted she was to the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days where he would reduce her feeding, to slow her down, instead of gulping down shake she had started to try to suck it from the hose. Trying her hardest to have as much as she could, and even more beyond that. But, Phil knew that she couldn\u2019t grow too big or Brad would probably lose interest, so he kept alternating her full on days, with days were he was giving her a smaller quantity so he could have her on a good track for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Brad, Angelina. Just came for the usual checkup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina grunted a few times as her maids forced in between her lips slice after slice of cake, she tried to raise her arm to greet the doctor but found herself unable to. This lately had left her quite bewildered but, with so much food surrounding her, her focus didn\u2019t last long on trivial matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad instead slowly managed to raise his arm closing his ham-sized fist in a thumbs up sign, but also him soon found himself tired from that single exercise and gave it up as he opened his mouth to accept more hot dogs and burgers. Christie, instead, overdosed with the weight gain stimulant was blind to anything but food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brad, Angelina. The diet is proving successful and the treatment will continue, but both of you have done huge progress and I\u2019m confident that at year\u2019s end, your marriage can be considered saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there are many that can\u2019t afford, or don\u2019t know ho to ask for help. For them I was thinking to offer some assistance but, I can\u2019t do it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you say to help me in this endeavor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, as the feeding stopped at Phil\u2019s command, burped quite loudly and, after gasping for a while she replied in a deep voice, through ragged for she was starting to have problems to do even the simplest of things at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Y\u2026Ye-he-rsh...\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad instead seemed to think long and hard on it, keeping a scrunched-up face as he downed burger after burger, chewing them hard in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!*\u2026urff\u2026Alright\u2026seems\u2026ok\u2026also\u2026for\u2026me. <br>\r\nYou did\u2026a good\u2026job\u2026with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! I\u2019ll start right away with the preparations. But this doesn\u2019t mean I will stop with the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phil said so, he motioned for the maids to start anew with the feeding and, although Angelina seemed to want to add something else, she quickly found herself unable to talk as her constant feeding started anew. Philodendron had received their agreements and, most important, had it recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he could start to build his paradise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the funds stored in his two new human banks (Brad and Angelina\u2019s bank accounts) he had started the renovations on the mansion so that he could better host many new guests. But, as it always happens, something seemed to put a stop to his grandiose dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently checking the camera feeds, after moving Brand and Angelina, along with Christie, in a more secluded section of the mansion he noticed that the bank accounts of the two actors had been suspended. At first, he thought that there had been a mistake. Between the two of them there had to be enough money to purchase a small nation but, as he checked more in detail he saw a suspension notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Miss Jolie,<br>\r\nAs our client we are terribly sorry to inform you that we\u2019ve had to place your accounts under suspension. As per our security checks it is possible that your bank accounts, and funds, may have been hacked and used for an enterprise for which you weren\u2019t informed. Due to this we\u2019re sending one of our agents to personally contact you since, it has been impossible from our side to contact you by any other means.<br>\r\nHoping that this issue is only a simple misunderstanding,<br>\r\nSincerely yours,<br>\r\n\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil stopped reading, as he began to think on what the easiest solution to this issue could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor obvious reason he couldn\u2019t let this lawyer to see the two over-grown actors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would simply get him arrested and tried to save the two from the path of gluttony upon which he had placed them. But there wasn\u2019t also the time to let the lawyer grow slowly how it had been for Angelina &amp; Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long day of planning, Phil had a half idea on how to deal with this lawyer person. He had only to hope that the person coming wasn\u2019t going to be one of those paranoids who saw troubles and dangers everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, as Phil hastily finished his preparation against the lawyer representative, the doorbell of the mansion sounded and one of the maids informed him that a lawyer was requesting to enter and be shown the owners of the mansion. Phil let out a sigh, clearing his voice from any trembling and went to meet the person. As he entered the salon in which the lawyer was waiting Phil noticed that it was a young man, barely thirty, and was nervously fidgeting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling the good doctor moved forward, greeting him with gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. You must be the Representative from Fitzgerald and Co., isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy turned and politely, albeit nervously, smiled to the doctor shaking his hand and then sitting opposite to him as he began the speech he had prepared for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Yes. I\u2019m Jacob Vanderbird and I\u2019ve been sent by the firm to verify the situation here for two of our best clients, Miss Jolie and Mister Pitt. There have been plenty of expenses in the last week alone and our firm had decided to investigate. <br>\r\nEspecially since most of these expenses have been done in the name of a Philodendron Sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be me. I see your worries but I can assure you that there is nothing illegal going on.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI\u2019ve been employed by Miss Jolie to help her and her husband to keep a solid relationship with each other, something tha was crumbling down before my intervention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expenses have all been agreed first with them, as it is proved by the receipts that my accountant has in ours archive. I will gladly send copy of those to your firm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that solve most of our worries but, we still would like to meet our clients.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, that is a request to that I can\u2019t satisfy as easily. You see both Miss Jolie and Mr. Pitt are currently undergoing long meditation session and cannot be disturbed for any reasons. Through these sessions the feelings they have for each other will be made stronger and so it is essential for them to keep all external influences away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your point. But, we will not unfreeze their capitals until they have been met us. So, you could say, we\u2019re in an impasse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHm. Mister Vanderbird, I think this matter shall be discussed further. Would you join me for a cup of tea? I understand your position, but I wouldn\u2019t work for them if I let anyone through, disturbing them each and every time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly. And I\u2019m sure you will make an exception for me as soon as we discuss it further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following two hours Phil and Jacob discussed about the situation, but, as time passed, Jacob began to feel somewhat strange. He didn\u2019t feel ill, but it was as if he was getting more relaxed. Way too relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026I\u2026I feel warm, all of a sudden\u2026Uh? You\u2026You were saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your point and I would gladly agree but my employers do not wish to be disturbed. Now, If you were <b>easy</b> enough and <b>calm</b> enough we could talk about it in a <b>gentle</b> manner and reach finally a conclusion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil spoke clearly and willingly slow on certain words, knowing full well that the tea he had given to the lawyer was beginning to have its effects. It was a brew he had found to be used in the Amazonian jungles, one that those with his dietary preferences used to let someone willingly agree with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it was needed were certain sounds and a certain emphasis on some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I</b>\u2019m sure we can all <b>agree</b> that if my employer wanted to be disturbed, then <b>Miss Jolie</b> would personally tell you that she <b>is</b> willing to meet you. As she\u2019s <b>healthy</b> of mind and body enough to let you know that.<br>\r\nAlas, there is <b>no</b> way that she will talk with you as she\u2019s still in her meditation chamber. I\u2019m afraid that you shall <b>need to</b> inform your superior about this situation. As we stand there\u2019s really no point in letting this argument to <b>continue</b>.<br>\r\n<b>What do you answer me, Jacob?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I thought\u2026But\u2026She said\u2026I mean, she is healthy so\u2026I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil smiled wickedly as if he could see the memories of the guy change thanks to the hypnotic effect of the tea he had drank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much to it, just a few word here and there. Or, as in this case, he had just calmed him down at first with his \u2018<b>easy; calm; gentle</b>\u2019 and then he had simply began laying the trap emphasizing certain word until they formed a directive for Jacob to follow : \u2018<b>I agree, Miss Jolie is healthy, no need to continue.</b>\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now primed and ready to receive orders and memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Tell me, Jacob. Do you agree?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. She\u2019s as healthy as I could find her. She\u2019s just so busy. We won\u2019t berate her further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Good. Also, Jacob, do you have any family?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019ve got a girlfriend. Our parents are in another state\u2026we rarely see each other nowadays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Good. Listen to me, wait a few weeks and the leave that job. <br>\r\nBring your girlfriend here. You both will live like royalty. You both deserve it.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I will. Yeah. We deserve to live a little. A vacation would do us good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Yes it will, Jacob. Now, return to your bosses. Remember, everything is\u2026?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is clear. Both Miss Jolie and Mr. Pitt are alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2026uh? What just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob Vanderbird felt as if he had just woken up from the quickest nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was feeling some dizziness but, it was already passing so everything had to be ok. Still, he had closed an important job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how long that doctor had tried to prevent him, he still had managed to meet his clients and got their confirmation that everything was in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he felt a little bit embarrassed when they scolded him for the disturbance but, he still felt that he had done his job perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil\u2019s voice shook him from his reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright there, Mr. Vanderbird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Oh yeah. Just a bit dizzy. Thanks a lot Mr. Sweet. Now that I\u2019ve been able to talk with them and assure myself that everything is in order there is no need for further disturbances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, sorry if I ask but, do you still work as a counselor for couples or are you working exclusively for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I could spare some time for some advices\u2026 I\u2019ll talk with Miss Jolie and, in case she agrees, will let my secretary to call you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lawyer went away Phil grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time he used that brew of tea but, it was the first time he had done it to purposely trick someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he needed to do, now, was to call some friends over so that when Jacob would be back with his girlfriend there would be someone able to follow them in their life style change\u2019\u2026 Or could it be better to keep things under the radar for a bit longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices, choices\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
