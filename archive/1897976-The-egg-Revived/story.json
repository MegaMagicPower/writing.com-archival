Looking out the window and seeing that it was still light you decide to go check out one of the home's largest selling feature, the large forest on the edge of the backyard. As it was fall however the \"forest\" was nothing more than empty leave less trees at the moment, the crunch of leaves punctuating each footfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to rest you take a seat on a stump when you hear leaves rustle. Quick as a shot you're looking all around, until a woman steps out from behind a tree, this wasn't a strange thing, you knew you'd have neighbors but the fact she was wearing a full-body silver cloak that covered her face, and was clutching a large 3-foot long pulsing rainbow egg kind of set off a few warning bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could move she was right in front of you shoving the egg into your arms \"protect it with your life\" she says before disappearing as you blinked. You were left stunned, speechless, not even registering the large egg in your arms fir a few seconds, finally you break out of your stupor to stare at it. The egg, giving off warmth as you u held it.

Everything is quite till it gets dark out, then you hear a noise, like an egg cracking. You rush back into the bedroom, large cracks were splitting the egg open and finally in a burst of light the egg opened to reveal....? </span></div></div>",

She has light blue eyes and a black mane, and hooves instead of feet, but she has hands. You guess she is roughly one and a half feet tall, and as you pick up the baby anthro she lets out a quiet whinny and nuzzles your chest, pushing herself further into your warm embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroke her back gently and carry her to your bed, where you sit down and place her in your lap. You are about to think of what to do when you hear the voice of the woman who gave you the egg in your mind, saying, \"She doesn't need to be fed and she doesn't need to drink, or go to the toilet.

Doubled in size overnight? She wakes up and flicks her ears slightly before launching herself at your head, wrapping her arms around your neck and nuzzling you dearly, refusing to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally lets go, you put on a dressing gown before giving her a piggyback to the kitchen, which she thoroughly enjoys if her excited neighing is any indication. You place her down on the floor and grab yourself a banana from the cupboard, when you notice the mare's confused stare at the banana. Chuckling, you peel it, before opening her mouth with a hand and placing the banana inside, before closing her mouth again, telling her to chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does so, and swallows, before grabbing the rest of the banana and stuffing it into her mouth, skin and all. You lightly pat her head and scratch behind her ears before you feel a strange tingling coming from her body, and she inflates and grows until she is three feet and four inches tall. Four inches from a banana? Wow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick her up into a hug, which she gleefully returns, before waiting for you to sit down so she can sit on your lap as you eat. Suddenly, a thought enters your mind. \"You know, I still haven't given you a name. How about Bella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare nods her head enthusiastically before laying back against your slightly smaller feeling chest, content in the feelings it brings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Finally cracking open his eyes he's able to make out that the egg that had been sitting on his bed is gone, however it didn't simply disappear, it was replaced by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Sitting in front of him was a woman, if he had to guess he'd say she was a little over six feet, looking like she was a little, spoiled although it seemed any extra weight she had settled around her breasts and thighs. The aforementioned orbs sitting high and proud on her chest, each breast perfectly round and about the same size as a small beach ball. Her body while being quite...appealing to him, wasn't the strangest thing about the woman before him, rather her dimensions weren't what was strange. From head to toe she was covered in a soft rustic red-brown coat of fur. On that matter she didn't have toes, she had two large cloven hooves rather than feet. Her head as well was different as it looked like a cross between a human head, and a cows head. Her face looking human, two brown eyes staring at him in the middle of the face, but the bottom half of her face extended a few inches ending in the sort of combined, nose/mouth a cow has as well, as well as two large cow ears sat on either side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He didn't realize until she gives a small cough but he had been staring at her for a few seconds. Quickly looking away, the wall suddenly becoming more appealing he hear the bed creak slightly as she moved across, nearly jumping as he felt a large wet tongue lick against his cheek before hearing a gentle moo. He froze, painful memories rushing back as he turned to stare at this strange woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX (flashback)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Alex stared at his parents as they brought in his birthday present, his brothers and he were only 5 years old, first his parents had decided he needed to move out to this dumb smelly farm and now they were presenting him with a calf as a birthday present. \"Her name's Bessie, the three of you will be raising her\" his mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But Mooommmmmmm\" the boys whine in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No buts, this is to teach the three of you how to be responsible\" she states firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"This is in your best interest boys, your mother and I know what's best for you\" his father says backing her up. The three of them sigh, and stare angrily at the calf who stares back at the three of them innocently. Of course it wouldn't go that easily, over the next few months it more or less fell onto their parents shoulders to take care of Bessie as none of them wanted to feed or water the cow, and none of them wished to take care of her....droppings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     This all changed however after nearly a year had passed, Bessie was still technically a calf and Alex had his first crush, her name was Katie Wilson, and she was in his first grade class, of course children being children it didn't quite go as planned when he told her. All she did was take the box of chocolates he offered her and walked away, then for the rest of the day she and her friends tormented him when the teacher wasn't looking. He split away from his brother on the way home, running to the barn in tears, finding the usual haystack at the back of the barn he dived in sobbing, the tears ever flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He just lay there sobbing till he felt a soft weight press on his shoulder, turning around he's greeted with Bessie's face, she gives off a small moo and pushes against him. She forcefully pushes her head between his arms, laying her head down on his lap, her large eyes staring up at him, he tightly hugs her head against his and literally cries himself to sleep. When he wakes up he finds himself pressed against Bessie's stomach, the cow sitting there patiently waiting for him to awaken before gently butting him back into the hay and laying her head down in his lap. He smiled at the calf before him, \"thank you Bessie\" he whispered before hugging her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     From that day on the two of them were inseparable. He willingly took on all the duties relating to Bessie, including picking up and disposing of her droppings. This continued for years, the two of them sharing life's ups and downs, he even fought his father when he said that he wanted to breed Bessie, however his father won out on that in the end. Bessie however didn't...take to the pregnancy, Alex slowly watched her weaken, this deterioration culminating one day a year and a half ago. His brother rushed in and all he had to do was look into his eyes to know something was wrong. Rushing into the barn he found Bessie lying against the same haystack from all those years ago. He was a little surprised that the two of them were alone but that was secondary in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Be...Bessie\" he said slowly approaching her, her head lifted slowly at the sound of his voice. The once shining eyes of his best friend had dulled from their usual bright brown to a much duller one. She gave off a soft moo in greeting; he took her head in his arms and gently hugged it into his chest, enjoying the familiar weight and warmth as she gently butts against him. \"Bessie I'm here girl, you'll be alright I promise\" he said, he swore he felt her shake her head as he said this, her head raising up to his so she could give his cheek a soft long lick, another soft moo gently escaping her lips before he felt all the life just leave her, her head becoming almost dead weight. She had been struggling to stay just so she could say goodbye, \"Bessie\" slowly, painstakingly slowly her eyes started to shut. \"No, no, stay with me Bessie please,\" he plead with her but he could see that it was a losing battle. Her eyes opened for a fraction of a second meeting his, her eyes seeming to light up in that familiar fashion before slowly and finally closing, her final breath escaping her lips. Sitting there for a few moments he was too stunned to even do anything, before it hit him all at once. \"Bessie\" he started to sob burying his face against hers, gently cradling her head against his own even as he felt the heat of her life slowly leave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He stayed like that for a solid hour, weeping over his best friend. Finally he stood up and gently started to pull the cow out of the barn and out to an oak tree nearby, grabbing a shovel he started to dig, it took almost 12 hours for him to dig Bessie's grave, he stared at her body and as gently as he could began to lower her body into the hole. He stared down at her form and simply said \"goodbye Bessie, I'll always remember you girl\" before he started to fill the hole in. He delved into his funds from his job and bought a headstone which should still be sitting under that tree stating for the world to see \"Here lies Bessie, best friend and confidant, the world grew a little darker with her passing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXXXX (flashback over)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He stared at the woman before him as she waits patiently for him to come out of whatever trance he had been in. \"Hello Alex, I've missed you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Bessie\" he cried hugging her as tightly as he could practically burying himself in her chest. \"How? What? Why?\" he said his eyes never once leaving hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Someone up there didn't think it was fair we were separated, so they let me come back, although I had to wait to make sure you'd never forget me\" Bessie replies gently returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Bessie of course I'd never forget you\" he replied as he felt her gently start to rub his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know\" she replies softly, \"I promise I'll never leave you again\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Knowing that rabbits liked carrots, I grabbed one for her. It wasn't anything too large for her, just about half her height. Heading back, I handed her the piece, and she happily started chewing on it. As she took her first gulp, her feet started shuttering, before stretching to an inch long. She and I looked at her feet in awe, before she smiled and started eating more of the carrot, eyeing her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each gulp, her furry feet grew a bit larger, finally, after finishing the carrot, her feet had grown enormous, for her size at least.

She had dark grey fur, a completely black horn, and orange hair flowing from the top of her head and in small tufts around her wrists and ankles that glowed with a bizarre light, making it look like flame. She also had hooves instead of feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can gather your thoughts, the unicorn begins to vibrate, and with a sound like stretching and squeaking latex, begins to grow. Her growth spurt is powerful, but stops in a matter of seconds, as she stands up, a little unsteady. She towers over your height of six foot by a full eight inches, beachball sized breasts accidentally pushing into your face, forcing you to take a few steps back before you can actually see her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNickering, she seems to notice the massive size difference between you, and takes a single step forward, the loud boom of her hoof connecting with the floor resounding throughout the room. She kneels to put herself at the same height as you, then stands back up, savouring her height of six foot eight inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she hugs you, easily lifting you almost almost a foot off the floor, accidentally pushing your face into one of her gigantic breasts, each of which is far larger than your head. Smiling, she sits down and places you on her lap, as you try to understand the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you want to continue this storyline, or start a new one?</span></div></div>",

Glad to know its back! :)</span></div></div>",
