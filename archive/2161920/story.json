            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thud! Theo felt the pain of his cheek hitting against the ground spread all across his face. It was pretty late when Theo went home that night. He was so caught up helping Coach Wilson clean up after guy football match that he lost track of time. He already was past his curfew and hoped that a cut through the park would speed things along, even if he'd expect a yelling once he got home.<br>\r\nBut the one thing he didn't expect was being jumped in the park. Jack Dale was the towns local nuisance; despite being the son of the town mayor, Jack caused a ruckus in the streets, fucked any girl he wanted, but primarily tormented you. <br>\r\nJack kept hitting you at the side, hoping you'd bleed. But after countless beatings your scrawny body has become durable enough to withstand his ferocious foot. That was until he lifted you into the air, \"What do we have here? Poor little Theo scurrying to his next booty call perhaps. Gonna please someone with your sweet ass,\" Jack laughed as he slapped your behind. <br>\r\nYou pushed him away and jerked back, you were going to bolt when you realized that Jack wasn't alone with you. \"Just leave me alone!\u201d you shout but its too late as all four of them come after you, taking your bag and ripping your clothes a little. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\nHumiliated and disgusted you made the journey home, covered in dirt and blood, your bag stolen and your clothes ripped. What else can go wrong! \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n Well sadly it did, after climbing into your bedroom window on the second floor cause your keys were in your stolen bag. The moment you did the lights flashed on and there was your father giving you his trademark stare. <br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what time it is and what happened to you!?\u201d he shouted.\t\t  <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was on my way home and I got mugged in the park,\u201d you replied. The moment he heard this his personality just switched like a light, instead of his tormentor father figure mode he entered the dotting dad phase. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay son! Do you want me to call the police?\u201d he asked as he helped you onto your bed to clean up your wounds. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cIts fine it was just some boys from school playing a silly prank, they\u2019ll probably give my stuff back tomorrow.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWho son? I\u2019ll call there dads and give them hell.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n\u201cIts fine, I just don\u2019t want to get into any more trouble dad.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                      \t<br>\r\n         Once he finished helping you clean up, he tucked you in bed like he once did when you were a child and left your room. You stared off into the night sky, wondering how much more miserable you\u2019d have to be to get your happily ever after. Frankly, the way your life was going it probably never even happen. That\u2019s when you realized, your not going to enjoy being Theo. You\u2019d better off being someone else, somebody with a better chance at life. You didn\u2019t want to stray too far, just another guy, only cause you didn\u2019t know how it was to be a girl. But really anyone. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a single star streaked across the sky, you quickly closed your eyes and made your wish. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to be me. I wish I could become anyone I wanted to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe next morning, you woke up feeling so nauseating. Your entire body was burning up and sometime in the night you decided to take off all your covers. But despite sleeping in you pajamas you realized that you were completely naked. Your clothes were folded on your dresser in a neatly fashion as if you had gotten up to do it yourself some time in the night. But there was something rather peculiar about it, a written note was folded on top of it all. You quickly stood up and read it immediately.\t\t\t<br>\r\nDear Theo,<br>\r\n\tApologies that you were stripped naked.  For you to receive this blessing of a power you couldn\u2019t be wearing your own clothes, or your new powers would back fire and you\u2019d be stuck as Theo. Either way congratulations. We have heard your wish and decided to grant it immediately. If you wear your own clothes you will be Theo, the but the moment you put on the clothing of another man you will become them. Get it? Its simple, you put on their clothes your body changes to there\u2019s. You might be asking, where do they go? Well they simply become your stand in, they change it to you and live your. Its up for you to decide if they show know the truth or not. There is one problem to your powers, sadly we can only limit to men for now. But if you so wish to become a woman your powers shall grow over time. Either way, we hope that you enjoy your new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith sincere thanks<br>\r\n-\tYour shooting star<br>\r\nOddly for things to happen like this, you definetly didn\u2019t think this was fake. So, the only logical way to figure it out was try it. But the question was, on who?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick is the good looking jock at school who everyone loves, girls fawn over him, people bow to him, and the teachers let him walk all over them. He's still a smart guy and aiming for a football or hockey scholarship. Despite being such a great person, he still has time to be with you. You were always curious on what it was like to be him, so why not give him a shot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Dale: This time its your turn to cause some pain. As Jack you can turn the tides into your favor and really fuck up his life. Jack was at the top of the food chain at school you could cause some real trouble as him. But more importantly Jack has influence over the entire school, this could be your chance to stop all the bullying. Plus it helps that there's the added bonus of having an extremely hot girlfriend to fuck and being the rich mayors son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew Borno: A physics geek, Matt isn't necessarily a bad guy to switch into. His grades are phenomenal and has the option to go to any top school of his choice. Matt might be a good option if he you really want to just live a normal happy life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also try switching bodies with a teacher, although they won't be easy as they don't have clothes lying around and it would be rather creepy of them to strip for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

That is something that you'd have to figure out, I'm only a simple story-teller (Haha right) Now, you want a Man a real Man's Man, so will just have to give you some options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris: Your father was a family man alright, a supervisor for a factory your father is the pinnacle of blue-collar goodness. He was the tall, bald-headed, big beard burly types. Despite that, he was a teddy bear at heart, he loved all his children equally, even though he did show a lot of pride in your older brother. Because of this, he's very ashamed of himself if one of them isn't being loved enough. The one thing you really wanted to do was spend time with your dad, something he never had time for. Maybe go camping or something. (47 years old) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: Your older brother, college-bound with a baseball scholarship. Your older brother was actually quite protective of you, he was one of the many who hated how your parents tended to play favourites. He's pretty much raised you when your parents did, maybe it was your time to take care of him. You knew that Will was struggling at school, maybe you could give him a break by taking over his college life for a bit (20 years old) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Harrison: The husband of Mrs. Harrison who lives across the street, Mr. Harrison owned a brewery nearby and was rather rich. He always gave the greatest presents to you when it was your birthday. You never knew why but maybe it was the regret in his eyes that he never had a son of his own. It might be rather hard to get him, but maybe you could use him to get to his wife or even just have fun running your own business (65 years old) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Burgett: Ho-boy! Now even as a bisexual, this man you lusted over. There was just something about this dang family that made you want to be any of them. Not only was Peter a smoking hot firefighter but he was an avid pilot who flew his small plane around the state. He once flew a passenger plane to Mexico with you, William, and your dad to join him and his friends for the bachelor party. He's young so he has a lot of young friends with bodies to be taking, Peter also will give you easy access to some other firemen as well as guys at the gym. But he'll even give you access to Rachel his beautiful wife and infant son. (25 years old)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now you have some options to give it a shot, such as your mother or your annoying sister but there were also some in the streets you can give a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda: A kind women, she's the money maker of the family compared to his father. Brenda was a stubborn and headstrong, something she took pride in. Her fiery attitude was something she took out in at her kickboxing class at the Gym. She tends to be healthy and tries to keep her children healthy as well. Like your father, Brenda tended to lean towards your sister while ignoring you. To her, your brother was her pride and joy while your sister was just like her. Sometimes it was like she never even knew you were there. Maybe you could give her a shot and give her your own lesson? (Dark hair, 45-year-old woman)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail: It's surprising that you're related to her. Your charming sister is an avid dancer and the most popular girl in middle school. She's loud and obnoxious and makes it her sole duty to annoy you. (11 years old)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Harrison: The neighbour across the street, this early-retired woman is constantly giving your baked goods. She never had children of her so maybe it was why she's so nice to you. Compared to your sister and mother, you really didn't have a personal vendetta against her. She really an open book, you could use her to try the powers or even use her to get close to her attractive husband who does make bank. Up to you. (65 years old) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Burgett: Your neighbour beside you, Rachel was still a young mother with her newly born son. She worked as a nurse at the hospital while her husband saved lives as a firefighter. They were the perfect cookie cutter family. The only reason you'd want to become her is probably just for the looks, Rachel was very attractive, it was no wonder her husband Peter liked. You could also use her to get to Peter, or even try out your powers on her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">First I would like to give a sincere apology to all the authors who had written chapters in the original Clothing Body Swap, I know a lot of you put a lot of hard work into them and they were very detailed asI read over them over the years and was inspired everyday. To tell you guys the truth I messed up big time and accidentally deleted the original copy and then purged it from recycle bin without looking. I was attempting to clean up the interactive and re-write old chapters of mine when It happen. I mean maybe this is a good thing as Clothing Body Swap was never as popular Body possession Powers. So, I'm going to add a few new changes to this new interactive. Overall, I apologize greatly and urge you to write new chapters within this interactive along side me. This was my first interactive and it be a shame if I can't return it to its former glory, if not better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are Theo a seventeen year old Senior in high school. He's an average kid, but is terribly bullied at school. As a result his parents shun him from the spotlight, favoring his siblings over him. <br>\r\n-One day you wish upon a star and wake up with the power to change into other men. With experience you might be able to turn into women. <br>\r\n-Now its up to Theo on how he'll use this new found power of his, whether its with great responsibility or to cause hell you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGround Rules...<br>\r\n-Theo can have sex with all genders, go wild! he's attracted to all of the SEXES<br>\r\n-Theo's original body can't die as he needs something to fall back on, if it does die well make the story line interesting at least and not some bullshit like: \"Oh no Theo's body died, well guess I'll have boobs for days\" <br>\r\n-Theo's powers should evolve as the interactive goes along so maybe think of adding some special skills he can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheo's powers...<br>\r\n-At this moment, Theo's powers are simple as putting on a glove (Literally)<br>\r\n-Theo Simply has to strip off his clothes and pull on an article of clothing of the other man.<br>\r\n-Overtime he will be able to change into women but make it interesting in how learns to do it. <br>\r\n-Its up to Theo to decide whether the other person retains consciousness of who they are. This is decided through consent, if Theo asks then they remember but if he steals the clothing then its oblivious. <br>\r\n-If any of you add any upgrades to his powers and I see it, Ill add the chapter number here so that if any person chooses to go to your route they can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall please have fun and thank you for reading/writing/joining this interactive!</td>",
