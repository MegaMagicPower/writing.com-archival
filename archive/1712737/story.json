Moonlight shone off of the oddly skinned creature as he glided towards the ground, comfortably landing before continuing his search through the numerous books.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's got to be something here I haven't seen yet.\" he spoke to himself quietly, as if keeping with the rules of an open library.  Green clawed hands traced over the spines of various books, varying in ages and sizes, nothing the gargoyle had not read or caught his interest in the least.  His tail flicked the ground and waved behind him as he looked up and down, side to side, his large eyes glistening in the light.  Finally they lit up, Lexington grabbed at an old, thick book that seemed to be rotting away where it sat on the book racks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one looks interesting!\" he said happily, the gargoyle pulled the book free, opening it and listening to the binding crack and watching small flecks of old paper and dust falling free.  \"No one's touched this in years!\" Lexington was almost overjoyed.  He studied the book from cover to cover, admiring the age on the pages, the smell of the old book, it had to be chock full of new information.  Pleased with his find, the gargoyle climbed as high as he could, through the window from which he'd originally entered and hurried himself to the roof of the old building.  There he sat, his excitement having gotten the better of him as he simply could not wait before getting back home to begin checking his borrowed book.  Again he opened the heavy book, the pleasant cracking sending a shiver through his spine. and there he began to truly check out the contents of the pages within.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexington's claws traced the pages as he looked at old written text, drawings, tables, charts...and much to his surprise... \"Spells?\" he said aloud, his fingers stopping on a series of phrases and notations.  Lexington smirked, his lower teeth jutting out from behind his lower lip, he traced his claw along one of the incantations and mindlessly spoke it as he read.  The gargoyle shook suddenly, his head spinning, Lexington dropped the book and held onto his bald head.  \"Ugh.\" he groaned, closing his eyes, tail thumping the ground behind him...his cheeks bulged, growing rounder and then...\"Buuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nugh...\" Lexington hiccuped, all of a sudden feeling just fine once more.  \"That was strange.\" he said, rubbing his temples.  \"I had better get home...\" almost in a defeated manner.  The green gargoyle leaned forward, grasping at the dropped book before a sudden explosion of gas belted from his rear end.  He clenched his teeth, eyes wide with surprise, he grabbed the book and stood up, his tail flicking the air as his cheeks cooled down.  \"Just nerves.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexington's stomach gurgled audibly in response to that thought.   He placed his hand over his lithe belly before finding the need to crease himself, his tail lifting as the pressure mounted behind his sphincter.  *BRRRRRRPPPPT*  The heat billowed in his loincloth, Lex blushed as he straightened himself and gripped the book tight against his chest, he bit his lower lip as his tail again fanned the gas around behind him.  \"What in the world?\"</span></div></div>",

Lexington's green tail and rear end held high into the night sky as a cheek-slapping fart exploded free.  He groaned as he rolled onto his side, gripping his middle, another puff of gas breaking free.  Lexington rubbing his stomach, his eyes widening as his cheeks bulged with yet another healthy loud belch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening.\" he whimpered. clutching his sides and squeezing his eyes shut, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked across the dark rooftop, eying the old book he'd borrowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be an answer...mmph...mmph...BUUURP...there!\" Lexington spat.  His tail flicked as he rolled back onto his knees, grabbing in an almost panicked manner at the book and pulling it close, scraping the old cover across the gravel and dirt.  Lex's claw traced the pages, attempting to find the spell he'd read, and anything that might undo whatever he'd done.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...mmph...no...\" his cheeks bulged again, Lex barely had time before another massive burp erupted, spittle flung into the air and across the book, pages blew in the wind.  Lex huffed and gasped, wiping drool from his bottom lip as he found the page he was looking for.  Lex's eyes darted from letter to letter.  \"These spells, I can't make any of them out.\" he half-moaned, then grimaced noticeably as a thick fart rumbled from his rear end, followed by a musical squeak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no more!\" he slapped his palm against the pages and began reading the spells aloud, praying he'd find the counter spell.  Again darkness came, Lex's eyes burned as the stars, the city lights, everything spun and encircled him, and then there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his bald head, his eyes opened and closed slowly, readjusting to the night.  The bright full moon met his upward gaze, Lex lay atop the roof, flat on his back with his arms and wings splayed across the gravel.  \"Ughn...did it work?\" he spoke to himself, rubbing his eyes as he sat up, only to have his heart sink.  \"NO!\" he spat, as the moonlight brought his green flesh into view, Lexington's jaw hung wide looking himself over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what did that?  Those spells!\"  The small gargoyle stared at his now plump frame, heavy flesh jiggled over his arms, his thighs and newly swollen rear end strained his loincloth, his meaty tail swung heavily as he stood stationary, lifting, prodding, pulling on his fatty body.  \"This is impossible!\" he grabbed the two-handfuls of his belly and jiggled it,  His thickened clawed hands grabbed at his legs, at his quivering chest, his neck.  \"What did I READ?\" he yelped, feeling his jowls wobble.  The gargoyle felt like he could cry, things couldn't possibly get worse than this, he thought.  His fatty stomach gurgled, and Lexington leaned forward, tugging on his ill-fitting loincloth, tearing the fabric from around his bloated tail and exposing his heavy, green, jiggling rear to the cool air, and ripping a satisfyingly loud fart.</span></div></div>",

Lexington was petrified, but that was soon broken by a loud belch that erupted from the gargoyle's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned from both pain and oddly pleasure as a fart, much stronger then the last, exploded from his rear.

It was massive. He could tell that it was resting on its blue whale-sized stomach and its ass even bigger. It seemed to be farting as well, as tiny villagers stood around the blob of beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of panic, Lex read the first spell he could find, hoping it would do the trick. All the spells were written in an odd language so it was hard to tell. He began chanting the spell, but a humongous burp interrupted his reading. Nothing seemed to happen for a little bit. And then-<br>\r\nPBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTTTT!!! He let out the crudest fart yet. So loud it shook the ground he was sitting on. Suddenly the gargoyle's body began to swell again, but this time it was mainly his ass. He fell onto his belly and his eyes teared up because of the fowl smell of his farts and burps. He grabbed his basketball-sized asscheeks for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-someone URRRRRRRRRRPPP h-h-elp meeeeeeeeeeeeee PLLLLBBBBBBBBBBTTTTTTTT!\" He cried into the open night as he began to transform into a blob. </span></div></div>",

A grumbling noise fills the air, followed by a near orgasmic moan.  Behind a massive dented trash dumpster sits a plump, blue hued, gargoyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuurrrrp!\" Broadway's cheeks puffed and blew out, followed by a long sigh.  There he sat, fat stomach fully distended, greasy pizza crusts, crumbs, sauce, and cheese littering his bloated frame.  His fingers stroked his stuffed self, trailing along the swell, letting his claws slide carefully across so as not to burst himself.  Finally he dug two fingers from both hands into his tight navel, prodding and pushing inside, putting his girth in enough straight to cause his cheeks to puff up once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUURRRRRRRP.  Uhn...Luigi's out done himself tonight.\" Broadway gasped in his deep voice between belly heaves.  He pulled a hand free of his blue belly and slapped at a nearby, old pizza box.  Once in his grasp he pulled it close, flipped the lid and frowned to see no more slices.  Pushing the torn box back from whence it came, he grunted and slapped at another box at his other side, this time hitting gold.  \"Mmm, double cheese and jalapeno...noone makes it like you do Luigi.\" He gripped the smashed slice of pizza and lowered it into his awaiting maw.  His thick tail slid from side to side happily as he chewed and chomped on the day-old pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor weeks Broadway had been raiding the local pizza joint's dumpster for the surprising amount of still edible pizza they continued to throw away.  His already large frame took it's time with the calories, but with the constant overload Broadway's bulk simply began to pack it on and on.  Broadway grunted, suckling his fingers for any remaining tasty cheese, and the second half of all this pizza binging began it's course for the night.  A quick stomach bubble, a tail twitch, and...\"FFFFRRRRRRP....FRRP...PRP...TRRRP.\"  Broadway shivered, he moaned and sank against the brick alley wall, the heat of his gas still warming his inner thighs and just under his belly.  All this greasy, garlic-ridden, gloppy food had tripled the amount of flatulence the fat gargoyle had ever produced, but the taste was worth the price.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroadway smiled, licking his plump lips as his nostrils flared from his own scent filling the alley, one of these days he'd have to put an actual order in for Luigi's, rather than feed off half-eaten pizza boxes.  But, there he sat, stroking his fat belly, letting his fingers slide under the girthy ball and lift it, only to drop it and let it bounce and slap his fat thighs.  \"Wuh-oh.\" he grunted, rocking himself until he was on his side, one arm holding his stuffed belly, the other quickly tugging down his loincloth, thanking himself for having the foresight to undo his belt earlier, the gargoyle's massive blue rear end was quickly exposed to the New York air.  His tail lifted free as another explosive wave of flatulence filled the alley.  Several long gassy minutes went by, Broadway simply stroked his quivering, jiggling ass cheeks, farting loud and proud, his thick wind billowing against and through his fingers.</span></div></div>",
