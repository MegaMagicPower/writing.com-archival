You don't know where you are exactly since this place feels so unfamiliar. You navigate yourself across the grass to find out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw something huge above you. Unfortunately you can barely see what it is due to the grass blades blocking your view but you could see that it's some sort of red structure. While you tried to find a suitable spot to view this thing, you soon found yourself in a stone path. Not only you got out of the grass, but you could also see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this...\" you said in disbelief. Right above you was an humongus torii standing at several feet (at least to you) from the ground. From what you learn about Japan, a torii is a type of structure that serves as a gateway to the Shinto shrine; acting like a transition between the mortal and spirit world in Shinto religion. You were surprised to see something like this in front of your eyes which cause you to think that you were in a gigantic version of Japan. You look ahead to see what looks like a Shinto shrine so maybe you could go and find help. Unfortunately, you have no idea if they could understand you since you are in Japan. Of course, that won't mean you could stay here any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

That's good, you wouldn't have to go inside and find someone there. You try to get a good look at who was the owner of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner appears to be a young lady who resembles a witch of some sort. She has long blond hair that was covered by a stereotypical witch hat, a black and white buttoned-up dress with puffy sleeves, and black mary-jane shoes. Looking at her, you now know why there's a house in a forest. You know that witches tend to live far away from society and often in wooded areas like this so it made sense. What you don't know however is that if she's friendly or not. Witches can be either good or bad so you hope that she'll be nice enough to use her magic to turn you back to normal-size unless she has that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the witch carries a broomstick on her hand and say \"Alright, it's time for me to go.\" You realized that she's going somewhere else and is going to leave you behind. You could try to go and hitch a ride on her broom to get her attention along the way, but that's too dangerous. You may try to go and wait inside her house til she comes back, but you don't know how long will it take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

This could be dangerous because you could get stepped on by her shoe, but you went on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally made it, you make a running leap of faith while having your eyes shut at the moment you made your jump.

Sadly, you don't know how to get back to your world, but at least you can leave this place before Seija gets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis box is covered in velvet so this is not going to be easy. You latch onto the soft wall and make your way up. You definitely predicted this as you were constantly falling off, but you went on to fight for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took alot of time than you expected, but you managed to get on top of the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Occasionally, you can see it shift a little from time to time. You decided to be a little risky and poke the fish tail. It felt sleekly and smooth, and even a bit squishy. That's not all though, it reacted to your touch by slightly wiggling side to side before being still again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still curious on this mysterious creature you found.

Looking around, it made this place feel like you are in a castle or a palace.

Normally it's invisible from the eyes of those in the outside world and only certain methods can be used to enter.\" She explained \"So it seems that you are currently in need of shelter so therefore, you'll be staying with me for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess that's good.\" You said, agreeing with the fact that you wouldn't be able to survive on your own in an unknown world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked you up and puts you on her shoulder. \"Would you like for me to show you around?\" Satori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, please.\" You answered as she shows you around her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a tour to many different rooms such as the parlor, the kitchen, the bathroom, and when she shows you to the balcony, you notice that the sky looks kinda dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is because we are under the surface of Gensokyo so it always get dark here, even by day.\" She explained who once again, read your thoughts; you decided not to ask any question from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, she then shows you to another bedroom. The bedroom looked like it belonged to a young child with some toys spread around it and child-like drawings on the walls. Despite how it looks, it felt like it was cold and little lonely, letting you wonder why it was this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSay satori, do you have brother or sister?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, I have a little sister name Koishi. She have an ability to manipulate unconsciousness.\u201d Satori answers your question, \u201cShe haven\u2019t been here for while.\u201d You noticed her face slowly change to a frown, looking sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel lonely?\u201d You asked her. While you can't read minds like Satori, you can tell that she is deeply sadden by your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOf course! Why wouldn\u2019t I miss her!? I haven\u2019t seen her for 6 months!\u201d Satori replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It broke your heart as if you had brother or sister and didn\u2019t see them for 6 months you would be sad as well. You noticed her now anguished face and got up, came to her, and petted her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s just pray she\u2019ll be back soon satori.\u201d You replied while trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed you as her tears came down and closed her eyes, petting your head with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you, for cheering me up.\u201d Satori replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo problem.\u201d You said, you're glad that you are able to make Satori happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then...</span></div></div>",

You then realized that she also doesn't look human as you noticed two tails coming from behind her and cat ears on her head. You suddenly smelled the bad odor from the pushcart and after looking what's inside it, you discovered it has a lot of corpses in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm..yes iron. You have gotten plenty today.\u201d Satori replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes I have!\u201d The catgirl said with smile, then noticed you. \u201cHey, who\u2019s he?\u201d You hide from her sight, fearing that she'll eat you since cats have a natural instinct of hunting down small creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, he\u2019s our guest.\" Satori said. She then whispers to you. \"It's okay, she won't eat you; just tell her your name.\" She read your thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSid.\u201d You replied, coming into her view \u201cSid tenancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright, Mr.tenancy, she\u2019s Rin Kaenbyo, one of my pet I have.\u201d Satori replied. \"As you can see, she's tasked to collect corpses and materials for the blazing fires of hell.\" You're not going to go further into that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNice to know you Mr.Tenancy.\u201d Rin replied with smile, \u201cJust call me Orin if you want to, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cS-sure?\u201d You replied. Although Orin seemed to be safe around, you are still quite nervous around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how did you got here in Gensokyo? And why are you so small?\" Rin asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..I don't know how I got so small.\" You answered. \"All I know that I got here from a portal I found in the bushes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well you should be careful around here as this place is full of youkai. They're mythical creatures that dwells around here.\u201d Orin said. \u201cSome are nice, but a lot of are bad folks.\u201d You shivered at the thought of being eaten by a monstrous yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as your here, you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d Satori said, \u201cIf you need to go out, I\u2019ll ask Orin to help you go out.\u201d You felt relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do that, but I'm busy with the corpses here; see you Satori.\" Said Rin as she left the scene<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that...</span></div></div>",

Having PTSD flashbacks of that one time you inadvertently found a very hyperactive africanized honey bee nest, you quickly curl up into a ball and hope it'll be quick cuz you cant outrun those bastards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you suffered no stings. That loud buzzing wasnt even from bees. They were actually fireflies. It was pitch black in the middle of this wide open field that seemed to go on for miles with only the majestic glow from the swarms of fireflies to light the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mesmerizing watching the tiny little nights dance about illuminating the darkness like the super bright lit up signs all over Las Vegas. All it needed was some catchy upbeat music to play in the background and you could watch this spectacle all night, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until one of those hundreds and hundreds of fireflies stopped in the middle of their flying and landed just near you! It was then you learned that you were shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firefly was huge. HUGE! Like as big a horse! Big and freakishly ugly like most insects at close range! You gazed in horror hopefully outside of it's sight (though you couldnt tell cuz it's thousands of optical orbs were looking all directions!) as it stopped to groom it's antennae. As much as you wanted to question where you are and what happened to your size, that was currently on the backburner as your primary focus was trying to avoid being detected by ANY of these giant fireflies, let alone the one just in front of you! You had no idea they if were carnivorous and you did not wanna take any chances (and if you DID know, you'd be even MORE terrified!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that huge firefly quickly became the least of your problems as well! Because you were distracted by the bug, you didnt see the even more colossal figure fly toward you until a very large shoe landed on the grass near where youre standing! The big firefly quickly flew away, not so much out of fear, but out of convenience for the titanic figure now in view!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you stood a humongous green-haired girl in a white shirt, blue bloomers, and a black cape (with a red interior). You wouldnt have thought of her THAT out of the ordinary if you didnt notice the antennae sticking out of her green hair! And they werent for show either. They twitched!  And after they twitched, you watched with utmost attention while the fireflies buzzed circles around her, again you were unable to avert your eyes from the glow. Especially from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally, she was glowing! You gazed with disbelief and an awful bit of intrigued as her hips shined a bright light in the same flashing pattern as the fireflies surrounding her. Shamed to say it took a little more effort than it should of to snap you out of it! This colossal girl you were glancing up at was a bonna fide bug girl! Not a girl who was fascinated with bugs, but a girl who actually WAS a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinating discovery if you werent the size of an ACTUAL bug! Priorities, man. You were in need of desperate help and you desperately wanted help desperately! Your first thought would be the get the giant bug girl's attention.<br>\r\nBut then the second reminded you that she was a bug girl. Not a human girl. BUG GIRL. To other creatures, you were no longer at the top of the foodchain and since you were already worried about being firefly food, you oughta most certainly be worried about being bug girl food too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, she doesnt seem to be FERAL bug girl what with wearing such humanish clothes and such, so maybe talking her into helping you wouldnt be THAT unreasonable, right?</span></div></div>",

Just like that, the bug grabs you by it's front legs and carries you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, put me down!\" You protested. You have no idea what this creature wants to do you. By the looks of it, the firefly appears to be bringing you to the giant girl because it was flying right towards her face. You realized that these bugs act like some sort of servants to her, almost like their queen. Maybe it's trying to have you shown and examined by her due to being such a strange \"bug\". Finally, you are now looking at this bizarre young giantess' face that is now in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that you are holding there, Miss Natsume?\" asked the girl. Being so up close, you were slightly blown by her breath and it only got more intimating when she set her huge blue eyes on you, trying to see what her firefly friend has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt absolutely terrified by this point. One is that you are being held up from hundreds of feet in the air, two is that are now at the mercy of this girl, and third you have no idea what is going to happen if she spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to wait because you can see her huge pupils now staring right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Is this a person?\" She said and lowers her hand from below you.

Only one way to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to put more effort when writing a chapter and make sure it's a paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Any fetish is allowed, but make sure they don't distant themselves from the main story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The character is tiny enough to be unnoticed; however awareness is also allowed but try to get out details on how he/she get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The character can have any sort of personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  You can end the story but don't try to do it so very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Death is allowed but put some effort on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. All the Touhou character's personalities are the same like they are (or at least how the majority the fandom often portrayed them) in the games. Don't go out of character unless there's a reason behind the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.The character is not some random fan, gamer, or anything like that. So he/she has no single knowledge about the Touhou series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
