You remembered that you were walking down the street when suddenly, you come across a odd portal in the bushes. The portal was purple with creepy eyes inside and red ribbons on each side.

You don't know where you are exactly since this place feels so unfamiliar. You navigate yourself across the grass to find out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw something huge above you. Unfortunately you can barely see what it is due to the grass blades blocking your view but you could see that it's some sort of red structure. While you tried to find a suitable spot to view this thing, you soon found yourself in a stone path. Not only you got out of the grass, but you could also see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this...\" you said in disbelief. Right above you was an humongus torii standing at several feet (at least to you) from the ground. From what you learn about Japan, a torii is a type of structure that serves as a gateway to the Shinto shrine; acting like a transition between the mortal and spirit world in Shinto religion. You were surprised to see something like this in front of your eyes which cause you to think that you were in a gigantic version of Japan. You look ahead to see what looks like a Shinto shrine so maybe you could go and find help. Unfortunately, you have no idea if they could understand you since you are in Japan. Of course, that won't mean you could stay here any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

That's good, you wouldn't have to go inside and find someone there. You try to get a good look at who was the owner of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner appears to be a young lady who resembles a witch of some sort. She has long blond hair that was covered by a stereotypical witch hat, a black and white buttoned-up dress with puffy sleeves, and black mary-jane shoes. Looking at her, you now know why there's a house in a forest. You know that witches tend to live far away from society and often in wooded areas like this so it made sense. What you don't know however is that if she's friendly or not. Witches can be either good or bad so you hope that she'll be nice enough to use her magic to turn you back to normal-size unless she has that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the witch carries a broomstick on her hand and say \"Alright, it's time for me to go.\" You realized that she's going somewhere else and is going to leave you behind. You could try to go and hitch a ride on her broom to get her attention along the way, but that's too dangerous. You may try to go and wait inside her house til she comes back, but you don't know how long will it take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Somewhat lucky, the witch starts to run herself to catch some speed in order to use the broom. This could be dangerous because you could get stepped on by her shoe, but you went on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally made it, you make a running leap of faith while having your eyes shut at the moment you made your jump.

However, what really got your attention was a nearby table that towered over you, making you feel like an insect around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander forward in hopes you find some help around here or maybe some shelter around here. You don't know much about this place. All you could know was a clue in form of a painting which features a young girl with blue hair and scarlet eyes which was a little bit unsettling to you. Unfortunately, you couldn't see what's outside due to your size but you can tell that it was slowly getting dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you found a large door that must've lead to a room of some sort.

All the shelves towered over you like skyscrapers and floor was the streets that spread among the buildings. You walk forwards through the center space of the two shelves and can't help but feel impressed by how many books are around here.

She wears a black dress with white sleeves and a red bowtie. She has a pair of gray tights and black shoes. Just by looking at here, you can tell that she isn't human. In her arms, she's carrying books and putting them in the shelves.

By the looks of it, she appears to be the size of a doll, but you are still much smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that you already got food for yourself?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Sukuna, I just found this little human on my sandal and I already planning to eat him.\" said Seija.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSukuna then floated towards you and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please tell your friend that I'm not her lunch?\" You asked her. Sukuna looks at her friend with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seija, I just work very hard making dinner for both of us. As an inchling, you know this not as easy as you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I haven't got any human prey in a while. Just let me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seija...\" Sukuna looks at her with a serious expression; you're not sure if she's trying to save your skin or she really wants Seija to eat the food she made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Seija pouts and throws you into a small box in a table; you can tell she did this on purpose so that the next time she's finished, she'll come for you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left the room, you make your plan to escape. Sadly, you don't know how to get back to your world, but at least you can leave this place before Seija gets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis box is covered in velvet so this is not going to be easy. You latch onto the soft wall and make your way up. You definitely predicted this as you were constantly falling off, but you went on to fight for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took alot of time than you expected, but you managed to get on top of the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The fins you saw are at the tip of the tail and you haven't seen any other fins on it. The strange thing is that the head and the rest of the body is submerged underwater, but the tail is still peaking out. This really puzzled you alot to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go and try to see what it was, but it seemed to dangerous to approach water at this size. So the only thing left to do is to check out the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the tail and stare at it a bit. It's pretty still and motionless, not moving for a bit. Occasionally, you can see it shift a little from time to time. You decided to be a little risky and poke the fish tail. It felt sleekly and smooth, and even a bit squishy. That's not all though, it reacted to your touch by slightly wiggling side to side before being still again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still curious on this mysterious creature you found. Maybe you can take a risk and find out what it looks like. You could go and take a peek underwater. However, your eyes are still glued to it's tail. You couldn't help but feel like taking an even closer look on it; you even feel the need to have some bit of fun with it. You know this is going to be kinda dangerous, but you really have a weird fondness for squishy things to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pounding pain in your head quickly subsides as soon as you heard the loud noise of buzzing. Lot of buzzing! Having PTSD flashbacks of that one time you inadvertently found a very hyperactive africanized honey bee nest, you quickly curl up into a ball and hope it'll be quick cuz you cant outrun those bastards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you suffered no stings. That loud buzzing wasnt even from bees. They were actually fireflies. It was pitch black in the middle of this wide open field that seemed to go on for miles with only the majestic glow from the swarms of fireflies to light the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mesmerizing watching the tiny little nights dance about illuminating the darkness like the super bright lit up signs all over Las Vegas. All it needed was some catchy upbeat music to play in the background and you could watch this spectacle all night, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until one of those hundreds and hundreds of fireflies stopped in the middle of their flying and landed just near you! It was then you learned that you were shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firefly was huge. HUGE! Like as big a horse! Big and freakishly ugly like most insects at close range! You gazed in horror hopefully outside of it's sight (though you couldnt tell cuz it's thousands of optical orbs were looking all directions!) as it stopped to groom it's antennae. As much as you wanted to question where you are and what happened to your size, that was currently on the backburner as your primary focus was trying to avoid being detected by ANY of these giant fireflies, let alone the one just in front of you! You had no idea they if were carnivorous and you did not wanna take any chances (and if you DID know, you'd be even MORE terrified!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that huge firefly quickly became the least of your problems as well! Because you were distracted by the bug, you didnt see the even more colossal figure fly toward you until a very large shoe landed on the grass near where youre standing! The big firefly quickly flew away, not so much out of fear, but out of convenience for the titanic figure now in view!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you stood a humongous green-haired girl in a white shirt, blue bloomers, and a black cape (with a red interior). You wouldnt have thought of her THAT out of the ordinary if you didnt notice the antennae sticking out of her green hair! And they werent for show either. They twitched!  And after they twitched, you watched with utmost attention while the fireflies buzzed circles around her, again you were unable to avert your eyes from the glow. Especially from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally, she was glowing! You gazed with disbelief and an awful bit of intrigued as her hips shined a bright light in the same flashing pattern as the fireflies surrounding her. Shamed to say it took a little more effort than it should of to snap you out of it! This colossal girl you were glancing up at was a bonna fide bug girl! Not a girl who was fascinated with bugs, but a girl who actually WAS a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinating discovery if you werent the size of an ACTUAL bug! Priorities, man. You were in need of desperate help and you desperately wanted help desperately! Your first thought would be the get the giant bug girl's attention.<br>\r\nBut then the second reminded you that she was a bug girl. Not a human girl. BUG GIRL. To other creatures, you were no longer at the top of the foodchain and since you were already worried about being firefly food, you oughta most certainly be worried about being bug girl food too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, she doesnt seem to be FERAL bug girl what with wearing such humanish clothes and such, so maybe talking her into helping you wouldnt be THAT unreasonable, right?</span></div></div>",

Only one way to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to put more effort when writing a chapter and make sure it's a paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Any fetish is allowed, but make sure they don't distant themselves from the main story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The character is tiny enough to be unnoticed; however awareness is also allowed but try to get out details on how he/she get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The character can have any sort of personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  You can end the story but don't try to do it so very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Death is allowed but put some effort on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. All the Touhou character's personalities are the same like they are (or at least how the majority the fandom often portrayed them) in the games. Don't go out of character unless there's a reason behind the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.The character is not some random fan, gamer, or anything like that. So he/she has no single knowledge about the Touhou series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
