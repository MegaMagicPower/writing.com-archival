I'm sure you're eager to get started, but first we'll set a few ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Both boys and girls are allowed to gain.<br>\r\n2) Weight gain only. No slob, scat, transformation, AR/AP, inflation, shrinking or any other form of expansion.<br>\r\n3) This story is rated 13+, so no extreme violence, profanity or sexual content.<br>\r\n4) Keep the weight limit realistic (no 100,000 lb. girls or cosmic growth).<br>\r\n5) I shouldn't have to say this, but put some effort into your submission so that it is at least enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, let's go!</td>",
