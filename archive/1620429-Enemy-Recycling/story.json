            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're just getting off the bus on the way home from school. It's the Friday before Canvas Day, which means the next week is free from school. You never did figure out who this Canvas guy was, but you'd really like to thank him for causing your town to make it's own holiday week. More important than that though, is the week off from Rob Elgen. Escaping him would probably equate to a year long holiday. You can't help but think of all the times he's pestered you. Always taking your backpack while you're not looking, taking the last snacks at lunch, laughing when ever you do bad in gym class, pointing out any little flaw he can about you. The guy exists just to torture you. If there was ever a person you wanted to knock out, it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you stroll through the open chilled air, you tell yourself to relax. You don't have to worry about him now. As far as you know, he doesn't exist for an entire week and two weekend. You've even got the rest of today to forget about him. That's nine and a half days. Not bad at all. You almost want to skip home, but you don't because it would terrible if some from the track team saw you. You pop the key out of your pocket and unlock the door to your week long vacation. The house is empty as both of your parents are working and your brother is staying after school. As per your usual Friday protocol, you head upstairs to toss of your uniform and backpack. Today, you become a lazy, junk food eating, video game addicted teenage stereotype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ascending the stairs, you push open the wooden door leading to your room with one hand, while sliding your backpack off your shoulder. You throw it on to the floor, and is hisses as it slides  into the corner where it will likely stay until you panic and cram the homework you're going to forget about eight days from now. The tie around your neck is slipped off as you prepare to change into something, but you stop when your eye catches an unfamiliar sight at the edge of your field of vision. While you start to unbutton your shirt, you bring yourself around to see what it is. It just happens to be a girl you've never seen before sitting in your room watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble take. Triple take. Quadruple take. She's still there. Not a hallucination. You take a piece of paper that happens to be sitting by your feet on the floor. In a second you crumple it up as the girl, who seems to be blushing a bit, looks on blinking and you toss it at the her. It hits her head and bounces right off. Not a hologram. As the paper projectile flew toward her, she closed her eyes and pulled her head to the side, then looked back at you as if she had walked into her room and found a boy that she's never seen before lurking in it. Not a statue. She is just sitting on the floor with her legs folded, leaning back on her arms. Her brown-orange hair shines radiantly despite the unimpressive output from the lone light bulb on the ceiling. It hangs over her face in bangs, with a little parting offset from the middle above her right eye. She's wearing two blue ribbons in her hair, which are supporting two pony tails. Her clothes are, for lack of a better term, limited. All she had on below the waist was a pair of pink short shorts. Short short shorts. Her thighs were practically hanging out, leaving her captivating legs exposed all the way down to her bare feet. She is waring a tight purple shirt, it provides a good look at her ample breasts and doesn't quite meet her short short shorts at her waist. Over that is a pink denim cutoff that matches the shorts, unbuttoned except for the very top. They barely cover long, thin arms, only going halfway between her shoulders and her elbows. The bottom of the cutoff doesn't make it past her protruding chest, and actually don't like it could be buttoned if she wanted it too. After what seems like an eternity of staring you decide it is time to find out what is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, why are you in my house, and how did you get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises one hand to clear some hair from her face and replies with her head off at an angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, like, me Rob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing his name makes you angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm calling the cops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout moving she goes on \"Wait, I know it's wierd, but it's true. Like, I ran into and pushed this person who said that you helped him fix his computer or something. When I knocked him over I didn't, like, stop or anything. He asked me to help pick up his stuff, but I just thought, whatever. According to him, he read my mind, and like noticed how I treated you bad too. So he thought that I should make up by, like, being attractive instead of repulsive to you and have to follow your commands. He's the one who, like, made me a girl and make me talk like this, like, saying like a lot. You have the ability to change how I act, and like, my mannerisms and what I can do. Right now I can't, like, get up or leave this room until you tell me. You can control my actions and personality only if, like, it doesn't put me in a lot of danger, or, like totally, completely go against my free will and old personality. Me telling you this is also part of what he did to me. You can make me say it whenever you want. So, like, that's what happening. Can you, like, make me stop saying like and stuff, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first though, that doesn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense.\" You turn around. \"I'm calling the cops unless you get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, still sitting says \"Like, wait, I'm totally telling you the truth. You should, like, test me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of aggravation, you go along. \"Fine, I want you to take off all of your clothes and do jumping jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl finally gets up, while you look on with a cross face, deep in skepticism. She begins unbuttoning her top, which only had one button buttoned anyone, you think she's still pretending. Then she unbuttons her shorts. Your eyes open up a bit. She drops them down revealing a set of panties clinging to her body. \"She's taking this too\" far you think, but you're convinced she'll stop now. There is no hesitation. She grabs her purple shirt and pulls it off, though it's not easy for her to get the shirt over her breasts. You start to blush as much as her as this goes on. \"To her underwear?\" You think, but you're wrong. As the shirt comes off, you see no bra, and her breasts jiggle erratically. Your left in shock. This is the first time you've seen a girl's breasts, you don't know if you should keep looking, half out of curiosity and half out of desire, or to turn away from shame. But the girl isn't giving you time to think about that because she isn't done stripping. She still has the panties on. After she throws her shirt into a pile of your clothes, she reaches down for them and begins to pull them away. However, it's all more than you can take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! stop! put everything back on.\" The girl grabs all her clothes and performs the process in reverse. When she finishes, she sits right back down in the exact same pose and position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totally not kidding.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stare blank faced at what just happened. There's a crazy girl in your room who likes to take her clothes off. Without a word you leave the room, not able to take notice of the girl's cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark? You're not going, to like, call the cops are you? I don't think they can move me. Um, like, I don't like saying like all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, you come back with a pot full of freezing cold water. You plainly walk up to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This pot is full of water as cold as I can get it. Unless you get up, I'm going to pour it on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just sighs, she moves nothing but her head. You put the pot right over her, and drop a tiny bit of water on her naked leg. She winces at the cold touch, but keeps sitting, and looks back up when the drop runs off her leg on to the floor. You then begin to slowly rotate the pot. The girl's face shows a bit of fear. Just as water starts to fall from the pot, she closes her eyes and looks away. The ice water trickles down on to her legs. She begins to shake and contort wildly, yet her arms and legs remain anchored. After you finish dumping the water on her she just barely manages to speak, her words greatly distorted by shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... bbrrrr... you like, see...mmhhhfff....I'm not\" She begins to blow air from her mouth, obviously unhappy about having the water dumped on her. \"Kidding... brrrrrr...hhhhhaaaahhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned. This means that she must be Rob. She even somehow knew about the guy you ran into a few days ago. Your brain begins to fry trying to piece this together until Rob wakes you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, he looks pathetic shivering in his tight pink clothing. His breasts are vibrating intensely. It distracts you for a moment before you tell him to wait for a towel. When you come back from the bathroom, you toss a green towel on the floor. Rob doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get up...bbbbrrrrrr... you need to, like, tell me I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get up?\" You say in slight confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jumps up and runs for the towel. Drying herself and then trying to warm herself with friction. But then it dawns on you that you can't have a barely dressed girl in your room when everyone comes home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you can't stay here. I can't let my parents find a naked girl in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back while still trying to warm her legs \"I'm sooooo not a girl, I'm, like, Rob. And I can't go home, not like this. Please, like, hide me. And like, tell me to stop talking like one of those 'like-girls'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to get frustrated again \"Fine stop saying like and hide somewhere really fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob drops the towel and looks around. He fixes her head on your closet and runs over to it. He takes her hands throws the doors open, then dives in before slamming the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, there isn't a lot of room in here. Can I hide somewhere else?\" He says with a completely different style of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you go in there in he first place?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it's probably because you wanted me do it quickly.\" He pauses \"Or maybe because you didn't allow me to leave your room. I'm getting a cramp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the closet won't work, you might as well have him come out anyway. \"Come out of the closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as say, Rob brings his female body out and stand in front of you. He's obviously embarrassed. You give in to curiosity though and decide to explore your power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me as best as you can.\" You order. The girl slips himself right behind you. You look back and see him looking up to you with her attractive eyes and beautiful lips. Rob actually looks really cute - and the thought of putting Rob and cute together makes you look away in disgust, as you picture a fairly well built guy in those girl clothes. Back to your experiment. You walk all around your room, jump up and down, even walk into a wall, and Rob follows. Then you cross the boundary of your room through the door. The girl suddenly stops in her tracks at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go any further than this.\" She says with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith confirmation of your control over Rob, your mind begins to turn to darker thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are Rob right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl innocently answers \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might have been better off lying. \"OK then, well, now you are Mimi and you always talk in third person, and you have a really really high pitched voice. You like to talk a lot, and you're scared of getting germs on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looks at you in shock, though it isn't really surprising that he'd have to deal with revenge at some point. Suddenly, he begins to uncontrollably blurt words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi is so upset with you! Mimi doesn't want to be Mimi since Mimi is not Mimi but Rob. Mimi wants you to make Mimi Rob again!\" then, Mimi suddenly becomes aware of her feet on the dirty floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! Mimi is going to get so many germs on Mimi! Mimi needs to get off the dirty floor, what will Mimi do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob dances all over the floor, trying to keeps his feet in the air as long as possible, then he sees you. You take a step back, but by the time you decide to run, Mimi is charging at you like an Olympic runner who promised a dying a three year old kid that he would break the world sprint record and give him the signed medal. Rob jumps on you, and you see nothing but purple as you stumble backwards. Between the sudden gain of momentum and having your face buried in a girl's chest, you lose track of which way it up. You're completely out of control as careen towards the stairs, unaware of the danger behind you. Luckily Mimi jumps off you and pulls your arms. Just before reaching the stairs and falling, you're pulled the other way and fall on Rob, who lets out a big \"oooff\" as you land on his now much smaller and lighter body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last condition put you and Mimi in danger, so it was canceled\" Rob said, with his feet now motionless on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up rubbing your head \"Oh, thanks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Mimi, not Mimi at all. It's this curse. Or whatever the bad thing that happened to Mimi is, Mimi was made to tell you then. And Mimi doesn't like saying Mimi either. Make Mimi Rob, or at least not Mimi. Mimi doesn't like Mimi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, at least we're fine right?\" You say, without an ounce of desire to listen to Mimi's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob sighs. But then you remember that there is still a half naked girl running around you house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, whatever, we still need to hide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when you realize that the vacation is just beginning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flashes of sunlight passing through the blinds on your window wake you earlier than you might have liked. Sleep always seems most precious just after waking up. You grab your pillow and bury your head under it. A few minutes later, you  decide that it's finally time to get up. You feel stiff and lazy, but still manage to slowly drift into the bathroom. After the morning routine is complete, you head downstairs for breakfast. Mom is in the kitchen and greets you as you come in, she is just exiting with some toast and coffee as she typically eats breakfast in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on one of the four seats around the kitchen table and think about what you're going to eat. You don't want to cook anything this early, especially if you're going to have to clean dishes afterward. You don't want something cold like cereal though. Waffles! The perfect food for a non-morning person. You pick yourself up and head for the freezer, ripping open a brand new box of waffles. After standing over the toaster to make sure that they meet your high standards, you place them on your plate and douse them with syrup. They don't last long, as you're always as hungry as you are tired in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith breakfast done, you head to your room to change. You don't even know what you're doing today, since you're on vacation you don't have to. Anything will do, and you just grab some stuff from your draws. Now changed and fully awake, you head back down to decide on your plans. You remember the new entertainment hall that opened a few weeks ago. It has everything, bowling, pool, basketball courts, an arcade, even a go kart track. It's decided, and you are halfway out the door when a nagging feeling comes over you, like you've forgotten something. You end up standing right in your open door way for a good while trying to remember. Usually you just brush off these feelings, but today you know it's something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of excitement over takes you as remember what it is, but then you remember what it is and are no longer excited. Rob is buried under some junk in your basement. Your face turns sour as you close the door and head back inside. You open the white door to your basement and switch on the lights. There's scattered stuff everywhere as your family typically just stuff things it has no room for down there. All the piles of stuff look the same, and you can't remember exactly where you hid Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, where are you again?\" You call out trying be loud enough to alert Rob without letting anyone else hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why aren't you answering?\" The you remember what you told him yesterday after hiding him \"I want you to stay right here and not make a sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, you can talk now.\" And surely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi is here! Mimi is here!\" You follow the voice around the stair case and open the built in closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi is uncomfortable, get Mimi out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, don't let people here you!\" You say as you dig him out. Everything that you move it taken quietly so you don't draw any attention. You put it all in a neat pile besides the closet so you can hide Mimi under it again when it's time for her to go back in. Finally, you see her compressed against the back wall and reach out with your arm. She looks at you for a second that grabs on, and you pull her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little dusty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi had to sit on the dirty floor. You left Mimi in their after you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that you were only seeing if you could fit Rob in their when you heard someone come in, so stuffed him in saying that you would come back but you never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob then holds her stomach and leans on the wall. He doesn't look too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, Mimi is so hungry, Mimi hasn't eaten since breakfast yesterday. You left Mimi without food.\" She steps forward and pounds on your chest, but it carries no force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should probably get something to eat. Wait here.\" You quickly run upstairs and grab some cold biscuits from the fridge. You want to make sure no one sees you, so you only grab whatever doesn't need preparation. After raiding the kitchen, you fly back down to the basement and give everything Rob. He was expecting something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? It's so cold. Can't Mimi get a real breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can't have anyone know you're here. If you really want something else we can go get it, I was going out anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to walk off when you realize that Rob is already eating the cold biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi will go, after Mimi finishes eating. Mimi is dizzy from hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis talking in 3rd person isn't a satisfactory form of revenge anymore, so you revoke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop talking in third person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob doesn't respond, he's too busy engorging himself. In your haste, you had actually taken the whole case of biscuits down, you didn't think he could possibly eat them all. You can't figure out how he's fitting it all in that petite body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rob finally gets to the last biscuit and scarfs it in two bites, he falls back on a covered plastic bin and puts down the tray that the biscuits were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I ate too much, we don't have to go out now.\" he says while patting his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes we do, I'm not losing out on my time off. And I can't leave you here because who knows what will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looks up at you but doesn't move. He must have stuffed himself good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he puts his hand by his legs,\"Can I at least go to the bathroom first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that everyone is going to be up soon if they aren't already. It'll be too risky to let her use the bathroom and have someone waiting outside the door until the room is empty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, at least not in here. I'll sneak you out the back door. The place I was going to probably has a bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving a note for your parents telling them where you went, you drag Rob outside and head for the entertainment complex.</span></div></div>",

No one would be home for a few hours. You're alone with an extremely attractive girl and you have your sworn enemy under your control. A better opportunity there has never been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Rob, oh I mean Mimi, we're OK being out here for now. No one is going to be home for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looks up at you with his big bright eyes as you pull him up, seeing a girl up close like this feel so good. \"Mimi thinks you and Mimi should be prepared. What if someone finds Mimi later? You and Mimi could get in trouble, and Mimi doesn't want anyone to know what happened to Mimi! Can we hide Mimi now? Please hide Mimi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and raise you head \"That's not exactly what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob leans and asks in a confused voice \"Mimi doesn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Mimi to want nothing more than to hold on to me, where ever I go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi just shouts a piercing \"Nooooooooooooooo!\" at the sound of your request, but he can't make his body follow his mind. Rob extends his arms, reaching for you and makes his way over with his long womanly legs. He grabs your arm, completely entangling it with her's. You feel each breast rubbing against your arms and feel ecstatic. Rob then rests his face against your shoulder, you feel her pushing into you. You never knew how wonderful a girl felt until now. It's almost beyond words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark stop! Mimi thinks this is gross! You and Mimi are boys, you and Mimi can't do this!\" All the while she has her arms tight around you and won't lift her soft head from your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh devilishly,\"You don't seem to mind Mimi. You are the one who started it after all.\" Then for a moment, you forget about revenge and give in to curiosity once more. You take your free hand, and put it to Rob's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep! Mark?\" Mimi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to stroke her hair, it's soft and light. Perfect composition and texture. You can feel it flow around your hand as you simply move it back and forth. Then you slowly begin to descend, bringing your hand further down on her neck. Her skin is so soft, and perfectly smooth. Your hand glides effortlessly. Beyond her neck, you find her small back has just the right feel. It's not scrawny and bony, yet there's no trace of extra weight or loose skin. But it's still Rob, and you've even begun to creep your self out. You take you hand off, look into Rob's eyes again. She looks upset, though he's still clinging to you like he was your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rob jumps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi doesn't want you to do that ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel that he has the right to say that after what he's done to you, but you do admit that maybe you went a little too far. But only maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like you don't deserve it.\" You say in as neutral a tone as you can. \"Alright, I'll find a place for you to live.\" You say to change the subject and take her with you to find a place to hide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
