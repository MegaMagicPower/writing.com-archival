It's quiet for moment before a recorded female's voice speaks to you, curt and business-like, but still sultry, grabbing your attention by the throat with lace ribbons, speaking words dipped in honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello. There has been a change of plans. Your new appointment is in the city. A message will be left on your answering machine concerning the details. Be on time, be discreet, and do not disappoint us</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line goes dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ending sounded like a warning, veiled behind those 'come hither' words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the phone down. There's not much you can do now, especially when the important questions you have to answer yourself do not include questioning who you are. The mask you hold in your hand is all you need to be at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and the VHS you rented. After all, you can't have any late fees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the cassette that sits on your bed and read the title of the cheesy flick aloud as you make your way out towards your car. The title makes you unconsciously lift your mask up to your eye level.</span></div></div>",

The mask's name was Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the manufacturers behind these masks that has affectionately named every single one that they made. You can't remember if there a blurb or something on the packaging, but it wouldn't surprise you if there was an entire backstory for this character, writing him out to be as cute and cuddly and affectionate as the parents who bought the masks for their kids at Halloween wished their little monsters would remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was a red fox and not much more than that as he was just a head. A furry head with a muzzle and triangular ears sitting on the top, stiff as antennas. The fur was a course, synthetic texture covering the rubber form, rusted orange for the most part except for that covering the lower jaw to the throat; that was white. And the eyes were not present, only empty sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle as you set the mask down and meander to a nearby mirror. You take a look at your eyes for a moment, as if noting that they are blue and nothing like what Rick's eyes would look like. Some freaky yellow, glow in the dark eyes with slit pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment passes and you run your hand across your head, sweeping back the carelessly short-cut hair that was caught somewhere between being kept and becoming shaggy. After a day of work in the garage it was greasy and slightly matted and could stand a wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it could wait. You were expecting to be sent out on another job really soon. And you could just get dirty all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the VHS in you hand. The cheesy arthouse flick that was <i>Inner Animals</i> really was not the kind of thing you were into, but the rental store had rented out all the good action movies, especially the new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the answering machine and shrug, turning and striding for the door to your apartment. You pause only for a second to adjust your black nylon jacket and check your denim slacks for any stains that could get into your car. You'll return the crummy movie, get a good one, come back, hit the job, bounce, shower, and maybe have time to watch the movie. That's what you think to yourself, taking way too long to finally close your door with a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLICK!*</span></div></div>",
