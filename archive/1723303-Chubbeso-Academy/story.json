            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Morning CJ\". said a familiar voice. You turn around to see that it is your two best friends Rebecca and Kate. You've known them ever since first grade, even back then they were little pudge balls. But because of their weight they didn't have a lot of friends and were treated like outsiders. The other kids would usually bully them by making fun of their fat and calling them names like fatso, butterball, and little miss piggy. Kate would just curl up and cry silently and Rebecca would stand up and defend her and Kate from the kid's bullying. This went one until one day you were getting sick and tired of all of this teasing and name calling that you went over there and told the other kids to back off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told them to put themselves in their place and see how they like getting picked on. The kids thought about and realized they were going a bit too far and apologized to them. After that you became really good friends with Rebecca and Kate. Plus they managed to make new friends in the class as well and Kate manged to build on her self-esteem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see that I'm not the only one running late today\". You said with a smirk on your face. \"Hey gives us a break\". Rebecca said while catching her breath from all of that fast waddling. \"I had trouble finding a uniform that wouldn't rip apart and had issues getting my shirt buttoned.\" \"Then I walked over to Kate's house and she was having trouble because she out grew all of her uniforms and had to wear one of mom's old uniforms and it barely fits her\". \"Then we had to book it if wanted to make to school on time but I see now that were all going to be late\". You then heard grumbling noises and it wasn't coming from your stomach it was coming from their stomachs. \"I take it you forgot to eat breakfast as well\". You asked. Um..yes, Kate said quietly.  \"We spent a lot of time trying to find uniform that would fit us by the time we found a decent uniform we didn't have enough time to eat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were talking with your friends you turn your head for a quick second and see that the sign changed to walk. \"Come on we can still make, you said in a hurry\". Then you run as fast as you pudgy legs could take you. But Rebbecca and Kate were just waddling as fast as they could right behind you due to their immense weight. Minutes later you make it to the front of the school with a couple of minutes to spare. \"I haven't moved that fast in a long time\". Rebecca said resting on her broad belly. \"At least we made it\". Kate said laying down with her large belly and breasts cutting her view. \"Come on lets go to homeroom\". You then got and helped Rebecca and Kate get on their feet and proceeded to go to homeroom. While on the way you...</span></div></div>",

Rebecca said. \"Well mine and Kate's anyway you'll probably just get a warning\". \"What are you talking about\"? You asked. \"Oh come on CJ, Ms. Kawasaki is the most serious teacher in the entire school she'll give someone a detention if there a second late to her class\". Rebecca remarked. \"She's strict with everyone regardless of students or faculty\". \"She's even strict with what she wears, always wearing those tight clothes that make her look like an elephant wearing kid's clothes\". \"The only people she doesn't act so strict with are her family, friends, and you\". \"Don't you think your over exaggerating things a bit Rebecca\". You said. \"Oh am I\"? She remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\". Said an energetic and familiar voice. You and Rebecca stopped your argument and turned to see that it was the lunchlady Bunnie Blake running towards you. \"Hi Ms. Blake\". Kate said. \"Oh Kate you don't need to act so formal you can just call me Bunnie\". She said. \"What's been going on with you\". You asked. \"Just the usual stuff, anyways can you guys help move some boxes into the cafeteria\"? She asked. \"Wish we could, but we need to get going to homeroom or we'll in trouble with out teacher\". Rebecca said. \"You mean Mina\"? \"Don't worry give you guys late passes so the \"Iron gut\" won't snap at you, besides it won't take long\". She said happily. \"Alright we'll help\". You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie then lead you, Rebecca, and Kate around the school to the back of the cafeteria where some stacked boxes were laying around. \"Just help me bring in these boxes into the kitchen\". \"Sounds easy enough\". Rebecca said confidently. Then you and everyone else started working. You and Bunnie had no trouble with the boxes, Rebecca had a little trouble because her belly got wedged in the doorframe sometimes. Kate had the most trouble. Due to her large weight she had trouble bending down to get boxes and while carrying boxes she felt off balance because of her bust size. After 21 minutes all the boxes were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were..finally..done\". Kate panted,gasping for breath. \"So Bunnie what are these boxes for\"? You asked curiously. \"There the ingredients for the gut-buster cake\". Bunnie replied. \"WHAT\"?!? You all shouted. Out of all of Bunnie's famous and tasty creations, the gut-buster cake stood out above everything else. It was well known throughout the school even people outside the school have heard of it. The cake could turn a skinny women obese with its high calorie and fat count. Bunnie only makes it at the end of school year or on special occasions due to the time and preparation it takes to make it. She makes it large enough so that everyone in the school gets a slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its not even near the end of the school year, why are you making it now\"? You asked in shock.</span></div></div>",

You'd only been able have a slice of the Gut buster cake once during your time at Chubbeso, and it was absolutely positively delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again you three, have a seat and I'll write you all a hall pass.\" said Bunnie pointed to some open chairs. As you took a seat you heard the school bell ring signaling that the first class of the day was over. Had you really been helping Bunnie that long? Oh well, there wasn't anything really important in math class today anyways. Just as the bell finished ringing it was followed by the sound of a stampede of footsteps stomping down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Bunnie dropping a pen before she could finish your passes. \"I hope everyone doesn't think I made the cake already...Lunch isn't for a few more hours and I haven't even started it yet!\" That fact did little to turn the tide of titanic footsteps as a large crowd of hungry hungry girls was flooding its way into the cafeteria. The footsteps  thundered louder as the got closer to the kitchen area, the vibrations shaking the walls of the back room. The quaking continued, so much so that a jar of pickled peppers on a rather high shelf began to jostle, and then jiggle until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ! look out!\" Rebbecca had shouted a fraction of a second to late. The three women watched as a bulk sized jar of pickled peppers came careening of its shelf and crashing directly onto your head. The sound glass shattering was the last thing you heard before the world around you began to spin, then turn black, and then...things slowly began to swim away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke...</span></div></div>",

Blinking , you gazed about and realized that there was in fact nobody around you.  Wait a minute, this was the infirmary! Slowly you began to recall the events that had put you here in the first place. The now sickening scent of pickling juice seemed to be coming from every pore on your body. Now though, where was everyone? How long had you been out? And why did your neck feel so-stiff!  Feeling with your hands and turning your head downwards as best you could you realized that your neck was now encased in...  What <i>was </i> this thing around your neck? Before you could examine yourself further you had your first visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! You're up!\" said Nurse Young from somewhere behind the four curtain walls, still seated in her reinforced roller chair. \"Oh sorry was my t.v. too loud? I was just watching one of my soaps Dial H for Hospital...\" she blinked a bit before remembering something, something that from the look on her face was very important. \"Oh!\" she said quickly before wheeling her chair out of view.  \"Mrs. Master's he's awake now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of heavy heavy footsteps pounding their way across the cool linoleum floor, and then with great speed, the furthest most curtain wall was flung open. Behind the dramatic reveal stood Mrs. Masters, panting and sweating up a storm but with a look not of strain, but shock on her face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Mr. Dalton!\" she exclaimed crossing the room and bringing her large belly bedside. \"Are you okay?-How do you feel?-Where does it hurt? Erika!\" You had never heard even the tiniest bit of panic in the usually calm and well reserved Mrs. Masters, but right now she was clearly worried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" you rasp, your throat feeling a bit dry. \"My head still hurts a bit and I'm a little confused about why I'm wearing this...neck thing...but other than that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Nurse Young (still chair bound) had just re-rolled back into the room looking a bit calmer than her blonde boss. \"See, he's going to be fine.  He's been in here plenty of times before and gone out without a scratch. I already looked at the x-ray's and I didn't see anything severe-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severe enough for a neck-brace...\" icily added Mrs. Masters while pointing to your Styrofoam encased neck. You were taken aback by this sudden change in tone by Mrs. Masters, she seemingly had just gone from tender to testy in seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...\" sheepishly said Erika Young, blushing a bit.  \"Well nothing <i>more </i> severe than a torn Trapezius muscle. No broken bones or signs of a concussion.\" she said correcting herself while holding up a pair of X-rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Masters seemed to carefully think things over a bit before deciding on what to do next. \"Well, there's no harm in another check up, although I <i>do </i> hope your right Nurse Young. Please give Mr. Dalton a once over and fill him in a bit, while I notify Bunnie, and follow up on that call to Mr. Dalton's parents.\" and with that, the heavy Headmistress waddled her way out of the room in a way that showed she was still clearly in \" <u>all business mode</u>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\" you ask innocently as Nurse Young retrieves a pen-light from her uniforms very tightly packed chest pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you had <i>quite </i> the accident. So I can understand why she's a bit worried\" she begins, while shining the light directly into your eyes. (As Erika mentioned before you had been to her infirmary quite a few times before, and so the check-up process had become pretty routine between the two of you.) \"And it wasn't just the usually sort of bumps and bruises your usually in here with. It was a <i>neck </i>injury, and it could have been <b>a lot </b> worse. For example, there's no sign of a concussion as far as I can tell.\" finished, she clicked her small pen-light off before donning a pair of gloves and opening a new tongue depressor. \"Say ah. Good.\" she continues quickly not letting you get a word in edge wise. \"Now, what's <i>really </i> dramatic here is that it wasn't the usual group of school girls tackling you, it was the actual <u>school </u> this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soah?'\" you gargle, tongue still depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, since it was the schools accident...We'd be held responsible if...you know things really got bad. I'm only a nurse so  I can handle almost everything.  Almost.  And if you did need major surgery I'm pretty sure your parents could wanted sue the school for medical costs...if they wanted to...You can close now.\" she says with a snap of her gloves and getting you a paper cup full of cold water. You take a small sip and the cool water feels great going down your achy throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they <i>aren</i>'<i>t </i>bad right? I mean this isn't going to be a permanent thing right?\" you point to your new neck accessory and turn your head about a bit, the act give you a sharp pain and you immediately stop the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" says Nurse Young quickly. \"I mean pretty much. 90% sure. Okay 75. Wait not like that- I mean you're going to be fine, it's just I don't know how long it's going to take to heal. It could be 2 weeks or 2 months depending on how quick it heals.\" she explains before wheeling herself back to your X-rays to restudy them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new news is a bit shocking to you. Wearing a neck brace for two months was definitely not something you were looking forward to. Before you could ask any more questions Mrs. Masters returned to  room, now accompanied by her infinitely stone-faced assistant Abida and one very worried looking Bunnie Blake. The pink haired lunch lady's eyes lock with yours and in an instant her face brightens up exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ceej!\" she shouts ready to give you the biggest hug ever-only to stop two paces away, noting your new Styrofoam necktie.  \"Oh...Oh no. Ceej.\" she brings a hand to her cheek dismayed at the sight of your injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry Bunnie.\" said a now standing Nurse Young, her smile doing it's darndest to cheer the three other dour faces in the room. \"I've checked Mr. Dalton here over twice now and he's going to be just fine.\" Then turning to you as an aide \"As long as he keeps that neck brace on. No heavy lifting, and no roughhousing understand? You're going to have to take it easy \" she says in a mock stern tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you feel fine? There <i>won't </i>be any need to leave or press charges then?\" said a still  rather tense looking Mrs. Masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No? Why would I do that?\" you rasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant!\" cried the headmistress breathing a deep sigh of relief, the color slowly returning to her face. \"Well, we're all certainly glad you currently fell fine. But,  for the future, and to be on the safer side of things, I'm assigning you a caretaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroat hurting to much to talk at the moment, the look on your face does all the talking for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't let our most popular student lugging himself around campus and injure his neck any further can we?\" explains Mrs. Masters the silky cool as a cucumber tone returning to her voice. \"Especially if it means going back across the pond for a <b>REALLY </b>serious injury. Claire would be- I mean the students here, would never let me here the end of it. So, I'm insisting that you have someone who could be a pair of eyes to keep a watch on you, and a pair of hands to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you think to yourself. A caretaker might not be the worst idea, especially with this neck-brace on, but who did Mrs. Masters have in mind?</span></div></div>",

Out of everyone in the room she'd certainly been the one who had hung out with you the most, but she already had what was probably <i>the </i> busiest job here at the academy, well other than Headmistress. Bunnie seemed to share in your confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!..But, Mrs. Master's why? C.J doesn't need me to babysit him.\" argued the pink haired portion purveyor  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Bunnie you wouldn't be a babysitter.\" said Mrs. Masters with a pshawing wave of her hand. \"More like a chaperone or...a bodyguard, just so he or anybody else for that matter doesn't hurt himself any further.

I certainly don't think Claire would mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" you say in short agreement feeling like wearing this neck brace might have some positives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunnie, you're really the only other qualified person we have!\" Said Mrs. Masters her beach ball like belly sliding closer towards the legendary lunch lady and placing a hand onto one of her lithe shoulders as to butter her not only vocally but physically as well. \"And, as much as it pains me to take you away from cooking duty, a duty I <u>know </u>you love so much, I have to do it. I'm sure that the other lunch ladies will undoubtedly  have a bit of trouble without their leader, but I'll talk to Jen, er Ms. Telleri, and I can only hope that she will help them sort any problems out.\" The heavy headmistress finished her compliments and turned with baited breath, turning from Bunnie to you, then back to Bunnie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you put it like that.Okay!\" said Bunnie, succumbing to the stream of compliments, and figuring if she <i>was </i> to be so quickly replaced, it would be by her own partial mentor  Jen Telleri the official teacher of all things gastronomic here at Chubbeso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Masters face turning into the exact same triple chin sprouting smile that her own daughter gave whenever she got her way. \"Now please, do take the utmost care of C.J. here.  I think we'd all be rather upset if he had to be flown back home wouldn't we.\" she explained the girlish giggle in her voice returning once more, now that the stressful situation had been sorted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Bunnie.\" said Nurse Young looking thankful she could now retake her seat.  \"Just make sure he takes it easy. No heavy lifting, no running, no jogging. Nothing more than walking at the most.\"  Then turning towards your direction, \"You can come back and see how your neck is healing in two weeks, but until then nothing but rest. Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod preferring to not speak with your scratchy throat when you didn't have to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right well, we're <i>all </i> very happy your okay and will still be staying with us, but as Nurse Young said you <i>do </i> need your rest.\" said Mrs. Masters, and with a graceful wave of her fingers she and Abida left your sectioned off area of the infirmary, with Nurse Young wheeling herself back in front of her now muted and subtitled soap operas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" said Bunnie twirling a lock of her calamity pink hair in semi nervous manner. \"Hope you don't mind me hangin' around your place for a week or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you don't...\" you say in between dry sounding wheezes. \"It'll be like game night every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie gave a weak smile at this and moved in closer, \"Hey I'm really sorry about this...I feel sort of responsible for putting something like that up so high...\" she mutters, now leaning over your bed. \"How about a hug to feel better, handsome?\" And at that she ever so carefully wrapped her hands around your tender torso. It was brief, but it was very warm and very soft, her own smell of flour and baked goods enveloping and overpowering your own scent of pickled peppers 'juice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...It's not your fault that shelf broke. It's-fine..shelf should go to jail for negligence. Cough cough ...owww...\" Your own attempt at a joke doesn't seem to get a laugh out of either of the two of you. Another round of coughs come on again, and you can feel your head going woozy a bit, your eyelids getting heavier by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay C.J.

You're eyes open instantly and you find that infirmary is now lit in the orange hue of a setting sun. \"It's time you get back to your own room, I'm busting you out of here.\" she says jokingly. She reaches for a table just out of view and returns with a tiny white plate, on which sits a small slice of apple pie. \"So...after everything that happened...I didn't end up baking the gut buster cake, but I did manage to sneak you a piece of this.\" she teases, the warm cinnamon wafting straight up your nostrils causing a goofy grin to spread across your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you the plate, and then retrieves  a small thermos of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you eek out, throat feeling better but still not 100%. She smiles in return and then says...nothing really. Bunnie simply stays quiet as a sense of peace falls over the room, looking content to just sit and watch you eat, or at least try to eat, it's a little awkward trying to move your head around with this new neck brace..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she says suddenly breaking the silence,  \"I told Becca and Kate by the way! They so glad you're okay! They wanted to come see you right away, but then you were still sleeping so I told them to wait till later....\" Her voice trails off a bit, and when it does return it's a bit softer \"They both...they both really care about you you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause you pie eating for a bit to nod a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you got your apparent back.\" she says noting that your plate was already near empty. \"Here, have another\" she says, tiptoeing the line and between offering and insisting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou HAD been hungry, missing out on both breakfast and lunch, and so go to take the second piece of delicious pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get your strength back as soon as possible and nothings better than-uh-oh-whoops.\" The last bit had been uttered just as the piece of pie slid across the tiny plate and landed smack in the middle of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing lightly, Bunnie grabbed a few napkins and started to scrub at the hot ooey gooey mess. Your wandering eyes couldn't help but watch as she strained and searched every bit of her cavernous cleavage for crumbs. Your gawking stares went unnoticed, for a bit, as soon as  Bunnie realized you were watching her as she brushed off her bosom, she blushed a bit before turning around to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that...guess I'll have to sneak you  back something else for tonight...Or hey I could even make a pizza! You got an oven in your room right?\" she says excited to finally be talking about the subject of food, and not about how injured someone was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie invites everyone over So the can see your okay. Food and fun in a sort of Game Night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another dark laugh and suddenly your eyes were open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering straight above you was the familiar sterile florescent light of the nurse's office. You sat up realizing that you had been moved from the cafeteria kitchen to the back room of the Nurses office. Of course you were familiar with this room, having been sent here for a multitude of reasons before; none however were quite as severe as the accident that had happened to you today. At least you hoped it was today...there was no way of knowing how long you were out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNurse Young must have heard your rustling as she was soon in the room. \"Feeling better? You had quite an injury\" she asks approaching your bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks...\" you say propping yourself up on your arms. \"I had...I had weird dream...I can't remember it but...<i>Ooooow</i>\" a sharp headache pierced your skull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a headache. Well that's to be expected...\" said nurse Young large stomach and breasts bouncing their way closer to you. \"You took quite the knock to your noggin.\" she notes retrieving a small flashlight from her skintight nurses outfit. Shining the light into your eyes she asks...\"How many lights do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" you say honestly, you had taken this \"test\" every time you'd woken up in her office but this was the first time you were feeling rather woozy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Young gave a noise, not a word, just a noise sounding like that you'd given the wrong answer. \"H<i>mmm</i>, well you have been out for ten minutes. Please, close your eyes and try again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, and this time the world seemed a lot clearer. \"One.\" you say feeling as if you'd just cheated on a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well you have some minor double vision....no sign of a concussion though so that's good. Just a second...\" She disappeared behind your sectioned off curtained area (well disappeared as well as a woman her size could) and returned handing you two aspirin and a glass of water. \"I'm suggesting you should head straight back to your room and rest for the day. I'll write you a sick note for today, but come back and see me first thing tomorrow for a check up okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you say as you swallowed the aspirin and began to drink the crisp refreshing water. The water was cool and felt good on your dry throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you could stay here and watch F.B.I. M.D. It's a soap opera about a secret agent who has to juggle spy missions while working a hectic shift at a hospital.\" said Nurse Young hands clasped together waiting on your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, no thanks...\" you decline as you climb out of the hospital bed and make for the door. \"Thanks for taking care of me though nurse young..see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you traversed the campus the cool wind whipped about your head, a slight sting reminding you of where your skin must have been cut by glass.

Right now though it seemed to be droning on forever way longer than usual. It was so annoying! It rang and rang and rang and rang shaking your eardrums. Suddenly your head hurt, <b>bad,</b> right behind your eyes. The world was spinning, your eyes rolled into the back of your head, things were going black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.......J....Are you....okay?\" you heard Rebbecca ask in super slow motion. She watched mouth agape as you hit the ground (well grass) for the second time today. She hurried over to where you were laying and came as close as she could to your face...She could feel hot tears coming again, just as your eyes suddenly flipped open. Rebbecca jumped back, startled. And that wasn't all you did, you stood up, standing straight and dusting yourself off as if nothing had happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what?\" asked Rebbecca breathlessly and surprised \"Are-are you okay?\" she asked eyes as wide as dinner plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Never better, Becky</b>\" you said taking a two smooth steps closer to her. You took a finger to her face and wiped a single tear away from her cheek. \"<b>You know, I absolutely hate to see a woman cry, but right now your eyes look are sparkling so beautifully. Did I ever tell you how marvelous they look from up close like this?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca's mouth gaped up and down as she searched for what to say, looking like she was chewing an invisible piece of bubblegum.  \"C....C.J!\" was all she could say as she was more caught off guard than caught up in this sudden moment.  \"How many time have I told you not to call me Becky!\" she shouted, not liking that her emotions had been so...exposed. What had happened? Suddenly you looked different somehow, like you were older, even slightly taller from your change in posture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Shhhh</b>.\" you say quietly placing the same finger to her plump lips. \"<b>You look even cuter when your angry, you know that</b>?\"  The two of you were almost nose to nose now and you could feel her warm breath quickening as it washed over your face. You slowly leaned in confident, assured, of what you were about to do, unafraid if anyone was watching. Rebbecca stood paralyzed unbelieving that this was really happening! She closed her eyes and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG*</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>That damn bell again! Oh well...</b> you mutter, as slowly your eyes closed and then re-opened, the process much faster than before and with the drastic feinting.  You blinked as you were suddenly aware Rebbecca was making a puckering fish face at you. Why? You wondered. Uh oh the last few minutes were suddenly a hazy memory...Was it because of your head injury? You stepped back away from Rebbecca slightly worried about the possibility of brain damage. Well there was no point in making Rebbecca worry too. Quick- say something and play it off like nothing is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-he\" you say faking a laugh. \"That <i>is  </i> a funny face Becca. But that's the tardy bell, you better hurry to class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebeca's face seemed to melt, turning from a pucker, to a mean frown. \"What the hell C.J!\" she shouts clearly very angry at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what to say (or what you had just been talking about for that matter,) so you quickly sputtered out something, anything to distract from the fact you were having short term memory loss. \"J-just see me after school at my place okay?\" you say taking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca didn't seem too satisfied with this answer, but she answered with a shout of \"Fine!\" anyways. She looked like she was a mix of angry,and strangely also confused. \"You better be there!\" was the last thing she said (more like threatened) before turning about and heading for her class. This left you alone and cold on the campus wondering what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were supposed to head straight back but there was something you were going to do first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH YEAH!

Thankfully, most of the student body was too lazy to follow even basic proper procedures so there was still much for her to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bunsen burners weren\u2019t completely cleared of debris after one of the assistants tried to half-ass a lecture out of \u2018how things tasted when cooked by different gases\u2019, some of the consumable alcohols were once again missing from the Toxicology worktable and while tasty the day old homemade ice cream soda flavors still left in the volumetric flasks was downright insulting! Why does science always get abused by other, lesser fields of study?!

In her brief panic she realized that there were very few chances she was actually alone with you, not in a classroom with teacher and plenty of other girls, and not after school hours as usually it was trio or quartet of C.J, Rebecca, Claire and Kate herself.  So, definitely not wanting to mess this up by doing something embarrassing, Kate waddled back to a science lab counter top and tried to look relaxed as she readied herself to talk to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly she wouldn\u2019t exactly be talking to <i>you </i>per se, it would be \u201cThe Superior C.J,\u201d well superior-ly in touch with his feelings at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs J.C\u2019s eyes fell upon the nerd girl a reaction akin to cupid\u2019s arrow seemed to overtake him.

So modest, so soft spoken, so sacrificing, always shying away,  willing to let someone else get the attention.\u2026  C.J had always been a bit too shy himself to admit his own partial feeling for the shy girl. Well now it was finally her turn to feel special, she was going to get all of your attention.A killer smile flashed crossed your face, as you entered the room slowly, coolly letting the heavy door close behind you without glancing back, your eyes blazing with passion remained gazing upon Kate, almost like a hungry wolf preying upon his next lamb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.J you\u2019re all right! I mean, the way that the jar smashed on your head\u2026for a second I thought...\" she turned meekly away from a moment at her own grim thoughts, before returning to face you with a smile. \"I\u2019m just really glad you\u2019re okay...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Nah, I\u2019ve taken plenty of worse bumps than that here.

Wow! How had the ordinary C.J. been able to control himself around such a sensual body! You knew what you wanted, and now you were free to admit it: you liked girls, all girls for that matter, but you <i>loved </i><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">big </font></b>girls! Kate\u2019s breasts! So round and fat and full! You\u2019d love to give them a gentle squeeze, and feel their weight as you held them in your hand! Oh! And that stomach! Long known as one of Kate\u2019s ticklish spots since you both were younger, C.J was always able to keep a hand off approach as he and Kate grew older when things would have been awkward. Even after bumping into her so many times by accident, there were apologies on both sides a look of embarrassment, and then nothing more. What you wouldn\u2019t give right now to see her fleshy belly right now in all its glory, and perhaps feed it and watch it grow larger! Too bad she insisted on keeping her beautiful body covered under as much clothes as she could, hidden away like layers of chocolate over the sweet caramel center of a candy bar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.C had been supercharged with these emotions in matter of nanoseconds, emotions that regular C.J had felt and dealt with for years and could leave a teenager feeling..\"confused\" about one of his best friends, J.C was without such inhibitions and so was still able to keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-me? Aw geeze CJ.  I\u2019m not that smart...\u201d said Kate already feeling herself starting to blush, and regrettably feel herself starting to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Sure you are</b>,\u201d said J.C whose slow approach had finally reached the girl, he leaned in closer to whisper the next part close to her ear so that it was barely audible. \u201c<b>and the most <i>beautiful </i>too</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate blinked a bit unsure of what she\u2019d just heard. She had always wanted to hear those words, but had certainly never expected to hear those words coming from you at this moment. Especially after all of the mean teasing she\u2019d gotten back at your old school.

Such daily insults though had definitely built up over time and could really cause a girl to clam up!  Things had been better since the two of you had started going to Chubbeso, but secretly Kate was still prone to tiny bouts of self-consciousness when it came to the way she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c-Erm w-what?

To think that weaker part of you didn't eat today. You patted your own tummy. \"I'm hungry too. Want me to get you stuff?\" For extra effect, you rested a hand on her love handle, and squeezed. She practically melted in your arms, resting those huge boobies against your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I--sure.\" Kate was breathing heavier now, a hazy look in her eyes. She wanted you. She needed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked to the lunch area.. Your fingers touched her hands, hoping she let you hold it. Eventually, she surrendered, her fingers shaking, palm sweaty. She was excited, nervous, even a little turned on. You grinned, glad to have this effect on such a total freaking hottie. You thought about later, once you fed your way into her body, when she'd be willing to let you do her, to hold her down and make sweet love with her until all the pent up desires went away. The old guy must've been an idiot not to embrace this situation. A harem of women, all there for the taking! How could anyone hate this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the lunch table, you pulled out a chair for Kate. \"I'll be back with food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get it.

Every bite was carefully crafted by tastes, affectionate complements or comforting conversation, and always asking \u201c<b> Please, let me give you more </b>\u201d before the next section of the foodstuff scale model of Olympus Mons was offered to Kate on bended knee. You didn\u2019t want to just fatten her like some hog for market; it was your duty to make sure she was comfortable from start to finish \u2013 and you didn\u2019t care who saw you giving Kate\u2019s over-nourishment your undivided all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kate\u2019s gaze settled on the buttered sea food than you would acquire shell hammers and nutcrackers directly out of the Cafeteria\u2019s staff\u2019s own hands to make sure she didn\u2019t have to lift a finger to swallow the most tender parts of the Lobster\u2019s Claws and the saut\u00e9ed White Wine Spider-Crab. If she was starting to feel more carnivorous there was a legion of Tenderloin, Sirloin and artery exploding Filet Mignon; garnished from Cajun tongue melting spices to gentler peppered Steak au poivre - with deep pools of cream that almost hid the taste of the cured, breaded and roasted Fatback or Pork belly larding. When her formidable stomach started to make her moan in more pained breaths, you would take several minute breaks slowly kneading her expanding flab in gentle rhythmic tides of chilled fingertips dancing on rising, yet yielding flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t stand to let any of Kate\u2019s treats to be defiled, even when greedy outside hands or the forward march of Kate\u2019s stuffing onslaught threatened to topple the remaining horde before it reached its final destination into the later. You\u2019d politely confiscate four more tables and cloth from other dining parties to channel Kate\u2019s belly into a more contained growth, cozy in a lazy makeshift hammock, and thank the envious onlookers for their compliance. You\u2019d also make sure to let Kate know you were still there when her feeding trance occasionally broke and she could no longer see you over her own three mounds. A peck on the head, a gentle yet wolfish grin on your face and \u2013 when she was ready \u2013 easing back into the meal with supple chocolate dipping saucers ready to give her a truck load of sugar to help the medicine go down. Her absolute favorite maneuver was when you scaled up to personally lip feed the dark chocolate slathered side to Kate\u2019s awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter how much you persuaded into her, she always seemed to have just enough room for J.C.\u2019s next attack. And even with the standard wandering 3-6 hour lunch breaks the Academy was notorious for, to Kate this pleasantly seemed to go on forever. She could die right here and now, bloated beyond all reasonable explanation, and her only regret would be that she didn\u2019t show you\u2013 or rather, <i>\u201cC.J.\u201d</i> the true extend of her feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that the two of you were a spectacle was the understatement of the decade. The typical gluttonous roar of the Chubbesco mini-mall sized eating square, which would have put Nero\u2019s Rotating Banquet Hall to shame, was a mausoleum of hatred as the overfed blob mob around you jealously ate out their hearts in tension filled silence. It was difficult to determine whether more girls were anxiously waiting their turn with you or were eagerly plotting to smother Kate to death wherever she would be sleeping off her oncoming food comatose. However, the ugliness that would have followed if it was regular old C.J. was not happening, as few even dared to call you out, let alone approach you. Your unnatural new charisma and confidence projected an unspoken rule of <b>DO NOT DISTURB ME</b>, rivalling even the authority Claire Masters abused at whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the Lardy Heiress, she was tittering over the breaking point watching HER C.J. DALTON \u2013 \u201cW-WITH THAT LOW BORN SOW! I WILL TEAR OUT HER-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n///*Due to the sheer hateful filth of Claire\u2019s upcoming diatribe towards student Kate Granden, we here at the Chubbesco Academy Management must inform you, the viewer, that the rest of Young Miss Masters\u2019 rant will be redacted for decency. Just know that what followed was a sordid oath of vengeance for the ages. Thank you for your understanding.*////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaintily wiping the foam from her mouth, Claire viciously grit her fang-like teeth as she bided her time until Dalton finished his mistake of wasting such pleasant food on such an unworthy urchin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final soft burp, Kate tearfully drifted off into a small hibernation that would never match the dream she just lived. For some reason, you had the suspicion that you couldn\u2019t quite roll your work out the doorway without hurting at least someone \u2013 <b>and you will not tolerate that possibility to be Kate</b>. Snapping your fingers, you managed to order several freshmen to make sure Kate had the most comfortable nap possible on the heated marble floor. \u201c<b>Please try to round up the more decent pillows and blankets \u2013 I\u2019ll make sure Bunnie gives this the okay.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could even notice how shell-shocked your Favorite Canadian was at the show you just gave, you could hear Masters\u2019 thunderous stomps as she put her weight into the angrily jiggling thighs heading your way.   \u201cC.J. DALTON\u201d she cattily screamed, \u201cYou and I are going to have a serious talk about what liberties you may have with the rank-and-file plebs of MY Academy! It seems I was far too lenient in educating you on the grounds of OUR relationship, so I will let this incident slide if you come with me right this second!\u201d She smugly expected results after she put the finishing touch of one last table breaking I-am-putting-my-foot-down thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if possessed by some sinister force, your head slowly cocked around until your furious glare locked gazes with Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face her, your advance startled the spoiled brat, for <i>C.J.</i> never defied her like this before. \u201c<b>Ma\u2019am, listen up, because I will only say this once</b>\u201d you coldly remark in the most American Action Hero way your juvenile mind wished for.  <b>\u201cI am sick and tired of running away from your stupid little conspiracy to stuff me silly, and I will not tolerate this fan club nonsense or your commands anymore!

Do you understand me, Claire?!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all your bluster, you were slightly amazed that you could go as far as you did. Still, you waited for Miss Masters\u2019 reply.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire looked shocked then hurt, then like she might cry, and with good reason too; few had dared to stand up to the demanding primadonna whether for fear of firing or expulsion, Claire had connections very, very powerful ones.  Getting talked back to was rare enough for the girl, but by you CJ! Getting told what to do was a shock, it was different\u2026it was kind of exciting\u2026Watching you take command was a complete role reversal of what she was used to, and even if it wasn\u2019t focused on her (at the moment) she\u2019d liked this new take charge C.J in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>And that goes for all of you!</b>\u201d you say, standing on top of a table and shouting at the top of your lungs to the crowd of girls watching this spectacle.  \u201c<b>I love Kate Granden!

That\u2019s when you noticed something\u2026Where was Kate? The last time you had seen her, she had been gently brought to her makeshift bed of blankets and pillows and was resting gently on the cafeteria floor. A blissful smile on her face telling everyone she was the happiest girl in the world at the moment, the lower half of her belly, so round and full with food was exposed for the world to see as it gently rose and fell with her breaths. But now where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Where is my love</b>?\u201d you ask the nearest freshman one of the few you had ordered to find blankets moments earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate?\u201d asked the freshman who looked as startled at your personality she as any of the other girls. \u201cBunnie had us move her to the back room, something about lunchroom standards and practices, safety issues that sort of-Hey wait where ya going?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>No time</b>!\u201d you say already taking off for the cafeteria\u2019s back room. Dashing all the way, you make your way inside and arrive to the sight of Kate, still sleeping, still peacefully unaware of the scene you\u2019d made after she began to sleep.  Your eyes satisfied by the sight of your Kate still at peace,  you noticed the other features of the room; the smell of pickled peppers still pungent in the air from this morning, all of the higher up shelves were now vacant of any heavy objects, Rebecca Maglen standing in the corner and looking pissed. Wait-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.J. Masterson! What the hell is going on!\u201d demanded a very angry Rebecca. In two steps (carefully stepping over Kate) she crossed the room and jutted a finger into your chest. \u201cWhat were you two doing out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmly took Rebbeca\u2019s accusatory finger in your right hand and held it, then slowly moved it to just below one of your mini-man boobs, and right over your heart. \u201c<b>It\u2019s simple\u2026 I love her\u2026I love Kate.</b>\u201d You\u2019re eyes are aglow again with intensity as you nod into Rebbeca\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbeca isn\u2019t convinced and she peels her eyes in suspicion, freeing her hand from your grasp. \u201cAre you feeling okay\u2026You sound a bit\u2026different.

It\u2019s just\u2026well seeing you\u2026with Kate-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca doesn\u2019t get to finish her sentence as none other than Bunnie Blake burst into the back room. \u201cC.J!

We were just excited!\u201d Rebecca snuggled you closer into her chest and you couldn\u2019t find a reason to complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Sweetie.\u201d The punk cook happily decreed as she pat the still slumbering Kate \u201c<i>She</i> certainly enjoyed it and I did have a kick out of getting to finally watch you stand up to her royal bossy boots\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs much as you enjoyed their attention, you were glad plans had already been made to become isolated with Miss Maglen. If you stayed in that kitchen any longer, you likely would be doted on until the bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three legged waddle was not as strenuous as you expected, especially since Rebby tried to take the blunt of both of your weights in between the gossiping looks and the snide remarks that she must have stolen you from that bloated Titty Nerd Kate. The <i>Cafeteria Event</i>, as it coming to be known, was already being altered into a thousand personalized rumors, from where you supposedly were the sensual cause of any girl\u2019s recent bulging gut, to your spirited proclamation of loving everyone in your personality cult, now and forever. The C.J. Fan Club will always find a way to ignore reality.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, you only blocked out the more significant distractions from your current target. You could still feel the athletic remnants of Rebecca\u2019s past life pumping blood and enjoying the sweat. It wasn\u2019t a contradiction that you enjoyed her being an incurable glutton, and her now more unfortunately subdued passion for exercise, <b>they both made her a better person in your eyes</b>. But your silent staring only seemed to make her restless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, C.J., you uh- mind I ask you something?\u201d  Without waiting for a chance to respond, she dropped the bomb \u201cdid you really mean what you said back there y\u2019know, about Kate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know was the best answer you could find, as you honestly never considered your own motivations for your actions. You clearly remember enjoying what you did to her; you do still more than like Kate, you wouldn\u2019t mind doing it over again and again -- and are pleased that she seemed to reciprocate all of these points back at you.  And yet, you could not seem to recall why you were so driven to do exactly what you did. The bittersweet memories of your collective childhood past are there, the pieces of the pathos are all present, but \u201cWhoa, don\u2019t strain yourself too much over this answer, your in even less of a condition for that.\u201d  Rebecca attempted to change the subject, but you know why this is so painful to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rebecca deserves happiness!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou apparently  have mumbled that last thought out, as her years of Kateology have made Rebecca ears tuned to catch low speech, \u201cWhat\u2019d you say, C.J.?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You deserve so much more, Rebecca</b>\u201d you pronounce without a hint of irony, but she isn\u2019t sure how to take that last remark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d Her resistance is expected, but you easily recount how many times, in how many years, she\u2019s tried to have <i>that</i> talk, only for some sadistic part of the universe to influence causality and fate against her moment from ever arriving. Well no more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily near your side of the dormitory, you standup straight and use your two inches of height over the girl to your advantage. \u201c<b>For the longest time you\u2019ve been my strength</b>\u201d playfully arching ever so close to her still baby fat face \u201c<b>When I failed to be enough of a man to keep Kate from being bullied, you always picked up my slack without so much as a thanks.</b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unheralded flattery and blatant angle of your words crippled her defenses, but Rebecca still tried to deny that this was actually happening. \u201cC-Ceej, C\u2019mon! Cut this out you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>No! I mean everything I say. I\u2019ve shamelessly accumulated a debt that\u2019s gone unchecked for far too long.</b>\u201d Taking one surprised palm to your mouth, you kiss her right hand before continuing your barrage \u201c<b>Read my lips. I Love You Rebecca.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou patiently waited for her to fully regain conscious while she was still standing there; repeating what thankfully weren\u2019t her last broken words several times in sheer awe.  As her pupils stabilized, she made one last desperate attempt to maintain the status-quo \u201cBut-But, you\u2019ve said this before C.J.! How can I be sure this isn\u2019t just your medical condition talking nonsense again!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her hands, you kneel before the shade of her wide pear dip \u201c<b>I want to prove myself by becoming a better man for you.</b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.J., I love \u2013 I MEAN LIKE, I \u2018like\u2019 you as you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c<b>No, I want to be your strength for a change! I want to follow a work-out regiment you prescribe and be the caliber of man you deserve!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking down, you couldn\u2019t help but enjoy Rebecca making order out of your chaos by laying down ground rules. \u201cOkay\u201d her voice no longer quivered, but her red cheeks, much like her hips, didn\u2019t lie \u201cLet\u2019s say I want to believe you. You want me to personally coach you whenever I feel like it, even though you\u2019ll likely wimp out as always?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DON\u2019T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!</b>\u201d your scream, stereotypic of a drill Sargent, sent a shiver up her spine \u201c<b>Especially if I act like I don\u2019t remember any of this. Don\u2019t allow me to be weak anymore, Rebecca. Please, help me be better for you.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, enough\u2026even though I don\u2019t think I could do much of a good job these days\u201d she sarcastically patting her belly as you stood to hug her. \u201cI\u2019ll help you as much as I -- oof!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Thanks, Rebby. You\u2019re the best!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c\u2026Rebby? Look, I\u2019m not sure how much just the two of us can do without proper equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A devious smile crosses your face as Rebecca thought; nothing can get in your way to please her.  \u201c<b>You just leave that minor inconvenience to me\u2026So, do we have a deal?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her for only moment, you extend your hand for a simple confirmation; \u201con one condition, C.J..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Currently resting her head on the pillow at the head of your bed, the rotund, pear shaped angel that was currently the object of your desire found herself lost in the blissful afterglow of her glorious gorging session at your hand.   And it had been glorious indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand rubbing the exposed porcelain mound that was her belly, the other hand drifting through her hair, you look around the room around the two of you, glancing at the disheveled remains of what was, if you do say so yourself, an even better stuffing session than the one that you had graced Kate with earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Almost too easy. Almost...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad J.C. not been in control when Rebecca had whispered those magic words earlier, you're sure that the weaker side of yourself would have been flabbergasted, if he had not fainted outright instead. Luckily, you had been in control at this, the true turning point of the relationship you had desired secretly for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I want you to feed me.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour insides had quivered as your heard those words, spoken so quietly that you strained to hear them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's face was bright red, her eyes looking downward nervously, hoping that none of the sources of the gossiping voices in the hallway near your room had been close enough to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I want you to feed me like you did with Kate.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour outstretched arm, waiting for the handshake that had never come, slowly dropped to your side. Rebecca, sweet little...well, perhaps not so little...Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour insides leapt with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting into action, you rushed forward, planting the largest, wettest kiss you could muster upon the unsuspecting lips of the girl you loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was certainly startled at first, attempting to pull away. But you would not relent. Finally, her knees quivering, the once athlete who it seemed had finally turned to the culinary wonders of food, gluttony, and pleasure melted into your embrace. It lasted only a moment, but a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking from your kiss after what seemed like a lifetime and grabbing a dazed Rebecca by the hand, you dashed away towards your ever so close room, your enraptured companion following behind, seemingly unaware of anything but the kiss that she had wanted so desperately desired and had finally transpired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What had followed was a display of hedonism that Dionysus himself would be proud of. You were the perfect gentleman of course. The euphoria from opening up your friend to this new world of pleasure was reward enough. Besides, that could always come later. Situated beside her as she slept off the effects of what you were sure was a experience that may have even surpassed your previous efforts with Kate, you could think of a way this could get any better. The gentle caress of your hand on her belly had been enough to put Rebby to sleep as you looked back upon what had transpired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself, and the world is at peace. Nothing can possibly go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Droning ringing and something that sounding like a voice that wouldn\u2019t shut up for a few seconds. Like an incoherent dream that wouldn\u2019t get the hint that you're already up and not in any mood for more reasons for your head to hurt more than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh -- what time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was becoming less fuzzy as you had trouble gaining balance on your own bed. A slight fear that you were already getting too fat to even know how much space you took on you own special Queen Size didn\u2019t help you deal with the situation you were about to land in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid someone find me and take me to my room? Without trying to shove anything down my mouth while I was unconscious or take creepy pictures?\u201d You weren't sure whether you should actually smile as you didn\u2019t feel any painful bulge on your stomach or any weird marks on your mouth or other places. \u201cLucky day I guess.  Wait, what\u2019s this soft thing right\u2014\u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour instincts immediately broke out into a cold sweat as you realized how familiar the object you was touching felt like. The fact that it was snoring and MOVED almost made CJ shriek in a very masculine, macho voice that would have surely have woken whomever it was up if you didn\u2019t thankfully cover your mouth as quick as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God no. Please don\u2019t tell me someone actually slept with me. The entire female population would riot if not kill me!</i> CJ was almost too afraid to check exactly who it was if your panic didn\u2019t move the bed enough for Rebecca to shift through the covers and moan out a few pleasant thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJay\u201d she softly cooed \u201cI can barely move as is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a series of gasps and Three Stoogian noises that could almost pass for an actual comprehensible language for a Looney Toon, if you could first figure out what was more shocking. That you actually wound up in this situation at all or if she actually just meant what she could have said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just gonna have to roll to the next table and I don\u2019t care who can see~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart began to slow down as the bloated girl began to try swallowing an arguably small enough to manage pillow in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, so one of your best friends sounds like she\u2019s having a very *odd* dream about you. She\u2019s sleeping in your bed, in her skivvies, and very obviously fantasizing about you.

Some sort of ancient vault of the Masters Family\u2019s favorite torture tools throughout the ages that would put Vlad Tempest and Mary, Queen of Scots to shame in how vicious they were; A combination of a rack, a force feeding device and guillotine for your di\u2026\u201dCan I please not scare myself into a nervous breakdown?\u201d You whispered under your breath as you shook the more useless ideas out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a second\u201d you tried to reassure the threat outside the door as you clumsily tripped over an apocalyptic wasteland of wrappers, packaging and plates oddly littered around your floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Masters Heiress grew more worried as she heard the racket and slightly audible swears her hopeful husband to be was making on his way to answer her. \u201cIs this a bad time, I don\u2019t want to bother you or anything\u201d speaking in an uncharacteristically sheepish way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, everything\u2019s fine!\u201d You immediately opened and slipped around the door closing it behind your back.  \u201cI\u2019m here. Hello, Claire Masters. How are you?\u201d You both shared a nervous smile briefly trying to suss each other out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, eager to go first eventually spoke up. \"Listen, I just want to apologize for how I acted earlier today\". CJ's brow raised further as she continued on talking \"I didn't think you were against the way our relationship went and -- if I've hurt you or displeased you in anyway - please, tell me and let me try and make it better\". You weren't sure if this was some sort of trick or if you fell into some Bizarro World, but you didn't have the chance to find out more before Rebecca made a very loud ruckus attempting to forage whatever she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Claire's tone became much more forceful and familiar, much to your dismay. \"OH THAT, its just a movie I had on because -- uh -- I kind of had an accident today and I think I went home early\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's overtly maternal side cranked up to 11 as she rushed to hold -- or maybe that should be squeeze her man in her soft embrace. \"What?! When was this and why was I NOT INFORMED OF IT AS SOON AS IT TRANSPIRED?!\" She blushed both at the feeling of both you and her extra flesh pushing up against one another and as you attempted to worm out of her arms for the air to speak. \"I don't know\" CJ honestly tried to piece together anything that happened since head injury \"Last thing I know is I got hurt, I was eventually told of it and now I'm at my dorm. I thought everyone would know everything about me as usual right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, CJ\" Claire carefully considered her options as she pressed CJ in deeper. \"You were acting strange only because you got hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" CJ muttered out, unsure of what she was going on about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd still like to apologize for any undo stress I may have caused you, CJ\" she diplomatically stated as she let go \"I always like spending more time with you anyway, so I wish to invite you over to my estate for the evening all the same\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah, that sounds great\" you desperately try to end the conversation so that Claire would leave your flat. \"When should I come by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the last bell, of course\". Tapping her watch, she smiled a proper and self-satisfied grin \"We must always be good students at this Academy and it would not do for me to let you spoil yourself the wrong way\". As she began to make her way to the dorm elevator, you waited until her face was was finally concealed by posh elevator doors before you quickly rushed to your bed to see if Rebecca was still there. Somehow, however, a very large girl friend just escaped your room without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What were you going to do now, genius?</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either one of your paranoid fears was true and she somehow Danger prone Daphned her way down a stereotypical Mystery Novel secret passage way the Masters or whomever likely put to your room, the vents of the Chubbesco dorms were big enough to squeeze prize hogs through or she basically waddled down the fire escape in her sleep. Whatever it was, as much as you worried about what kind of nonsense a newly discovered somnambulist could unintentionally wander into, sadly, that wasn\u2019t the most pressing issue on your mind. You just gave your word to Claire Masters that you would meet her at her lavish abode this evening and she would be just as angry about you standing her up as if she discovered an almost naked woman on your bed. Hopefully, you can rush through her likely gigantic dinner or whatever it is and find Rebecca before she can hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you\u2019re not completely heartless. You try to text Kate, Bunnie and Ms. Young hoping they can handle the search for you, but sadly only the staff responds with an assurance they\u2019ll help. Kate, for some reason, is still out cold and hasn\u2019t been on for hours. Not even a dumb emoticon from her. When Rebecca\u2019s squared, you should probably make sure she didn\u2019t get stuck in bathroom trying to hide from a crowd or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fret over whether or not dressing up will matter, but depending on how much food is in your future - \"and that always seems to be the only thing on Clarie's mind\" you grumble out loud, you'll only end up ruining another dress jacket trying to be nice. Maybe you should finally just tell her no. Maybe.,,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRANG GOES THE EVENING BELL</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maybe you should just sit this one out and let me fix our life.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the custom bathroom that is still 10 sizes too big for you, you gaze deeply into the wall sized framed mirror. As your eyes focus, the sleepy and gentile hooded gaze of the idiot sharpens into a calm glare. Your thick s curved brow easily gives off the impression that you're constantly angry and you can appreciate that. After cleaning your teeth with brush, floss and mouthwash, you hold your chin to look at the wild growth of puberty on your face. <b>\"Does pantywaist even shave this peach-fuzz? He isn't old enough to pull off a five o clock shadow right\"</b>. You make quick work with the electric razor, but have trouble trimming some areas around and under your neck due to your weaker self's eating habits forming the basis of double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you bathe and you growl at the crap CJ uses. His unique position as a boy in a girl's school meant that many of the onsite facilities, necessities and even some of the outer Lethargis Town goods cater to a heavy female population and in more ways than one. Good for whatever you could need to fulfill the pleasures of your many lady friends, but not exactly equipped for what a boy of age really needs to strut his stuff. Aftershave, body wash, fashion that you pick out and not whatever your girlfriend thinks will look cute on you at the moment. Hell, most of the soap and shampoo he picked out he probably bogarted out from Rebby or Kitty's rooms. Lilac body oils? Does he have no pride or even personal taste? You know damn well that a good seasonal sent for women to smell right now is Cinnamon and Pomegranate. Looks like you need to talk to the Masters about your shipping needs as well as settle your personal business with them. They gave you a personal line of credit for this exact reason, but they tend to favor its use solely on food, snacks and stuffing for \"growing\" boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>If you're going to get fat you're going to do it of your own will and desire, not because someone wants to creepily groom you for the family.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to put on a nice Chubbeso Varsity Jacket along with whatever you felt like wearing when little miss Masters gave you a ring. \"CJ, I hope you didn't forget our little date tonight\", came from a relaxed sense of dominance. It'd be cute if she wasn't so used to getting whatever she wanted. <b>\"I assume I have a ride arranged\"</b>, you coldly ask, testing the waters of how best to twist her around your finger for a change. \"Indeed I did\" overtly smug about everything proceeding exactly how she planned, \"our outings should be extravagant and sophisticated, as is custom for a Masters\". <b>\"Then I'll see you soon\"</b>, you curtly state. \"Wait, I haven't told you about what tonight will-- \" you end the call and turn off your smartphone, making sure to grab and pocket a pair of earbuds to block out any unwanted changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you proceed down the lobby, you notice a few turned heads of the rank and file Chubbeso grounds keepers and free to stalk students enjoying your usually sharp attire.Tucked in dress shirts and clean pressed pants. Their boy calls weren't insulting but you had much more bigger fish to go after tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbida Idhar, the desert jewel of an assistant of the Masters waited at a very modified for carry-weight Hummer V2 Limousine. Usually she wasn't there for Claire and almost exclusively acted as the extra hands of only one woman. The riding window slid down to reveal none other than Mother Dearest herself, \"Oh young mister Dalton\", Jessica Masters' thick fingers beckons out to you \"would you please be my riding companion for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"With pleasure, ma'am\"</b>, you politely respond, as Idhar opens the door for you to have a seat right next to the beyond rubenesque beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped a massive arm around your shoulder \"Oh CJ, please, such formalities shouldn't come between us\", her breath was sweet and strong with a mixture of what you assumed was the result of the wine bottles and chocolates stocked around the several bars and delicacy assortments she had already tore into to keep her figure as full as it aught to be. You grab hold of her other wicked hand and looked into her demure yet commanding eyes, <b>\"it'd just break my heart if I didn't show you the proper respect every woman deserves, ma'am. Mother's orders\"</b>. Her smile widened as her full and slightly stained cheeks parted, \"Oh my, you've never been this playful before\". \"Whatever shall I tell my husband if he were to see us like this\" she said as wrapped both her arms and drew her lips very close to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"That he is a fool for leaving a woman like you unfulfilled for even a moment\"</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts become less focused as you begin to imagine the things you could do with a woman like Mrs. Masters. Time has taken nothing from her, she has only enjoyed herself and grown more lovely by her own desire. She took her time popping strange chocolate into her mouth, making sure you watched everything go down at a steady pace. Their allure was almost as strong as her own. The black silk of her Two-Piece Custom Embellished suit and skirt could barely contain her, much less buckler her jacket together anymore. One good meal and she could be exposed just for you, and her appetite was making it easier and easier the longer you took her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she wanted to make you hungry enough to join her or hungry enough for her. <b>Honestly, both wouldn't be bad things to engage in</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>However, you also made a promise to someone. it wouldn't be right to have fun with Mrs. Masters now, as inviting as she is, before you keep your word with Rebecca.</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide it was easier to still play along, but making a bold move of your own may either cause her to back down or give you some breathing room to concentrate on your promise before you lose yourself to raw passion. <b>So you close the several milometer gap between your lips and kiss Mrs. Masters right then and there</b>. And it wasn't any sugar you'd regulate for family or some quick peck on the cheek. You surprise yourself and apparently even Jessica by how curious your tongue was touching hers. How your hand somehow found its way traveling around the matured crevices of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she closed her deep blue eyes, she took the lead harder than you for a few minutes and reciprocated your affections, and still far beyond your ability to discern whether this was truly genuine or if she was playing a much more dangerous game with you. She seemed to show you how to better move your body and fingers without saying a word, guiding you further across her vast tracks of land while her tremendous thighs explored your legs and seemed to lock around you every now and again. The pressures her overwhelming extra weight pushed upon your frame was exhilarating, if not curious as to whether Mrs. Masters ever studied any sort of yoga or martial art with how she could apply it even at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your session was over she gave you a comforting gentile smile before the a very rambunctious voice echoed from the speakers in the center of the passenger lounge \"I don't know who to call the dog this time, the boy or you, you saucy old cow\". You both turned to see a live video screen where a more noticeably drunk and somewhat blushing Professor Jen Telleri of the Chubbeso Culinary class apparently witnessed the show you and Mrs. Masters put on. \"Looks like I won the bet this time\" the Masters Matriarch's belly laugh was deep and whimsical, even as she quickly clung to you and allowed you to feel how much she could jiggle just from speaking \"I finally got CJ to show the caliber of man he could grow to be. I expect our agreed upon payment to be in prime condition and in heavy quantity\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you need any more Hans&amp;Gretta clogging up what's left of your arteries\" Telleri snorted as she inhaled an entire bag of H&amp;G chocolate balls between her taunts \"or making you even more fatter than all hell\". They both started to laugh like like gossiping school girls when Jessica came back at the lazy cook her with her claws \"Turn on your monitor before you fling insults. I'm the one wants to weigh a metric ton, remember, you sagging bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeigning regret, you interrupt the old couple. \"<b>Aw, so all of this was a set up for a wager?</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my sweet little man\", she practically pushed your head deep into her cavernous bosom \"our love is very real. But we were just having a boring little conference chat and then I heard you actually set up a date with my little Claire, so I had to come see you and give a little push if you needed it\". Not resisting her will for you to rest on her comfortable breasts and belly, her fox like grin bore her sweet fangs. \"But then the CJ I met tonight was so very <i>different</i> than the boy my child rightly claimed as hers. Telly though you'd just be too bashful even to hug your poor old mommy-in-law, and yet here you are, suave as the devil himself and still skinny as a rail\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I made a safe bet on you, Mr. Dalton\" Mrs Telleri joined in on the teasing \"and now I have to lose half my month's reserve because you had the gall to kiss your headmistress in front of a live camera\". \"This could be grounds for a very severe punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick hand gently pulled your chin up to look at her more openly Inquisitive gaze. \"Who is this strange, yet interesting dark horse in my academy and where could you have spirited our CJ away to, I wonder\" she asks in a way too coy to tell if she's already onto you or just having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up pieces of the many almost empty chocolate assortments around the two of you, J.C. nimbly begins to pop them into Mrs Masters' many chinned maw. The first once again caught her unaware, but a shameless glutton like Jessica Masters never turned down any morsel of food offered to her ever expanding temple of indulgence. \"<b>I guess you finally broke me down. Your charms just too great to resist any longer</b>\". The more she allowed you to feed her, the more you felt the culinary chef, and even your driver, Abida, watch your actions very carefully. However, while you could hope that maybe there was some interest from Telleri, the pure hatred angled at you from the rear-view mirror didn't need to be mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see if Mrs Masters would follow your hands if there were these special chocolates involved, and amazingly, she followed your hand like a very obedient (and obese) pet waiting for her treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ma'am</b>\", you begin as you test this obedience further, \"<b>could I trouble you to purchase a few odds and ends for me? I promise I won't ask the Taj Mahal of you</b>\". She only responds in gulps and moans, but she appears to be listening. \"<b>I'm afraid my current attire and necessities aren't befitting of a potential Masters beau</b>\", Jessica makes a long mouthful noise and nods her head \"<b>and it isn't just extra nutrition</b>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes for a bit and gives you a curious \"mmpfh\" as you keep helping her finish her car snacks before her more fitting dinners at the manor. \"<b>While I may have difficulty in showing my appreciation for you concerns on my diet, there is more to a man's life than eating. Claire deserves me to be in the latest fashions, the best products, like say a cologne modeled after these chocolate you love so much</b>\". Mrs Masters seems to salivate through her already stuffed cheeks at this particular idea and nods before she swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a caring young man you are; I'm so very sorry we didn't consider ALL your potential needs may be different than our usual students\". Jessica tries to turn this into her idea, but she still seems very pliable and eager for more chocolates as soon as she hears you tear open a fresh box. \"<b>Even though you likely were the reason I was enrolled, I don't blame you being unprepared for a boy at a girl's school</b>\" you lovingly rub her more open gut as some buttons finally begin to fly off at Telleri's screen and all over the car \"<b>accidents happen</b>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful old girl\" Telleri mocks as she writes some notes down \"any more to this and I may want to steal him for myself\". \"Like you'd ever eat enough to woo a stud like CJ\", the Matriarch somehow manages to say in a way everyone could comprehend with her mouth practically glued shut with chocolate pulp. \"At least then I'd get something out of the figure you ruined by giving me this job\" the chef huffed. Jessica viciously pantomimed a crying baby with her hands and moans as you continued to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I also have a special request that I need to speak with you alone about tonight</b>\" almost running out of ammunition, you try to leave her wondering and interested to hear the rest. \"Sure dearest\" Mrs Masters playfully winks at you as you arrive at her oh so humble abode \"I'd love to continue our conversation, and maybe even continue where we left off in a much more personal environment\". As you step out into the courtyard, you hear a very obvious shredding noise as you almost catch enough of a glimpse of the likely cause before Abida triggers the automatic door to shut you out. The window lowers just enough for you to see Jessica Masters barely covering herself. \"Too bad, I'm sure you'd love to see this\" you smile your own wolfish grin as she continues \"and maybe you'll even get to know me with nothing to hide later in my room. AFTER dinner and your play date with Claire, of course\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stretch hummer slowly rolls to the back entrance of the Manor while you are escorted by legion of fat maids, each bulging from their proper garb and longingly looking at you while maintaining their professional stance as respectful servants - <b>at least for now anyway</b>. On in particular dark skinned beauty catches your attention before you finally make your way to the front door. It opens to reveal Claire dressed in a fetching green dining gown. The natural Irish emeralds that flowed around her wide hips and stomach perfectly accentuated her size as they shined in the pale moonlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to begin a likely prepared speech to greet you, but you cut her off with honest flattery. \"<b>You are really beautiful in that dress</b>\" you let out a short whistle as you make a quick walk around her \"<b>and here I am barely in a presentable jacket. Sorry Claire</b>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you lock eyes with her, she seems to get even more subdued and embarrassed. \"W-well, thank you for noticing CJ\" she blurted out as she twiddled with her finger around one her freshly tussled waves of long hair \"I wanted to wait until the Summer Festival before I got you a fetching gentleman's wear, but I suppose I put it off too long. It isn't your fault at all\". As she tries to avoid eye contact, you wonder if she already knows the difference between how you look at her and how dipshit does. <b>Cunning as her mother and just as gorgeous</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own slight paunch begins to growl and her eager ears quickly picks it up. \"R-ready for dinner already, I see\". <b>She doesn't hide her desires, she just needs to learn how to compromise and get consent instead of demand it</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Well, you are hungry. Maybe you should let her have her fun. But then again, you always wanted to turn the tables and stuff her for a change.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that the d\u00e9cor of the Masters Mansion was obsessed with adipose was the understatement of several centuries the house has stood and grown in influence. While the occasional life size scale Venus Figure or polished marble statue dotted the many gardens occasionally skirted the line between Neoclassical Greco-Roman style through the artistic whims of a Masters\u2019 fancy and common decency -- with the possibility that some were so round, you weren\u2019t sure how much was actually carved so much as they found a reasonably rotund stone and simply chiseled a familiar face on it; the inside was a constant barrage of fat. From the help to the very walls and foundations, there was no escape from a pride that reveled in its own largeness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls and pathways all displayed stone reliefs of very plump people gorging themselves, engaging in sedentary activities or even making love depending on where they lead to. Every portrait on display always depicted someone beyond obese that couldn\u2019t entirely fit more than their face in focus of the picture, though they all had their own distinct personalities. Even the gold-leaf railing that helped the much too stout to walk around the estate curved into humanoid and much more ancient depictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Not too gauche of a design, but you knew why weakling didn\u2019t want to step in here unprotected. Everything about this place felt like it wanted to seduce you to consume until you could never leave.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main lobby that took you in after you stepped into the <i>Versailles of Lethargis</i> comprised of a decadent atrium that illuminated the halls more with the light of the sun and moon than modern electricity, although there were of course secondary and emergency lighting wired. It gave the chamber a wonderful sense of mood that only intensified Claire\u2019s barely held in excitement that you were finally here, in her own home and even on a real dinner date. Like a small child with a new toy she was eager to feed you, <b>but you had other plans for her.</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reinforced mahogany and redwood table stretched about 20 feet long and 7 foot wide, with some chairs so thick it could take several strong men to push, yet some of the maids seemed to have brushed them off easily to make room for you and Claire to sit right next to each other in front of a mountain of food. You were to be positioned by the fire place, with adequate room to lay on extravagantly soft carpets in case you likely couldn't sit any longer and needed a full stomach massage. You made sure to sit Claire down first as the nice thing to do and then took a few bites of soy sauce and garlic roast duck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it\", the heavy heiress asked while dreaming of a fatter you with each swallow. \"<b>Tender and juicy, but not too sweet nor sour</b>\", you calmly imitate a food critic without trying to act like you knew any terminology to throw about \"<b>did you prepare this, Claire?</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned a deep crimson at idea of being your personal cook \"No, silly, I'm no where near ready to give you the banquets you need -- I mean, lunches I would like to make for you\". You manage to pick most of the plate clean before you decide to edge the conversation towards an opening. You stick the last bit of meat on your fork and look at it, waiting for Claire to get interested, which doesn't take half of 10 seconds with how she practically scooted so close to you her much more broader love handles were touching your own. \"W-what's wrong CJ\" her concern wasn't entirely from lust, but you couldn't blame a girl for liking them large. \"Is there something wrong with the food? Should I get something else for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This piece seems a little hot</b>, you nonchalantly lie <b>would you mind blowing on it for me?</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my CJ\" she nervously agrees. As she arcs her head near your hands and you softly shove it into her mouth. \"Cjgey, wah\" you don't allow her to talk as you snap your fingers and the maids mechanically serve another plate for you to shove into Claire. They were trained for their speed and it showed with how much of a \"portion\" they could swiftly pile onto the fine china. She already wolfed down three full Baguette loafs, 30 stuffed oysters, a full roasted quail, five entire trays of chocolate Yorkshire Pudding (one of her many sweet weaknesses) and 10 plates of her favorite marbled Beef Bourguignon slathered in pork lardons. This was what she could finish in the time it took you savor one duck half the size of a football (the soccer kind, you Yankee), and it didn't even phase her. However, <i>poor Claire</i> chewed and polished off what you gave her, but you could see she wasn't lost on why you were doing this so much as how she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You really are a greedy little pig</b>, your tone was harsh but you weren't looking to bully the Princess. She bit her lip as you rolled a ridiculously large lump of Squid Ink Tagliatelle pasta. In you or in her, both options were exciting Claire into a heavy breath. She opened wide only when your hand moved to her face and she was far too much of a glutton to take her time with the flavor. \"CJ, you really should try some of this with me\" her highness hoped she could regain the plan of <i>eventual</i> mutual fattening only on her terms, but you weren't having any more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one of the 20 porcelain gravy boats, you hold her double chin as you pour it all down her gullet slowly. \"<b>For an entire year, you and your mother have orchestrated every opportunity you could to force feed me as fat as humanly possible</b>\". As soon as the first one is finished you violently hurl the boat to a wall, scaring everyone else in the room even when a heaver maid manages to catch it in time. \"<b>I am hounded by growing mob of crazed teenagers every day, that I know you were not only the founding member of their little <i>CJ FAN CLUB</i>, but you have increasingly led them to become more fanatical in their devotion to making me fatter for you AGAINST MY OWN WILL</b>\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bitter anger erupts as the saucers become quicker, and your voice echoes out from the halls while Claire continues to drink it down in a combination of fear and exhilaration. \"<b>You lie to my face, turn even my own friends into pawns to stuff me, grab my life by the throat and drag it into the kitchen, a sumo ring or some other dumb food focused thing</b>!\" Your ranting knocks around confections and silverware, some even the help can't get in time, while Claire is now down on her hands and knees. She looks up to see a wrathful CJ and doesn't know what to do except continue to quietly listen as you even stop feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT UPSETS ME THE MOST?</font></b>\" you roar out as she meekly asked <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"what\"</font> in a mousey tone. \"<b>YOU NEVER--</b>\" you sigh as you try to compose yourself. \"<b>You never just come out and tell me how you really feel. I know I'm guilty of this too, but it just INFURIATES me to no end how you keep this all a stupid game of tricks and deception instead of just laying out a clear \"I get hot at the idea of both of us being the fattest fucks on earth\" and then try to date me like a normal human being</b>\". Claire gets up to try and hug you but you turn to hold her corpulent arms and look her in the eye \"<b>I am sick of these power games, Claire Masters. This - is - not - love!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but\" the Princess interjects \"but I -- I kind of\" playing with her hair she trails off trying not to cry. \"<b>But you actually like this weird little game of ours. You don't just enjoy the weight gain, but also these power-plays and the nonsense it can become</b>\". You flatly snark and put your hand on your head as Claire nods. \"At first I didn't know how to even introduce myself to you, let alone how to say anything\" she sniffs and you hug her back knowing damn well this is your fault. \"Mother raised me to love food and what it does to our bodies, and I do. But it isn't because of silly tradition, you know\". She smiles as she pats and pokes the fluffy ends of her form \"I enjoy being like this and becoming wider and heavier every day, not just for my own naughty pleasures - but to please you\". \"When I saw you for the first time, I just knew we were two of a kind -- at least in certain ways\" you wipe the tears from her chubby face. \"But then I didn't know if you felt the same way I do about being fat, and I got scared that maybe we couldn't be together because we weren't the same after all. So I -- I'm sorry, CJ\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You absolutely hated women being driven to tears, especially if you were what made them upset.</b> \"<b>Let's just start over from a clean slate here</b>\" Claire hugged tighter as you tried to make it better for both of you. \"Claire, I really don't care that much about being fat. I like you. I'd love to help you enjoy being as big and as beautiful as you want to be, and we could work something out about how big both of us are if you actually try to have a real relationship with me\". You make sure she hears this part as clear as she can, \"<b>And a real relationship involves give and take. If I'm going to be fat, I want it to be on my own terms. Okay?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Claire sniffed as nuzzled your chubby chest. \"<b>And if I am going to bulk up, I want your mother to give me access to Silverfish exercise equipment and trainers. I want a lot of core strength to be able to enjoy being fat. To dance, go places and do things with whoever I end up with, even you, to keep life fun.</b>\" Claire once again bit her lip imagining a new herculean you and considered her options. \"Okay, I'm not sure if I'll like the end result\" she steps away and playfully puts her hands on her hips \"but supporting you as you meet me half way could be fun - for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have my own conditions too\" Claire held up a chubby finger and prodded your belly \"I'm going to continue our game, and I want you to occasionally feed me. Harder and fuller than anyone else. Starting now!\"</span></div></div>",

Still, Claire stands adamant about how this will go. \u201c<b>All the same, Supergirl, I\u2019d be a lot more comfortable if you gave me some sort of safe word or time out trigger as fattening you is all fun and good unless it ruptures something.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess projects a very high class laugh you thought only existed in anime. \u201cAs cute as your needless concern is, CJ, no mere morsel will stop me and I simply must crush all competition for you.\u201d \u201c<b>This is about what I did with Kate</b>\u201d you ask an assured rhetorical question as Claire\u2019s eyes light up with competitive spirit as well as careless voracity. \u201cWhile I am overjoyed <b>you</b> finally admitted your love for a healthy sized woman I knew was within you\u201d, she makes a brief imitation of both your particular speaking pattern and her mother in likely knowing you\u2019re not exactly him, but being a tease about it; \u201cI must step up my efforts to win your heart - both in my increased consumption, and now in your direct involvement of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a very regal pout on her face as she folded her arms between her ample chest and the upper folds of her middle. Claire clearly had deeper questions to ask, but she either wasn\u2019t ready to speak them or wasn\u2019t sure she had a right to bring them up. \u201cYou wished for our relationship to be more open and thus I\u2019ve made my demands in a clear manner. Will you accept my terms, CJ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You repress the urge to mock her incessant need for formality and grandiose flair about <i>everything</i> in the hopes of finally getting this show on the road.</b> \u201c<b>Very well</b>\u201d you sigh as you take off your jacket and unbutton your slightly tight dress shirt, \u201c<b>let\u2019s see how much you can handle.</b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids had already apparently restocked the table and rearranged the room before you had the thought to ask. The well-fed machine of the Masters had no difficulty in falling in line under your specifics without being told anything, which you assume was another over calculation of Claire studying the footage of your Cafeteria Incident in preparation of monopolizing your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you began the assault with high calorie Haute French cuisine, with, of course, proportions big enough to choke an elephant with how much they followed the Chubbeso Theoretical Gastronomy of More is More; your black and white forces made sure to pass you a fine balance between an abundance of meat, salads with enough sauce to guarantee possibly 2 pounds with every serving and a seemingly endless supply of creams of everything. The Alastian Baeckeoffe was like a 5 star Turducket in how the potatoes, carrots, marjoram and other herbs and vegetables were all separately stuffed and flavored on the individual layers of fried pork, beef and lamb like a plump pyramid that challenged the edges of the trays to hold it in before either they broke under the weight of the food or Claire practically ripped them open with her eagerness to eat. She was always quicker than gravity, although sometimes the heiress simply sucked the layers out like an obese vampire on a chunky oyster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire cleaned France from the table she was already past having trouble breathing and became finicky when you offered any sort of massage instead of just tearing the seams her bloating gut was already making in her dress wider to offer less restriction. \u201cWhatever will I do when I am in nothing but my lingerie, CJ?\u201d Her face became a thicker shade of red as time went on, but you weren\u2019t sure if it was just how risqu\u00e9 this was or if she was also becoming tipsy from the amount of alcohol used in the collective dinner for 8 normal people she\u2019d inhaled. \u201c<b>Assuming you don\u2019t bust out of those as well, I\u2019d need to rub your whole stomach to relieve the stress you keep pretending you\u2019re not feeling</b>\u201d, you flatly snide more out of care for her well-being than anything else. Her fatness enters a cute loop of repeating \u201cI keep telling you I\u2019m \u2013urp\u201d before she finally manages a frail \u201cine\u201d after a particularly long belch. You had already managed to get her on her back next to the fire place, but she only accepted this position \u201cfor the wonderful view\u201d more than admitting she wasn\u2019t invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up from the remaining Valley of Deserts, you grab one of the whole Jellied Eels and in hold it in front of Claire. \u201c<b>If you can eat this as quickly as before</b>\u201d you harshly chide \u201c<b>then I\u2019ll stop bringing it up. However, if you show any sign of being too full, I\u2019m going to roll your rolls no matter how much it tickles.</b>\u201d You don\u2019t move your hand at all; Claire has to pick herself up from her already beached position to eat it on her own. The less huge mistress struggles to first rise up on her hands and shift the cargo in her belly enough to sit on her wide bottom. It frustrates you how much Claire puts herself through just to act like nothing\u2019s wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 hic \u2013 almost there\u201d she weakly pants between more hiccups and burps \u201cn-no need to worry, C-erp- J.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeds to slowly suck the soft, yet firm jelly out of your hand, working on the long edges of the head and the tail that were easiest to reach without much effort on her part. Moving at a glacial pace from those shafts, Claire begins to lick upwards and outwards making a mess out of her face and what was left of her top. \"<b>You seem to be getting more on you than in you, Princess.</b>\" She licks her lips and lowers her lashes into an unintentional bedroom gaze \"a momentary - hurp - stay of execution.\" Her neck widens further like a snake as she attempts to swallow some of the pieces down whole, delicately lowering it down into the gurgling expanse of her too overcrowded belly. You should be stopping this now, but Claire's determination convinces to let her finish her grueling ordeal before you punish her. When there is nothing left but what you cradled in your hand, you open it up to allow her highness to complete her mission. Wobbling on her dimpled knees and thunderous thighs, Claire enjoys putting your jellied caked fingers into her mouth. The feel of her greedy tongue gathering everything they could from the contorts and slight roundness of your palms, around the lower to upper phalanxes, to the sensitive tips of your digits. Claire liked making this as foreplay-like as possible and that was fine with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last trace of the original globs on your fingers were gone, you wiped the mess from Claire's face which let the princess have another small encore with your right hand. \"S-see? All clean and - burap - inside me.\" Claire gently falls on her back with a heavy thud, her entire body jiggling as it absorbed the impact and let her moan and breathe handling her gut without being able to lift her hands from being <b>so full and exhausted</b>. \"<b>It took you twenty minutes</b>\", you growl as you look down on the last remnants of her evening gown finally snapping off to show her custom black silk lingerie snugly holding back the rest of her, \"<b>to eat one eel.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - hicm - sorry\" she meekly wheezes out trying to digest. \"<b>No, I'm sorry I let you hurt yourself\" you yell \"<b>and now I'm going to help you feel better whether you like it or not, Claire!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can even burp out a desist, you touch her taught pale dome of a belly and Claire screams. \"<b>What?! Is it worse than I thought?!</b>\" \"N-no, CJ -- I -- oh god--\" she moans in joy as you try to broadly stroke the front of her gut \"I'm such a naughty whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you stop because you are all sorts of confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for her to breathe and relive herself of digestive pain, and whatever that kind of eroticism came from, Claire cools down enough to explain herself. \"S-sorry CJ, I didn't want to - hic- tell you I get very, well, 'sensitive', when I eat a lot even for me.\" \"<b>And what the hell was I supposed to do, wait you out or let you cause yourself some internal injury? What did I say about being open with me and why didn't you tell me this before we began?!</b>\" Even you being angry with her didn't stop her from moaning out a bit more before she continued, \"I told you - urp - I am a naughty girl that really likes being fat\". You gave her an ugly look as she tried to laugh without setting off the critical nuclear reactor that was her digestive tract. \"Okay, I'm very s-sorry. I just - hic - wasn't ready to let you know. I was afraid that you'd use that sort of information against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot grasp how aggravated and confused you are at that sort of answer. \"<b>In what conspiracy world do you live in where I'd abuse the fact your whole body apparently is an erogenous zone when you overeat?</b>\" She sheepishly bit her lip, \"its one of my favorite dreams involving you.\" You sigh as you rub your head trying to solve the headache that could be this girl. \"<b>Goddamn it, Claire. What am I going to do with you?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, if you don't mind me yelling some silly things between burps\", she gave you a mischievous grin as she slowly put her hands around her mountain of a middle, \"would you please be a gentleman and help me finish dinner?\" \"<b>Not big enough?</b>\" you jokingly sigh. She winks, \"There is no such thing. Claire Masters always finishes everything at the table. It is the only way to become a Supermassive black hole for you.\"<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

Never wavered on it and, frankly, I'd feel lost without the pampering even with you around to make it even better.\" Claire smiles as she has a thought, \"Oh, CJ, would you mind visiting my room? I've always wanted to take you there and nibble with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids already start shifting the remaining food into elaborate cloche trays and chafing dishes, assuming you would take her up on this offer, so you went along with it in the hopes that you could pry further information before you stormed the matron's den. As you walked and Claire was carried on jewel encrusted litter throne that took at least 8 servants to move at a decent pace, their mistress certainly made them work for it as she devoured caramel lathered crepes, full cakes and a decadent chocolate baklava. Mostly on her own greedy insistence, but occasionally commanding them to lower her so she could either offer you some or let you offer it to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Clare, do you mind me asking some hopefully not too personal questions?</b>\" \"CJ, I'd happily tell you my measurements, but sadly, they keep changing every day so much that they're even a mystery to me\" she teases shamelessly. You roll your eyes even if that information wouldn't be bad to personally learn every day, \"<b>Why would I ask that when I could always just measure you now?</b>\" Claire takes this suggestion to heart and has one of the serving girls squeeze measuring times into her schedule. \"<b>No, dummy, I meant what's the deal between you and Silverfish?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt and Cousin Flounders...\" she worryingly mutters \"Oh, they're very odd but boring people. You wouldn't like them.\" \"<b>No really, what's their deal? I've heard there's some bad academy blood that people spread rumors about all the time about.\"</b> Claire sulks her head into her several chins as she really wants to avoid this topic \"could we please move to something else? Mother--\" \"<b>Isn't here, Claire.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbles more from being forced to talk than from the raw sugar being tossed into her exposed gut.\"Very well, Sonia Flounders and her daughters: Livia, Josephine, Himiko and little Zenobia; are either famished skeletons or muscle-bound neanderthals who are enslaved to a worship of exercise worse than anywhere else in the <i>regular</i> world. We only ever see each other on amicable terms when Grandmother wants to bring the whole family together, yet auntie always gets into a fight with mother over money, reputation, politics or just ceaselessly attacking our harmless hedonism.\" The Princess rips apart several thick bricks of pound cake to settle down, a sacrifice that seems in vain, even as her still sour face gets an unintentional powdered sugar grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Do you really all hate each other that much?</b>\" Exasperated, yet slightly remorseful, Claire continues. \"I honestly don't mind my distant cousins as they either are too afraid of upsetting that fascist of a parent by being near an unsolicited crumb without instantly losing their oh so important figures, or are precious darlings that want to be friends, but get ripped away in fear of a few cookies.\" Your interest is peaked at the idea of meeting them one day, you attempt to pry about the one she seems most favorable of. \"<b>I take it Zenobia was the friendly one?</b>\" \"Zenny and I still keep in contact\" the Masters faintly beams \"she tells me sometimes she has to change server IDs to keep SF's regulations police from hitting her with a wasted time violation, but she hasn't changed much except threatening to steal you away if she ever visits.\" \"<b>Is there no one who you don't set up to go after me</b>\" you joke, trying to lift the mood and thankfully she starts to jiggle - er, giggle again. \"Well I wouldn't dream of her missing the wedding, but its your own darn fault for being so -urp- handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenobia sounds like a nice Plan B if the Headmistress denies out of principle because she really does absolutely despise this Sonia Flounders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you really involve them, CJ\" Claire asks between bites of figgy pudding. You notice that almost all of her doggy banquet had disappeared into her before you even had a chance to feed it to her, \"<b>Weren't you going to involve me in your gluttony or having trouble holding what you already ate in?</b>\" The hiccup queen merely pats her upper belly fold, \"a growing girl must eat when she can, CJ.\" \"<b>I doubt you will be getting up from wherever they drop you off tonight.</b>\" You prod her belly button with a full index and middle finger and she squeals with delight. \"As long as you're there, I don't care if they roll me out into Mother's personal garden and we sleep under the stars - I have the padding to keep us warm.\" Claire tussles your hair, enjoying the short moments she had left of being taller than you from the cramped comfort of her throne. \"But I'll give you as many opportunities to help me eat as I can as a reward for being so much more amusing than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the Princess's room, you notice her section of the estate was made with the idea that a growing whale of wales wanted to gorge herself huge. \"<b>Its like a house within a house</b> you let your voice echo to a similar open air glass roofing from the main, lobby illuminating the wide bed Claire Masters used to sleep. You felt the vibrations of Claire's landing and being helped to her feet \"W-welcome to my room\" she bashfully stated while relying on the maids to help keep her standing straight, \"you're the only boy I've let in here.\" \"<b>And what will they say of this</b>\" you jeer as you put a hefty flank over your shoulder and help her wobble to the bed. \"O-oh CJ\" she flusters as she notices how much strain her weight is putting on you trying to move even this far. \"I don't want you to h-hurt yourself being a gentleman like this. It's what the help is for!\"\"<b>Don't count on it,</b>\" you wheeze, \"<b>this is part of the reason why I want to get strong. Besides, how else am I going to carry you to our bed if we get hitched?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can already feel her poor heart go into overdrive as Claire's luscious curves rise and fall in your grasp. \"But\" she fights the idea that you could make her kinks weirder \"think of how time you'd have to waste just pumping iron or whatever those muscle lovers do. Wouldn't it get tedious instead of just lounging around and eating with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>And if I eventually get bored and let myself go, all that muscle becomes a ton of fat and you win anyway.</b>\" Its obvious this bomb hits her right in her dirty little pleasures because the Princess is frustrated in how she can't fight against either scenario. \"Damn you and your sexy logic, CJ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire makes a jovial \"timber\" as you tip her over, she falls and impacts the bed hard enough to quiver out a large BURP that almost drowned out the creaks said furniture made over this abuse. You enjoy the show of her overstuffed body shaking itself back into a calm. Noticing some specialty cocoa butter and moisturizers, you decide to lather the heiress up as you defuse her obese mountain of a belly. She tries to negotiate out a simple \"Try to be a little gentle at the start\", but you interrupt her with a premature squirt of lavender creme from her lower belly up to the smaller hinterfolds around her left breast. If she already cries out in ecstasy even from that, Claire was a sensitive girl that needed a tender touch if you wanted to keep this from getting lewd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making waves, up and down, from her hips to her chest; you follow the healed remains of stretch marks all across the top of her shivering belly peak, down her love handles and further out to almost every extra inch she gained. The Princess' reactions grew louder and more descriptive as you worked your way into covering every corner of her increasing beauty with an even coating. First only calling your name to beseeching any other otherworldly force that struck her synapses, Claire moved on to holding onto you and kissing your potbelly that she loved so much to moving on to your lips. \"I'm - urp - glad you ate a little more with me\", Claire moaned as she licked the sweat rolling down your torso, \"I want more of you! Enough to cover the world in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a sense of dread hits you as you notice the clock next to her night stand. <b>I twas almost midnight, curfew bell was about to ring</b>. You only had one chance to stay in control and this was as good as time as any to test if ear buds could block them out.</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With one slippery hand you somehow turn on your phone, rush to your song list, crank up the volume and slap down random in the hopes that music would shield you from that troublesome bell. You successfully put both earplugs in just in time; however, Claire angrily drags you back down into her ravenous expanse for daring to ease up. You manage to only make out \u201cI DIDN\u2019T GIVE YOU PERMISION TO STOP\u201d before your salvation begins to play. The irony of fate\u2019s clich\u00e9d selection wasn\u2019t lost on you as you cackle wildly to Queen\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Me Now building up in your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, you both were having a good time as every ounce of the young mistress\u2019 corpulence came alive with your kneading caress. Everything else, even your current mission, swiftly lost importance as her pleading eyes, hungry for more, inverted your personal control. You were losing yourself in her ecstasy and <b>you didn\u2019t care</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Don\u2019t stop me now, Time.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the clock as little hands met at 12. Slowing down, you were actually scared you miscalculated this gamble. The tremors from the school bell several miles away still shook through your petrified gape noticeably enough to feel their particular vibrations in her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you remained at the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again picked up steam, knowing that you were disappointing Claire losing momentum for no good reason. Shifting both trunk-like thighs as straight as her cuddly lard could jiggle itself into position, without the Princess wrapping them around your neck to push your in; you roll clumps of cocoa butter around her skin, from the slimmest to thickest part of her lazy fat legs. Her head cocks to the left as the rubbing descends further, taking your time lathering her hidden knee smuggled in folds and practically hugging her juicy flanks to make sure nothing escaped becoming moist. You cheekily lick, from the quivering overlap of flesh disputed between where her massive thighs end, up to her calf, just to set Claire off. Even you can hear the roaring scream of \u201cOh Please, Yes!\u201d from the chorus of Freddie Mercury. Tasted like white chocolate and peaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of booty, it wouldn\u2019t do to skip out this leg day without applying a healthy coating to her rump. You attempted to ask if she wanted you to explore her bottom, but she made no discernible attempt to communicate anything but give you eager looks and the body language of DO IT YOU NERD. So first, you prodded your fingertips around the already strained fabric of her size 53 panties to feel the kind of butt a Masters can craft sitting down and eating like a senseless hog all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an immaculate Gluteus Maximus that was not too long or too wide to shift out of the shape of a giant heart symbol, and Claire made sure to wiggle it around all over your hands to feel the true heft of her hips.  You playfully honk both of her lower spheres as you prop her pelvis against your stomach so you can have easy access to her back, while letting your wave evolve into a raunchier soft thrust against the bed without going too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>God knows both of you probably want to break free to The Act, but no. No way.  No stated and clear consent from the start, and every step of the way, till the very end? Not happening. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Claire.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rub down that was going to accelerate her jiggling folds like a wild, yet stationary heifer grew from creaks and squeals from both Claire and the Masters custom mattress as you tested how much the latter could take of your collective weight. Her fatness at first wasn\u2019t sure what kind of strange physics you were attempting to apply, but after you retreated back to her legs, and moved onto grabbing the side folds of her waist like reigns; Claire stood on her arms as best as she could and push a sideways cowgirl in sync with your own lurid movements. As you both picked up speed and ferocity, the more the bed shuttered and tore, back and forth, into once clean marble tiles of Claire\u2019s room. Your pace, your actions, your sensitivity, even your own moaning was matching hers as your hands could barely hold onto the flabby Newton\u2019s Cradle you turned her into. It didn\u2019t help that poor piece of furniture that Lemmy Kilmister of Mot\u00f6rhead was growling out Overkill in your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you were launched into her stuffed, warm mass after it finally gave up and broke underneath you two. Her welcoming safety cushion of a body jostled from the impact and tickled her fancy as Claire gently removed your earbuds, nibbled on your lobe and then quietly whispered \u201cmy turn\u201d as she giggled while rolling on top of you. Her pressure ebbed and flowed from both of your lungs as much as the dominating bulk she held you under. You only had just enough room to inhale when she exhaled, only for her belly to drop back down and shove into your doughy frame when she felt like taking your breath away. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have some extra plush to press back with?\u201d her tone was sweet, yet challenging. \u201cNo need to do anything but stay with me and be two hungry piggies together\u201d, she arched her back, squeezing you further against the ground and her sloshing middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer now unruly blond hair, run ragged by your actions and partially stained by her ceaseless consumption, turned white under the haunting glow of the moon. What little you could see, between desperately fighting for air and being lulled to sleep by the metronomic march of Claire Master\u2019s expanding adipose, was eclipsed by the mistress\u2019 vast shadow overlying you. A pressurized lock hissed as it released and obedient black and white hands assembled equipment that she wouldn\u2019t let you see. The porcine cat rubbed and gyrated her hips, twisting and turning the obese knife as it cut into you. Both Heaven and Hell were extensions of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this moment, you were Claire\u2019s plaything and prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut instead, you wish to sweat and toil for fleeting muscles.\u201d A Cheshire's stare pierced you with an all too familiar urge to give into passion, her wild face a reflection of yourself as much as her endless lust for plumping both of you up. In some ways, you two lunatics really were made for each other. \u201cWell, come on, strong man\u201d the mistress mocked as she slapped her girth just to hear you gasp, \u201cI thought you were the powerful CJ!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you shove back against the unrelenting force of Claire Masters\u2019 intemperance. Her eyes flushed and her burps returned as she enjoyed the feel of your struggle across the Princess\u2019s bloated extent. \u201cRegretting fe -urp- ding me now, CJ?\u201d You\u2019re too focused on getting her off you more than witty banter at this point, even if you try to smirk back. \u201dBecause if a weakling like you can\u2019t move me we\u2013hic\u2014ll\u201c, she motioned her maids to corner you two, \u201cwhat\u2019s to stop me from just fattening you here and now to help pry yourself out?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>This wasn't going to end until she's stuffed you beyond the capacity to walk, much less leave whatever pampered prison Claire would keep you in. Tonight, or in some random encounters with you or nimrod, Claire Masters was never going to stop pushing this fatty fate onto you.

The first part of this Gordian Gut was shifting your legs out from under a tyrannous use of gravity. She\u2019d positioned herself belly to belly on you, pressing down all over your anatomy in a strategically simple way, and yes, for certain parts this was particularly effective at getting the blood pumping. She titters as more of you squirms and snakes around her grumbling middle, glad you were going to play as much as hoping you\u2019d give in. \u201cCome on, big boy\u201d the princess teased as chubby fingers pushed your cheeks together to form a ugly duck face \u201cyou only have maybe \u2013opfh \u2013 excuse me, 5 minutes before my little surprise is ready to make you an even bigger boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnants of the mattress springs were your surrogate voice as Claire dug in deeper with her gut, lowering her chest down to dangerously dangle a barely held in set of breasts right in front of your eyes, as they slowly rubbed up against you merely from her breathing. Even without the current use of your hands, it wouldn\u2019t take much to pop that top.  A simple shift of your face or even a slight jiggle from the Porcine Princess and her overripe melons would reveal what little wasn\u2019t already obvious to you as inquiring pink areolas peeked across the shrinking border of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire enjoyed toying with your gaze as you secretly squeezed your legs into position thanks to the opening her forward tip gave you. \u201cI don\u2019t like sharing you, CJ\u201d, finally bearing her fangs, you could sense the anger she saved for the parts of your social life that didn\u2019t include her. \u201cNot with Mother, those scrawny little fools I use as pawns\u201d, she venomously spat through gritted teeth at the mere visualization of Rebecca, \u201cand especially those low-born harlots you consider friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mistress\u2019 chubby arms reached as far as they could over the spilling folds of her inflated stomach to try and wrap you into her body as best as she could. \u201cAnd when this new CJ bubbles out, starts making all the moves I\u2019ve waited for MY Man to show me,\u201d she huffed in a manner Pillsbury would have already melted into pure obedience to appease, but you were slightly enraptured by. \u201cThis other CJ, who I admit I like just as much, maybe even more than the original flavor, SHOWERS HIS AFFECTION ON THE WRONG WOMAN I JUST \u2013\u201c  Claire crushed with her weight and her words as the bloated vice came down around your chest and you couldn\u2019t help but somehow enjoy being the meat of a flab sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrathful tears trickled down her folds, but some managed to drip onto your face. \u201cCJ Dalton, you have no idea how barmy I am for you.\u201d <b>No shit?</b> You could think, but had no intention to mouth out while Claire distracted herself in ranting. \u201cIf I have to take a forceful approach, here and now, to make sure you stay mine\u201d, threatening while sniffling, she looked conflicted as a pair of mouth harnesses joined by a shared industrial tube descended, \u201cknow that I will never hurt you out of anger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly reassuring bedside manner, especially as she delicately tucked the harness meant for your mouth between her breasts and upper belly. \u201cI was going to save this for something more special, but I just can\u2019t help wanting to spoil you even with an early surprise gift!\u201d Her Heftiness licked her lips as her hose end barely managed to wrap onto her face. Whatever dessert she was going to pump down your throat, she was eager to swallow it down with you. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, darling. I won\u2019t let my boy pop \u2013 just maybe get too full to leave my room without assistance.\u201d She yearned to make you helpless. If you\u2019re going to do something, you better make your move before either of you becomes too big to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your knees created a wedge as they curled back to allow your feet to free your arms. When Claire finally caught onto your plan, she somehow both moaned and uncontrollably laughed from the extra tactile contact. \u201cH-hey\u201d, she gasped, \u201cT-that\u2019s not \u2013 oh my.\u201c Her hose fogged up between panting and attempting words as you mostly accidentally brushed around the underflap of rolls by the end of her stomach and what they could easily obscure around her hips as they traveling upwards. However, you are completely guilty of attempting to grab her porcelain belly, poking and rubbing around a deep bellybutton with your toes, before setting up your footing around her center. The Mistress\u2019 composure stumbled back with a belch, yet Claire didn\u2019t have the focus to pull through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ, it\u2019ll be al-herk-ight\u201d, fearing that she was moments away from choking; you needed to make this surgically precise. \u201c<b>This is my safeword, Claire</b>\u201d, you wheeze back with fresh oxygen while pushing with all your might, \u201c<b>GET OFF!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all your wimpy arms and legs, you manage to roll back princess onto her back and snap the tube off her cheeks before collapsing in exhaustion. If she had the intent to try again, you were completely defenseless to pull this miracle off a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she only cradled you with her limbs. \u201cI took this too far, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She quivered as you slowly confirmed between heavy breaths. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I tend to lose myself to passion every now and again.\u201d Still unable to fully raise your head, you unintentionally make her giggle as you speak through her belly fat, \u201c<b>You\u2019re not the only one, sister.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said\u201d, she proudly beamed as she stroked your hair, \u201ctwo of a kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey \u2013 CJ\u201d, her plump smile lowers into a serious sulk, \u201cor whatever I call <b>you</b>.\u201d You give the heiress your undivided attention as she tries to find the words to talk to another Dalton. \u201cDid you mean what you said, y\u2019know\u201d she strains trying to finish the thought. \u201c<b>About loving Kate?</b>\u201d Claire nervously nods as she you pulls you in tighter, scared for the worst. \u201c<b>I do love Kate Granden. Platonically as friend I want to protect and aid whenever she wants my help. And as a woman I wouldn\u2019t mind growing old with.</b>\u201d She looked too devastated by that statement to even cry, however, you, thankfully, can give her a truthful hope. \u201c<b>But the game is still in play, Princess.</b>  She immediately lights up, \u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d \u201c<b>You can\u2019t change the past I\u2019ve had with Rebecca or Kate. The time they\u2019ve shared with me is always going to be there. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t manipulate the future to win the war.</b>\u201d A devious little grin returns to her face at the use of those particular words, but it feels good to open up to Claire as your own identity and make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may regret being this honest with me, stranger.\u201d  She pulls you in with bedroom eyes you couldn\u2019t tear yourself away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as an intercom rang out, a coy Mrs. Masters summoned you to her room. \"Would a Mister Dalton please come see me in my office? I would hate having to give him a curfew violation -- unless it was a certain extracurricular activity under the supervision of one of his instructors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw\", Claire put on the cutest pout, \"over already? I was even going to ask if you wanted stay the night. And to go all the way.\" Dreading that neither of you were ready for that just yet, you nudge her chubby cheek with your own to distract her from that kind of serious step. \"<b>Sorry, babe. Not on the first date.</b> She sticks out her tongue jokingly giving a raspberry before embracing you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, fine. I\u2019ll just be here, all alone, with my bedtime snacks, thinking of you, while Mother steals you away from me.\u201d Crazy Girl isn\u2019t as convincing with her sarcasm as she usually is, but once she can walk again, Princess is going to be fatter and hungrier for you or doofus come the morning. \u201cSam, Christine and Margie\u201d, three distinct maids immediately bowed in front of the two of you, \u201cPlease escort <i>Mister Dalton</i> to wherever Mother\u2019s wedged herself into for the night.\u201d And before you even realize they\u2019ve stood you on your feet, they all say \u201cYes, Miss Claire\u201d in perfect harmony as they walk you towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>They have names? And can talk?! Will wonders never cease?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, stranger, you still want to seek out this muscle-bound madness?\u201d Barely able to see Claire\u2019s messy curls, much less her stuffed face over her gurgling middle, you answer back \u201c<b>You better believe it.</b>\u201d She hiccups while wagging a finger to dark corner around a full scale kitchen and clothing department of a wardrobe behind her, \u201cSam, please give him some of my vintage little Empresses as a present for Mother.\u201d The ebony apple waddles over to a high security door where you can only imagine the majesty of fat girls diving into bank vaults of candies like obese Scrooge McDucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You have a literal chocolate vault in your room?</b> Claire snorts with laughter and you can already hear the gears in her head spin, \"Well, it cannot compare to Mother's or the shared Family Larder, but I must remember to give you a tour of them all next time.\" But that obvious trap was not going to be sprung tonight as Sam waddled back with a weapons crate full of high calorie sugar bombs. You can't decipher the German lettering, but you can notice the weird little fairy tale round boy and girl of their logo. \"Hans&amp;Gretta. Mother and I adore their products almost as much as you. If you simply must seek out this lunacy, I'll just have to help you as best as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even say thanks she blows a kiss as the maids finally shift you out of the room and down the corridor. \"Ciao, Love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Well, here we go. Off to the Lair of Masters Matriarch. What else could go wrong?</b>  </span></div></div>",

But it wasn\u2019t as creepy as it could have been with your present company, and since you were alone with them, well, what\u2019s the harm in a little momentary socializing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>So when\u2019s Dracula going to pop out and tell me I\u2019m nothing but a miserable pile of lard?</b>\u201d You attempt to break the ice, but no one but Sam and seems to get the reference even as the other two follow her lead in smirking \u2013 or at least, reacting. \u201cMaster CJ\u201d, sighed the bi-speckled red haired pear as she adjusted her glasses, \u201cThere are no such things as Vampires.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t sass your potential future employer and current guest of the house, Margaret.\u201d Margie\u2019s blunt bob cut turned with her sharp glare at the tanned Platinum blond hourglass, \u201cAnd even if there was some creepy crawly around, we\u2019d protect ya from it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead gently lets you down to walk over and set off an argument with who you can only assume is Christine. \u201cOh so he doesn\u2019t want realistic reassurance, but is eager for emasculation and belittlement?\u201d No sooner does the taller blond set you down to return the sentiment; do you finally notice Sam awkwardly try to pacify the situation. \u201cGirls - could both of you please not make a scene in front of Master CJ of all people\u201d, she somehow meekly says, while swinging what sounds like over fifty pounds chocolates on its side with a mighty thud that sends a pleasant ripple around her ample upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Woah</b>\u201d, both impressed at the sudden burst of personality, but not wanting to set off conflicts you have no idea about, you try to deflect any oncoming strife. \u201c<b>It was just a dumb joke, no one did anything wrong.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Red headed maid groaned loudly as her face fell into her palm, \u201cWonderful, not even five minutes and we\u2019ve already screwed up.\u201d \u201cNice Job while it lasted\u201d, Christine apathetically teased as she shrugged her taught shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly grow concerned over messing with their livelihood as you don\u2019t have the faintest understanding in how the Masters handle their servants, much less the norms of the occupation in general, other than apparently letting them fatten up to fit the family\u2019s aesthetics if nothing else.\u201c<b>No, I\u2019m serious, don\u2019t worry about it!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Sam seems to get down on herself over nothing. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Master.\u201d Her delicate fingers wiped out teary eyed confession that you couldn\u2019t believe they were making out of this, \u201cAll I wanted was please you and I failed.\u201d Are Claire and Jessica really this harsh to these women that they\u2019ll fire them over stupid trivialities like this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Look, I won\u2019t say anything to them</b>\u201d, you\u2019re starting to actually echo out in the halls, \u201c<b>they start talking anything about severance pay or kicking you out \u2013 you can shack up in my apartment until you get back on your feet.</b>\u201d Hopefully this was out of earshot of Claire or else you were not sure how many large women even your spacious abode could handle without the floor giving way because everyone else would want in on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all simultaneously gasped a little too perfectly for you to believe this was natural, but you didn\u2019t want to take it back if any of what they insinuated was true. \u201cYou really mean it?!\u201d Sam tugged on your arm with a puppy dog love in her face. You try to respond, but are cut off from Christine dipping over to plant a quick kiss on your lips. \u201cOh you won\u2019t even know we\u2019re there -- unless ya want us to do something extra special\u201d, not missing a beat, she draws a heart in your little chubby tummy \u201cjust for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Wait, was this just to get me to let you all stay at my place?</b>\u201d  There was a varying menagerie of devious faces, from Sam\u2019s more innocent fat girl caught in the cookie jar, Christine\u2019s smug nonchalance to Margaret\u2019s wicked grin. \u201cWe have a recorded confirmation of your agreement\u201d; the glare from her glasses partially hid her legitimately terrifying sneer, \u201cWe could use this in a variety of painful ways if you suddenly feel the need to go back on your word.\u201d More confused than upset, you can\u2019t help but blurt out \u201c<b>You could have just asked?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that\u201d they all replied before laughing hopefully not at you. \u201cWe saw your little drama with Miss Claire\u201d the blond cooed as the ebony brunette finished, \u201cwhere\u2019s our heart-wrenching romance and advanced cuddling, Master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely stumble out a \u201c<b>I just met you three</b>\u201d as you wonder if you were too quick to call Princess crazy. They quickly corner and grab you, carrying you off to a gilded elevator. \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse to deny us our right to serve you!\u201d As you climbed up, you didn\u2019t mind being trapped in a four-way risqu\u00e9 hug between the three weird maids prodding and rubbing up against you, although you almost pitied the wake up nimrod will likely face with them suddenly showing up. \u201c<b>I am surrounded by beautiful lunatics.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached your destination it was beginning to look more like some fat obsessed secret society than just an eccentric rich woman\u2019s obese paradise. The architecture took on a much more antediluvian, yet disturbingly familiar twist on the prominent display of indulgence that greeted you at the entrance. In the dim dancing light, the statues almost looked like they writhed in pain and joyful ecstasy as if they were alive, but that couldn\u2019t be possible. Your hands stroked the surface of the walls and the effigies, and other than having a texture that didn\u2019t exactly feel like any stone you\u2019ve ever touched, they should be just regular carved figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Mistress has a love for artifacts, particularly pertaining to old or forgotten times.\u201d You followed Margie as she soaked in an ancient splendor of little mixtures of apparently everything remotely proto-celtic, like possibly Hallstatt gold jewelry to strange Urnfield - well - ash urns, to something even your late night history surfing with Mom and Kate couldn't even remotely identify. And yet they all shared a very obvious and much less so connection in them all. Round caricatures of people, but with what looked like a strange woman that the round people either worshiped or were maybe even sacrificed to?! You definitely needed a plan of attack here depending on whatever nonsense she likely has stuffed to the brim in more ways than one here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hey girls, you really want to please me?</b>\" The maids eagerly surround you again, willing for a command \"Ooo! Master's first order!\" Sam kept slightly shaking the ground jumping up and down asking \"what is it\" until you grab her by her plump arms, which only seems to make her more giddy even if stationary. \"<b>We're going to play a game with Mrs Masters - but I'm going to need you to do exactly what I say when the time comes.\"</b> While they seem interested in what sounds mischievous, Sam seems to want to get in on the joke ahead of time \"Do what, Master?\" You put a finger to her lips and make a quick shush noise, \"<b>That would ruin the surprise. But can I trust you to play along when I need you three?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded in agreement and you all casually entered the Master Study with puppy slightly trailing behind with the crate. Between the bookshelves modeled after bellies, tasteful purple and black velvet drapes curving around paintings and walls, extra reinforced black leather lounge chairs and other furniture that could probably seat you and both Mistresses of the house; and, of course, the dulcet sounds of Mrs. Masters gorging herself behind a desk as she waits for you. Almost everything you were expecting was here except for the oddly attractive centerpiece of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk across the dark marble floor to the center, Jessica gives off an impressive belch as a greeting. \"A-burp-out time you arrived, my boy. I was beginning to wonder if you actually took up my little girl's offer.\" She projected herself well for a woman facing a wall of monitors instead of looking at you, \"<b>Spying on us the whole time, Ma'am? Did you at least enjoy the show?</b>\" Her deep chuckle made the flesh clinging to the confines of her chair quake, \"Not much escapes my attention when it comes to you two, darling\", she teasingly played with a large cup of wine in one obese hand before taking another <i>sip</i>. \"Your technique is still very sloppy\", her saccharine voice purrs in your ear even from this far away, \"but I will take great satisfaction in personally training you, every step of the way, onto being the perfect man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally turned to face you, she cunningly smiled at your reaction to her new outfit. \"Oh - do you like my lounge wear, love?\" She didn't get out of the chair, but one creaking shift of her massive legs to cross her vast thigh only excited you more as who knows how much purple cashmere barely contained her body's bounty in the form of a simple toga, both revealed the contours of her shape yet technically concealed them. The Matriarch's thick blond curls cascaded around her round shoulders and triple chin bulged by breath or another treat from greedy fingers, \"What's the matter precious? Where's your witty remark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I'm sorry ma'am</b>\", you honestly reply as you take a bow, \"<b>I can't think of a word that could do your radiance justice.</b>\" She politely giggled with another inhale of wine, \"Not the worst save. But I'd try something a little more eloquent like <b>there is no word in any language to describe your beauty</b> next time I captivate you.\" Before you can even finish a sigh, Jessica impishly continues \"Oh don't worry about being unprepared for me, darling. The willingness to learn is the important part.\" And then she gives you a more powerful come hither look \"Well, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?\"</span></div></div>",

As you caresses the wide dip of the church bell of a belly, circling the curvature of the breasts, and follow all the way up to the eyes, Mrs. Masters made judgmental, yet appeased murmurs at your choice selection of points of the figure\u2019s body. \u201cDirty buggar\u201d, your spine tingled at another agonized groan from the chair she tortured under her glutted blob of a body, \u201cyou\u2019d rather play with rocks than your lonely Mommy Dearest?\u201d You gazed upwards to the angled articulate face of the idol and some part of you needed to know <b>\"What is this?\"</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, a fellow lover of history\u201d the Matriarch prods and you can feel the predatory leer she pierces you with, hungry for more details. \u201cA prize piece of our family\u2019s collection and one of my personal treasures \u2013\u201cJessica must be lurching forward, as now there\u2019s another set of creaking coming from maybe the table or even the floor as she shifts into all sorts of positions your imagination could picture \u201c\u2014and it just makes my heart soar watching my crown jewel get so interested in it.\u201d Finally turning your head back, you can\u2019t help but enjoy the feline stare the fattened tigress gave you, leaning her puffy elbows on the black mahogany table and holding her head, or rather neck folds. She had every intention to toy with her food whether it was another morsel she snuck into her bottomless stomach or whatever she finally decided to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ma\u2019am, please.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bubbled out a smooth laughter at your naked insistence, \u201cSo eager to learn. How can I resist when my favorite pupil asks so nicely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, there is tasty bit of cultural flavor in our wonderful corner of the world.\u201d She savors the last \u00e9clair by slowly draining the cr\u00e8me only with her mouth, steadily sucking it all down, until finally deflated Jessica swallows the rest and winks at you. \u201cHave you ever heard of M\u00e1thair Neart?\u201d Not even waiting for you to finish raising your brow, she grabs a hand full of caramel bon-bons and begins to spread them out in a circle. \u201cMother of Plenty, or if you\u2019re a direct translational literalist between what has been found and the remaining inferred theories\u201d, she stops naturally to only eat the rest of the set that aren\u2019t on the table without a hint of shame, \u201cMother of Power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop yourself from going full Solid Snake and repeating the headmistress out loud or else you\u2019d be here till period bells start to ring, however, you could easily see the name in the idol as she mixed invitingly soft excess with cold stern angles and points from her commanding face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"And what\u2019s so special about her?\"</b> Mrs. Masters wags her finger as she tut-tuts your interruption, \u201cLet me get to that, young man. Good history and legend are like good gossip.\u201d Finally running her goblet dry, Jessica simply sets it down and bluntly polishes off the rest of the bottle until all the medicine goes down and she rumbles out a lush\u2019s burp. She doesn\u2019t betray any potential weakness even as she looks at you noticing her rising blush, \u201cYou have to let me get to the juicy part before you develop it further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong ago, in a time possibly before or around the age of the Druids, before the invasions of maybe even The Celts, The Romans, The Gaels, The Saxons, The Normans and Danes. There are traces of a people history has forgotten - buried deep within the earth or scatted and assimilated across the cultures of the isles. Many names have been born from many scholars, political propagandists, pagan spiritual appropriators or humble curious minds; all attempting to piece together fractured splinters so small they haven\u2019t the faintest idea what goes to where. However, there is one complete link they all tie to, one fierce and indomitable figure that shapes the myths and true history around her rubenesque physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"M\u00e1thair Neart\"</b>, you assume as you advance towards the Matriarch. \u201cGold Star Lunch for my sharp little Cherub\u201d praised the Queen as she dug her fingers into her belly, \u201cespecially since you were naughty enough to skip what should be mandatory seconds.\u201d She didn\u2019t hide her lascivious ogle taking in the small ripples of your bare torso jiggling as you moved, \u201c<b>Is she a Goddess or some sort of hero?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA temptress, a jilted lover, a force of nature, a gentle protector and provider \u2013 but the specific Lethargis one is the most interesting of all.\u201d  When you finally reach her desk, her flabby arm stretches out to stroke your chin, \u201csomething about a chosen son if I remember right.\u201d You don\u2019t like that insinuation at all; however, Jessica swiftly starts the ball rolling again. \u201cBut Mommy knows that\u2019s not why her sweetness is here right now.\u201d One chocolate stained finger slides across your lips before it travels down your chest, where her right palm rubs against your small gut, whilst the left <i>accidentally</i> undoes one of the gold rings pinning her toga together to rub her gurgling middle. \u201cBe a good boy and come out with it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"If you\u2019ve seen it all, what\u2019s the point in ask-\"</b>, you were cut off as something sweet went down your throat on Jessica\u2019s forceful insistence.  You tried to ignore how good it tasted so you could focus on blocking any further sneaky moves from Mrs. Masters, but she only just gave you another hungry chuckle, \u201cMen who don\u2019t go after what they want in life don\u2019t get it, dearest.\u201d <b>\u201cVery well, I want access to Silverfish equipment and training. I need you to play nice with Sonia Flounders.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, the frisky veils of Matriarch left for a serious grimace at that woman\u2019s name, \u201cYou have no idea what sort of devil you\u2019re wishing to deal with, precious. You may not believe it, but I love you more than like my own flesh and blood.\u201d Jessica\u2019s unnatural physical prowess exploded to the surface as squishy fists rose and slammed into the table, leaving round cracked imprints into the hardwood without the slightest hint of pain on her face. \u201cLetting you anywhere near that self-absorbed, muscle obsessed, lord chasing Slag Bitch is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and the maids just stare with a frightened gape as the Wide Queen takes a moment to realize what she\u2019d just done and then surprise you even further with a short apologetic panic. \u201cO-oh, silly me, m-mommy\u2019s gotten so plump, the poor table couldn\u2019t even take a little tap from a harmless butterball like me! W-what a wild lark Jessica Masters has played on herself by eating like a senseless adorable hog, right lovelies?\u201d The Mistress instinctively tries to get up and laugh. Unfortunately for her, however, she really has crammed her bloated ass and distended gut between the chair and the desk and you're treated to the rarest sight of all -- a defenseless piggy monarch shaking every inch of sublime lard all over her mass without trying to ask for aid. <b>That was just a tap to her?! Still, the fact that she can\u2019t get out of there is just the sort of angle you could use.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ma'am\"</b>, you reach out and grab warm handfuls of Jessica's belly to get her attention, <b>\"Is something wrong?\"</b> Mrs. Masters' composure still isn't fully there, yet she seems to give you a different kind of longing burble as you clutch down harder on as much as you could hold, advancing closer into her titillated fog of excited breaths. Your rough mixing and probing of her body goes deeper as you are egged on by louder moans praising more forceful dives, only slowing down when you unthinkingly go for an area that would only unleash your basest urges. Yet, even if you try to not reach for nerve clusters, or even brush against the most tender part of her breasts, butt or thighs, Jessica guides your hands back to those lewd locations and makes sure you can feel exactly what only a soft layer of wool stands between you and aroused massive woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she actually want you like this? Everything, even the kiss in her car, Mrs. Masters eventually claimed all were some elaborate 9th dimensional chess played with your raging hormones for her amusement or part of a grander scheme you always discovered after the fact. And yet there was always some trace of plausible sensuality behind her actions that felt too genuine to be completely faked. And the Mistress always wanted your inner carnivore to come out by always tempting you harder with her own predatory impulses. What reason could this whole year of seduction be about if she didn't at least feel for you like you do for her right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, something always comes between you and headway into that mystery when the angry heels of Abida Idhar kick the door open and for her to scream wrathful words in some unknown, yet pretty language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's commanding presence immediately returned as she swiftly loosened your grasp and made it look like she was leading the dirty dance instead of you. The anger that she had Sonia roared out again as her thick curves sheltered you from Idhar's gaze, \"What right do you think you have to interrupt my desire?!\" Abida's usually emotionless face went from a confused fury to a wounded retreat in a servant's bow as her thick face framing black bangs slid to hide the tears welling in her dark eyes. \"Hazrat -- I\", you've never heard the desert rose speak much of anything, let alone enough to notice how light and birdsong like her natural soprano sounded. However, Mrs. Masters wasn't going to have any excuse. \"My -- precious boy was about to make a significant breakthrough. And your useless feelings not only shattered that wonderful moment, but could have jeopardized everything! You will stay there and wait until I am done with CJ before I give you the punishment you deserve for this impudence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Masters.\" <b>Idhar complicates things, but this is likely the ideal time to make your move - if the maids can be trusted to play their part.</b> </span></div></div>",

Is this really what a guy has to go through to secure an exercise machine for a girl? Rebecca seems so far and away now, but your promise still burns in your brain to finish this, if only to see her hopefully pleased face when you give her the good stuff.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t sure whether Mrs. Masters is still in whatever foul mood that fended off Idhar, so you decide to force back more amours attitude while working your way out of her embrace. It is amazing her expensive looking executive chair hasn\u2019t broken its top, let alone cracked in half, with how far back Jessica has been leaning to give you access to as much of her figure in, around and partially under the desk as you could reach. However, your exit needed to be gentle and on her omission if you were to have the time to get the maids to somehow incapacitate Abida so she doesn\u2019t ruin this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you merely nibbled and blew on her neck folds, still having a little height over the Matriarch while you were practically laying on her and the table. The Queen\u2019s sneer cracked with snickering as her mass started to quiver to your actions, \u201cWhat \u2013hng\u2014are you doing \u2013fff-angle?\u201d Jessica\u2019s giggling only grew as your fingers also started wriggle and tickle across her gigantic sides, even if some nervous sweat broke out at the thought of the Headmistress\u2019s mighty strength accidentally giving you a head injury or something worse. \u201cP-precious ple-ase a-haha-\u201d was all she could get out before her jelly like expanse quaked around you and her arms tried several times to grab hold of you before her wild swings hit something. As she effortlessly lifted you into the air with her hands, her smile thankfully never left her cheeks while she inflated her already bloated frame to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, *huff* you saucy little devil\u201d, her teasing was nowhere near as threatening as with Abida, but she did furrow her brow with a wide Cheshire grin, \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you. Mommy doesn\u2019t want to harm her sweet boy when she can\u2019t move like she should under better conditions.\u201d Setting you down to her right, you made sure to at least not make this look intentional to the desert rose, <b>\u201cBut you are so much more beautiful happy than angry, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the secretary\u2019s vicious gaze follow your movements as you walked around her side of the table, but you needed to get closer to the maids and your <i>weapon</i>. \u201cTouching as that sentiment is, I believe we needed to finish our conversation from earlier, young man.\u201d Back to business at the drop of a hat, Mrs. Masters soon lays down her point. \u201cI will purchase whatever you want darling, but I will not involve you with that horrid woman or her military school under any means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give one last chance to some sort of emotional pull before you play dirty, <b>\u201cBut Ma\u2019am, Claire told me about her cousins. Surely asking Zenobia or her sisters for help couldn\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</b> Jessica actually let\u2019s out a soft sigh at the thought of her little nieces, \u201cWell \u2013 yes, they are all good girls, even if they have all been partially influenced by a bad mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever\u201d, a stern look crossed back directly to you, \u201cinvolving them would soon bring about that woman, some way or another, and I cannot allow her to corrupt you. You will meet them one day, but it cannot be for this, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, diplomacy has failed, so it\u2019s time for exaction. <b>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I was really hoping you could make everything better, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</b> You sulk back to the idol as Mrs. Masters either believes you or plays along to see where this is going, \u201cOh baby, don\u2019t cry. Mommy will make it better if you just tell her how.\u201d The three maids seem to be enjoying this latest soap opera you\u2019ve been giving them, yet Margaret and Christine\u2019s instincts seem to comprehend where your punchline could go as they give you enthusiastic looks. Without moving your head, you give a quick eye roll to the right before staring back at them and they both give a small affirmation in their own ways. Returning to character, you continue <b>\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve wasted your time and I apologize for that. But I do remember I was fortunate enough to have a gift for you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little angle actually got me something?!\u201d <b>\u201dOh no, this was mostly Claire\u2019s generosity, I\u2019m just a delivery boy\u201d</b>; you momentarily turn around and notice she\u2019s actually beaming at this, which almost makes you sorry for what you\u2019re about to do. \u201cI don\u2019t see her here now, love. So this is just you spoiling me as far as I can tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and gently ask, <b>\u201cSam, would you please bring the trunk over here?\u201d</b> You couldn\u2019t think of anything more adorable than watching her waddle over as fast as her round thighs could rub together to give you your payload and pop the lock open. \u201cHere you go, Master!\u201d She pleasantly smiles and you sneak her a kiss on her luscious lips just to make the brunette blush, <b>\u201cHow did I live with you?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t even unearth the first one from the protective packaging before you hear the slavering tongue of Jessica Masters audibly salivate several feet behind you, \u201cIS THAT HANS &amp; GRETTA LITTLE EMPRESSES I SMELL?!\u201d You gingerly take one by its wide little tush and hold it up to reveal these things to be over 10 pounds of decadent chocolate, vanilla, mint and who knows how many other flavorings crafted into its cute little dress, shaped like a fat queen the size of your whole hand. And it certainly sounded like Jessica had padded her own adipose layer out by devouring hundreds of these gut bombs as she screamed \u201cGIMMIE\u201d like she was going to die. <b> \"You want it? Come and get it, Ma\u2019am.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Porcine Queen claws at her desk, groans as she tries to slide back and forth from the chair and tries to even lift the table from the floor; however, unfortunately for her, when their carpenters made something Jessica Masters proof, they weren\u2019t fooling around. <b>Don\u2019t you want this?</b> She whimpers out \u201cyes\u201d, but you act as if she didn\u2019t. <b>\"Maybe this one\u2019s bad\u201d</b>, you dryly remark as you turn to pat Sam\u2019s frilly protruding belly, <b>\u201cWould you like to be my Taste Tester?\u201d</b> Puppy twitters as she obediently opens her mouth and gives the Chocoholic Wet Dream a nice solid bite in its lower middle, moaning with her mouthful as its gooey white chocolate filling flows over her rosy face while she quickly goes for another. Jess agonizes as the figure shrinks into Sam\u2019s noticeably growing stomach until she finally packs away what isn\u2019t still around her lips, melted on your fingers or staining her dress. She rubs her tummy as her green eyes beg for more, \u201cOof- That was divine, Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"And you deserve another for being such a good piggy\"</b>, you wink as you pull the next sacrifice out. When Mrs. Masters screams in primal gluttony, Abida attempts to charge after you - only for Christine to casually trip Jessica's Right Hand over and for both maids to pin Idhar down with their heavy posteriors. \"I always thought she'd make a nice cushion\" Margaret mocked as she shifted her thick ass into the position that made the flower painfully swear the most. While this was going on, puppy was already in the middle of her third and the buttons around her apron were popping as she achingly hiccuped \"more\" between occasionally soughed out soft oinks and constant chewing. Sam veraciously licked your hands, but you couldn't fetch for a fourth without giving her some belly rubs to make her feel better. And just when you didn't have enough tasks, the other two bellowed out \"Where's our treats, Master?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Chocolates for everyone except Mrs. Masters I guess\"</b>, you teased as the supply quickly dwindled between now three ravenous black and white sows. The Mistress was still somewhere around denial and pleading as you rushed back and forth fattening one maid to the next. Margie and Chrissy soon gave a pre-stuffed Sam belly a run for its money in size, but their ballooning trunks were nothing compared to a real belly girl's girth, especially when she cheated and got more than they ever did - but, it wouldn't be wise to mention that now. Yet by the amount they were eating, apparently some of it was even starting to digest and be absorbed elsewhere. Legs jiggled and shredded fishnet lace, busts ripened and tore straps, arms stretched and seared poofy shoulder threading, Abida was not having a good time. Until, at last, <b>\"Looks like there's only one empress left, Ma'am.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was devastated, and honestly, you didn't feel right pushing it this far that she was actually crying about chocolates of all things. But one last push could clench this, so you made your way to the secretary. Your expanding servants did an odd number on Abida as she seemed a mixture of silent fury, yet aroused prisoner underneath the bloated maids. You couldn't blame her for liking em big, yet you wondered <b>\"Excuse me, Miss Idhar? You seem to really like Mrs. Masters, so why don't you ever - you know, blimp out for her like she likes seeing from me?\"</b> Abida gave you a look worth a thousand words as she quietly debated with herself, despite slightly hating that the question came from you. <b>\"C'mon\"</b>, you twist the knife as you lower the confection in front of her twitching mouth, <b>\"Try it, maybe you'll actually win her over.</b>\" In an instant, she snaps the strawberry crowned head and gulped it down, only to noiselessly cower as the heavens thundered \"AAAAAAABBIIIIDAAA, I LIKED EATING THE HEADS BEST\" from Jessica's jowled throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE, YOU WIN! You win.\" As she admits defeat you couldn't help but apologize, \"<b>I'm sorry I went this far, Ma'am.\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can make it up to me by giving me the rest of that Empress! I don't care anymore! I'll even let you -\"</span></div></div>",

Bleaugh!\" As much of an Out and Proud Fatty Jessica Masters is, you feel it\u2019s a safe bet that most of her disgust is coming from the idea that she'll have to not only talk to, but come into contact with her most hated distant relative. With her strange superhuman strength and her patronage of the Sumo, Kendo and, at least for a time the Swim clubs, she couldn't be completely opposed to exercise. Especially since, like you pointed out to Claire, there was a far greater satisfaction for people like us to watch all that effort to stay thin and healthy, slowly become defiled by constant eating and sloth until they grow into a fattening Chubbeso inevitability. Okay, you're thinking way too much like them for your own good now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in reality; as you defensively flatten your hand out in front of Jessica, your intuition seemed to be on the money as the Matriarch\u2019s feverish fangs swiftly tore into the confection, chomping down what it could and somehow nearly missing fingers you were sure she could easily bite through if she felt like it. In a hunger only a woman of her size could feel, and denied in the way you inflicted on her, savoring tastes took a back seat. Right now, there was only the maddening impulse to feed, and as soon as the larger remnants of the ball of sugar went down into the lioness\u2019s vast belly, she pulled you in, back over the desk, to lick up any trace or crumb she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelted smears over your hands and arms weren\u2019t enough, Jessica\u2019s soft tongue and lips followed her chocoholic cravings as the Queen lapped up the smudges the maids left in their attempts to hold, toy or just be the messiest eaters they could as you fed them. Whether it was a now hardened kiss mark in the center of your chest or white drips around your paunch that Jessica took a special pleasure in tasting, she was going to have her tickling revenge with the interest of driving your teenaged lust bonkers even while on subconscious auto-piolet. You have to admit, it was a fun ride until she snapped out of it after suddenly becoming inhibited when she unzipped your pants rooting around for possibly sub-atomic chocolate particles. It seems even The Headmistress has trouble with self-control as she looks away while you fix your jeans back up to adequately snug, yet decent, \u201cE-excuse me, precious. Mommy gets a bit grouchy when she\u2019s ignored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear one of Christine\u2019s pained wails sounded almost like a wolf whistle, but you needed to make sure there wasn\u2019t any bad blood between you and Mrs. Masters. <b>\u201cMa\u2019am\u201d</b> you gulp looking at Jessica in possibly her real natural state for once, <b>\u201cI really am sorry if I hurt you.\u201d</b>  The Headmistress shakes her head as she solemnly remarks; \u201cLooks like I was wrong about you. You only mostly need my protection and guidance instead of completely.\u201d The Queen\u2019s spacious, yet strong drooping arms wrapped around your love handles as she tugged you down to sit on her plush gut. She knowingly chuckled as she looked up to you your confused face, yet the return of Jessica\u2019s more subdued flirtation gives you a strange sense of comfort - aside from having no idea what to expect from her in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never knew my sweet boy could be so cruel\u201d she teasingly pouted as Jessica rubbed her neck rolls and obese cheeks against your soon-to-be pot-belly like she was cuddling a teddy bear, \u201cSubtle manipulation of my love of familial bonds, then withholding one of mommy\u2019s many favorite indulgence foods until she agreed to your demands?\u201d Her fingers crawl up your back, fondling together body fat to make temporary rolls for her hands to admire, \u201cAre my lessons taking root that quickly \u2013 or was I right, and you were born a Masters before we ever found you, I wonder. It definitely seems like you\u2019ll need more advanced subject material in the immediate future if I am to best nurture this new potential you keep showing, Dark Horse.\u201d And here comes the uncertainty as she takes a long several minutes to play with your body while your silence is only punctuated by her curious exploration of your tender points and her giggling at your reactions if she struck gold. You finally try to look down and start up a conversation, but Mrs. Masters won\u2019t let you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. I won\u2019t take anything back or even treat <b>you</b> any differently. Your desire to seek out the Flounders simply must be like your strange arrivals, another happy slice of providence I haven\u2019t had the experience yet of trying to enjoy how good it really is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she pets your pudgy gut, her wicked side comes out, \u201cYou do owe me a heavy show of good faith by striving to take bigger portions though, precious. I\u2019ll make sure to even visit and join your meals now to make sure my boy grows Big and Strong.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand her innuendoes here,  but these women always seem to know how to make you feel both scared and excited for their plans, <b>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</b> She coyly pulls down your head to hers, \u201cAnd stop with this ma\u2019am business in our private moments, baby. Here -- and soon elsewhere, it\u2019s just Jessica or Dearest \u2013 understood?\u201d When you nervously reply <b>\u201cYes, M\u2014Jessica</b>, the Queen lovingly hugs all of her squishy upper half around your middle, \u201cGood boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she lets go, the Matriarch gives you a stern look, \u201cYou will show none of that sweetness to that Woman. She will chew you up and spit you out if you don\u2019t stay cunning and detached like you were with me, because she will not return such mercy or apology to you, darling.\u201d Your brows sharpen and rise with concern, but Jessica hides a sense of worry well around her show of authority while taking your hands into hers. \u201cPromise me, precious. Be ruthless in engaging her. I will make sure to be there and support you on the day she arrives, but I need to know you will harden your heart enough to be protected from that woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to make out a <b>\u201cI promise to take this seriously, Jessica\u201d</b> before you are hit by a wave exhaustion, you really want to take a nice rest at home to be prepared for another day of flirtation, weirdness and melodrama. The Mistress titters as she rubs your tired face, \u201cI can see your point in wanting to exercise if you are this lacking in stamina, love. But then again, how many meals have you skipped?\u201d You don\u2019t even have the juice to work up some sarcasm, so Mrs. Masters just gives you honest paternal care as she sets you down again. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get you to bed, sleepyhead. You do have classes tomorrow, but mommy will make sure everyone gives her baby some leeway because he was such a studious night owl tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a flock of servants begin to carry you and your piggies out, the last thing you can hear before you black out is Jessica\u2019s vindictive deep cackle as she watches you drift away. \u201cI was afraid you were still too soft for our affairs. That involving her would just ruin you. But now, I wonder if it\u2019ll be you that corrupts her, precious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A bump in the road unceremoniously awakens you to find yourself back in the passenger seat of the Hummer, still in control and surrounded by maids gleefully watching your personal staff cling to you in their food comas.</b> \u201cOh shoot, they looked so cute sleeping together like that.\u201d A pink highlighted maid with very large chest assets was busy taking her last picture of you all that you guess was going to start a whole host of other rumors as soon as it goes online. \u201cI\u2019m Emily, by the way, but I wouldn\u2019t bother going through introductions right now. You should just go back to sleep, Master, and let us take good care of you.\u201d A beach tanned, wide thighed girl to the left suggested \u201cMaybe he needs some more \u2018pillows\u2019 to help him sleep with\u201d, to which a sassier girl in the far back replied \u201cYeah, let\u2019s all keep each other warm, Master. Why should those three get all the fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat sounds nice\u201d</b>, you drop without any intentional lewd interest, but looking at Emily\u2019s phone gave you the urge to check your own. You are immediately barraged with several texts from Bunnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHERE ARE YOU, CJ?! We found Becca, but she is in the Cafeteria Kitchen, hanging around a lot of pointy knives and other dangerous things, and won\u2019t wake up no matter what we try! PLZ GET DOWN HERE NOW!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline rouses you up as you tightly grasp your phone, fight instincts throwing subtly to the curb if Rebby\u2019s actually in trouble. <b>\"SHIT! WHO\u2019S DRIVING THIS THING?!\u201d</b> The help still conscious get flustered by this sudden outburst, Emily, being a more levelheaded operator, attempts to calm you down \"Whoa, where's the fire, handsome? I thought you wanted to go home?\" You lean in with an unthinking anger, <b>\"Change of plans! School Cafeteria! STEP ON IT!\"</b> The multicolored punk gets a little kick out of this excitement, \"Okay, Riggs. MIA!\" Emily bangs on the seat paneling for a goggled, short haired motor-head at the wheel to scream back, \"WHAT?!\" A wild grin hits Mia's face when Emily tells her to \"Floor it to the Teria'\", and you have just put all of their lives in danger as she's allowed to put her lead foot down. \"LET ME HEAR YOU ROAR, BIG GIRL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe modified 6.3-liter, V12 engine bellows out exhaust and ear drum shattering hellfire as you speed up to a nerve wracking 70 MPH down a thankfully smooth and unused private stretch of road. Why the hell does a goddamn Stretch Hummer have the horsepower to ram through a building doesn't matter to you right now, Becca needs you.</span></div></div>",

You are the one with the complete memory, you see from both nimrod and your own perspectives. You were aware when he discovered her sleep eating tendencies, so there must be only one reason why she\u2019s there. Appeasing an imaginary Dalton scarfing down anything she can find. Well, even if it\u2019s working, you\u2019d much rather have her <i>small</i> and alive than the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the occasional shaking of the car and Emily\u2019s chubby hands waving across your face brought you back from your mind. \u201cWelcome back to Earth, John Matrix. The Grimace you were giving the floor looked like you were picking out who you were going to kill last.\u201d You embarrassingly scratched the back of your head as you gazed back down, <b>\u201cOh\u2026sorry if I scared anyone, I\u2019m just really worried\u201d</b>, you almost mumble out. The movie loving maid tries to deflect any barbs to her words, \u201cOh no, I was just joking that you looked really mad for a case of the munches-\u201d, but she joins a host of envious eyes watching you momentarily pet and brush the indigestion and odd twists you\u2019re giving your personal servants deep slumber. \u201cLucky dogs\u201d you faintly hear among the small crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s is the simplest and cutest to decipher, \u201cmmMaster \u2013 are we going swimming?

Christine\u2019s is trickier, although you get a sense she\u2019s going to not only be teasing whenever she can, but will be the most easygoing. \u201cOops, you did all the house work again? Well \u2013 what can I do to make it up to ya, Hoss?\u201d That grin of hers just leaves so much to imagination when she starts to breathe heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the other two responded positively to soft touches, Margaret \u2013 well she\u2019s a little bit different. \u201cMaster \u2013 urp \u2013 did I eat everyone\u2019s food? Well I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re starving, what are you going to do about it?!\u201d Yet when a very long pothole sends a loose seat belt strap to slap her giant ass, \u201cOh Yes -- Punish your greedy hog!\u201d You won\u2019t judge as there are parts that don\u2019t sound that bad, but you don\u2019t want to kiss with a fist or cuddle with a riding crop, even if she asks nicely. Then again, you get the feeling you won\u2019t have a choice in the matter when it involves her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got your hands full with that one\u201d Emily motioned like she was going to rib you, even if she was too far away to reach, \u201csure you don\u2019t want to trade out with someone else-\u201c. She was interrupted by a sudden weightless sensation you all shared, before the car came crashing down and finally slides into a parked position, sending the whole host of servants rolling on top of you, as Mia proudly proclaims \u201cUNDER 10 MINUTES, FUCK YES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the tangled pile of padded flesh, there is an angry scream of \u201cARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US, MIA\u201d, but you aren\u2019t sure who is saying what between the grunting and ranting. But if you\u2019re at the Campus, you needed to move; even if someone\u2019s ample body was blocking your vision. Apologizing as you prodded and picked up a very soft and abashed Emily by her hips, she timidly squeaked \u201cthanks\u201d as you let her stand upright on her own volition and give you an exit from the fat cave. <b>\"Think you can hold down the fort here as I take care of something?\u201d</b> You don\u2019t exactly wait to hear Emily\u2019s reply as you rush to the nearest door and frantically run as fast as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side entrance doors you\u2019re nearest to have thankfully been left unlocked, but you aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s a sign of Bunnie or Miss Young\u2019s competence or the lax security of Chubbeso. No, that\u2019s unimportant, what\u2019s the quickest way to the Cafeteria from here?  Is she even still there at this point?! You begin to holler out <b>\u201cREBECCA\u201d</b> in the quiet hallways, locked rooms and dark corners of the school. Your panicked panting and reverberating shouts were your only company as you cursed an entire year of overeating slowing your progress with an out-of-shape mess that tugged and jiggled against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you finally reached the marble pillars and strange mix of Art Deco and Neo Classical structure, you knew you were in The Hall of Fattening itself, Chubbeso Cafeteria. You didn\u2019t even need to shout for Ms. Blake to poke her head out of a doorway and signal you over, \u201cTHERE YOU ARE! Get over here quick, Romeo!\u201d As you wheezily jog over to the cooking \u201cBunker\u201d \u2013 a snaking series of world class kitchens and stacked to the brim pantries that could feed an entire city, let alone the constantly growing student body and facility that was rumored to be a repurposed Fallout Shelter; you could already hear the wild foraging of Rebecca Maglen randomly tearing through cast iron pots and pans, breaking containers and who knows what else. When you reach the Wonder Chef and Head Nurse, their likely reprisal at your tardiness quickly melted away to flushed gapes. Bunnie, having more backbone, is the one to actually ask \u201cUh \u2013 CJ? Where\u2019s your shirt?\u201d <b>\u201dDoesn\u2019t matter\u2026\u201c</b> you puff out as you lean forward with your hands on your knees, desperately gasping for air, <b>\u201dWhere \u2013 Where is Becca?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question was soon answered by the labored footfalls of your best friend waddling into view; her creaking belly wobbles and gurgles with an ominous loud groan as it hangs heavy and undeniably inviting for your touch. Rebecca\u2019s peaceful glaze from her baby blue eyes had a haunting beauty as they ignored her strained movements in a childlike search for more treats to stuff herself with, \u201cAll\u2026for\u2026Cejey.\u201d Her once taught XXXL T-shirt flapped as a tattered and stained curtain hovering around her nearly exposed breasts that were shielded by long Auburn hair, both articles of clothing were destroyed by a gut that is possibly larger than Claire\u2019s at this point. Her black sweat shorts were a series of open holes, rubbing and wiggling around their uncontrollable thighs and an indomitable bottom, with the largest opening barely covering her pink frilly boxers that weren\u2019t fairing too well either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Rebby\u2019s somnambulic instincts cornered another tasty treat, this time a particularly large Cinnamon Crumb Cake, the glutton next door's already debris encrusted digits mercilessly dug chunks out for her to happily swallow down, no matter how much her already aching stomach begged her for no more. The already fragile Streuselkuchen rained sweet gore around her protruding girth, a strangle pleasant hum mashed with her already broken English as she mumbled while she gorged. As the pieces shrank, Rebecca licked her fingers, her belly, even the plate and some of the floor clean of pieces before she let off a loud <b>Bruuap</b> and patted her glutted sphere. \"Tubbeh\" she faintly smiled, but then it soured into a painful frown \"Neh...Tubbeh...Enouh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have said your remorseful <b>Becka</b> out loud, because one thick thigh slowly rippled around the other until she faced you, \"Cejey?\" Hopefully, she'll listen to you in this state, <b>\"That's right, it's me. The real CJ Dalton. Come to me, Becca.\"</b> Rebby's bright blues worryingly scanned around her as she grew scared, \"Wher...Cjey?!\" You make a loud shush, which thankfully slows her movements back to a relaxed slouch, before you continue, <b>\"Becca, concentrate on nothing but my voice.\"</b> She begins to repeat a fair assessment of your words in her dream speak, so you hope this first attempt at hypnotism works. <b>\"You have eaten enough for now and are the most beautiful woman and greatest friend I have. I couldn't be prouder to have you in my life.\"</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca actually breaks out into sniffle as she listens in, yet somehow says a very articulate \"Dork\" that you'll gladly take if this is successful. <b>\"That's right, your Dork misses you\"</b>, you shamelessly state while Bunnie and Erika snicker amidst outwardly thinking this is absolutely adorable, <b>\"and I want you to follow my voice and come to me.\"</b> Maglen obeys as she slowly waddles closer to you, <b>\"And when you reach and hold me, you'll wake up and we'll be together.\"</b> Her lumber speeds up to a heavy stomp as Rebby's dreamlike grin widens across her messy face, \"Ferver?!\" You hold out your hands in a dramatic fashion as who knows how much fat girl comes stampeding your way, <b>\"Forever.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd certainly be a touching scene, if it wasn't for Rebecca's massive hips hitting the side of a table right next to you and setting off a call bell with sharp little <b>ring</b>, that switches back the original CJ Dalton just in time to be hugged by a now awake and agonizingly full Best Bud. You both traded whys, whats and wheres before the staff came in to try and explain the situation to everyone involved. \"I'm a som-what\", Rebecca spikes before she winces back to try and deal with the sore mound of sugar in her gut, which you also try to help soothe. \"Well, technically you're a sleepeater, which is a similar sort of parasomnia event like sleep walking except - well, you consume a lot.\" The Nurse tries to both be gentle and matter-of-fact, but Becca's clearly shaken by this. \"Am I - hic - am I going to keep doing this?!\" \"Well, I won't know the possible cause until I run some tests, but-\", Ms. Young is cut off by your now softball resembling friend clinging to you and desperately begging, \"Cej, please - you gotta help me through this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you want me to do?\" Rebecca nervously shakes you as she tries to come up with something \"I dunno, spend the night with me until I get this is under control? C'mon, man!\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, you stammer out a few feeble attempts at some sort of alteration; however, the more you try to resist, the closer her billowy belly bounces up to you. As Becka\u2019s bare tanned spare tire brushed against your pudge and nudged you back a few steps, you start to truly understand the size of her girth as she still slowly advances closer, her pleading gaze turning more impassioned along with the tomboy\u2019s walk into a sultrier sashay of utilizing every groaning ounce of her growing form with each step. Your eyes widen in disbelief whilst your longtime friend lowers her lashes as she looks up to you, now fully entrapping you into her vast sloshing abdomen and your back against the white kitchen wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d you whimper out in time for Rebecca to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce of a kiss, \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it Ceej?\u201d Bunnie gives out an amazed clap, Erika covers her obese face with her plump hands, but cannot hide a beet-red flush and you are completely dumbfounded. What in the hell just happened?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d, Blake coughs and attempts to clear the heavy air with her usual sense of wit, \u201cI didn\u2019t know today\u2019s playboys were the Dorks.\u201d You give her a slightly wounded, but still confused look before Ms. Young recovers her composure and clarifies, \u201cYou know \u2013 when you said you were her dork to try and wake Miss Maglen up? It was quite a charming speech you gave about how much you cared for her.\u201d Rebecca perks up at this, yet you sink further into a disoriented sitting brood. \u201cDeets, please\u201d the dark-reddish brown beauty insisted as Bunnie prepared to spin a tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was around late afternoon when Chubbeso Cock-of-the-Walk, CJ Dalton, gave his gal pals a sudden text message of significant importance\u201d, the currently blue and purple short bedhead styled cook shamelessly exaggerated and the Nurse rolled her eyes incredulously. \u201cNow this is nothing new for us, because I\u2019m always waiting for my little stud to dial me up and go I GOTTA EAT SOME MORE OF YOUR COOKIN\u2019, GOOD LOOKIN\u2019. But once again, he needed me for something more difficult than a little TLC for his tum-tum, yet I wasn\u2019t gonna let my little bro down.\u201d Erika, trying to be a more honest source, rested her delicate fingers on a soft belly of her own as she continued, \u201cI was worried CJ had two accidents on the same day, but as you now know, he was warning us about trying to find you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks for helping me again\u201d, Rebecca bluntly butted in to get to the part she really wanted to hear, \u201ctell me how CJ came to my rescue!\u201d Bunnie put her hands on her slightly plusher hips to this, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Lover-Dork himself for an encore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft big toe prodded your exposed gut handles as you looked up to see a trio of friendly smiles waiting on you to socialize with them. \u201cHey~\u201d, Rebecca kittenishly rubbed her leg against you, while you took a brief moment scan her voluptuous and very exposed form at this angle before twisting your head back down in embarrassment. \u201cI want to hear that mushy stuff you said about me!\u201d This, like a lot of today, was something absolutely lost to you. All you could reply with was a timid \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. I promise I won\u2019t make fun of you too much before I give you give you your reward \u2013 depending on what you say that is.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s newfound friskiness tempered with her old teasing self isn\u2019t making this any easier on you, and it only makes you shout out \u201cI said I don\u2019t know\u201d louder, much to everyone\u2019s discomfort.  Becca attempts to play this off as if she\u2019s what\u2019s upsetting you with a \u201cLook, CJ, it\u2019s alright if-\u201c, but they still don\u2019t understand you! \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW. I DON\u2019T KNOW WHERE I\u2019VE BEEN, I DON\u2019T KNOW WHY YOU\u2019RE ACTING LIKE THIS AND I\u2019M SCARED TO FIND OUT JUST HOW MUCH I DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friends\u2019 maternal sides kick in with Ms. Young drawing the swiftest conclusion, \u201cCJ, are you suffering worse complications from your head injury?!\u201d Bunnie\u2019s right back to silently agonizing that this is her fault, Rebecca\u2019s holding you not in a new budding love, but in fear; Ms. Young is setting up future appointments and you\u2019re having sudden painful migraines <b>because you couldn\u2019t just fucking take a few gift girlfriends like a normal lonely heart. No, you just had to ruin this because baby wants all the pieces to fit!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sudden entrance of a Masters Maid entourage broke up the strife as Emily proceeded to provide a cover story in a much more formal tone. \u201cExcuse me, but I believe I have the ending you seek. Master CJ was having medical complications at the manner while he was seeking Mrs. Masters\u2019 personal assistance in searching for Miss Maglen. We tried to give him good bedside rest, assuring him that we could handle his affairs for him. But as soon as we unfortunately let him learn of your location, Master CJ wouldn\u2019t hear no for an answer until he personally woke up his sleeping beauty.\u201d  Is that how this all went down? You do remember meeting Claire outside your room, but then nothing for several hours until you\u2019re in the Cafeteria, the middle of the night, and just after everything is settled?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour migraines relapse to likely tell you to <b>leave well enough alone</b>, but, thankfully, Becca\u2019s ready to cut to the chase. \u201cSo CJay just needs some bedrest\u201d your stuffed friend with potential benefits asks as she wraps an arm around you. Emily nods as she takes a short bow, \u201cThe doctor at the manner seems to think he is suffering from minor sleep and food deprivation that are not helping him heal from his head trauma naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll make sure he gets some good bellyfuls starting tomorrow.\u201d Bunnie seems even more enthusiastic than she typically is about sneaking extra helpings your way over this, but there\u2019s nothing malicious about her obvious concern for you. Erika, on the other hand, wants to be a second opinion. \u201cAnd as Head Nurse, CJ\u2019s health is my responsibility. I will conduct further examinations of him \u2013\u201cbut Emily cuts her off, \u201cAFTER he has had sufficient rest and relaxation.\u201d  The usually mild mannered woman, but maybe a little too nurturing when you\u2019re involved, as it\u2019s often joked she\u2019s gone Florence Nightingale Effect for you and harder with every visit; gave a very uncharacteristic leer at this convenient and intrusive stonewall likely all the way from her employer. Sensing this, the busty maid tries to calm the waters, even if there\u2019s no chance your tubby angle will stay away if she thinks you\u2019re hurt, \u201cNo offense to you or your skills madam, but we\u2019ve only been instructed to try the initial remedy first before we attempt any other cure.\u201d \"Oh, I bet you have\" coldly snaps out of Ms. Young's still somewhat sweet countenance as she furiously writes something down in a tablet she produces from a pack snugly hanging around her lovely waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're free to go now, right?\" Becca's still a willing pillar of strength for you when she senses trouble, even if you're slightly fighting the urge to focus on her lack of a shirt and bra rubbing and jiggling next to your own. \"Of course\", Emily once again bows her vast tracks of land before the host of maids makes a path for you and Rebecca, \"Please don't hesitate to ask for our assistance in anything should you need it. Mrs. Masters was very touched by your words and actions this night and has commanded for us to now serve the manner and the Young Master's flat in this time of need.\" The tomboy's now more willing overeating urges casually licks her lips as she turns to you, \"Free and unlimited high quality room-service too? This extended sleepover just keeps getting better - eh, Ceej?\" You simply mummer out a fragile \"mmm-hmm\" that only makes her squeeze you in tighter with her left as her right manages her bubbling cauldron. \"Hey, it's okay man. I'll look out for you as you look out for me, like always.\" Your old personal Three Musketeer credo between Rebecca and Kate is a small comfort - but everything still feels topsy-turvey, like she's hasn't stopped shaking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try one last grasp at a sense of normalcy as you look back to Bunnie and Erika, \"N-none of this is against any rules?\" Your Canadian over-feeder gives a sly, smug grin as she eyes you up with Becca. \"One girl just isn't enough for you? There's nothing against roommates - especially involving opposite genders, seeing as you're the only Big Boy here.\" \"And Mrs. Masters did sign your apartment under your name, Master CJ\", Emily adds her own suggestive needling just to make this is even more awkward for you, \"Chubbeso Administration will not interfere with any off campus activities occurring on private property you own, sir.\" A tender finger gingerly rubbing around your chest makes you look down to meet Becca's hungry eyes and you simply give up trying to understand any of this. \"Okay - just lemme get to my bed and have a rest\" you wearily sigh as you slowly waddle along with your amorous new roomie, \"Sure thing, bud. There's always tomorrow - and the days after that to celebrate our new relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, what the hell just happened?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself planted in a dark leather sofa, it creaks and shifts to your touch and movements, yet you are numb to any sensation that should come from these actions. A dim moody light flows from a series of red curtains that contain the room that you are in, at times depicting shadows of familiar people or shapes before they flicker back into nothingness.  As you hear the slashing of ink scrawling to paper, your vision follows a zig-zag of sharp black and white tiled lines in the floor to a tall man scribbling notes in a large black book beside two statues. To the right, a very obese woman with noticeable muscle tone slightly peaking up beneath her expansive flab; while the figure to his left had no head or arms, yet it always seemed to shift around as you tried to study it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing back to the man, there is a strong sense of envy the longer you survey his features. A powerful series of muscles stretched out the fabric of a deep crimson three-piece suit, strong face structure with skin that puberty apparently forgot about with how pristine and perfect his complexion is; thick and feathered back dark brown hair that bordered on being pitch black, with equally Russian Brown Bear colored eyes that glared back at you as you gazed into them. A fun house reflection of what you could look like \u2013 with a lot more effort on your part to achieve any of this and slight differences such as his S curving brow giving the illusion like he was always angry and hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed his book, the man took a wry smile in saying <b>\u201cKcor S\u2019tel!</b> You must have blinked in a completely lost confusion, as he chuckled while he took a small shrug, <b>\u201dYou were expecting someone shorter?\u201d</b> Suddenly, a jazzy saxophone and double bass duet played along with flashing strobe lights as a very short man, in an equally red suit and flared disco shirt, walked a groovy strut across the room before he exited through a door that vanished and took the music along with him. The Tall Man had a very admiring smile as he watched the other stranger leave. <b>\u201dNow there\u2019s a cool cat that knows what\u2019s going on\u201d</b>, yet a more noticeable glare returned as he turned his head back, <b>\u201cunlike you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tall Dude opened his book on his lap as he breathed out an exasperated sigh. <b>\u201cSince I\u2019m killing time either way, let\u2019s see if you can retain any of this. Tell me, Charity, who do you actually have your eye on?\u201d</b> Although you took offense to not calling you by the name you want, you took the bait, \u201cWhat?\u201d <b>\u201cQuit being stupid\u201d</b>, he growled as he turned a page, <b>\u201cwho are you actually going to start hooking up with so you can stop tormenting all of these poor women in an endless feigned ignorance of everyone\u2019s feelings?\u201d</b> Does this guy seriously want to know who you\u2019d want to go out with?! And frighteningly enough, he answers that thought. <b>\u201cYeah, I do. Why else would I ask the question, Dipshit?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rude Man stretched out his hand to the left statue as it took the shape of the person he described. <b>\u201cHow about that freaky, fat and financially secure crazy girl, Claire Masters? She\u2019s got issues in wanting to make everything about her kinky desires, but she doesn\u2019t lie about that-\u201d</b>, Jerkface puts on a sad smile as another page flips; <b>\u201c-yet with a little attention, we could coax her out of that nothing but libido shell to make bonds with people besides us and grow as a person. Y\u2019know, as we make sure her figure grows out as a gigantic fatty.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not comfortable being so blunt about that subject, especially with an asshole like him, but the man strangely doesn\u2019t grill you about it as you thought he would. <b>\u201dOh right, you don\u2019t like broadcasting the fact that we like Fat Girls. Hey, I can respect that as the flag\u2019s yours to wave as high or as low as you\u2019re comfy with \u2013 but let\u2019s not bullshit each other here. They all can see it; I enjoy it and I can easily make you show it if you still want to pretend like you can cut it off from love.\u201d</b>  You furrow your brows as you look away and he relents, <b>\u201dYeah, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d crack that nut tonight. So let me get back to the point I want to bring up here.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Red Goon snaps his fingers and no matter where you look, more statues appear of all the women you\u2019ve ever had a potential interest in, inside the academy and elsewhere. <b>\u201dThere\u2019s always a choice, CJ. We may not like the ones we\u2019re offered, but they exist whether we like them to or not.\u201d</b> You\u2019ve already had enough of this guy\u2019s sermon as you stand up \u2013 but unfortunately, you notice you\u2019re kind of huge and completely naked. \u201cHey\u201d, your panic actually causes a gelatinous wave in your thankfully unmentionable covering belly overhang, \u201cwhy and when did any of this happen?!\u201d <b>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tubbo. You tell me, this is your own damn mind!\u201d</b> You focus on yourself and it starts to shift back into a more realistic and decent set of chubby t-shirt and jeans and you calm down into the seat.  <b>\u201cChrist, do I have to do everything even in your dreams? Just pick someone so I know who to work on.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I don\u2019t know who I want to go out with yet and it\u2019s none of your damn business when I do it!\u201d Tall Twat gives a bombastically sarcastic howl as he springs out of his seat. <b>\u201cWell look who decided to participate. Except it doesn\u2019t matter if you say that to me, what matters is you finally telling any of these girls, including your so called closest friends, what the score is! Because you sure as shit aren\u2019t being a NICE GUY with anyone by treating this as an anime harem where you don\u2019t pick anyone and a perpetual status-quo of WILL HE OR WON\u2019T HE means everything\u2019s fine and dandy for the ladies involved.\u201d</b> You\u2019re kind of awestruck as he continues to rant. <b>\u201cHell, I dare you to date or try to go after all of them. Because let me tell you, at least that isn\u2019t as hurtful as just ignoring reality and letting them all wait their whole lives for CJ Dalton to find his balls and even try to have a relationship with anyone!\u201d</b>He wrathfully throws his book at the red curtains and the statues crumbled down. <b>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice, CJ. And when you avoid making any, you only pick the worst option of all!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get TM to explain what you should do if it\u2019s really this bad, but his words are cut off with you waking up under the curious looming gaze of Rebecca. A suppler, but notably smaller gut isn't the only part of her curvature orbiting around your body as she watched you sleep. \"Guess I'm getting too big to do this stealthily anymore.\" You let out a groggy \"do what\u201d, however, Becca's casual glib doesn't seem to care of any social faux pas she'll likely continue to do when it involves you. \"How was I supposed to resist when Ceej was mumbling this weird stuff in his sleep?\" Your eyes betray a deep seated anxiety you didn't want to come out, yet Rebecca's grin widens. Her long auburn hair brushes your face as she leans in to impishly whisper, \"including your dirty secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing becomes erratic as she slowly lumbers on her hands and feet to further spread out her toasty lard over you, \"Ceej, what do you like more? A big soft belly or a hard and stuffed one?\" Please, Becca, don't push this out - not with you. The folds of the mattress groan and creak as she wobbles and rocks you around under her, with Becca's face oozing with satisfaction as she's finally cornered you into The Question. \"Right now, it's so pillowy soft, I bet you could just cuddle with it for hours and do a lot of things someone like you knows all about.\" You wince as the tomboy rubs her body harder onto you, her sent now inescapably all over your bed. \"But Big Girls like me gotta eat. Nibble ourselves fatter and fuller because we just need it so badly, Cej.\" Becca's eyes pierce you with a longing for an answer as her mouth moans out her plea, \"Won't my brave dork please feed me nice and full?\" You try to look away, but her rounder hands clench around your jaw. \"Or is it neither because you don't like big girls. Am I ugly to you, CJ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer the silence intensifies, the sadder she becomes as she waits. You don't want to say it, you don't want love to just be this - but you can't lie to Rebecca and hurt her like this. \"It's both!\" Her reddened blues give a confused blink as you continue, \"I like both soft and hard bellies. And you're really pretty Becca, don't ever think that ugly bullshit again!\" She starts to cry and laugh at the same time before she closes in for a long gentle kiss that doesn't feel bad to receive. She gives you a few cop-outs, closing back in for another quick tongue play once you think she's done. But when she finally pulls up for real, she's too peppy to pull of smug seductress, no matter how hard she goes into the act anyway; \"Took you long enough to admit it, Fatty Perv!\" You're never going to hear the end of this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebbeca rises up to sitting on both her and your legs,its good to see her so happy, even if you've just noticed her big soft stomach ruining one of your favorite shirts. She must have heard you groan, \"What, the maids haven't brought what little clothes I have left that fit yet.\" A deep belly growl comes from both of you and Becca starts to get ideas, \"I like being a cool girlfriend roaming around in your clothes all day, but how will I make sure you keep getting larger stuff for me to wear?\" She starts to pat and rub both of your tummies as she licks her lips, \"Maybe I should round you out as well just to be safe, but then, there wouldn't be less food to fatten me up with. Choices.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively pull her down into the bed as the door opens up, with Sam, Christine and Margaret rolling a large squadron of food carts stuffed to the brim with tantalizing goodies. \"Master, Breakfast~\" Sam gleefully shouts as Becca shimmies on her back next to you, \"Ooo, looks like its both this time.\" </span></div></div>",

The last day of near complete fasting certainly made you hungrier the more types of food you could smell surrounded you; oven fresh bread, warm tea, a variety of meats with likely sausages as big as a quarter pound steak, thankfully some hints of vegetables along with an entire set of dressings. But they still kept coming and you simply had to ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI thought you said Breakfast? I don\u2019t know how late I\u2019ve slept, but I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t have time for all of this.\u201d The cuddly dark skinned girl with the even cuddlier belly delicately set a napkin around a not so loose blue shirt you slept in and your blanket covered lap. You got a tingly sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in her too innocent to believe grin; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Master-\u201c, the Brunette paused to give a yearning quick study and then corrected herself, \u201c-CJ, we asked the manner chefs to make it as small as they could. However, Bunnie couldn\u2019t bring herself to go lower than 20 if it meant leaving you malnourished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 courses, yeah, that\u2019s around 10 dishes less than Claire usually tries to stuff you with at lunch. You\u2019re really glad Becca forced her way into being a roommate, even if that\u2019s also tempered by a very realistic fear that these three women are trying to make both of you explode with this much Blake cooking. Yet the prelude concluded with Becca\u2019s eager fingers yanking a nearby 10 inch thick slab of French Toast and managing to suck the buttered and heavily syruped fried egg bread down before Sam could stop her, \u201cHey, this was supposed to be for Master CJ!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, in her desire to ripen in front of you, gave a devious forced burp as she replied, \u201cThen you better get to feeding him before I gobble most of it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round rump red-head made a frustrated \u201cTch\u201d through her teeth as she and the tall platinum blond strutted over your way, circling half the stuffing around an easy to reach path to your mouth as they closed in. You attempted a meager distraction of asking for an introduction; however, the maids quickly sliced open a Cinnamon, Chocolate Chip, Lemon and Vanilla Cream Swirl Bundt cake you could probably fit your elbow through to arm the four eyed devil enveloped you in her ominous shadow. \u201cYou want introductions again? Boring\u2019s Sam, Dopy Tits is Christine and you can call me Margret.\u201d Her pupils shrank as she shoved large chunk down your lips and strongly tickled your Adam\u2019s apple to make it go down, \u201cRight now your name is Porky \u2013 and you\u2019re going to eat.\u201d They giggled in a mechanical unison and your Brunch \u00e0 la russe commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, between the buttermilk, blackberry and Mint Chocolate crumbed pancakes and fried breaded chicken tenders was when your paunch started to peep out of your shirt. And, of course, it caught the attention and teasing of everyone else. \u201dUh oh, someone\u2019s getting softer~\u201d, cooed Christine as she drummed her fingers around your tight navel. You groaned more from the increasing pain of your new contents than the mocking, but thankfully, Christine and Sam protected you from Margaret\u2019s claws hard pressing them even further. \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t\u201d, Sam yelled as she actually cat scratched Margie away with a sudden fury, \u201cMaster\u2019s Belly is a wonderful little cinnamon bun of fun and you\u2019re not going to pop it for your dumb kicks!\u201d You erupt an urp of relief as you were able to rub your potbelly in peace while the ensuing rotund ruckus focused on a stuffing food fight amongst each other with the growing mess, weight abusing wrestling moves and really vicious name-calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn\u2019t even lean back without bumping into the glutting field of Rebecca\u2019s dirty plates, pie tins and marinara and other sauce bowls - discarded and bled dry. Where you\u2019d rather not think about how much you\u2019ve probably swallowed down before it started to hurt, and judging by how far your pudge is sticking out, that\u2019s no small amount; the Tomboy didn\u2019t care to stop until there was no more she could fit in \u2013 or at least, until she topped herself off with a ridiculous high- calorie concoction of her own piggy design. Griping and grunting against the resistance her already bloated belly was giving her, Rebecca\u2019s knack of crafting Tombstone concoctions of everything and drinking it down was about to reach a whole new pinnacle of mad science. Pulling in her side of the morning dessert reserve, your fat friend took a few mousses and milkshakes of varying flavors and sent them all down into a cool fondue pot full of gooey caramel. Even if you cannot look away from the oncoming act, both out of concern for her safety and a quiet interest to watch her pull it off; you still try to reach out a hand into her expanding middle, but your touch only encourages her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom-heavy cast iron pot tipped across Becca\u2019s lips and you could feel every gulp of that sugary slurry cascade down into her gurgling stomach, ripping and tearing through what remained of old dependable Doom Guy into a barely stable stained bra. Further out her gut went, already bigger than even how you found her last night, yet your fingers craved to know this chunky comrade\u2019s circumference chugging itself thicker. Your tips caressed and sunk around her taught bellybutton and Becca billowed out an excited \u201cMmmgh\u201d that spoke to something primeval within you. Your pulse hastened the more of her you could hold onto, drawing you in closer to explore Rebecca\u2019s form, which in turn caused her to consume faster and lean more your way. The few trickling streams she missed flowed down over her girth and your hands, mixing that still intoxicating sent of hers with a sticky saccharine lotion that travels wherever your mitts roam on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision blurs, your actions feel like the movements of a stranger than fully conscious decisions, yet both you and Rebecca moan in harmony as your trunk contacts hers. You both feel each others heartbeat and it grows louder in your ear deafening out everything that isn\u2019t Becca. Closer and fuller she balloons, the fattened athlete setting you off and you her. But this could never last with a finite amount of slop for your Rebby to swill. As the pot falls to the floor with an empty echo, Becca quivers in a helpless bliss as she slowly falls to her back, the impact shifting you on top of her and you both give a slightly irritated burp while settling into place. The Softball\u2019s is the more impressive display, which makes her weakly smile and titter out a frail \u201cI win\u201d, as she gingerly rubs both of your intermingling flesh \u2013 however little she could actually do with even her flabby arms. Her blue eyes give you a euphoric haze as she meekly whimpers, \u201cI can\u2019t move CeeJ. What have you done to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve never been this thrilled before in your life. While you\u2019ve always loved Rebecca more than just a mere friend, not even your wildest dreams that included her went this far. Involved those sort of urges, had her this willing and responsive to reciprocate those desires. This couldn\u2019t be real \u2013 and yet, who else\u2019s breathing is slowly raising you up and lowering you back down if not Rebecca\u2019s?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, waves of doubt and guilt came crashing over you as you didn\u2019t want the only reason for you to love her just to be her body fat. You\u2019ve cared for this girl more deeply than most people you\u2019ve ever met, aside for Kate and Mom, and you just did this to Becca. You didn\u2019t ask to touch her like that \u2013 you just did it anyway. You took advantage of your best friend. God, what do you even want?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you just let this happen, does she really want you like this? Do you not want to sacrifice the friendship you already have on a gamble like this? Or is CJ Dalton once again completely clueless on whatever he wants in life?! Fuck!</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t lead on that cute ice-cream soup smeared mug or hurt her by being such an emotional wreck that you don\u2019t even let yourself feel this shit. But Rebecca\u2019s wounded yet crossed scowl has already read your body language and is on the warpath. \u201cOh, so this is when the Dalton slip occurs?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ashamed heavy brow and gritted teeth meet her slightly hiccuping aggravated acceptance that you were going to weasel your way back to square one yet again. \u201cYou know, I was actually stupid enough to think this time it was different. You came to me, in this weird \u2013 hup \u2013 voice, begging me to make you a better man, acting all interested in me and open about who you are. But now you start conveniently forgetting things.\u201d Her accusing blues watch you hold your head trying to recall any of this and she barks, \u201cLet me guess, CJ doesn\u2019t remember any of that either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca flinches at the knots her rage is adding onto a way too full tummy and your attempt to shift off and help only pisses her off even more, \u201cW-why are you always like this? Why do I have to go after your kink to get you to say I\u2019m pretty? Am I some sort of sick game to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs curl into a semi fetal while your arms just try to hold onto Becca instead of aim anywhere in particular. The emotional combat zone in your head bubbles out in your eyes and snot, \u201cOh god, is that I how I made you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Softball Girl tries to pull up her anger\u2019s rudder, but you\u2019ve easily shot down that Bomber into a mellowing concern for you. \u201cY-Yeah \u2013 you could maybe apologize or something a-and I could forgive you.\u201d Unfortunately for your Big Fat Friend, however, you were about to let it all out instead of just take your bad boy punishment. \u201cI want to love everything about you Becca. I want to enjoy doing anything with you, like it was before we got to this school.\u201d Yet when you look at the now dried slurry trails your hands left on her mountain of a stomach, glistening in the light of the sun, self-contempt hardened your words while your tone cracks between pitches. \u201cHowever, you were big the day we met, so the fear was always there. Even back then when I was still putting the pieces together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca\u2019s face grew more protective the more you said, with her pudgy right hand rubbing through your wild bed locks, \u201cFear of what, Ceej?\u201d You prop your thick chin around her upper belly fold, too embarrassed to notice how close you were to her exposed underboob flesh, so you can look her in the eye without any effort on Rebecca\u2019s part. \u201cFear that I only care about how fat you are.\u201d A flush brighter than her clay brown hair overtakes your ample amiga\u2019s cheeks while you look away and bashfully move your finger around her bellybutton. \u201cWhen the portions increase and you and everyone else started to use that to flirt with me \u2013 I feel like the biggest creep in the world. I constantly have to catch myself from peeping on every midriff stretched undershirt lifted up by too many snacks, counting all the uniform buttons that pop during class, hearing the sounds of endless gluttony everywhere I go and resist an ever growing horde of girls pushing my buttons every single day. And if I\u2019m able to survive that \u2013 suddenly you come in and now almost all of our conversations involve you telling me how full you are or get me to brush up against your amazing body. It drives me crazy every time.\u201d Your hand slaps to your forehead and you go pinker even noticing the kinetic force ripple out on her tight drum, \u201cYou\u2019re not some fat pig that exists only for me to fatten whenever I feel like it, Rebecca!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill somewhat titillated by your choice of words, Beccy tries to soothe you down with a slightly mocking \u201cDude, you\u2019re a teenage boy in a girl\u2019s school. Fatty Perv or not, looking at a loose button is nowhere near sleeping around\u201d; but you still worry there\u2019s danger of you treating her as nothing but a disposable mound of lard instead of a person. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready for that kind of relationship now. You\u2019re perfect in every way Becca and I\u2019m just a goddamn mess. I\u2019m sorry I made you feel this way and I\u2019m sorry to ask even more from you, but I\u2019m going to need time to unscrew my head about a lot of things.\u201d Your sentiments put a sad smile on her face, but it was the \u201cYou deserve so much better\u201d that finally drove her to pull you up as far as she could and squeeze you tight against her torso. \u201cSo this is what was wrong with my poor baby? Why didn\u2019t you say anything before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plant your head on her doughy left shoulder and give a probably too brutally honest answer, \u201cBecause I\u2019m a moron.\u201d \u201cYeah\u201d, she laughs as she hugs you in tighter, \u201cYou\u2019re my moron and I don\u2019t like seeing my Ceej be so down on himself.\u201d A serene calm filled the bedroom as you even stopped hearing the rumble of the maid fight below you, which also seems to give you another familiar sense of dread. She cuddles with you a little longer before Rebecca preemptively puts her fingers on your lips as she lays down the law. \u201cOkay CJ, I\u2019ll let you off the hook for now. It\u2019s alright if you want to take your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever-\u201d, her other hand starts to rip into the last stable strands in what was your shirt and Becca\u2019s ravenous blues enjoy your conflicting instincts of ignore and observe, \u201c-if you think I\u2019m just going to stop when you tell me that all my little attempts at your heart are super effective, well, you\u2019ve got another tight sensation in your pants coming, pal.\u201d Her tan lined arms delicately hold your face as she savors your squirming, \u201cI want you Ceej. So bad, I\u2019m going to help you get over this weird hang up you seem to have over being the Fatty Perv I\u2019ve seen you be \u2013 especially if this big belly you\u2019ve fed has anything to say about it.\u201d Becca hums a little tune as she sticks out her gut as far as she can, quivering with whatever slight movements she could make, and you\u2019re too preoccupied to think clearly about what the hell you have been up to during these blackouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some blood comes back to your brain you try to stumble out some words, yet she never gives you the chance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, man. I\u2019m a Fat Girl \u2013 when I make my moves, I\u2019ll go nice and slow.\u201d Her chubby finger edges closer to your nose between every word of \u201cJust for you.\u201d You\u2019re way too hot and bothered to think, gotta get away, and maybe take a cold shower or ten. When you manage to brush off her hands and try to shift towards the door, a doughy pitcher\u2019s hand tightly grabs onto your boxer strap as she makes a more routine Rebecca whine. \u201cNo \u2013 Please, stay with me, CJ!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to her oddly desperate mannerisms that you\u2019d expect more from Kate having to deal with any social situation ever without you being her personal cover. \u201cI mean \u2013 they already listed us as sick, right? Why not just blow off classes today and play hooky with me? I don\u2019t care what we do, eating, talking, zoning out with some games.\u201d An oddly vulnerable tickle in her words makes you want to help her as she pleads once more, \u201cLet\u2019s just stay together.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And Rebecca currently looks to enjoy being beached a little too much to neither attempt nor care about moving around anytime soon. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna have to pass on that\u201d, scooting just enough out of her reach, you brace both for an earful of \u201cBUT CEEEJ\u201d and the likely extra difficulty of navigating through this carbohydrate minefield with your already painfully stretched pot-belly. And when you finally found balance on your feet, the Tomboy, thankfully, merely used her words instead trying to throw things at you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, man! The Headmistress and her little bitch blimp would roll over to whatever you asked them-\u201c, Becca stopped, noticing the slightly bigger wiggle around your middle and then remembered, \u201c-Oh right. Whatever they agree to, they\u2019d both make sure it involves a lot of food.\u201d You almost burp out a sardonic \u201cNo, really\u201d, but continue once your intestines stop trying to interrupt you. \u201cThey\u2019re already sending too much as it is. But sure, let\u2019s see what happens when I tell Claire I need a few days off because you\u2019re shacked up with me.\u201d  Her sugar coated mug coiled into a several chinned scowl as Becca can already hear The Princess\u2019s shrill, ceaseless yapping over anything and everything.  \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget about homework\u201d, you continue to make her turn away with work nausea, but cut off her obvious rebuttal. \u201cEven if we force Kate into being our note taker, you think it\u2019s fair that you get to lounge around here when she\u2019s doing all the work for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shows a little guilt at the idea you didn\u2019t even let her fully have, but her new quirk shifts the tone in a way you didn\u2019t expect. \u201cWell, what if you let Katie stay here too?\u201d  Your eyes slightly twitch with a cold limp stare as you try process this latest bit of madness that could only make the discovery of your new residents even worse. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t mind sharing you with my other favorite nerd\u201d, she giggles in that a little too snide to really mean exactly what she said way that has turned your arms into her personal punching bag before. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve already been doing for years at this point. And she really deserves an explanation on why you\u2019re such a moron too.\u201d You try to think about all the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t involve Kate like that at all, yet the only thing that comes out is a defeated \u201cY-yeah\u201d, to which the Tomboy gives a very knowing smug grin -- with a slight bitterness underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't like you all haven't slept-over with them before, even if Mom and your other friends started to suspect ulterior motives for inviting the girls over the older you all got. And this incredibly spacious High-Rise Penthouse has maybe over 15 rooms you don't really use between where your bed is, the bath, living room - okay, maybe you occasionally like looking at the view from the patio, wondered if you could have a nice BBQ with the outdoor kitchen and wouldn't mind having another dip in either the hot tub or spa pool with Becca and Kate; but that's not too extravagant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrist, who are you kidding? You're probably deeply indebted to the Masters for this likely several million dollar luxury flat that makes most of the other students living quarters look like hovels, and that's assuming this place isn't also some sort of shady creative book keeping on Mrs. Masters' part. Bunnie's joked that you could make mad cash renting pieces of \"The Dalton Suite\" out to the richest members of the student body, but you'd never do that to your gal pals. It's payment enough when they come over and make this gilded cage feel a little less lonely. And if potentially both of them stay here permanently, it wouldn't be so bad. Just two really lovely young women lazing about on their off time, wearing next to nothing because you inadvertently keep leaving around sets of cookies and other treats that they just couldn't help but graze on all the time. You certainly wouldn't judge them poorly for enjoying themselves. And if both of them got the crazy idea of taking a little not-so-skinny dipping float in the pool and just begged for their humble host to join you'd -- oh wow! NO! CJ, what the hell are you even thinking?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally shake some lewd thoughts involving both of your BFFs at once out of your head, <b>the puritan stick up your ass</b> wished to get some mutual silence from Becca on That Subject before you leave. \u201cHey\u2026could you please not talk about what we\u2019ve been doing --to other people that is.\u201d Her dreamy blue eyes flux from a mild annoyance to a subtle suspicion. \u201cC-jay\u201d, she inhales as she raises an auburn brow, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your weirdo status is now a forgone conclusion since yesterday.\u201d You clench your hands around not so firm shoulders as you nervously blurt out, \u201cI-I don\u2019t care what anyone else knows or says about me liking Fat Girls! My words were just for your ears only, Becca. Please don\u2019t tell anyone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe softball girl\u2019s chubby palm covered her mouth as Rebecca\u2019s gentle gaze desperately tried to hide the snickering you could easily hear. But when she raised her left to point next to you, all you could do was growl out an agitated groan to the suspicious smiles of the three maids, responding in their own ways with a mostly polite, \u201cHello, Master CJ.\u201d Your anger boils up as you frantically shout \u201cDON\u2019T ANY OF YOU SAY ANYTHING EITHER\u201d, to which they all give a stereotypical salute with their right, while hiding likely crossed left fingers around their ample backsides. \u201cWe promise, Master!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor C-Baby\u201d, Beccy lovingly quips, \u201cnothing ever goes his way in the end.\u201d You start to grumble as you storm off out the door, kicking over trollies in your way and feeling like an imbecile for ever telling her anything. \u201cAnd don\u2019t keep eating until you can\u2019t fit outside of my bedroom, Becca! You\u2019re going back to class real soon!\u201d You hear a faint \u201cNo promises on that, handsome~\u201d that only aggravates you further as you work your way to the shower. But an exited thumping quickly squeezes you from behind and almost makes you trip down the second story stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange pulling sensation around your legs turned out to be Sam. A little disheveled, heavier and sporting a very new, revealing window to exactly how her moderately sized breasts nestle into her welcoming belly; which swerves your head into an erratic U-turn back to the silver hand railing you now cling to for dear life as pools of sweat lubricate your goosebumps. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice Master CJ\u201d, her sporty nature follows a tender worshiping touch of all your dimensions that could compete with the Fan Club or even Claire\u2019s CJ obsession. But unlike most Dalton hunters, her wild jade eyes burned with an intense hazel sunburst, fully devoted to some transcendental aspect about you, instead of just raw animalistic lust exploding the moment you arrive. \u201cAfter I won the right to be Master\u2019s personal attendant for the day, you try and run away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that the ceiling is a lot closer than usual, it dawns on you that Sam is actually lifting you up in the air by your legs. The surprise loosens your grip enough for the plump servant to sling you across for an impromptu piggy-back, with Sam giving a very suggestive chuckle as you unintentionally clutch her folds. \u201cComfy?\u201d Full lips chide you for jostling about her bumpy ride as you bounce on dusky humps to a soak.  Unclean thoughts race through your blood and into your brain, she couldn\u2019t possibly be wanting to \u2013 y-you don\u2019t even know her! Your attempts to escape from her grasp become more desperate the closer you get to the wide curtain gateway, yet a titan like hold keeps you buried into your new retainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pretty little head, Master CJ\u201d, the maid proudly proclaims as she takes a moment to appreciate your gurgling lump before disrobing your shirt and underwear before you even knew they were off, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure both of us are nice and clean for all the fun we\u2019ll have today!\u201d Your hands cover your unmentionables while Sam shamelessly nudges you under the shower head. One last effort to avert this clumsily came out in an \u201cI can bathe myself just f-fine, Thank you!\u201d However, unfortunately for your dignity, her silhouette immediately flings the tattered dress to the winds, a lacy bra and garter casually thrown on top of the bar holding up the curtains and her bare curvy physique wobbles on over to turn on a burst of cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high-pitched squeal you give to the frosty downpour was swiftly 180ed to the cream colored wall tiles in front of you when it became evident that Sam really was going to shower with a stranger. Juicy thighs lowered delicate toes into the rising tides, she hummed a sweet nothing tune to herself while pulling the curtain behind and clearly making a yummy sound at the sight of you. The shroud of drips accentuates all of her movements while drowning out any outside noise. It's just you and the crazy girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Master?\u201d How in God\u2019s name can Sam say that in such a pure way as she lumbers on over and presses her warm belly all over your back?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stuttering to the contact from her fingertips feeds the servant\u2019s need to toy with you. \u201cStill a little groggy it seems\u201d, Sam murmurs into your neck as the temperature rises with her kneading the water across the pores of your chest and pudge. When her hands stop, draping themselves under your navel, the maid rests her double chin on your right deltoid, purring out \u201cDoes Master need special treatment to wake up for his piggy?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her movements were slow after that, with her flabby mitts hovering over gently before the touchy-feely subordinate made very ginger brushes across your shoulders. You didn\u2019t dare to look back and check what she was up to because \u2013 well\u2014you know. \u201cDid I take things too fast, Master? I\u2019m sorry; I\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a genuine sympathy to her tone, even if something cynical digesting inside you didn\u2019t trust the servant to be all that altruistic. And that unsettled feeling in the pit of your gut, immediately bore fruit when Sam\u2019s clingy digits began to pet deeper and deeper around you as she picked up something that what was hopefully just soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noticeably cold drip of oil and cream slid down your back and swiftly evaporated into the now cozy fog of the steam and Sam\u2019s lathering embrace. Their mixing fragrances couldn\u2019t hide her tittering as the slippery foam spread around, including onto her own jiggling mass as it pressed and stretched about you. \u201dSuch a messy boy\u2026\u201d, she teased lounging her bulk atop you and enjoying the way you wriggled in feebleness, unable to stop Sam\u2019s fingers from frolicking through your chunk, \u201cQuite frustrating I must admit, the more I try to figure out the right way to rub the genie out of the bottle, the more you trickle onto me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited breath huffing at the back of your neck; a sinister shiver runs through your nerves, you could sense her joyful primal moaning spell out her naughty thoughts; \u201cOh yes, I have a wonderfully Grinchy idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, would you mind if we scrubbed each other?\u201d she asked knowing full well you had little to no say in the matter. The laid-bare maid predicted your reflex to escape from the corner she\u2019s backed you into and easily locked your wrist under her large meaty armpit before proceeding to wash under your own. \u201cGeeze, you really are skittish!\u201d Sam said, snappily and now with her own playful pretense dropped. You could almost make out her still incredibly thick brown hair, slightly straitened by the constant downfall, touching the corner of your vision and face as she reads deeper into your clouded and confused countenance. \u201cI\u2019m impressed Master. I know this whole shy boy thing is an act, but you go above and beyond my ability to deceive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been a weird couple of days, and now as one of Claire\u2019s own servants insists to scrub you down, there isn\u2019t any time to question this MASTER what she\u2019s going on about. While you\u2019re lost in your thoughts, Sam decides to firmly grasp your arms and turn you around to \u201cwash that pretty boy face.\u201d Your pathetic best efforts at fighting this fate don\u2019t even make her clench down to keep you from slipping away, and to be honest, there were much more rotund issues slowly orbiting into view that you needed to cover your eyes for. With the last moments you had left you quickly hide your own shame, and slightly bend backwards while closing your eyes much to the girl\u2019s dismay. \u201cOh come now, there\u2019s no need to be self-conscious\u201d, Sam jests in a tone that suggests she\u2019s already seen the goods -- this possibility doesn\u2019t make you feel any more stress-free. She pats your still packed tummy and lowers her forehead next to yours, \u201cBig man like you ain\u2019t got a thing to be ashamed of for taking a little peak. If you open those handsome eyes of yours up and keep it quiet, I won\u2019t even tell Miss Masters what happens next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou question at the way she hints at why Sam would specifically break the rules for you \u2013 or even if there is some clause in which this whole situation Princess and her mother may have cooked up that could turn on its head. Sam\u2019s brawny brown body is dangerously close to your own now, there\u2019s no need for sight to feel her middle pushing up to smoosh your navel and her own together in a love lock, your belly buttons smooching together as much as you feel the frisky girl wants to make out this very moment. Sam\u2019s stomach vise is only getting tighter as the servant leans in closer, her hands cradling your chin and gently whispering \u201cPlease let me see your eyes, Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuh-uh, not going to happen \u2013 even if she\u2019s hot, Sam seems more interested in this \u201csensual\u201d shower than you ever could be in doing this. It just wouldn\u2019t be right\u2026right? She makes soft groans as she prods and pokes about your chest, tickling right around where you\u2019d be able to feel ribs, if you weren\u2019t getting so portly yourself. Sam grew intense the more you resisted, sucking her teeth before spitting out a low whining \u201ccome on~\u201d as you continue to stonewall her. The poking you could handle, but your plan couldn\u2019t withstand her dirtiest tactic yet of moving her digits back to your face and finally going in for a kiss, one that felt like it lasted an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d obviously had experience with this sort of thing, as her methodical, yet dainty circling of her own tongue, slips in for one electric jolt of your senses, than ducking out for a few minutes of traversing every corner of your mouth. Sam\u2019s pink lower lip never dried between the constant drizzle pouring over both of you and the intermingling body fluids traveling the tonsil river. CJ Dalton never thought himself anywhere close to an expert of kissing, I mean, you\u2019ve always been too embarrassed to even think about possibly dipping in further when any of your gal pals got in just a little too close to avoid mixed signals; however, at this moment something felt natural. You seemed to instantly pick up the rhythm of letting the dark skinned beauty take the lead, but unthinkingly followed suit on your own at times. You don\u2019t even know what a lip lock is, and yet here you are switching through a variety of techniques; complete closed, intertwining, and pouting with perfect lip posture like this isn\u2019t your first rodeo! (WHERE DID YOU EVEN LEARN WHAT THOSE POSITIONS WERE?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like a moron, you\u2019ve opened your eyes and are looking at Sam the servant\u2019s smug giggling smirk as it pulls out and teases your lips going for one last spit trade, only for her to dip around your Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cSee-\u201d, she says, beaming with a partial pride, but a look that still isn\u2019t satisfied with whatever the girl really wants from you, \u201cYou even kiss like Master. And I saw your moves on Miss Maglen\u2019s body earlier, worshiping her growing mass. All I need to hear is the right voice say <b>Sorry I kept you waiting</b> and I\u2019ll know it\u2019s the real deal.\u201d Her lashes lowered for a moment as Sam enjoyed mimicking that strange husky voice a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight pressure needles across your head as for whatever reason, her words weren\u2019t just confusing but giving you a headache. \u201cSam, what the hell do you want from me? Why do you keep calling me Master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant pulls her head back a little for you to notice how she\u2019s almost as tall as you, yet somehow a slight speck shorter. Thick curls twist with drips across her wild green irises as her neck shifts to the right. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the real you, silly. The guy I need to see again and will do anything for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words boomed about your head with a troubling echo, the idea that all these weird things you\u2019ve apparently been doing in your blackouts \u2013 they were the real CJ Dalton which you clearly aren\u2019t. You can\u2019t even deny that you aren\u2019t happy with what has recently happened with Rebecca, at least in some ways. And with how this near perfect stranger opens up to you, in this sort of situation, you are already too hoped up on hormones to think clearly about anything, let alone maintain the will power to not have something stand at attention now of all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Claire preach about you for days, but even the wildest rumors about CJ don\u2019t do justice to the Master I\u2019ve found. And even just a small taste\u2019s got me hooked on having even more of you.\u201d Yet the praising, enamored smile quickly fades as she notices how down you must obviously look, your head slightly pushing hers back as it begins to droop down. \u201cHey,\u201d she worryingly nudges you as you start to notice her heartbeat beating along with your own. \u201cIs something wrong? I\u2019ll back off if you aren\u2019t in the mood right now to p-\u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rapping at your bathroom door along with a muffled, yet clearly agitated yelling shocks Sam into a more sobering personality. \u201cShoot\u201d she yelps, along with a few other more overt expletives as she quickly pours water and scrubs your hair. \u201cJ-Just a minute, we\u2019re almost done!\u201d Whatever may be coming down your face is easily hidden by the rest of the water falling in swift dunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever could it be at the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whiplash from wet scrubbing to the dry rubbing of towels was so severe; you didn\u2019t know what was going on until Sam\u2019s panicked clean-up was over. Both of you were instantly draped and dry by the time Margaret\u2019s strict wobbling thighs shook their way over and gave the both of you a scrupulous eye. With most of her weight around her lower body, every step was another ripple across the redhead\u2019s fat inflated legs, with her shanks potentially already forming the basis of cankles and hidden knees; but with the lion\u2019s share of weight going to her glutes that were already dangerous enough to knock over or squeeze all over you as she got close. You were fighting the very idea to give a keen observation of how big she really was due to the severe carnivorous aura that jiggled around classy, yet powerful high heel talons clacking about the floor tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, whatever could have happed here\u2026I wonder\u201d, she flicked a lone fiery bang from her rectangular rimless glasses as Margie really leaned in on Sam, catching the fellow servant with her hand around the proverbial Doughboy Jar. The long strand rested around her plump double chin, but even with a corporate casual ribbon tie, Margaret rocked a kind of feathery several knotted back tie that made her deep crimson ends curl around her front while making an arguably adorable tail in the back. (Or shark\u2019s dorsal fin depending on how you looked at it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big-bellied girl scratched her still dripping brown locks mostly cocooned in a white towel bun as she pulled out an innocent face, \u201cJust helping Master take a nice hot shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelping Master take a shower?\u201d Margaret began to echo Sam in her frantic explanations as her heavy thighs sashayed around the room, both likely to intimidate her colleague and maybe to give you a quiet showing of her more pronounced attributes. The firebrand made an overblown performance of pondering while you were distracted by how the white trim of the Margaret\u2019s dress could barely contain the curvature of her hips, already broken in by her thick waistline and unable to do anything about her gelatinous ass but peacock about the maid\u2019s back shelf as a tantalizing tattered plumage that barely covered her lacey undergarments wobbling between plump cheek folds and fraying fishnet leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust, helping Master take a shower?\u201d she said again, this time leaving a pregnant pause as she turned to face the mirror and sink, making sure that she could look at both of you with a cynical smile; \u201cFunny, I only heard the water turn on once. Surely, our perfectly little Sam wouldn\u2019t have done anything untoward with our new Master.\u201d When she turned, you attempted to look away from completely ogling at how far her blue panties sunk into the fissure of her rump and other lewder aspects. Unfortunately for you, however, Margaret always seemed to know what position to display onto the vanity to drag your attention back onto the bottom-heavy Dom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh \u2013 well\u201d, Sam coughed and scratched her barely covered, three towel tied midriff trying to come up with a lie even she wasn\u2019t sure was possible. \u201cMaster\u2019s kind of an environmental baby and didn\u2019t want to waste water.\u201d The brunette tugged on your arm hard for you to affirm this, but even after you eventually gave a delayed and half-thinking nod of confirmation from out of your scattered focus, it was clear to all three of you that your role right now was a toy being fought over between two blimps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of this, Margaret shifted her lumbering axis around you and openly savored you sweating anxiously over how a slight inhale would possibly make contact with her folds. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be as thrilled as he should be, if you really have been acting as stupid as you look, and done what I\u2019ve think you\u2019ve done.\u201d Four eyes\u2019 vile snicker only angered Sam further with an air of repeated hostility you were all too familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off, Fifty-Shades-Of-Freak\u201d, somehow, Sam\u2019s round face pulled off a menacing glower, despite her already puffy jowls inflating out a little bit further and making you think of fugu for some reason; \u201cNothing bad happened and besides\u2026he didn\u2019t show up.\u201d Margaret apparently shared some of your confusion, but the peculiar wordless language through expressions the servants gave each other hinted that they were talking about that \u201creal\u201d you \u2013 and this subject was really starting to piss you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst thing that more cute girls were apparently that obsessed about you, but the change in how everyone is treating you as some ancillary limb to the actual imaginary person instead of just some turkey to be stuffed that made this all go from bad to worse. Ah, whatever \u2013 it\u2019s not like pissing and moaning about it anymore now will solve anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Redhead seemed shocked, however, you quickly wanted to go back to being uninvolved in the conversation when her interests turned towards your gurgling gut, uncomfortably protruding over the damp cloth you vigilantly had to hold up to make sure it didn\u2019t slip around your growing, overripe hips \u2013 or reveal anything other potentially embarrassing thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Sam\u2026if Sugar doesn\u2019t work\u201d, her red tinted nails unleashed a slightly painful, but not so violent slap to against your stomach, making it jiggle just enough for you to have some trouble keeping your towel up; \u201cmaybe spice will bring \u2018him\u2019 out.\u201d Sam\u2019s bountiful physique immediately bounced in front you; the protective instinct radiating from her crackling clenched fist was not as notable as her not so small backside and back fat rubbing up against your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Need another fat lip to know your place or do I gotta move onto your eyes, Marge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaiju battle of Corpulence between Shin Gutzilla and Queen Thighorah could be potentially destructive for this too costly to even imagine apartment - if their overripe features would ever let them actually successfully grapple to set off the fight that is. The fatties were struggling first to be able to trade blows, from Sam's gut smooshing into the slightly smaller mean girl's face to her own legs inadvertently trapping the belly bomb's as they try to figure out footing without further colliding their abundant bodies into odder positions. The two of them somehow managed to stay hostile no matter what resistance their crowded location and own forms gave them, and as their lardy bickering continued to jostle around, let's just say neither of the two heifers were going unnoticed by you bearing the brunt of every quivering ounce shaking and wobbling all over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod help you if they ever manage to twister themselves over and fall right on top of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two tubbies threatened one another, you noticed the doorknob between their two meaty flanks; immediately taking the chance to slip around this seemingly endless confrontation so you can make maybe the last period class if you hurry. However, they didn\u2019t seem to care, nor follow after you too quickly, despite how many waves you triggered in their collective chub from trying to tip-toe around Sam\u2019s position, with what felt like 7 pounds of crap hanging inside your stomach. Out the door and on the floor, you nervously laugh at the idea that you\u2019re seriously \u201cstealthily\u201d raiding your own wardrobe in fear that either that last of the trio of servants is just as crazy as the rest of them or Rebecca tries to cram her bulk into the door way to keep you from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's amazing how one day is making even your regular class life at this chubby laden 'paradise' now have degrees of sanity. What should be happening is maybe an uncomfortable amount of attention from Princess, a potentially romantically tense situation from your BBFs that you could stumble out of without breaking anyone's heart, a slightly shameful amount of weight being gained and maybe - just maybe - some peaceful learning could happen after you were chased by a wheezing fat mob in the span of a week tops. But most of this all happened in maybe the span of an hour, and your instincts are telling you its only going to escalate?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many ways can your weirdo buttons be pushed in one day and could your poor grasp of reality or heart survive it all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door back to your room, but what you found was \u2013 um \u2013 an interesting answer to this question to say the least?</span></div></div>",

The snow haired girl gave a wistful look at every drop she sacrificed into the burbling bikini-lined mound, longingly licking her lips as she occasionally stroked Rebby\u2019s tight middle. You weren\u2019t proud of the fact that you unfortunately had to suck in and wiggle around your pudge to zip yourself decent, putting on some black boxers and tight tan club shorts, but it made approaching the tall platinum blond maid a whole lot easier on the self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really need to do much but accidentally step on a carton for the hourglass bombshell to turn around and give you a very casual \u201cOh, hey man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a sinister looking situation, Christine doesn\u2019t really give off much of an air of menace. In fact, her warm smile and demeanor as she approaches you give the impression that this was more of a minor chore that she happened to get stuck with. One she\u2019d obviously like to ditch and shift her attention onto you if possible. \u201dYeah, I know what it looks like\u2026\u201d, her half curly and spike bob, half buzz cut kept clinging around her plump cheek bones no matter how many times she tried to fling or blow it out of her way, \u201cbut she ate herself this way until the girl hit a nice food nap \u2013 and then she wouldn\u2019t stop trying to crawl around like some obese zombie, mumbling about more. Quieted down when the funnel fed her some heavy cream though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right, Rebecca\u2019s sleep-eating. You instinctively slap your own head which makes the blond break out into a slow, drawl like laugh which sends a pleasant shake across her chest until she catches herself and course corrects her tone. \u201cYep, that\u2019s where I was a while ago too, but now that you\u2019re here-\u201d, she was close enough to notice maybe the inch or two Christine had over you, widening the dimpled Cheshire grin on her face, \u201c-would you be a real gent and feed me a little to me too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze instinctively droops down to her moderate belly pushing against her loosely buttoned and laced black bodice; but squished under the possible back straining weight of her very large, yet firm breasts and hips that could compete with Margie if she had to same ass width: specifically the size of a water melon. Christine's bronzed, shapely legs held a few faded stretch marks and scar tissue, the latter of which specifically were found around casually bare feet that wrapped one heavy thigh about your own. Her chubby hands squish your cheeks and heats up your already flushed face as she pushes you in a little further into her waist, \u201cSee how small and pitiful my poor tummy is? I promise I won\u2019t keep you too long, just a little of your love would be wonderful in there.\u201d Dumbfounded, you watch her drop down and cozy up to a beached and jiggling Becca, snagging the cone and planting it between her lips with an eager pleading gaze begging you to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure, if that\u2019s what you want, Christine\u201d you shyly obey her whims, grabbing the nearest carton of what seems to be extra milk-fat saturated Heavy Whipping Cream produced by some weird company that started with a Y. Honestly, whoever made whatever chunky, white substance you channeled into the blonde wasn\u2019t as important as the spectacle she made out of steadily inhaling it all down, happily moaning and patting her stomach as it stretched out further, yet nowhere near the current hypnotic girth of Becky\u2019s minor ocean of a belly. The ecstasy of eating in itself set the hourglass off in ways maybe not even Ol\u2019 Claire reached, with her rotund arms exploring her tautness and playing with all excess that became even more gluttonous little Chrissy. And when it finally emptied into her, Christine curled on the bed like a satisfied obese cat, fat toes and fingers tugging at the sheets, apparently enjoying the sheer pressure her new contents filled her with. \u201cOhh\u2026HURP! Thanks, Boss. That really hit the spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure whether the girl was more of a shameless foodie than another contender for the Drive CJ Dalton Crazy game everyone at this school loves to play, but when the eager eater tugs your right down and gently influences your tips to cradle her breast before you yank it back, her yearning smile sends chills down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for those same pleading browns to hit you with a look that said \u201cTake Me! Right here, right now!\u201d and \u2013 no, NO! You don\u2019t have time for this! Yeah, she\u2019s hot as hell, b-but come on. Right there with Becca too?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I gotta go - like, right now\u201d you rush a red shirt over your head and struggle to find your shoes, inadvertently agreeing to continuing your session with Christine so long as she lets you go NOW.

Another clear violation of not only generally known Chubbeso rules yet again, but now going over the line of the promised \u2018safe spaces\u2019 Princess set up after the siege of your original dorm was half the reason they locked you away in this tower: to send a clear message that CJ was off limits. Oh, sorry, what they officially stated said was \u201cTo encourage proper respect of different students.\u201d Of course, she also used that incident to kick the rest of her co-founders out, seize total control of the club and started to gently remind you that you were always welcome to move in with her \u2013 but you thought you were at least done with this nonsense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one, Porky\u201d, the red head praised you with her fork tongue and a slap of your own pesterer, \u201cMaybe there is hope for you yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be your usual bitchy self to Master, this is serious\u201d Sam punches Margie in the arm, sending a small current of waves between their flesh that crashes and ripples all about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d the firebrand huffs out as she leans her head on your shoulder, \u201cOkay \u2018Master\u2019, who\u2019s going to deal with the trash?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Mina Kawasaki had her huge gut wedged in a doorframe and by the looks of it she was stuck pretty tight in their. \"Stuck again Mrs. Kawasaki\"? You said in annoyed tone. \"I'm not playing around Mr.Dalton\"! She said in a strict voice. Mina is the most serious teacher in the entire school, she's so serious that some call her the \"iron gut\". She was so serious to everyone around her weather its friends or students and staff. She was even serious with herself she always wore tight clothing which only hugs her gigantic body and looks like its about to burst at any moment. However she is never as strict with you as she with everyone else. Usually if a person is late to her class by a second after the bell rings she'd give that person detention. But in your case she just gives a warning not to be late again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we help you out, you give us detention right\"? You asked. \"Of course not this does not count for being late\". She said in a more calmer tone. \"Alright come guys lets see if we can get her out of there\". You said. Then Kate grabbed one arm, you and Rebecca grabbed the other and pulled as hard as you could. \"Man she's wedged in there tight\". Rebecca said while pulling as with all her might. After a few minutes of pulling and Kate running out of energy a few times you managed to get Mrs. Kawasaki free. Of course as soon as she got free, she lost her balance and fell but you were there to cushion the fall literally. \"Thanks for breaking my fall Mr. Dalton\". She said trying to get up. \"Don't mention it now can you please get off of me\". You struggled to say due to her weight crushing your body. After she got up the group continued to homeroom and made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she did role call the announcements were started which were the same as usual but near the end there was an extra announcement. \"Just a reminder to everyone that today is club tryout day\". \"Which means everyone explores the school and finds a club, team, or activity your are interested in and sign up that's all\". Said the speaker. \"This should be interesting\". You thought to yourself. You kept in mind that there are two clubs you should avoid the swim team because chris hates your guts, and your fanclub for obvious reasons. \"Hey CJ why don't we all join a club together\". Rebecca whispered. \"Even Clarie, by the way where is she\"? You said curiously. \"She was running a bit behind schedule but she said she'd catch up with us shortly..and yes the royal hippo can join with us\". She said reluctantly. \"This will be fun\". Kate said in realy quiet voice. After homeroom you and your friends left to find a club to join. But which one?</span></div></div>",

Being the first day of the second semester, Winter Clubs were open for recruitment and Summer Clubs were closing. As such, both second period and half of third had been cancelled so that students could walk around the school and weigh the options regarding which of the many clubs offered they would like to join. Of course you were no exception, having the only guy in school on a team or in a club was a strange honor in a way! So with that, all of your teachers had strongly encouraged you to pick something worthwhile and fulfilling. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to catch your eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMainly you were just doing this because you had to. Being part of the \"Going Home Club\" since early childhood, you weren't that into club activities. But more importantly, you were doing this in hopes of getting to spend more time with your friends; and hopefully make some new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, making new \"friends\" didn't seem like it was going to be a real option...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET GO!!\" a chubby brunette shouted as she tugged at your arm, \"CJ's joining the Photography Club!!\" on the opposite side, a bulky blond tugged at your other appendage, \"No! He's joining the Volleyball team!\" you couldn't do much other than just stand there, not much hope of getting out of this hold. Besides, Rebecca was coming to the resuce just like always. She tugged at your middle and used her superior bulk to yank you away from the two feuding fatties, \"Alright, break it up, break it up!\" she said sternly. \"You alright, CJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you made my shoulders pop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good, next time don't dawdle.\" she giggled as she pushed you in the right direction, slapping you on the butt to hurry you up. \"So, have any time while you were in there to think about what club you want us to join?\" she said cheerfully. \"No... and I'm really just thinking about giving up on the whole \"club\" thing and just going back to my flat...\" Becca smiled, \"Oh come on CJ, don't be that way, besides I think we've found one that you'll really enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her round face, her long brown hair framing those chubby cheeks of hers that bunched up as she smiled at you, \"Really, like what?\" you ask somewhat meekly, hope rising ever so slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see in a sec, come on, I left Kate there so I would see it again.\"<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Hey Hey, it's CJ Dalton!\" a familiar voice calls to you, instantly you recognize it as the bringer of glorious food, the one who gives you all those delicious meals when it comes lunch time. \"Bunnie!\" you shout back, rushing up to give her a quick fist pump, \"What's up, you running a cooking club this semester?\" you ask casually<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" she says energetically, her rounded face bearing a big smile like always, \"Me and Ms. Telleri got approval to co-sponsor, so we're hoping for a big turnout- and with you signed up we'll be sure to get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you in by sliding back into the wide doorway, her humongous boobs still making a bit of an obstacle of themselves as you try to avoid headbutting her cleavage. And surprisingly, taking in the overall obesity that engulfed the student body (or bodies), and all the delicious goodies laid out, Kate and an unfamiliar (though quite rotund) woman were the only two people in the classroom! \"Yeah, sad, huh?\" Bunnie said solemnly, \"You'd think with how great my food is and how popular Ms. Telleri is, we'd have a way better turnout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd really think so!\" Rebbecca said as she made her way over to the confection table, \"I know your stuff is good Ms. Telleri, why wouldn't anyone sign up?!\" she turned to her teacher, who sighed through her cupcake, \"The Culinary Arts are so underappreciated...\" she said quietly as she eyed her cupcake in a Hamlet-esque fashion before devouring the poor pastry. \"So, what do you say CJ?\" Bunnie jumped in front of you, \"Ya wanna join my club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, yeah!\" is all you can say, how could you turn down your good ol' buddy Bunnie in her hour of need?! \"So long as this doesn't interfere with our Game Night!\" </span></div></div>",

You finally make it through the school day, and enter the club\u2019s room. Bunnie Blake is already there and from the looks of it she\u2019s had quite the head start for the club preparing a lot of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey CJ thanks so much for coming, please have as much as you want.\u201d she says smiling intently. She happily watches as you chew down on one of your favorite baked goods of hers, those creamy Chocolate \u00c9clairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelicious\u201d you say breathlessly finishing one of the rather large pastries and quickly helping yourself to a second. Bunnie returns your smile, serenely content watching you stuff yourself on her baked goods. If fact if you didn\u2019t know any better you would think that she\u2019d been trying to fatten you up since your first day here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think those are good you haven\u2019t tried anything yet.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice suddenly cuts in sharply as the rest of her immediately enters the room, followed by a gaggle of girls, including Rebbecca and Kate with Mrs. Telleri bringing up the rear end of the group. Claire promptly walks up to you and holds up a tray full of the gooey chocolate brownies. \u201cI made these today in cooking class of course with a little help from Mrs, Telleri! I know you\u2019ll simply love them CJ!\u201d She throws a knowing wink at Mrs.Telleri. Trying one you find the chocolate brownies are surprisingly good, additively good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it seems everyone is ready!\" Said Mrs. Telleri. \u201cBut before the club can official begins, we need to elect a club representative. Any suggestions?\u201d she asks the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI elect Claire!\u201d a girl\u2019s voice calls from the group, and a round of cheers and aye\u2019s go up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny objections  Claire?\u201d asks Bunnie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo mam\u201d Claire answered pristine, ravishing any chance to be the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club continues normally from there, with the caring Bunnie showing her passion for cooking as well as some of her best tricks of the trade. Bunnie concluded the club session for the day by showing in great detail how to make her famous lasagna baked just right, handing around platefuls for the club to sample. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cVery good everyone!\u201d Mrs.Telleri and I are look forward to seeing everyone's results at the next meeting.\u201d she said happily, and you\u2019re happy for her too now that the club has come off as big success.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Miss Blake\u2026\u201d said Claire impatiently raising her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026yes Claire?\u201d Bunnie asked pointing a finger to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think we should have an official taste tester don\u2019t you?  I know every <i>good</i> cooking club has one\u201d. Claire said using her new club head status to already throw her weight around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Bunnie who definitely wanted to be a good cooking club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! And I know just the person to elect for the position, CJ Dalton!  All in favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheer of \u201cAye\u201d fills the classroom. You\u2019re surprised to see even Kate and Bunny has their hands raised!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Bunnie said now fully understanding what Christine had in mind. \u201cWhat a splendid idea, but you know we can\u2019t f<i>orce</i> him to be taste tester for all of our food.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwwww!\u201d moaned the crow of girls unanimously disappointingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, do you want the position?\u201d  Bunnie asks eagerly awaiting your response. Her eyes tell you that it would be doing her a big favor if you were a regular, and you\u2019d be bringing in even more supporters to her club.  Thinking about it Bunnie Blake was one of the nicest people at the whole school and you'd love to help her out, but on the other hand whoever had the job would defiantly be putting on some weight as a result, not that you would really mind, but maybe it was a task better suited for someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you make up your mind and say...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the start of the next cooking club meeting you notice there seems to be even more members. No doubt word of your accepting the position of taste tester convinced a few girls on the fence to join in. The possibility that these girls accepted the old maxim about the way to man's heart had already occurred to you, and during the school day a particularly devious idea had come to you. Perhaps there was a way to turn this to your advantage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then!\u201d Bunnie said, bringing the chatter to a halt, \u201cWhy don't we start our meeting with a simple little cook-off? Unofficial, of course, there's nothing at stake here. But it will give those of you who don't take cooking a chance to familiarize yourself with the kitchen and its materials.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Bunnie's direction the club members were divided into pairs \u2013 you being put with Claire \u2013 and the students were let loose to come up with whatever creation they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no shortage of possibilities: even for a cooking classroom the fridges and pantries were well-stocked, and the different pairings came up with a variety of dishes including appetizers, entrees and desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire decided on something simple, Hershey's Kisses wrapped up in balls of dough and baked. At first you were confused why she wasn't trying something a little more... show-offy, but less than half an hour later you understood her game. While all the other pairs were still working on their dishes, Claire's was finished, which meant it was time for you, as taste-tester, to do your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were good. Nothing spectacular, but good nonetheless. And as you sat there, making small talk with Claire, you ended up eating over half the batch of desserts. More than necessary as taste-tester, but as Claire's devious smile told you upon realizing this she couldn't have you sitting around for an hour waiting for something to eat, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bunnie called all the pairs together to display their dishes, there were more than a few evil eyes directed at Claire, a sign of things to come. The other students gathered around you two in a circle, the desk you were sitting at filled with dishes ranging from the impressive to the elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, CJ.\u201d Bunnie began. \u201cIt's your first time as taste tester. Make sure to get a couple good bites of each dish, and consider your remarks carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to suppress a grin at that last part. Of course you'd be careful with your words. Your plan, the plan you came up with earlier, hinged on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with the dish right in front of you, a shrimp po' boy. As you take a large bite and chew it you scan the faces of the women around you, noticing a couple tense and excited. Clearly the ones who prepared this dish. You recognized them from your fan club, but they didn't stand out in any special way. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food's not bad. The mustard they put on it was a bit watery, but that was the only real criticism you could think of. But what you say is<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's really good.\u201d And you give the two a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another couple bites before putting it down, making an act of savoring it. A few of the other girls shoot quick looks at the two, jealousy mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had seen Kate and Rebecca working on a Cornish game hen, so you pass that over and grab a plate of cannoli. Again you can identify its cooks as the two girls that tense up as you take your first bite and consider your impression. Again they're in your fan club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit too sweet. Custard filling is a bit simple, don't you think? I understand in Italy they use ricotta. I would have been interested in sampling that. Would have been more daring to try that. The pastry part isn't bad, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls are heart-broken, and those around them turn a little smug. You swallow the first bite and then put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is a spinach-and-mushroom omelet, sour cream slathered on top. You go out of your way to moan with your first bite, then shovel in a couple more bites. The duo that prepared this are beaming, the previous couple turning frigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it goes. All the food is pretty good, at the very least, but you single out a couple dishes as weak or unimaginative, while praising others as particularly exquisite. As you do so, you can see pairs of girls getting smug or gloomy, the seeds of discord being sprinkled among your fan club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is exactly what you want. Sow some division among your fan club, make them treat this as a competition, one against another, and maybe (just maybe) you won't get surged by a bunch of obese girls while going to and from class. It would be easier to avoid them in ones and twos rather than groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if some of the girls decided to get better at cooking, trying to win your favor... Well, that wouldn't be too bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the meeting there's a pretty good divide between the happy girls and the dejected girls, and it's clear more than a few were turning their frustration against one another. You hope there won't be any truly cross feelings after this, but you are satisfied your plan went so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meeting adjourns you hang back, ostensibly to help Bunnie and Mrs. Telleri clean up but really you want to grab several of the treats left behind because you didn't get your fill when you were pretending to be disappointed in them. Adjusting the waist of your pants, you notice your belly poking out. But it doesn't dissuade you from polishing off a couple of the dishes. Food this good shouldn't go to waste.</span></div></div>",

The warm full feeling settled at the base of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far away, however, you spotted Rebecca, waiting for you. You felt a tad guilty for bashing her Cornish game hen, but, then again, that was part of his scheme. So why waste too much sleep over it.

She was an old friend, one of the few people here you didn't just get along with but genuinely liked. It wasn't fair to make her an unwitting pawn in your scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d you say. Wanting to make sure there aren't any fan club members hiding around and eavesdropping, you lead Rebecca down one hallway, then a second, and then into an empty classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d you begin, \u201cI know 'Let me explain' is a really cliched way to start things, but if you hear me out this will make sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth is I liked your hen. Loved it, actually. I finished the whole thing after everyone had left, it was one of the best dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's mood brightened like a light switch had been turned on, but before she can respond you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I had to say it was bad because it was part of a... well, a scheme I'm pulling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElation turns to confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll those girls in the cooking club joined just because I did. It's not arrogance, it's just a fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Rebecca said, a little anger seasoning her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like how they're all in that 'fan club' devoted to me, and how they all get together to hunt me down and gang up on me when I'm trying to get to or from class. But what I realized earlier today is this is the perfect opportunity! They all work together to chase after me, but in the cooking club they're suddenly competing with one another, each trying to make the best dish to curry me favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca arches an eyebrow, a dawning realization can be read in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much all the dishes were good, but if I said that each girl would carry on thinking they in particular had a chance with me. So instead I mixed it up, tearing down a few dishes so not only were some girls happy I liked their food, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other girls got jealous!\u201d Rebecca finished for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. And if I can turn the fan club girls against one another, it'll make my life easier when I'm out and about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why did you say my food wasn't good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Truth was you had gotten into the swing of switching between praise and criticism, and you had forgotten the Cornish hen was hers. But there was no reason to be completely honest right now, so you say \u201cBecause most of the girls here already hate you for being so close to me. I didn't want to give them a fresh reason to zero in on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to satisfy Rebecca, and you relax as the tension dissipates and she goes back to her usual cheerful demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really glad to hear that, CJ. I worked hard on that dish knowing you'd be the one to taste it. And don't worry about badmouthing my cooking in the future; from now on I'm going to hang back and make sure you eat every bite of what I make you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can't help but detect something a little... wicked in her tone. Was Claire rubbing off on Rebecca? Was she planning to fatten you up, too?</span></div></div>",

No one with cameras taking photos of your butt, no girls attempting to grope you from behind. Just the usual traffic in the halls. Nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your plan is working,\" Rebecca mumbled, \"It looks like the girls are after each other now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed. You watched as some girls who you criticized were mocked loudly by the girls you gave top marks to. The victims turned the tables later on by pulling pranks, from the mundane to the serious, on the \"victors\" of their quest. One girl found her chair coated in peanut butter, another had gum snapped in their locks, and yet another--perhaps the strangest of all--found fan-art of a show she hated plastered to her desk in English class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was part of the game. This was to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooking class came and went, and you decided to spice things up a bit. You told different people different things, though you ended up eating almost everything by the end. Rebecca's dish was amazing, and, as you ate it, you decided to give her a middle of the road opinion. Rebecca looked at you with that semi-mischievous glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, she lingered. \"Do you need help cleaning up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. \"Well, I should be okay--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a forkful of her dish--a seven-layer cake--and pushed it through your lips. The delicious flavor returned. \"Like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and accepted another forkful. Then another. By the time you were done, the whole cake had disappeared into your full belly. She patted your bulge, satisfied before pinching your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did.\" She walked out, but not before tickling your overstuffed belly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In what seemed like less than two sentences spoken between you two, tonight's dinner had finished cooking and was primed for your satiation! A loud '<i>ding</i>' and the smell of a warm meat lover's special forces both of your heads to turn slowly towards the oven, a shared look of gluttonous need for satisfaction in your eyes and a unanimous grumbling of greedy bellies. While nowhere near fat yet, your appetite certainly had expanded since the last semester. It wasn't but six months ago that you were splitting a pizza with Rebecca when she found out you had enrolled and you could barely finish your half! But now, an entire course in cooking and half a school year of Bunnie's cooking later, you were right up to speed with your chubby brunette buddy... almost. So, as the most mobile, it was your job to grab the oven mitts and remove the twin pairs of pizza left in the oven to cook and serve both yourself and Rebecca. \"Ugh, can't move.\" the flabby lump on your couch feigned weakness, \"Still too stuffed from saving you in Cooking Club.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already getting up, you don't have to make me feel bad about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggled, \"Yeah, but if I didn't where would be the fun in eating all your pizza?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise from the couch rolling your eyes, Rebecca had always been like this; lazy but hungry. \"Whatever, you want the soft crust or the-\" she cut you off, \"You still have to ask; you <b>know</b> I want the crust with the cheese inside!\" you can't help but laugh; you actually kinda wanted to try that cheesy crust for once. You walk over to the oven -one of relative luxury thanks to the generous Masters Family who furbished the dorms- slip on Rebecca's oven mitts, grab both pizzas and place them on serving platters. In fact, you never really noticed that since enrolling into Chubbeso Academy your servings had slowly gotten larger and larger... when exactly did you start getting a whole pie to yourself? Anyway, that didn't matter. You carefully balance both platters and walk back over to the living room section of the flat, handing Rebecca her favorite combination of pizza and platter as you plopped back down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... you sure do cook a mean pizza, CJ Dalton.\" she says, removing a single slice of the pre-cut pie and slowly dropping it into her mouth from above, \"Always have, ever since we were kids.\" after deciding she had a relatively adequate sized amount in her mouth, Rebecca bit off her chunk and chewed slowly- her cheeks rolling with every mastication and lower chins quivering as she sensually enjoyed her meal. In no time, her first piece is gone and she is working on her second, reclining back lazily on the sofa and allowing her big billowing belly to push the hem of her shirt up a bit. As she chewed, the already stuffed taut tummy from earlier today churns and makes slight groans in protest of adding any more weight to its burden, but Rebecca's chubby hand falls down to massage the fleshy dome and rid it of discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, you were juggling trying to keep your eyes on the television and eating your pizza; the wriggling fat girl beside you was a bit of a distraction. That was something else that you'd noticed since enrolling: had Rebecca gotten even bigger? Than before, that is. She was always pretty heavyset, as the earlier trip down memory lane suggested, she had been quite the plumper when she was a child. And granted, as she grew older she grew significantly heavier. But back in middle school, when she got really into softball, she managed to keep a steady pace- even slim <i>down</i> a bit before joining Chubbeso Academy. But now that you look her over... it seemed like she had gained at least 50 pounds since your freshman year began! Was that normal?! Well... considering that you'd gained quite a bit of weight since enrolling yourself... and she <i>did</i> eat a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't explain Kate's rapid weight gain either. When you all were kids, Kate had been <i>lighter</i> than Becca! Granted she never really got into sports as much as your tomboy friend did and was always just as pudgy, but she still managed to just teeter on the edge of fat and obesity for a good portion of the time you had known her. Now she was the heaviest of your little group (royalty excluded of course) and seemed to eat just as much as you and Becca! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey, Becca?\" you ask in a concerned tone, interrupting your friend's pizza euphoria as she glutted herself. \"Mmph... yeah?\" she asks through a mouthful of masticated sauce, cheese, and dough...</span></div></div>",

I mean, we aren't as bloated as that stupid princess or anything, but, still, my uniform had to be replaced four or five times...and it looks like I'm due for another soon.\" Becca patted her jiggly gut with her pudgy fingers, pressing into it with a mingled look of mild satisfaction and self-disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, did you notice how fast you've gained in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? How did you--I mean, have you been tracking my girth or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just that I haven't really needed to replace my uniform since enrolling,\" you reply, only for Becca to awkwardly poke your middle, her finger sinking past the first knuckle.

For a moment, your chest was bare, and Becca stared perplexed at it, blush filling her cheeks. However, after pulling the shirt over your belly, she snapped out of it. You felt a little curious. Did she like what she saw? You almost could see her inching toward you, as slowly as possible, her thick fingers tense. Did she want to hold you right then and there?

Maybe it was finally time to  be something more than friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is blank now, you're still staring at Rebecca. Time to make a move... but before you had a chance, Rebecca was already kissing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were surprised that Rebecca made such a sudden move, but then you embraced her as well. You had loved her for years, and were to shy to admit it, maybe she was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been always attracted to Rebecca for years. That adorable belly that she had was a big turn on for you, and you wouldn't mind seeing it grow. At the same time you think Rebecca wouldn't mind  to see you grow a little (a lot) too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make out, you caress her bulbous belly with great pleasure, squeezing, pinching, rubbing, it just felt so good. You move your tongue around her mouth and you  realize now how much you love Rebecca.

You knew she wanted to fatten you up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was the first one to break up the kiss. You look at her confused, like she had did it for no reason, but then she gestured at the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ I know you like fat girls, admit it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blushing heavily, \"I--I--I do...\" she had figured out your darkest secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me into the biggest girl you've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a huge offer, literally, and you were blushing so much, but you like big girls... You agree and get ready to feed her the remaining pizza as well as all of the cakes, ice cream, pies she had  in her kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lies down on the couch, her belly out stretched, just waiting for you to fatten it up You grab a slice of pizza and fed her the entire slice at once! She had downed it pretty easily and was ready for the next slice. Rebecca groaned in arousal as she ate every slice of pizza until they were all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are getting a cake from the Kitchen, Rebecca stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast there skin and bones it's your turn\" she elbows you. You knew it! She did want to fatten you up! You were so excited right now and you lay down on the couch awaiting your share of the banquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had grabbed three cakes! You were not sure if you could down them all, but you were determined to prove yourself to be worthy to Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had began feeding you the cake, a slice at a time! She gave you time to chew and the cakes were so good, Rebecca was such a good cook! Her eyes as she fed you were gorgeous, they sparkled with love and lust. Occasionally she would pat your belly between slices, before you knew it they were gone! You didn't even feel full either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the rest of the night you and Rebecca fed each other, until eventually everything from the kitchen was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The evening began with her on the far end of the sofa, you on the right and her on the left as always. However, she slowly managed to wriggle herself closer and closer to your seat on the couch through her shifting. She was so close, in fact, that you could smell the perfume she insisted on using. Not that her apartment reeked of it or anything, it was just that the fruity flagrance was thicker in the atmosphere. And considering how much of one cushion Rebecca's steadily inflating bottom seemed to envelope (a whole one to itself), that there were only three cushions on the couch, and that there was one with a Becca-sized imprint on it left untouched on the other side of the couch, it stood to reason that she had slowly been getting closer and closer to you! The only real question is... why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a prank? Was she going to smear hot pizza grease on your countenance and call you Pizza Face? Maybe hit you in the arm really <i>really</i> hard? No, those were all childish things that Rebecca... might do. But not after she had just gotten done stuffing herself. She was always really calm after she finished eating; always has been. So, that in mind, what could it have been? Was something wrong with her? Some boy problems maybe? Crap, you didn't really want to be here for that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a pressure overtook your lap as Rebecca lay her head down on your thighs; her long auburn hair brushing up against your steadily growing potbelly. Your portly companion struggled to maneuver her own bulk into a comfortable position and sigh heavily as she finally nestled into a CJ-cushioned recline. Her bright blue eyes looked up at you warmly and her cheeks grew a little rosier. \"Ooh, getting soft down here, huh CJ?\" she teased, \"Spending a little too much time with her Royal Heifferness?\" she poked your soft belly with a protruding and much softer finger. You stifled a giggle; your stomach was a little known ticklish point on your body. With an eyebrow raised you questioned the enigma that was Rebecca and her strange behavior as it plopped itself atop your lap like a present awaiting to be opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large stomach, billowing down and out as it struggled to stand on its own lack of foundation, spread wide and spilled off of the end of the couch; its fleshy contours rolling, rising slightly as she took each labored breath. Her round, innocent face beamed positivity and security as she looked at you and smiled, you could feel her putting more and more pressure down on your lap as she played with you innocently. Flirting? No. That was never really a part of you and Rebecca. It definitely wasn't flirting. She lay one soft arm on top of her belly and massaged it lazily, \"Ugh, I've gotta cut back on all that greasy food.\" she lied, \"It really makes my stomach ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" you stammer incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Becky plus food does <i>not</i> lead to a pleasant tangent.\" she joked, raising the hem of her t-shirt with one plump finger and exposing a vast savannah of creamy white belly flesh. \"Maybe you could...

It all made sense now; how could you have been so blindly foolish?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Kawasaki's homework!! you shouted aloud, rising to your feet hurriedly and knocking the squishy girl to the floor, \"Oh crap, I've got so much Trig homework to do tonight!\" you fret, only now noticing that you had knocked your best friend into the floor. \"Oh, sorry Becca!\" you quickly fall down to the floor and heave the poor girl up, \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine...\" she says dourly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I gotta go get this done before I start failing on my first day back!\" You shout as you head out the door, \"Later Beck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later...\" she laments as you rush out the door, one of her hands falling down to her stomach as she rubbed it in lament. \"Same old CJ.\" she said nostalgically, \"Same old oblivious-as-all get out CJ... Damn, I almost had it this time too... oh well. Gotta keep up this girlish figure!\" Becca said resoundingly as she headed over to the freezer...</i></i></span></div></div>",

So against your still waking bodies will, you get dressed, and slowly trudge into the academy.  Once there you\u2019re rewarded by the sight of an empty hallway, well mostly empty. Overjoyed you see Rebecca (with rather clean looking hair and thoroughly tub-soaked skin) was had heading your way, along with the adorably cute Kate bouncing along beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2019morning\u201d you greet them still sluggish from waking up so early. \u201cMan, that was some hard homework last night huh?\u201d Digging into your backpack you pull out the crumpled piece of paper that was now your trigonometry homework. The two stare at it for a second before speaking. \u201cCJ, diiid you do this by hand?\u201d Kate asks giving you a puzzled look. \u201cYeah,why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026You were supposed to use a graphing calculator\u201d Rebecca exclaims, her explanatory tone adding a \u201cyou dummy\u201d to the end of her sentence. She swung her backpack off of her meaty shoulders and retrieves her own tidy looking sheet of homework. \u201cI\u2019ll let you uh, \u201cstudy\u201d mine before you turn it in, but just this once.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca that\u2019s cheat-\u201d Kate suddenly interjected before Rebecca gave her a soft elbow to the well padded ribs, \u201cOoof! Hey! Becca what was tha-Ohhh~\u201d Kate suddenly clams up into a mischievous dimple filled grin as she lets Rebecca work her mojo on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rebecca extended the answer filled papers to you, and you went to take them, when Rebecca quickly yanked them away. \u201cBut...You owe me one\u201d she adds as a devilish smile now crossed her face confident that you were at her mercy. Your gaze drifts from her smile to her piercing blue eyes, and finally down to the papers, noting that her strong softball throwing arm still looked like it held plenty of muscle underneath its pudge. Well, what choice did you have? Your math grade really needs the boost. \u201cOkay, sure, yeah.\u201d You answer quickly,if you were going <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">to copy</span> to study from Rebecca\u2019s homework then you had better do it quickly before Ms.Kawasaki arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rebecca says releasing her iron tight grip, \u201chere ya go, just remember you owe me one...\u201d  Grateful for your awesome friends; you dashed into the bathroom one of the few Fan Club \u201csafety zones.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the duo continued their gossiping as they headed to breakfast.  \u201cYeah I know C.J. could use an A on at least  one assignment. I mean, I only knew how to do this stuff  because you taught me.\u201d Rebbecca said complimenting the ever studious Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was tutoring. What you did, well it\u2019s still kinda cheating.\u201d Kate said crossing her ample arms underneath her full bosom into an \"I'm mildly disappointed in you\" pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shrugged, \u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s just once. Plus it\u2019ll be worth it for what I have planned tonight\u2026 \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d asked Kate immediately dropping her pose,eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe owes me one right?\u201d she hinted with a wink. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not even the best part...Wait let me start over\u2026Okay, so after cooking club, I finally worked up the courage to invite CJ over\u2026you know alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Kate shouted excitedly, leaning in and now hanging on Rebecca\u2019s every word. \u201cYep\u201d Rebecca giggled in confirmation. \u201cSo, we make some pizzas, and then we were both lying on the couch. You should have seen him, that cute little soft paunch he\u2019s grown plopped right on his lap.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah~\u201d Kate eyes momentarily glazed over at this dreamy image of C.J. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m thinking to myself, Now\u2019s your chance Becca! CJ\u2019s been clueless for so long about your feelings for him, you gotta \u2018Swing the bat\u2019 and make your move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right\u201d Kate  said nodding along, even deeper entranced by the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026I slowly slink over to him\u2026and then, I put my head down on his lap\u2026\u201d Rebecca continued, thriving off her friend\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Kate gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes way!\u201d  Rebecca said sending them both into a fit of school girl giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Then what?\u201d Kate asked after they stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Oh\u2026Well, then he had to get up and go, or whatever. But I was <i>this </i>close! I could feel it! That's why I\u2019m going to ask him over again after cooking club today, and he'll have to come, you know, since he owes me big time. And this time I\u2019ll make <u>sure</u> he knows just how I feel.\u201d Rebecca said her blue eyes shining determinedly. (What Rebecca hadn\u2019t known is that you\u2019d probably gone over to her house anyways if she\u2019d just asked, but she wasn\u2019t taking any chance today. Her heart was really set on this.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nodded knowing Rebecca was the type that did not give up on anything easily and she'd thought up of a plan so quickly\u2026Wait a minute! How exactly did Kate feel about this tumultuous turn of events? (At least for this the rest of <u>this</u> story branch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate is\u2026</span></div></div>",

As soon as she took a seat (well two stools) at her cooking station her face stretches into a wide dimple filled grin. The two girls sitting on her opposite sides leaned in closer as Claire went over her plan to make sure Rebecca\u2019s plans for you this afternoon didn\u2019t happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, everyone understands the plan right?\u201d Claire asked. \u201c<i>We</i> leave, and leave <i>them </i>stuck here\u2026\u201d the girls nodded in agreement. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that little sneak get her hands on my-err-our C.J\u201d the girls nodded in agreement again and went back to their stations, looking as casual and inconspicuous as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Ahem</b> Prof. Telleri began clearing her throat to signal the club meeting had begun. \u201cNow today class we will be making my own cinnamon raisin loaf bread, just on a smaller scale. You\u2019ll all be free to have some of my own as you begin to bake yours, but for now the first and most important step is too\u2026\u201d What followed was a series of set instructions; so many amounts of certain ingredients, this much dough to this much raisins, eventually it was time to bake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, in order to make sure your bread probably rises we need to use just a bit of yeast\u2026\u201d Jen Telleri went on to make clear, \u201cJust...a...bit\u2026\u201d As the instructor added the tidbit as she sprinkled in the yeast, she was oblivious to Claire as she began to add yeast to her dough by the handful, peppering it with the powder. The rest of the cooking club placed their mini loafs into one of the clubs several shared ovens and, one explanation on proper icing of raisin bread, and about 30 minutes at 350 degrees later (176 centigrade here in Europe) Claire\u2019s plan went into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProf. Telleri! Ms. Blake!\u201d Claire said acting as bewildered as she could be. \u201cIs there something wrong with that bread?\u201d she pointed a chubby finger to the oven door which looked to be as full as a Masters' stomach after a giant meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Well, let\u2019s take a look\u2026\u201d Prof. Telleri waddled slowly to the strained oven door, drawing the attention of the rest of the classroom, you turn along with the rest of the classroom to see what the matter was as Ms. Telleri began to open the oven door\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PSSS</b>hhhwFL<b>LLLAAARRP</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a sound unlike any you\u2019ve ever heard! Sort of like a balloon losing its air but mixed with the sound of bubbles being blown through a straw into an extra thick milkshake. You tried to get a better look at what now the whole class was staring at, and you could just manage to see a beige blob of dough oozing forth before a burst of warm air spurts forth from the oven sending a tiny bit of the dough everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batter splatter covers part of your face and a few of the other girls\u2019 clothes.  Partially blinded by delectable yet right now inedible dough you can only listen as a number of girls give cries of fright and shock as the kitchen/club room is quickly evacuated. You turn to see Rebbecca had been given a direct hit by the stuff knocking her off her chair and flat on to her well cushioned butt. She brushes herself off before pointing and gasping at Kate, you turn to see Kate lying on the floor and her shirt is covered with dough and soaked with blood? You rush to Kate who seems just fine if not just a  little confused. You touch the bloody spot on her shirt and realize it wasn't blood, just raspberry jam, one of the jars must have split on her shirt. Breathing a sight of relief for a second time today you see what had happened with the rest of the class.You see Claire who was covered in a bubbly mess,  but notice that strangely her face wasn\u2019t one of distress or alarm but (and this may have been the dough in your eyes) she looked more like she was holding in a laugh. Whatever grin you may have glimpsed was gone as she approached the head chef of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no Ms. Telleri, I don\u2019t know what happened! Who ever did this must have made a big mistake! *sniff* I need to go home and wash up right away or this outfit is ruined, it\u2019s an emergency!\u201d  Claire sniffed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Telleri who was now trying to push the rising dough back into the oven had little time to think and just gave a quick immediate response to the principal\u2019s daughter.\u201cUh, er, I suppose so, if it\u2019s an emergency\u2026\u201d There was a rush to the door as a group of girls followed Claire as she left the clubroom, everyone seemingly prepared to follow her out. Ms. Telleri sunk a flabby arm into the dough and then found it to be stuck there. \u201cUh Ms. Blake...?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her head around the now near empty classroom in search of her assistant chef, she spotted a few strands of pink hair hovering just behind a desk. Bunnie Blake raised her head from underneath a desk where she\u2019d ducked down, her supernatural lunch lady reflexes kicking in just quick enough to keep her clean from the dough. Going into action you watch as Bunnie speeds to the club-room's windows and quickly opens them. \u201cI\u2019ll get the vinegar!\u201d Bunnie shouts as she dashes to the ingredient closet. Ms. Telleri watched as the smoke began to flow out the window and with another strong tug she managed to free her elbow deep arm from the the dough.  Taking a step back she began to clean her glasses as she took in the  remaining members of the cooking club. The room now consisted only of; Ms. Telleri herself, you, Kate, Rebecca, and a still currently busy Bunnie. Oh and a still slowly growing blob of a bread dough she'd need to take care of that too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you three are free to go. If you\u2019d like\u2026\u201d she says, her voice and her eyes both pleading for you to help stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can help!\" You say immediately and you turn to your other friends hoping they would agree to stay too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, my shirt can\u2019t get any dirtier.\u201d Kate said laughing at this strange situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we'll help\" Rebbecca said through gritted teeth. She then cursed just underneath your range of hearing. \"Dammit, why do you always have to be such a nice guy C.J.?\"  Rebbecca wondered if Claire was somehow to blame for this, she didn't doubt it. The<u> ONE NIGHT</u> she'd planned for everything to go perfect was ruined! Or was it? Maybe if she cleaned this stuff up fast enough there would still be time! That thought in mind Rebbecca rolled up her sleeves and got ready to patty-cake this dough as fast as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that your trio of friends begin to assist the teacher as the began to battle the dough. You took a side of the blob dough and sink your hands into it trying to push it back. For some strange reason the jiggly feel of the dough, along with it's rising, plumping and stretch marks, reminded you of something you\u2019d seen a lot at the academy but you couldn't put your  finger on it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, how long does it take to lick the batter? (Metaphorically of course eating raw yeast while it\u2019s rising is a <b>NO-NO!</b>)</span></div></div>",

Your arms were starting to get pretty tired after an hour of trying to rid the oven's cavity of miscellaneous cooking residue, the sticky mass of yeast and filling having exploded quite some time ago and left its mark all over the once steely walls of Ms. Telleri's oven. A lot like napalm, what was supposed to be a delectable treat was glued to one of the many ovens that littered the Culinary Arts lab. And boy were you getting sick of the smell of raspberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the only one more dedicated to this mission than you was Becca, who scrubbed away at the quickly-hardening mass with just as much fervor as you did. Possibly more. Her round doubly chinned face was a deep shade of red, salty sweat dampening her brow as she worked the bristles on her own brush down to the nub. She was breathing pretty hard, but her resolution remained strong as she continued to clean up the horrible mess inside the oven. However she had removed her jacket for mobility purposes about twenty minutes ago, and while you wouldn't dare bring it up, her own soft rolls and bulges that resembled so much the yeast you were trying so hard to clean up were slowly creeping out from underneath her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chivvy up the pace, you two.\" Ms. Telleri said listlessly as a loud crunch was heard behind you, \"The custodians lock up this wing at half seven.\" she mumbled through crumbs of baked dough and raisins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you have them do this?!\" you can't help but question the large woman's reasoning as she sat idly by watching you and Rebecca toil away in her oven while nibbling away on cookies, \"They're janitors! It's their job to clean up! And Bunnie, why are you making cookies?! Shouldn't you at least <i>pretend</i> to help us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was hotter in here for some reason...\" Becca puffed as she rose from the oven, \"Kate, I thought you were taking the floors!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shorry Becca...\" Kate mumbled from across Ms. Telleri's seat, having joined the rotund teacher in munching on sweets while the two of you toiled away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie emerged from behind Ms. Telleri's personal oven in the quarantined zone that made up the heavyset teacher's makeshift office, a fresh tray of cookies in hand, donning an apron and pretty pink oven mitts. \"Hey, come on Ceej, don't be such a downer.\" she chided as she placed her latest batch between her newest taste testers and adjusted her toque, \"And they can't clean it up, because of a big strike that happened a few years back. Some girl tried to make a super-souffle (pheh, armature) for every teacher and wrecked the same classroom. Janitors won't go near the Culinary labs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bunnie, you've simply <i>got</i> to tell me what it is you put in these cookies.\" Ms. Telleri gushed as she grabbed another one, \"I mean really, these things are absolute bonkers! I could stuff 'em in my gob all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Calamity Pink Cook blushed a bit as she drank in her superior's compliments, a wide smile on her face as she tried (futily) to remain modest. \"Oh Jen, it's nothing really. I mean, the cookies aren't nothing, obviously.\" she smiled eagerly as she watched student and teacher both inhale her hard work, \"I guess they've just got my special touch is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelleri pat her wobbling stomach, \"Well, for what it's worth I'd kill to have that special touch in my classroom more often.\" she said with another dainty bite of cookie, \"If all my girls could cook as well as you do, I'd retire early and move in with Jess knowing that my job was done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie held back a squeal, her cheeks growing rosy at all of the praise she was getting. \"Oh stop, you're going to make me blush!\" she giggled, \"I'll go get you some more so you can take them home with you!! Oh, and you too Katie! Becca, Ceej, you want som--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" both of you shout in unison, still a little peeved at having to clean up the entire room by yourselves. You turned to face the mess, now an hour and a half into creation with little remedy and lots of room for improvement. Dried, crusty yeast littered the area around the oven as well as certain parts of the walls. At this rate, you were going to have to pull an all nighter... and no one wanted that. Except maybe Ms. Telleri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, as if answering your prayers, a knock arrived at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello hello?\" came a perky tone, delivering good faith and merriment into your hearts, \"Jen? You in there? I've got a package from Jessica... Abida said that if I didn't deliver it I'd get a paycut? Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Elenore!\" Jen said happily from her seat, currently firmly wedged between her two titanic buttcheeks, \"Come in, we were just sitting down for a snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool--- er,what exactly happened in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minor problem with my Cooking Club, not a problem really.\" Jen said dismissively. Bunnie began subtley waving another cookie in front of Ms. Telleri's nose making an \"o\" shape with her lips. \"Sorry, <i>our</i> club. Not just mine.\" she corrected, grabbing at the cookie between Bunnie's fingers, \"Mr. Dalton, Miss Maglen, and Miss Granden have offered to help clean up for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except it's only Mr. Dalton and Miss Maglen doing all the work!!\" Becca spat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... um, here's your package!\" Ms. Francium said happily, as she avoided the evil glares that the two portly gourmands were inciting from you and Becca, \"I'd better get back to my office... it's almost six now, so if I leave then I can probably find my way back before they lock me in... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honestly Elly, you don't know your way around <i>yet</i>?\" Telleri griped, \"It's been almost six months!\" she sighed, rocking her monumental body back and forth as she lurched forward from her stool, \"I suppose Bunnie should show you around then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie paused, \"O-Oh sure Jen, I've got this one!\" she stammered as the heavy woman's feet touched the floor, \"You stay here and watch CJ and Becca while I get Elly back to the Science wing. I expect excellent notes on those cookies though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" Jen smiled as the two slender women walked out the door, \"Kate, could you be a dear and grab the last batch on the ding? I'm going to go resituate myself on the loveseat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!!\" you gripe aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sighed, her plans having failed after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThere...\u201d  you say taking a step back from the oven and wiping a strand of sweat from your forehead. It was now half past six but you'd finally cleaned the last few bits of batter from the cooking lab, even with Kate leaving for the doctors office after getting a small certifiable \u201cowie\u201d of a burn from accidentally touching a still hot tray of cookies as they were set to cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph...Very (gulp) Good\u201d Ms.Telleri commended through a mouthful of cookie. (Whether it was for the cookie itself or your work you never found out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrrumph\u201d Rebbecca bemoaned arms folded unhappily, and feeling that for the hard work the both of you had just done a simple \u201cvery good\u201d  wasn\u2019t good enough. Worst of all her plans for the night had been ruined by the chauvinistic conniving Claire's literally half baked plan. Without a word more the both of you trotted towards the doorway felling drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Before you two go...\u201d Ms. Telleri called suddenly. You turn around and watch as she expertly scrolled in her reclining chair making her way to the fridge and pulling out two large Tupperware tubs and a mass of tinfoil. \u201cI saved some of Bunnie\u2019s baked lasagna from yesterday\u2019s club meeting. It\u2019s not  much but it\u2019s really the only way I can think to thank you for your hard work.\u201d Setting the tubs down she placed the tinfoil on top of it. \u201cI made some garlic bread to go with it for my dinner tonight but I\u2019m sure I can whip up something else for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... thanks Ms. Telleri.\u201d you say taking the strange gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well I\u2019ll have to make sure no more accidents like this happen again. Can\u2019t have my new taste tester doing  double duty as a  janitor all the time.\u201d she notes turning to Rebbecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca did not return the smile, but she did scoop up her Tupperware and tinfoil \u201cgifts.\u201d  There was an awkward pause as Ms. Telleri returned to the cookies and began to scribble some notes on a sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, h-have a good night...\u201d you say as you slowly backpedal towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh<i>hmm</i>\u201d agreed the teacher, savoring another mouthful of cookie from her pink haired prized portage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps out of the kitchen and your nose takes in lung-fulls of fresh air, thankful to be away from the sent of anything baked. Rebbecca takes a chest swelling breath too, but strangely it ends up sounding more like a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over. See you tomorrow C.J\u201d Rebbecca says,  glumly resigned to the fact that her plans for the night had been ruined. You too were about to say goodbye, looking forward to just crashing on the couch after eating, when you did some quick thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Becca...You want some help reheating that stuff up? You know since we both have some, and you know the homework thing today..I-it\u2019s not pizza but I\u2019m pretty sure it cooks just the same.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca felt her heart fluttering, and you notice her eyes brighten at the idea. \u201cSure!\u201d she shouts a bit louder than she had meant, then regaining her composure added  \u201cOkay, why not?\u201d feigning coolness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of you were outside Rebbecca's familiar abode and for a girl of her...size Rebbecca had practically zipped the entire way there. Her mood was now far from the red faced wreck she'd been while scrubbing muffin mix. As she unlocked her door, Rebbecca remembered that she had in fact just been cleaning. Caked on cupcake mix splattered her shirt and encrusted her hair: not the ideal look when you were about to talk to your crush. She couldn\u2019t just leave you here standing outside, but then again she\u2019d hate to reveal her love of bathing....She winced briefly as she realized the only option left was to invite you in and and clean up as quick as she could which meant...today of all day\u2019s; she\u2019d be taking a shower instead of her luxurious baths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca opened the door and plodded her way inside setting her Tupperware on the table. You do the same, and then nonchalantly head towards her oven, pressing buttons and turning nobs with a sense of familiarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m thinking we let the lasagna warm up for fifteen minutes, then stick the garlic bread cook in there with it for five more. But if your starving we could just microwave b-but I\u2019m not really sure how long to keep it in there.\u201d  You grimace slightly thinking there were few things worse than food that was cooked on the outside, but icy in the middle. Fortunately, Rebbecca didn\u2019t seemed to mind the wait. \u201cTwenty minutes? Okay...Umm, let me take a quick bat-er-shower and put on some clothes that don\u2019t have any frosting on them.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Rebbecca.\u201d you say, still busy with the oven. Rebbecca <i>had </i>been hit by the batter blast a lot more than you had, in fact you most of the dough that had been on you had wiped off rather nicely. \u201cI\u2019ll just chill on the couch.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat-<i>berightback</i>\u201d she spouted quickly, and then just as quickly, she thumped her way to her bathroom and undressed. Carefully, she stepped into her treasured tub. Her hands worked the hot and cold water taps having memorized her desired settings, then twisting the rarely used third knob, she switched from the bath\u2019s tap spout to the shower-head's stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the warm water, Rebbecca remembered why she preferred baths so much now, scrubbing herself while standing was getting sort of hard, and those hard to reach areas on her back were getting just a <i>little </i> more hard to reach. A few squirts of shampoo and conditioner later and she was out of the shower and completely crumb free. After drying herself off, she quickly crossed the short distance between the bathroom and her bedroom re-dressing in frosting free pj\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to dress she caught a glimpse of her naked reflection. <i>Damn </i>she was really starting to get thick....She gave herself a little shake and watched her whole body wobble a little. She tried to picture her stomach at Claire sized or even Claire\u2019s <i>MOM </i>sized. Was that the size C.J really liked? Rebbecca's mind began to wonder, and eventually stopped on one key question: What exactly did you like about big beautiful women?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it that you liked watching her eat a lot? She certainly enjoyed food, especially the oh-so-warm feeling she got whenever she truly gorged herself, but that sort of fire in the belly feeling she got was usually a once in a while sort of thing, saved only for something truly tasty. Maybe, it was because you had a thing for stomachs? She certainty had plenty of belly to go around now. She brought her hand to caress it, letting the still warm body fat dribble between her fingertips. Her stomach certainly wasn\u2019t the largest on campus but was large enough now to be considered a full blown gut. She had accepted the round dome as a new part of her now, and even occasionally found it...cute.  She imagined it was your hands that were gently massaging it and she certainly liked the idea of that, but what exactly did guys like C.J supposedly get out of it? She added 'belly play' to the growing list of terms to research later on the Internet. Plus, if you were into belly's she\u2019d given you the perfect opportunity yesterday for a belly rub... Was math homework really that distracting? She supposed it was possible, or it was possible that you weren't a guy who was into guts. Well...all that really left was her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca turned around and reflected on her rump. God it looked even <b>bigger </b> today! She wiggled it and it bounced healthy in reaction. There wasn\u2019t much else to say about it other than it was soft and big (and apparently <i>still </i>getting bigger certainly growing faster than her breast (those slackers.)) Her bottom was soft and firm, much like her bicep muscles now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the oven being opened and a tin foil being unwrapped interrupted her thoughts. She realized that the sound meant she had about five minutes till dinner was ready. Well belly, breasts, or booty it didn\u2019t really matter; she decided to just keep being her same jiggly self, and she'd find out what you liked eventually. With a nod of confidence to her reflection Rebbecca walked out of her room feeling read for what was about to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the main room and kitchen she realized that she had the perfect opportunity to do some flirting. The problem was she was never one for that breathy flirty stuff, but she could never work up the courage to just outright say how she felt.  She\u2019d have to improvise a flirty way to get your attention soon, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca proceeds to...</span></div></div>",

Boy it'd been a while since you'd eaten anything, since about lunchtime. Second helpings on the chicken pot pie with Becca, Kate and Claire. Still, it wasn't much to speak of now that the day had waned away so quickly. And after all that hard work cleaning up Ms. Telleri's classroom, you'd certainly earned a little bit more of Bunnie Blake's fantasmagasmic pasta a'la pink. You'd probably <i>kill</i> for a little bit more of that right about now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut luckily you didn't have to! Because it's reheated, brown-around-the-edges less than equal was sitting right there, wrapped in bright shiny tin foil just waiting to be devoured! Plus breadsticks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum merrily to yourself as you fumble around Becca's flat in search of the necessary equipment necessary to fully enjoy a meal. Plates, forks, napkins, all disposable of course. You'd long since learned where Becca kept them stashed, having come over to her place quite often since your freshman year. You dutifully place the plates across from each other at the coffee table, the tenants in the cheaper dorms usually lacking a proper dining table, and grant yourself and your gracious hostess a set of silverware each as well as what could only be described as a wad of napkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca stood in the hallway, trying her best to keep her thoughts in alignment as well as still her beating heart. Like it or not, Becca was pretty inexperienced with this sort of thing. She was pretty prone to bouts of nervousness, sometimes bad enough to make things really awkward if she wasn't careful. Behind her careful stare was a system of organizing her thoughts, trying to keep calm as she sorted out the ones involving you as a friend and you as a potential boyfriend. Should worse come to worst, she could still be your friend by the time you left and try again at another date... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut come Hell or high water, she was gonna at least <i>try</i> to get some flirting done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she did her best to saunter over in a manner as sensual as her thick legs would deem possible. For once she tried to accentuate the twins that bulged from her backside as she eagerly made her way towards the lasagna left for her on the counter. Grabbing for the serving spoon you'd left in the foil, she quickly plopped a large amount of the thick cheesy slab onto the flimsy paper plate. And then another before claiming several Bunnie-made breadsticks for decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her serving size (secretly hoping that you would be more satisfied with her portions than she was) Becca hurried her bubble-butt over to the coffee table. As she sat her plate down, she grunted with some audible difficulty, her plaid flannels were getting a little too snug to fit her generous pear shape lately. She'd have to go buy more over the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at you, already seated, Becca let out a strained huff in the difficulty it required of her to crouch down these days, before losing her balance and plopping her bubble-butt down on the ground with what seemed to her an apartment-shaking tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks good!\" she said ignoring the minor slip, \"You did a really good job of cooking, CJ.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awb I rully did wush reheed id.\" you smack with lips stuffed with lasagna, \"Ish doh big deel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're such a good little domestic lately, Ceej!\" Becca teased as she worked her lumpy legs into a cross-legged position. Her stomach flowed generously out from underneath the t-shirt she'd chosen for tonight. Poor Che Guevara looked like a lumpy bobble-head as Becca's breasts bulged against the too-tight fabric of her shirt and distorted his image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ab nod.\" you finally swallow, having chewed up enough of the delicious saucy ambrosia so that you wouldn't choke on it, \"You're the one who's all nuts over cooking club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose you're just there to play with Bunnie?\" she added dryly as she tenderly cut off a portion of her first brick of lasagna, \"Or is it to stare at Delphine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Neither!\" you retort back, getting red in the face from a combination of the peppers in the sauce and embarrassment, \"I'm there because Bunnie asked me to join and I joined! Then... a whole bunch of other people joined. I can't help it that I'm popular!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, because you're just <i>such</i> a ladies' man.\" Becca giggled. You'd never quite seen Che's face jiggle like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca took a bite of her lasagna. Instantly familiar sensations of eating this very same meal freshman year flooded into her taste buds. The warmth, the gooey cheese. The powdery Parmesan and the thick but not too thick layers of it all between the noodles and the meat. It made her drool just thinking about it. Luckily she had much more of it to stuff between her cheeks. Bunnie was such an awesome cook... boy, that cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a minute to poke the corpse. \"Beck?\" you ask, having gotten a little worried about her there for a sec, \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" she stammered, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been like, two minutes.\" you say flatly, \"And all you've been doing is moaning with your eyes closed while you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca turned as red as the pasta she so heartily devoured, her chubby cheeks resembling tomatoes as she grew more and more embarrassed. \"Sh-Shut up!\" she giggled again, \"I was in mid-flavorgasm and you ruined it. Thanks a lot, Ceej.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, next time I'll just let you stroke out on me then.\" you laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smiled to herself, quickly stuffing down another bite of heavenly pasta so as to cleverly conceal it from your view. This was going pretty good so far! She hadn't said anything to mess it up yet, so now was the time to really put things into high gear. The only question would be... how exactly to do that. There were plenty of ways to go about it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Okay!</b> Enough playing around, Rebecca had you here and she wasn\u2019t going to waste it! The flirty stuff would just have to come later after she\u2019d done some more research, right now she\u2019d just go with her gut and stuff herself to her limits in front of you. Such gumption for gobbling had arrived at the perfect time as she\u2019d really worked up a healthy appetite from all of the hard work she\u2019d done earlier when cleaning up the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! This bread! She clenched her eyes to focus on taste further, her well read taste buds busy checking her almost encyclopedic knowledge of food and flavors, finding hints of garlic and thyme encrusted into the dough. She savored this last mouthful before finally having to breathe, letting forth a peaceful sigh of content after she\u2019d swallowed. Taking up the other halve of the bread she provocatively pressed it between her plump limps with a single finger, letting the bread bulge her cheeks out a bit  to make room for a few bites more. Slow and steady, Rebecca began pacing herself to devour as much food as she possibly could that night, and she was going make sure you watched every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on the other side of the table, you too were slowly making your way through your lasagna <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">square </span>brick, but not because for lack of trying; the food was excellent, it was that there was something about the <i>way </i>Rebecca was eating tonight that was\u2026distracting you from your own cuisine consumption. Rebecca was definitely hungry tonight; you\u2019d noticed earlier how her plate seemed covered with food certainly much more pasta than porcelain showing. You note that she had been a great choice for cooking club as her love of food, had apparently grown along with the rest of her appetite (and...well...the rest of her). Just then, and much like yesterday, the idea to mention the rising weight and appetite among your group of friends slightly crosses your mind, but, also much like yesterday, the idea of bringing up such an issue at such a relaxing time like now seemed downright rude. So while Rebecca\u2019s mouth continued to engulf and swallow the last bit of her lasagna, your mouth remained shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence began to fill the room, until it was shattered by another small moan. Something between a giggle and a squeal erupted from Rebecca's full mouth, a mouth that from the sound of it was busy having having another flavorgasm  burst inside of it. What must have been her third of these sorts of flavorgasams drew your full attention once more; attention that Rebecca quickly made use of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Ceej? Did I get something on my face?\u201d she asks coyly noticing your attentive glances, \u201cOr, did I get something on Mr. Guevara\u2019s?\u201d And in an attempt to spot a stain her fingers pulled at the bottom of her shirt, stretching the fabric tight, perfectly accentuating her t-shirted twins. Her blue eyes, not unaware of your own, traced over her canyon of cleavage for a few seconds, and seeing no stain she let go the tight t-shirt. The hem audibly twanged as it snapped back into a still distorted but much more relaxed position. Her eyes then turned to you, looking for confirmation that she had earned your ogling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo\u2026uh\u2026\u201d you fork stabs against your empty plate and the scratching sound it makes shatters the slight spell you were under. Your eyes, still as wide as the dinner plates in front of you, quickly evacuated Rebecca\u2019s cleavage canyon and all surrounding areas, until they ultimately settle on your empty plate. \u201cI...was just getting up for seconds.\u201d You splutter out, giving yourself an excuse to excuse yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a close one! You breathe a sigh of relief as you enter the kitchen, having just escaped one of your best friends marking you as a pervert for life. It really wasn\u2019t all your fault though, Rebecca had been the one stretching her shirt out right in front of you. You still weren't used to sights like that, even though it seemed that every time you turned a corner around here you were getting smothered by a mob of fan club girls. It was...there was 'something' about watching Rebecca put away that pasta and tugging on her shirt like that, it made you feel strangely... warm. The feeling was a thousand times more complicated than that, but your warm red ears and cheeks were the only ones you could describe. Really, you didn\u2019t want to think that over now,and so to distract yourself from thoughts of your co-diner and her \u2018shapeliness\u2019 you cut one more slice of the rich lasagna. Gazing at the square, you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be getting up anytime soon if you did manage to actually eat it, which reminded you\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey, Becca? D-Did you want some more lasagna? W-While I\u2019m still up, that is?\u201d You can\u2019t believe it, you were actually stuttering, you usually felt so at home in Becca\u2019s kitchen, and now your voice was nearly cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of your view Rebecca was feeling a bit of the same way as her heart began to flutter.  You had offered her more! Was this a sign? A dare? It had to be! Or, maybe you were just being polite? She didn\u2019t know what to expect when you finally spoke up about your love for \u2018bigger women,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t like you would just come out and admit it. She decided to just go with the flow and accept your challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d Rebecca finally answered back, \u201c<i>Two </i>slices please! Ooh and some more breadsticks!\u201d  Let\u2019s see what you thought of that, she thought smiling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo! There was only two slices of lasagna left! Not that <i>you </i>were anywhere near hungry, especially when you still had a whole other piece to yourself, but you were still a little shocked that Rebecca still had room for two more of the large lasagna leftovers. You were about to mention how she was bound to get a stomach ache like yesterday with the pizza if she kept eating like this, but then you remember Rebecca\u2019s constant repeating on her love of all things bread and decide such a warning wasn\u2019t worth the telling off you\u2019d get in return...And there was another part of you too\u2026 One just below your bounds of awareness that really wanted to see if Rebecca really could eat all of this. Such feasting feats weren\u2019t uncommon here at the academy, but this was certainly more than you\u2019d ever seen Rebecca eat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding back into your seat you set the plates down in front of their respectful owners and the feasting continued. Slowly you cut into your meal; still warm, a burst of steam erupts from within the dish, hitting you with a welcoming smell and a slight mist upon your face. You can feel yourself slowly reaching your limit, and feel this last mouth-watering piece will definitely be just right for you. Rebecca on the other hand seemed to have gained a second wind (or second stomach) for she seemed to be eating her seconds even faster than her firsts!  This time around Rebecca decided she was skipping on the savoring the meal and instead was going for speed. It was a bit of a shame to gobble down the delight so quickly, it was like running through an art gallery without time to stop and admire the work the artists had put into their work, but sometimes sacrifices had to be made in the name of love. She picked up the pace not thinking just eating; feeling like every single bight brought you one step closer to admitting your passion for plumper women. Dead silence again seemed to surround the two of you, occasionally springing back to life with the symphony of gulps and chewing noises being conducted by the girl across from you. Minutes later you\u2019d finished your last helping, but continued staring at the brunette garbage disposal on the other side of the table. Oh sure you had turned the T.V on after you'd finished and pretended you were watching it, but you were much more interested in seeing if Rebbecca was really going to clean her plate rather than whatever was on t.v.. Rebecca\u2019s fork was still shoveling away forkful after forkful but always taking the time to not sloppily sauce up her shirt. She continued to pump pasta into her paunch, remorselessly downing the zesty red sauce, unmeticulously masticating the meat filled middle. Whew! You were getting excited tired just watching her! Yet you never looked away, in fact her eyes darted once from the plate in front of her and caught you with a flabbergasted look on your face, right before you finally excused yourself once more to take care of your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you returned from the kitchen, you were stunned to see she was almost finished. Rebecca\u2019s face was flushed with satisfaction, and was begging to look as round and red as her stomach. With one almighty gulp she finished off the last of her meal, a grin of satisfaction spreading across her face. \u201cWhew! I was starving!\u201d she gasped leaning back in complete contentment. She stood up very slowly, cradling her swollen stomach that looked large enough to be pregnant with two food baby's  if such a term existed. Then taking her plate she slowly waddled to the sink to wash herself up, her stomach audibly sloshing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also gasp a sigh of relief now that the dinner was over. For whatever reason, perhaps the lasagna itself, your heart had been pounding pretty hard as you watched Rebecca eat like that, but thankfully whatever was causing it had stopped. Yep, in fact it was getting pretty late too, you should probably think about getting home\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c \u2018Scuse me Ceej.\u201d came Rebecca\u2019s voice when a massive suddenly shadow eclipses your view of the TV. It\u2019s Rebecca with her full moon like bottom half, wobbling and squeezing around the table in front of you, until it ultimately craters itself beside you on the couch. Cratering was the best word to describe it as Rebecca rump sunk deep into the couch on impact, her stomach gives an audible slosh as it shakes you too could feel the aftershocks of such an impact all the way on your side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019cha watching?\u201d she asks harmlessly, hoping your answer would in fact be <u>her</u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, nothing\u2026\u201d you mumble as you quickly flick through a few channels. Unlike yesterday Rebecca had a different smell about her not the fruity perfume but one of fresh clean soap. Sitting practically cheek to cheek (in multiple senses of the word) you catch another whiff as you continue to absentmindedly flip channels the lotion like smell makes the word SKIN flash white hot around your brain. But, while your brain was racing, the rest of your body was slowly slowing down. The lasagna and bread churning inside you, was warmly rubbing your stomachs walls like an inside out tummy rub, and if you weren\u2019t careful you might just fall asleep here on this couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I ate that much\u201d Rebecca says noticing the sleepy look in your eyes.  She quickly brings her hands to her stomach gently caressing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026.Me too\u201d you dreamily murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...What\u2019d you just say?\u201d she asks raising and eyebrow and quickly pivoting her head to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap, what <i>had </i>you just said? Wait.  \u201cI-I-I had soo much. And it\u2019s been such a *<b>yawn</b>* long day\u201d you say as you half fake a yawn. And it was true, from the homework fiasco to the cup cake carnage you\u2019d been through a lot in the past twenty-four hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Rebecca says frustrated by your ignorance toward her gluttony. Why couldn\u2019t you just come out and admit it? Almost! <b>Almost</b>!  <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Almost! </font>She could hear it in your voice how you had just now been on the tipping point. It had been a rumbling stumbling long path to take to get here but here she was; stuffed to the brink with the finest Italian food, and your crush arms length away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, originally she had planned on eating a lighter dinner when she invited you over, and then splitting some dessert afterwards. Right now it was in the fridge/freezer begging to be eaten. Her stomach suddenly churned at the thought of more food. Okay, maybe she could wait a little while and digest a bit, then she\u2019d have room- no plenty of room for dessert. Rebecca knew it was no fun gorging yourself if you got sick and threw it back up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she had you a mere couch cushion away and even if you weren\u2019t admitting it, she was sure you\u2019d been checking her out tonight and that had to count for something.  Yes, she\u2019d just relax and wait a bit right here on this couch that was just so damn comfy! Soon Rebecca had reclined deep into the couch as a magic combination of a day\u2019s hard work, a nice hot shower, and a warm belly, created a perfect storm of relaxation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From just after Becca finally decided that she was finished and the end of that late-night movie you'd rented but weren't really paying attention to. Whatever the time and however the cause, you had fallen asleep on Rebbecca's couch at some point during the evening. Your position would be just like the one you held in your Becca-centric daze, one where your face was simply propped atop your palm as if showing great interest in the \"probably really cheeky\" British comedy you'd been zoning in and out of all night. Your eyes closed in a deep slumber, you had been completely oblivious to the apartment around you for quite some time now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ceejie-kins, would you like some more pumpkin pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would, thank you very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision pans out somewhat as you go through an out of body experience. There in the lunchroom you sit, in all your glory, as a pink-skinned little plumper. Your hair seems different somehow and your fingers really small. Probably represents your mother somehow, if you'd ask Freud. Your big rosy belly gurgles with the sound of delight as yet another entire pie is placed in front of you. You look down to blink at your belly button in Morse code, silencing its rudeness with repetitive batting of your eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, out of thin air, is Bunnie. She claims an armistice of hors d'ourves at her disposal and seems rather intent on stuffing you with them. She cuts a slice from the nearmost pie and draws it closer to your mouth. Instinctively you begin to chew, relishing just how close your relationship with Miss Bunnie Blake, centerfold central of the year, was getting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pats your stomach proudly and begins speaking to you in Korean. As she speaks, you can't help but notice that her plate keeps disappearing and her hat has now sprouted eyes. \"B-Bunnie?\" your voice is not your own, but someone of much more... feminine? That's right, you had a woman's voice! Suddenly it seemed so silly of you to have forgotten. Rare birth defect, not many people had it. \"Y-Your hat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sneaky little bastard.\" she says, now with an accent, \"No need to worry about him though, as long as you've got me.\" she says confidently with a pat of your monumental breasts, \"Now, about that pumpkin pie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" your voice fails to convey just how much you want that pie inside of you, \"Feed me, feed me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-kay!\" the Pinkie giggled excitedly, \"But just remember Becky, you've got that girlish figure to keep up!\" she said with a squeeze of your breasts, \"And you've got to eat~ it~ all my little taste tester!!\"<br>\r\n`<br>\r\nBecky?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hallucinations were shattered at the sound of a metallic clang echoing throughout the apartment. You awoke in a cold sweat, torn from your precious R.E.M's by the mysterious clattering. Where exactly where you? How long had you been asleep? Was this that girl from your fanclub's apartment, and if so were there any of your important body hairs missing- that or sharpie marks over your internal organs. Any new scars?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon realization that you had simply fallen asleep in Becca's apartment- the debris of her unforgettable feasting still left to litter the coffee table before you- there came several more pressing matters. One: where was Becca? A girl her size just doesn't wander off, at least not that easily. Two: Just what had made that noise that woke you up so abruptly from... whatever kind of dream you'd been having. Three... just what was that bright light coming from the corner of your eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that all three of these questions would be solved with a simple glance over to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the kitchen, eclipsing the light from her refrigerator, stood Becca. Not a cognitive Becca, mind you, but an instinctive one. Her long brunette hair unkept from slumber and her large hips making a mockery out of the overall capacity of her fridge, blocking you from seeing just what it was that she had deemed so important that she had to nibble on it this late at night. You could see the back of her arms moving and slapping against her upper torso, gentle moans filling the apartment which sleep silently if not for the gentle hum of the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Becky?\" you ask sleepily, having not called her that since you were children<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca?\" you hastily correct yourself. There was a <i>reason</i> you hadn't called her that since you were children<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet winced in anticipation of the touch of cold hardwood floors until realizing that Becca had carpeting. Touching the shag with your tootsies, you sleepily drag yourself over to the kitchen. \"What time is it?\" you ask, wiping the sleep from your eyes, \"Did I miss curphew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooo?\" you ask, a little agitated due to your lack of proper slumber, \"Becca, you hear me? I asked--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a better view of her from the front. Her eyes closed, her mouth full, and stomach bloated. In her hands was a mostly-empty Tupperware container that once contained a proud and beautiful cheesecake, what's left of it either in pieces or on Becca's plump fingers. She had a dazed look on her face, mouth hanging agape slightly as she stuffed a handful of cheesecake in her mouth. Che Gueveara's face was now a wrinkled mockery as her stuffed-taut stomach forced the red ensemble up further into her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh...\" she grumbled in a husky voice, \"... hungreh...\" she stumbled over the English language as her hand was brought down to the dome of soft malleable flesh. She jostled it slightly as a track of creamed cheese was left the wake of her hand. At her jostling, it was apparent that some of the occupants in Becca's tummy had been forced to check out a little early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUURAP!!\" she belched loudly, a satisfied smile on her face as she made room for the next appetizer. She let out a deep sigh as her body flexed, \"Better....\" she hissed as the air flew from her mouth like a balloon. Her breathing had become quite labored as her body no doubt struggled to digest God knows how much food she'd crammed into her poor overloaded stomach. She began to rub her stomach again, smearing the dairy on her side, \"Tubbeh....\" she grunted once more as she leaned past her own swollen middle to get at another dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbled something incoherent, perhaps acknowledging your presence, and then proceeded to get right back to work plowing her way through the remaining desserts in her refrigerator. Of course you were shocked to find your friend, whom you had always deemed more or less in control of every situation at her fingertips, in such a compromising situation. You could only stare dazedly as she dropped the remainder of the cake to the floor, where the source of the clattering had been revealed to be a pie pan discarded in her gluttonous wake.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was going to be fun! Slightly peeking as Rebecca gorged herself on lasagna was one thing, but now you were free to watch as with no consciousness to tell herself no, Rebbecca was giving her free access to anything and everything she craved. A fridge full of opportunity seemed to be on the menu tonight (literally) and you only wish you had brought a camera or something to record Rebecca and her somnambular secret. Deli meats, frozen pizza, cheeses, soda, milk, and an entire shelf of cakes and pies were at her fingertips, yet strangely she seemed to only be focused on the sugary sweets. You had to wonder; how had she collected such a collection of pies, cakes, and other desserts? Could she have smuggled a few slices out from the school cafeteria, or had she actually baked them herself at one time or another?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rustling from inside the fridge brings you back to full attention. Rebecca had nearly broken a perfectly good jar of pickles in her quest for something towards the back of her fridge. A small grimace crosses her face as she sticks her hand into the fridge, seemingly unable to find what she wanted as she searched about the fridge much the same way one searches blindly in the dark for a room\u2019s light switch. Curiosity piqued and definitely not wanting this silly sleep eating to stop so soon, you slowly tip toe towards the fridge to get a better look at what the midnight muncher was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the fridge Rebecca\u2019s rear blocks you from catching a glimpse of what was inside. Her wide hips barred entrance to the door and they swayed as she searched for sweets. Rather than risk waking her, you again try to gently squeeze in alongside her. This does little good, as Rebecca proceeds to back her thang up against you and jostles you aside, working her backside like a wrecking ball of sorts.\u201cGuh\u2026just sit down for a second Becc\u2026\u201d you grumble barely above a whisper. To your surprise Rebecca paused, and then proceeded to sit down, her titanic tush landing with a tremendous thud, as she props her back against the fridge's open door. You\u2019re stunned for a second as she\u2019d actually listened to what you\u2019d said...but then again maybe sleepwalkers were like someone under hypnosis highly susceptible to suggestions. Well, whatever the reason you had your chance. Quickly you reach for the Tupperware in the far corner of the fridge and bring it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you see what Rebecca\u2019s been after, and as you open the lid you give a faint gasp of surprise...it was four large neatly sliced pieces of pumpkin pie. Bits and pieces of the dream you\u2019d just had flash in your mind, most of it remained a blur, but you definitely remember pumpkin pie being present. Eyes widening at the sight you take this as a sort of mystical sign, perhaps this was all just another dream? Well dream or not, you slowly supply a hefty slice into Rebecca\u2019s hand.A smile returns to her inattentive face, showing by instinct alone she knew exactly what to do now. Breathless you watch her sink the piece into her mouth, chewing much slower and mechanically than when she was awake. Her cheeks bulge and re-bulge as she easily chomps her way through the heavenly smelling pie, she was clearly beyond content with the taste, and in minutes the piece was gone, leaving nothing but sticky residue around Rebecca\u2019s red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch Rebecca finish the slice, the warm sensation from earlier returns\u2026and then\u2026a wild idea hits you. A reckless, dark, sticky, maleficent idea\u2026 Why fumble with putting the next piece in her hand, when <i>you </i>could just feed her a slice yourself? Your breath and heartbeat quicken, as your realize if Rebecca somehow woke up this was going to be beyond explanation. Blood pumping as your heart continues to race, you lean in closer with the next slice at the ready, again you get the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as you find yourself whispering the magical commands the came from somewhere in your dream . \u201cEat\u2026it \u2026all\u201d The words were nothing more than a whisper as they eked out of your mouth but Rebecca in her hyper-aware state seemed to hear them. \u201cMmmph\u201d she blissfully agrees, as a smile crosses her face. \u201cAll\u2026for...Cejmmeh\u2026\u201dthe last <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">name </span>word was lost in an ocean of pie filling as Rebecca\u2019s face practically dove into your hand slurping down the slice of pie in a few bites, (and almost taking a bite of your fingers along with it.) Her tongue thrashes wildly against your fingers, and the sensation sends a shiver up and down your spine. Doing this with Rebecca was so bad, so morally wrong, and so\u2026crushingly sinful! It was wild, beyond wild! And yet, you loved every second of it. In the last few hours you had seemingly discovered an ocean of these new\u2026<i>urges</i>...and watching Rebecca eat this piece of pie it was like...like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize Rebecca has backed away from your pie-less hands and gone back to leaning against the fridge door.\u201cOoooh...Thrsssty\u2026\u201d she murmurs as she slowly began to turn about. Blindly, she reaches a hand inside the fridge and lifts out a half full two liter of Pepsi. She briefly struggles with the top, but somehow in the course of her fumbling works the lid off. You were unsure whether to act as your jostling might wake her up, but you ultimately decide to wait and let her take a few sips before feeding her another piece of pie. Rebecca began to raise the two liter, pressing it against her plump lips and looking much like a baby with a bottle, she began to guzzle the bubbly fluid.  You\u2019re eyes trace the effects of all the glugging (an actual word who knew?) down her throat and ultimate pooling inside an already taught stomach. The bubbles seemed only to balloon her stomach further, jutting it out proudly in victory over the red shirt army commanded by Che Gurrea\u2019s face. Her gut continues to swell and you realize that she was taking more than just a few sips. After a few more seconds she raised her arm even higher in attempt to bring more of the sweet liquid to her faster and now a full on flood of cola begins streaming into her mouth. Soon the pop is coming faster than she can gulp it down, and carbonated cola starts spilling out from the sides of her mouth and down her front, cascading into a sticky mess around her cleavage. It takes her a few seconds for Rebecca to catch up with the fact the bottle is empty but once she does, she dully tosses it aside and it hits the ground with a few hollow plastic bounces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell! Now that little scene was over, maybe she\u2019d like another piece of\u2026\u201dBrrrrap\u201d she lets loose another belch, almost loud enough to rattle the nearby dishes. And then...she hiccuped, a short but strong squeak that bounces her entire bottom half into her upper body. <u>This </u>was too much! You start snickering uncontrollably; Rebecca had complained of stomach aches before, even accidently letting a burp or two slide, but you\u2019d never seen Rebecca with the hiccups. Your laughter stops as her hiccupping comes again at short intervals, each one sending her swollen stomach rolling and flopping a bit.  Then for just a second, her breathing stops as if she was going to wake up! You, meanwhile can only hold your breath and freeze helplessly\u2026 Rebecca smacks her lips and\u2026 returns to her scheduled snoozing. You breathe a sigh of relief the situation feeling a bit  more dangerous than fun now. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun warmly kissed her bare skin and her longer hair flowing down her back as she relaxed in a tanning chair. She had become incredibly wealthy as a star pitcher in the World Softball League, and then as world famous food critic, but more importantly she had grown incredibly content with her life, as she relaxed on her mansions veranda in her favorite yellow sundress she let her two chubby hand pat the round mound that was her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance she saw another taller figure. It was you, C.J. Dalton, a more muscular and hunky and less chubby and chunky version of you, but your face still retained those gorgeous features she had always loved. Meanwhile she sported all of the hot features she knew you loved. After finally confessing your love for her and her weight gain, it had actually become a sort of sign of your love for her. All of your spoiling and pampering manifesting itself onto her body. She was your perfect flower so to speak and you were there to nurturer her and help her grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky?!\" his voice seemed a bit puzzled...and when was the last time he had called her Becky? Whatevs. She was way to relaxed to worry about such minor details. However, she did notice that the C.J of her dreams was carrying a sterling silver serving tray stacked with many-a-treat. As her set the tray down he cuddled up beside her, taking one of the cuts of cold cake and delicately serving it to her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat  it all....my love.\" he said in a voice deeper than the real C.J's. As his manly hands began gently caressing her,   Rebbecca indeed began to eat...and eat...and eat. Each bite of sweet cakey goodness absolutely perfect almost as if she were eating a cloud, and each pie drizzled with whip cream was baked to crusty a consummation just right for consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later she was begging to felt rather thirsty. Somehow sensing your dream doppelganger reached out and instantly pulled a bottle from a bucket of ice that had certainly not been there moments earlier. \"Some, Cristal to wash it down?\"  he asked, suggestively raising an eyebrow. Loving the fact that she was a truly an adult and could now drink such adult beverages, and giving only a nod  for an answer, she took the bottle herself and expertly unscrewed the bottles unique twist top. Rebbecca slowly then began guzzling down the cold drink by hand noting that it was awfully fizzy for an alcoholic beverage, it didn't matter though it was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dream began to blur as dawn began to break in the real world. Rebbecca awoke with a start, still a bit delirious. Wait...where was she? This was... the ceiling of her hallway? How had she gotten here? Had that all just been a dream? She frowned disappointingly...Wait, where was C.J? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca rolled over, and clumsily rocked herself to her feet. It was no easy task as her still quite full stomach was still distended with the long haul of food she had stashed away inside of it. As she arose Rebbecca ran a hand through her hair it was beyond her normal bedhead, now it matted with...from the smell of it was...frosting? She hoped it was just frosting. As she explored her flat's main room she  began to get a bit worried, not only because the kitchen looked like a terrible mess, but she could hardly remember what happened last night; only that you had come over and had even stayed for dinner last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was then she spotted you snoozing away on the couch. With a gentle nudging from her pudgy pointers, you're eyes fluttered as you slowly began to awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becca...\" you mumbled taking a second to take in your surroundings. \"I guess there must have been some sleeping  powder in that lasagna, huh?\" you joke as you gently arise from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca doesn't seem to be in much of a joking mood, in fact from the look on her face she seems a bit worried.<br>\r\n\"Um.. Ceej. Remind me what exactly happened last night....I mean after we started the video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh jeez...This was a lot to deal with...What to do? You couldn't exactly tell her that she'd been sleep eating last night could you? Maybe it would be better to just not mention it and save her the embarrassment....Then again you weren't sure if you could think of a reason why her kitchen was such a mess, and even if you did, Rebbecca almost always knew if you were lying... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation you eventually. </span></div></div>",

I-I could choke on a can of tuna or swallow a spoon or something!\" Rebbecca said overacting to make sure you fully understood her point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" you agree. \"But Becca, what are you going to do? Tie yourself to the bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But like you said, it's not like it's something I can control it.\" she announced having perfectly steered the conversation towards her next proclamation. \"You'll just have to spend the night again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look puzzled, but Rebbecca continued on before you could protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I mean...if it's no problem for you. Just make sure if I start sleep eating again that you, you know wake me up. It would just be nice if you could stay and make sure you know I don't kill myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jeeze </i>Becca when you put it like that...I guess we could make it like a game night.

After all you'd be mortified if anyone found out what <i>you </i>had been doing last night...In fact you certainly wouldn't mind another night with Rebbecca...and you <u>especially </u>wouldn't mind if she just happened to start sleep eating again.

I'll be right over tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel as a goofy grin began to spread across your face, and oddly Rebbecca seemed to be sharing your same wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school that day...</span></div></div>",

Had she really become so obsessed with eating during the day, that she'd started to sleep eat as well? The thought scared her a bit... Though she supposed that when you she finally worked up the nerve to ask you out and you two were boyfriend and girlfriend and not just \"friends\" she could give the bulking up a bit of a break. She <i>did </i> love to eat though, or more specifically to taste and savor flavors of any good food. In fact she couldn't wait to get back to Bake Club this afternoon to see what Ms. Telleri had in store, and she began licking her lips in hungry anticipation...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou meanwhile were having an equally hard time concentrating during school. All throughout the day, your mind began to wander back to the events of last night. Say for example when you and Rebbecca and Kate were heading for your first hour class together, you'd slowly zone out of the conversation and focus on Rebbecca's hips, they way they swayed as she walked reminded you of the way they looked propped up against the fridge door, the touch of her hand as she passed back a set of papers towards you reminding you of the way her fat fingers had been covered in cake hours earlier...Lunch had been the worst offender however. As you watched Rebbecca tear her way into a mini turkey sub sandwich with chocolate milk to wash it down, you felt...almost guilty watching her eat...guilty and...and...aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but what do you think? ...Hello? Earth to C.J!\" shouted Rebbecca waving a hand in front of your face, and sending her arm fat a jiggling. \"You okay?\" asked Kate looking a bit concerned. \"You look a little pale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...fine...Just...tired.\" you insist before digging into your own sandwich, unable to explain what you were feeling, even to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few classes later and school was officially over for the weekend.  You're pudgy posse rejoined outside of Ms.Telleri's classroom where a note had been taped to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sorry students. Bake club has been cancelled for today due to the lunch lady collision rules for safety.</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...now what?\" asked Rebbecca looking a bit peeved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could-\" You began until the bake club's door opened, and from within squeezed the very wide frame figure of Jen Telleri. \"Hello! Oh, I see you three haven't found out yet.\" she said a frown crossing her face quickly. \"Yes, it's a bit of a shame. I was surprised too, but safety rules <i>are </i>rules I suppose. And to make sure that no cooking instruments or utensils have been ruined by the...\"incident\" yesterday we have to cancel bake club closed until Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's too bad Ms. Telleri.\" said Kate just before noting the room in front of her still smelt like burnt batter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not all bad. Bunnie-er-Ms. Blake and I had made some more sample dishes for the whole class today. So we've just been giving them away to students and asking them to recreate the dishes for a little practice.\" explained Ms. Telleri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Rebbecca perking up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Ms. Blake and I agreed we have to keep thing fresh around here, can't have three day old baked spaghetti going to waste and we agreed to make things never more than a day ahead of time. Still we never miss an opportunity for a lesson. Anyone looking for a little practice can take home a little something and already it seems a lot of club members have taken the offer up. Which is good because it was either that or I bring them over to Mrs. Masters place and she...Oh, but now I'm rambling...\" said Ms. Telleri catching herself.  \"Would you three like some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Well take some!\" Your trio said in agreement, interested in the apparently easy assignment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good good, just a moment.\" she said doing anything BUT disappear as she waddled her way into the classroom. Fiddling with a piece of paper and a pen at first, and then heading to her large storage fridge, she again pulled out three separate Tupperware. Each one was filled to the top with two brick sized chocolate brownies. \"Now, each one inside is a little different. I made one batch and Bunnie made the other. I want to see if you can come back to class with an attempt at  either one.\" again explained Ms. Telleri. \"I do expect these back too on Monday...Tupperware isn't cheap you know. Here's some instructions and a basic recipe card, it's up to you to figure out the rest. I'm sure you won't have a problem my little taste tester.\" said Ms. Telleri handing Rebbecca hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short round of thank you's later and the three of you were heading back to your rooms. You marvel again at the large brownies and how the seemed so perfectly stacked like small bricks inside the clear plastic container, it was almost like a trick ship in a bottle. Without realizing it the two girls ahead of you had stopped outside of Kate's dorm, and you collided into both of their squishy backsides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.J? Are you okay?\" asked Kate offering a hand to help you up. \"You've been out of it all today.\" she noted as you got to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...Really.\" you insist picking up your thankfully unscathed box-o-brownies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright...I'll see you two later then.\" said Kate sneaking in a short wink at her gal-pal Rebbecca. Rebbecca returned the wink, understanding that Kate had purposely left the two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the fact she was again alone with you, Rebbecca's heart began to race once more, and her mouth was quickly searching for words, something, anything to say! \"So...CJ...Uh...\" she paused already feeling a bit warm and flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--See you at your place in a few?\" you ask, hoping to finish her sentence for her and remembering your sleep watching duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Uh, we can get out of our uniforms and...\" said Rebbecca the words sounding more proactive then she'd really meant too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll probably take a shower first and then head over.

Okay then...In a bit.\" said Rebbecca taking off for her own room. Unaware of your hungry stare as you watched her walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shower and one change of clothes later, you quickly were made for Becca's place. Not thinking of anything else, but just wanting to see her more, spend some more time with her, at least until you could work out what these strange feelings you were having inside were about.  Tupperware in hand, as well as a sleeping bag and a pair of pajama to change into later, you were prepared for tonight; hoping against all unlikely odds that you might get to watch Rebbecca sleep eat once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked on the door, and after than sound of weighted footsteps Rebecca was instantly at he door saying...</span></div></div>",

Rebbecca apparently had also showered and dressed, (well bathed unbeknownst to you, but same difference appearance wise.) Smelling of clean soap and a hint of lilacs, this was apparently one of the days she hadn't reached for a hoodie and sweats and simply called it a night. Electing instead to wear a purple leisurewear like spaghetti strapped tank top and a pair of non-dressy pants, casual but not formal, Rebbecca looked more like she was heading out rather than spending the rest of the day inside.  Actually from the looks of things it had been a while since she's elected to wear said outfit as the garment looked rather...tight. Especially near her lower half where the fabric now was stretched like onionskin around her barley contained spherical stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's only what, four o'clock?\" she teased removing herself from the doorway to let you inside. \"You could have called or texted me a warning...\" She was already feeling more comfortable and in control of the conversation now that it was simply in her dorm, rather than out in an open hallway moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-didn't- I was just\" You stammer caught off guard but entering the abode anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kidding, C.J.\" she says grinning.  \"I don't care. Hell, I always like having you over. It's just a little early than I was expecting is all.\" she turns a bit waddling her way around the corner of her couch and she catches another glance at you. \"Look at you...look nice when you dress up a bit.\" she says with a whistle, noting how you were also dressed in more than your usual lay around the house garb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you do too.\" you answer quickly quipping back. The bout of compliments was suddenly turned the conversation into a mess of stammering and stuttering. Rebbecca had blushed a bit before turning away from you, ready to slump her rump right onto the couch and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she was about to anyway before an idea struck her, \"H-Hey..Let's go out.\" she said suddenly, moseying back towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go. Out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know do something! Off campus\" she explained emphatically. \"We could go one day without a dinner at the school cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, well, like what?'\" It had been a while since you'd wandered about Lethargis town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like go to the mall or something! Go see a movie! Somewhere where we can just hang out...\" In that instant Rebbecca just held back on saying the word alone feeling the word would have been out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...That new action movie is out...\" You began tempted by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait even better!\" said Rebbecca  hurrying into the kitchen and checking her fridge. \"The Lethargis football team is playing at the home today! We could go check the new stadium!\" (And catch a few of those hunky muscular players thought Rebecca.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...When you say football is it like \"football football\" or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soccer.\" she said flatly.\"What's the difference. Honestly C.J that's like the <i>one </i> thing here, you won't switch too. It's a big sport over here and it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never calling <i>soccer </i> football.\" you said resolutely, although you were happy to see Rebbecca so excited over something. She did love sports back home in the USA, and well at Chubbeso, sports were rarer than a half empty plate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Fine.\" said Rebbecca with a bit of a pout. \"But it's still an option. I heard students get a discount. I've never really been there, but I hear it's really cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heart, Rebbecca didn't care which. At either place she'd be able to get her grub on in front of you. At the movie's big buttery popcorn (real butter here unlike back in the States), soda, and candy. She might even grab your hand a bit, or hell hopefully you'd be the one to \"put the moves\" on her! But at the soccer she probably could expect a bit bigger of a dinner, probably had an excellent concession stand. With smoked sausage, warm and gooey cheesy fries, and grilled beef patties, all hot and crispy and fresh off the grill...It made her mouth water. Plus, C.J would still be sleeping over at her place tonight to ensure no sleep eating went on. So either way it was perfect! She practically had you all to herself, and so it didn't matter where she would be spending time with you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moments pause you finally answer...</span></div></div>",

This fantasy though, wasn\u2019t going to end anytime soon. You were too enthralled in watching this new side of your best friend, to let it slip away would be like the stick of butter she\u2019s eating, you would never have another chance at tasting this strangely erotic feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, maybe I shouldn\u2019t let eat the rest\u2026\u201d you thought to yourself as you reached the remaining half. You want to see her stuff herself silly, but not make her sick. Mere inches from retrieving calorie laden stick; you were unsuccessful as the rest is consumed in a mighty \u201cGlOMP\u201d. \u201cMMMH\u201d is the first audible response the sleep eating Becca, \u201csooo busthery\u201d clearly a small coat of butter had remained behind. <br>\r\n\u201dM-MORE\u201d she had said in slightly startling volume. \u201cNeed to eat for CEEJAH\u201d, your command earlier to eat all the food had burned itself into her brain. \u201cMight need to watch out for that later on\u201d you thought to yourself. As you looked back to the towering multi doored fridge (Becca\u2019s parents had upgraded her to the largest fridge available through the school furnishing) she had already cleared out the two lower doors of all edible food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back to open the larger upper two doors swung open like the gates of heaven.  Waiting inside was something of gods looking down on you and your good deeds, or maybe someone wanting to punish poor starving Becca. You could feel your heart pumping so hard against your chubby chest; it felt like the only thing you could concentrate on was the feeling in your chest. So many feeling concentrated there. Your hands sweaty in anticipation of the show that was to begin soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Bunnie Bomb Cake\u201d you muttered out loud. You couldn\u2019t believe your luck, since you have been here, you haven\u2019t seen Becca even touch one of these. Bunnies\u2019 cakes had many names around campus \u201cgut busters\u201d \u201cbust busters\u201d, and \u201cbutt busters\u201d (people around here aren\u2019t creative). The most undisputed name used is \u201cDIET DESTROYER\u201d, anybody that has a taste can\u2019t stop craving for them. As if on cue your stomach let out a loud growl, almost like it knew what was in close proximity. Any sort of occasion called for Bunnie cakes, birthdays, new semesters, passing a class, heck even Fridays were enough for her to make them.  But it wasn\u2019t normally done with one cake, EVERYBODY got one. Depending on \u201cwhat year you were\u201d was the factor for the size of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one though was on another level; Becca had the largest fridge available, but even this cake made it feel as though the fridge had shrunk to half the size. At eye level, all you could see was cake, as wide as the main fridge, all the way to the back, cake cake CAKE. It took all available space on the main shelf. By just eyeballing it, it was almost square in shape, easily over two feet in length and width, close to nine inches tall. This thing was a monster in size, never had you seen anything remotely close to this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the smell hit us, you grabbed your stomach in hunger. Becca only response being \u201cmmh red velve cake my favorah\u201d.  Finally having a second to think about what she said, you realized that red velvet cake was her favorite. Out of fear of it being used against her, she never once told a soul about what foods made her weak. This indeed was a red velvet cake in front of you. Doing your best to resist, you reached in past the front and grabbed hold of the plate on the sides to hoist this calorie nuke. <br>\r\nUsing all your dormant muscle, you lifted the Bunnie cake. To your amazement and dismay, if must have weighed in the range of forty pounds, well over anything heavier you lifted in months.  Carefully extracting the cake from its prison, you stepped backwards, avoiding a catastrophe by stepping away from all Tupperware on the ground. You backed up to an opening; you slowly bent over to lay it on the ground, making sure to level out the plate.  Once one side made contact, the other soon made a \u201ccling\u201d sound, notifying you that the package had safely been set down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came what could only be said as the most exciting sentence you think you might ever say, EVER. \u201cOkay Becca time for dessert\u201d, what came out was merely a squeak, but to Rebecca, it was call to please the person held most dear. As she made an attempt to rock herself off of her fleshy throne, had she had manage to do was bust a few seams on her pajama pants. Her second attempt was successful as she rolled to the side. Next was almost indescribable, well almost, as she crawled on all fours towards the sound of my voice, her large butt was viewable from the front, hips swinging side to side wobbling like jelly. Bumping into cabinets softly.<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the cake,  you could barely speak, as if she had a spell on you to watch what was about to be the best show to ever occur in the existence of the universe.  As she slowly lowered herself onto the cold floor, she began to reach for her first hand full. You couldn\u2019t stop yourself even if you wanted to, next came out just as the first time. \u201cNo using hands\u201d, it came out before you even had a chance to stop yourself. \u201cMkay\u201d was the response you needed to hear her say. That exactly what you got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging her heavy body off the floor, she readied herself by lowering her head to the same level as the cake. As Becca opened her mouth for the first bite, a mouth full of the thing she wanted to avoid most. The feeling you got from watching that first bite, knowing you had just changed the direction of Rebecca\u2019s life. Knowing you just set your friend down the path of gluttony. Seeing her moan in pleasure of the taste, you were unstoppable now as you walked next to Becca, and muttered into her ear one last time. \u201cEAT...IT\u2026All\u201d.  Giving her rear end a might slap, a loud \u201cFWAP\u201d emitting from where your chubby hand made contact, \u201cpiggy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much for her overclocked sleeping brain. Next sight you knew is one that would never see the light of day. She went whole hog on that cake. Diving face first into it, mouthful after mouthful, only taking breaks to breath. Moans could be heard from Rebecca as she consumed the cake, like it was filled with nothing but ecstasy.<br>\r\nWatching this show of utter gluttony eventually had to come to a close as Rebecca had\u2026  </span></div></div>",

If you did this you and Bunnie might get in trouble with the school, and you wouldn't want that. Also, if the fan club had found out you gave Bunnie a belly rub they would all most likely be out for revenge, especially Claire. You shuddered to even think about what Claire might do to you if you gave Bunnie a belly rub and she ever found out. On the other hand Bunnie was easily one of the most beautiful women in the academy, with large perky chest and unlike most of the other staff and students at the academy, a thin waist and no fat belly to speak of. In addition to her good looks she did have a point about disappointing the girls in the cooking club. \"Come on CJ, I need a belly rub badly,\" Bunnie said while pouting and giving you puppy dog eyes. As you thought it over you realized that the positives of giving Bunnie a belly rub out weighed the potential consequences. \"Okay,\" you reply as you begin giving Bunnie a belly rub. \"Thanks CJ,\" Bunnie replies as you rub her small food baby. You rub it for a couple of minutes while making small talk with Bunnie, strangely enjoying every second of it. Eventually Bunnie stopped you saying \"Thanks CJ I should be able to finish the rest now.\" \"Alright,\" you replied as Bunnie began digging into the remaining student's food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After another half an hour Bunnie finishes testing the food and writing down the positives and negatives of each dish.

So, you help Bunnie up and begin walking her to her apartment. When they arrive at the apartment Bunnie sighs \"finally,\" it was starting to get a bit late by the time they got to the apartment. \"Sorry CJ I'd invite you in but I kind of just want to collapse on my bed and let this food digest,\" Bunnie said. \"That's alright,\" you replied as it was getting kind of late and you too wanted to just crash and fall asleep. \"So see you tomorrow,\" you said as you began to leave Bunnie's door. \"Yea see ya tomorrow CJ,\" Bunnie replied waving as you walked away.

Which is to say, as normal as things could get around this whack-job of an academy\u2014as in, not very normal at all. But while you were dodging hormone-addled, boy-crazy girls and managing to avoid awkward situations with your equally hormone-addled, boy-crazy cast of curvy cuties, a very distinct change began to occur in one of them. As her responsibilities slowly shifted from keeping the school, the Masters women, and (most importantly) you increasingly and exceptionally well-fed, Bunnie Blake's newfound responsibility as the official taste-tester of the Cooking Club meant that she was doing an awful lot of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what had initially been just another half-assed attempt at getting you to up your calorie intake, Claire Masters had inadvertently caused a series of events that would cause everyone's favorite calamity-pink cook to rapidly balloon outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started out small, of course. Most things like this did. The Cooking Club's co-sponsor and taste tester was adamant in making sure that her students were getting the most out of their experience under her tutelage, almost oblivious to the real reason that anyone had even joined her club was to get closer to you. She gave everyone her best advice when it came to the fine arts of cuisine, and eagerly awaited the results every Monday, Wednesday and Friday when the club met. So long as you kept showing up, so would the girls (and your friends!), and so long as <i>everyone</i> showed up, that meant Bunnie would get more than her fair share of treats to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job with this one, girls!\" Bunnie's belly mushroomed noticeably underneath her chef's smock, \"I really like how well you're taking to my criticism!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay in and day out, Bunnie was subject to gorging herself. She never seemed to mind\u2014that carefree attitude of hers shone through the whole experience, for sure. The culinary prodigy was just as capable of sucking down meals as she was dishing them out. And as the days passed, what little time she didn't spend in the kitchen was spent partaking in the glorious goodies that came out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boyyy Claire, you're really learning now.\" Bunnie smacked her lips lovingly, her belly growling as she snapped the buttons on her increasingly constrictive uniform, \"I'm gonna have to eat this <i>allllll</i> up. It's so good I don't wanna leave any leftovers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, with an increase of calories came an increase of... well, Bunnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to really keep a sense of scale when your headmistress weighed five hundred pounds. Or the other teacher in the cooking club also weighed five hundred pounds. Or when both of your friends were nearing three hundred, and your not-friend Claire had surpassed that. All you knew was that Bunnie was getting fat. Quickly and professionally, as she seemed to absorb every calorie passed her way with the expertise of an eating queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confident bouncy step was replaced with a lumbering waddle in no time as the pounds and inches caught up to her. The lithe, busty chef was buried underneath an avalanche of fat. There was no way that it was just the Cooking Club that was doing this to her\u2014she had to be binging on her off time too. Rebecca, you and Kate had discussed it at length during the party at your place where she'd eaten literally all of the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were worried about your friend\u2014it seemed so strange that someone so obsessed with cooking was now equally obsessed with eating everything in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't know just <i>how</i> worried you should be until one day, you were going to the Cooking Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Kate, Rebecca, and even Claire had managed to put all of the awkwardness that came with being a walking foursome for your affections aside when you came across the familiar sight of someone incredibly fat getting caught in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, your initial thought was that it was Mrs. K! This kind of thing happened to her so often that, if she were a side-character in some sort of strange fat-centered erotica story, it'd be a defining character trait. So you weren't too concerned, despite the fact that it was nowhere near Mrs. Kawasaki's hallway and far past time for her to have headed home. It wasn't until you noticed the distinct color pallet, specifically the bright pink hair, that the pieces began to fall into place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ceej?\" Bunnie's slow, heavy voice called out helplessly from the other side, \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunnie?!\" Rebecca cried out worriedly, \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Bunnie huffed, \"Think you could give me a push? I'm kinda stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the combined weight and force of your friends to get your older friend unwedged from the doorway. And it was only really <i>then</i> that you noticed just how different Bunnie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she'd gained weight. That much was obvious. But <i>how much</i> weight she'd been gaining had eluded you until now. Dealing with your own stuff, the fan club and the horny headmistress and your OT3 friends could get to be a lot. But Bunnie was enormous\u2014her hips had checked the doorway, soft fat bulging out from either side of the structure as it fought her pillowy body's resistance. Her face was impossibly round and chinned twice over, her cute pink 'do making it look that much more spherical. Her arms, hammy and doughy beyond recognition, struggled to bend at the elbow as she doubled over to catch her breath. Her belly was so big, her expanded chef's smock rode up in the back to give everyone a nice flash of big round ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babes.\" Bunnie wheezed, \"It'd be a real shame if I couldn't... huff... if I couldn't... puff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie wiped the sweat from her forehead with one meaty arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to siddown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie Blake was fitting right in at Chubbeso Academy, alright...</span></div></div>",

But this team is horrible, the girls can barley stand let alone sumo wrestle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then Ms. Touya and her daughter entered the room and all the girls went silent.

Claire was wearing her own sumo style diaper and tank top, it was a hot pink color with floral print on them. \"MMhmm!\" said Ms. Touya, obviously her patience was running short.

You quickly realize that the crowd of rambunctious school girls was your fan club, eagerly waiting for you by your dorm room ready to do who knows what with you. You reverse back around the nearest corner to hide, then taking a peek from your position you count more than ten girls in the group. It would be tough, but you think you could just barely muscle your way through them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and start to run as quickly as you could towards your front door. \u201cThere he is!\u201d a girl shouts from the crowd and the crowd as one shifts their heads from your door (where they thought you were) to where you actually are, running at them like a mini bowling ball. Most of the girls step aside not wanting to get trampled although a few reach their hands out ready to \u201ccatch\u201d you. Your hands (trained from video games and maybe the second fastest part of your body) slap away their advances with rapid speed.  Batting a fifth hand away you manage to get your key out and pull the door open. Tumbling inside there\u2019s only a few seconds before one of the girls can put their foot in the door. Adrenaline pumping at maximum levels you quickly gets the door closed and lock it tightly, feeling like some sort of survivor of the zombie apocalypse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew! You wipe a bead of sweat from your brow as you collapse on the other side of the door. If this was how it was going to be every afternoon after school, maybe spending time with the sumo club was the better option. You would head back to the sumo arena tomorrow, not to wrestle, but at least to hide from the fan club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your last class of the day you made sure to be the first one in the arena, hoping to have time to talk Mrs. Touya before sumo practice actually began.  Your punctuality pays off as you see Mrs. Touya dressed in her own training mawashi (sumo outfit) a solid red in color, except for the orange training whistle which bounced side to side in front of her wide cleavage. Her top clings to her every curve, not hiding her large size but rather displaying it intimidatingly. You bound over the spongy training mats to meet her, but it takes a second for you to begin to speak, even if she was a retired sumo wrestler she still looked quite fearsome dressed in her full sumo attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to talk but before you can she moves to cut you off, a warm smile upon her face as she bows slightly to you, her enormous stomach bunching up like a fold in a beanbag chair. \u201cCJ, I humbly apologize for my behavior yesterday.\u201d She begins as she ends the bow, her voice not in the thick Japanese English she had scolded you with yesterday, but her warmer, smoother English.  \u201cYou see, I was a little angry because of a big problem I am facing. The school has had one of the greatest sumo teams around, but this year, we are, not so good.\u201d You remember yesterday how you noticed this year\u2019s team looked terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is why Dalton-san, I need you for the team! My own daughter truly gifted with the size and strength of a sumo wrestler has decided to do kendo, rather than take after her mother and join the team so you can imagine why I might have been a little upset. But You! You have already brought in a ton of new recruits, even my Sazuka herself expressed some interest the second she heard you would be joining,  that is I hope, if you still wish to  join.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly had not expected this\u2026Mrs. Touya\u2019s humble apology had caused your own feelings to do a complete reversal, and how could you possibly say no to a plea like that? \u201cOkay\u201d you consent \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d you say as your return her bow honorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d She says looking like she was about to wrap you in a big hug, catching herself she stopped just sort of sending you to be smothered in her cleavage.  \u201cThank you for very much. CJ-san. I promise to train you with the honor and respect that I give all my students. And from now on it is not Mrs. Touya, it is sensei Touya understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sensei!\u201d You shout back snapping into a salute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Now please follow me\u2026\u201d she stomps across the gym mat leaving deep and heavy footprints in the spongy material as she does so. Stopping just outside the locker room, she gestures for you to have a look inside. \u201cPlease find a mawashi that fits and come out ready to train\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cold pre-Chubbeso men\u2019s locker-room you find a few shrink wrapped packs of sumo belts.  Judging from size alone most of them look like they wouldn\u2019t fit your relatively skinny waist.  You take the smallest of the bunch, open it and try it on. It\u2019s a lose fit, but it mercifully covers more than you thought it would.  As you tie the belt tightly, you mutter a bit on how unfair it was that women wrestlers had both a top and a bottom to their outfit and you were supposed to wrestle shirtless. You sigh as you look at your semi-pudgy self in the mirror, and then try to put your meanest wrestler face on, but  try as you might, you hardly looking threatening. Sighing again, this time at the mess you had gotten yourself into, you slowly left the locker room and headed back to the sumo arena. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaving the locker-room you find the arena has begun to fill up with girls all looking to be trained by the all-star Mrs. Touya. You\u2019re caught by surprise as few catcalls and whistles rise up from a crowd of girls obviously energized by your emergence from the locker room. Turning red you quickly search for a place to hide, but instead find the trio of Kate, Rebecca and Claire and that was good enough. You cross half the gym and meet up with them having to walk awkwardly in the new outfit as you got used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey <i>big</i> <i>boy</i>\u201d Claire in her hot pink and floral print garb from yesterday. You blush even harder now, feeling diminutive compared to your generously ample associates. \u201cDon\u2019t be coy; you have no reason to be ashamed in front of the future queen of Chubbeso's sumo wrestling team.\u201d Claire had been thrilled ever since yesterday, not only would she be joining a sport she could really get behind, (figuring she was born for greatness as apparently in sumo the bigger the better and she was all about big) but, you\u2019d also be with her <i>and</i> would apparently be  bulking up as well. It was all too perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d Rebecca scoffed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that like the princess Kate? We haven\u2019t even started yet and already she wants to be Queen of the team.\u201d In truth Rebecca had wanted to be the queen-er- star-er-captain whatever the top sumo wrestler was called. Ever since she\u2019d came to Chubbeso academy and had stopped playing softball she\u2019d been dying for some sort of rough and tumble activity and apparently sumo wrestling would be it. Plus being the star of the team wouldn\u2019t hurt her chances of trying to get some \u2018attention\u2019 from you. Her mawashi had been one of the school's mass produced uniforms and since it was not custom tailored to her size (as Claire's was) she found that it gave her just the slightest bit of a wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease! How many times have I told you about that name?\u201d Claire bemoaned. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019ve already been to quite a few of the school sumo tournaments already with mother, and it doesn\u2019t look hard at all. In fact, mother said that I was born to lead and that I was practically raised to be a team leader.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh actually, the correct term for the head sumo wrestler is Yokozuna.\u201d piped Kate as she adjusted her glasses.  Kate had originally found the sport fascinating with its ancient traditions and customs, but she hadn\u2019t really wanted to actually <i> be</i> a sumo wrestler. But the fact that she was among friends always made things easier and today was no different and so she ignored how the tight fitting green uniform was making her feel, chunkier, than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Touya had been doing rounds of all the participating students\u2019 names and she finally makes her way to your group. Getting up you display your new garb for her feeling a bit ridiculous as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be moving up to the others in no time\u2026\u201d she adds appreciatively before writing your friends names down on her notepad. There was something about her words that just didn\u2019t sit right with you, and then they suddenly remind you that there was one more thing you were going to ask sensei Touya about. \u201cSo, uh, sensei\u2026 you were just kidding about the whole \u2018I have to weigh 300lbs by the end of the month\u2019 thing, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs warmly and squints her hazelnut brown eyes closed before quickly answering with a flat and hollow \u201cNo.\u201d  The grin that remained on her face was now eerily the opposite of her voice. You eyes bulge slightly as you finally grasp her answer.\u201cCJ-kun,\u201d she began now using the friendlier \u2018-kun\u2019 Japanese honorific than the honorable \u2018-san\u2019 to address you. \u201cTruly you are still, as I said yesterday\u2026to skinny. But I\u2019ve seen you running from many girls and even carry a few or two as they tried to uh, hug you, and you possess great leg strength, perfect for any sumo wrestler.  If were to put on a hundred pounds or so, and with my expert training you could be a champion. But! It\u2019s not enough for me to think so; you have to believe in yourself too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it over, you already weighed about 187lbs, well last time you checked, but to get to 300lbs\u2026That would take..113lbs!  113lbs just seemed like such a large number to reach in a month\u2026but maybe some of it would be muscle too not just fat\u2026Yeah! Sumo wrestlers had to be strong right? You could imagine yourself strutting down the hallways; a walking mountain of muscle, able to hold back even the fleshiest of fans, it did seem quite appealing. You decide to take her words as a sign of motivating you. Rebecca and Kate and well Claire too, were already set on this and you couldn\u2019t let them down either. You decide to give bulking up your best shot and hope Mrs. Touya wouldn\u2019t be too angry if you didn\u2019t reach that oh so high goal of 300lbs by the end of the month. But who knew? Maybe bulking up to sumo size would be\u2026fun!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWonderful!\u201d Sensei Touya said as she picked up her whistle and blew it loudly.\u201cAll right new recruits!\u201d she began proving to posses powerfully large lungs along with everything else. She headed up the stairs and onto the arena\u2019s center ring before continuing. \u201cOur first match against another school is in one month. I want to see what everyone has got today, so let\u2019s have a few matches to start! If you lose today don\u2019t worry there will be plenty of practices later. I have a list with all participants\u2019 names on it, so if your name is called please make you way to the center ring\u201d she closed her eyes and dragged her pen across the notepad, stopping on one of the names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire Masters!\u201d  She announced and a roar of applause goes up as a crimson clad Claire hopped to the stage, blowing kisses towards the crowd, and doing a few short poses as she reached the center. She lifts one leg up and down in a powerful stomp sending shock waves and jiggles across her large doughy midsection. The crowd of girls grew silent at the realization that next name would actually have to sumo against the goliath of a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Toruya closed her eyes again and picked the next name, reading it aloud it was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their bellies were smacking against on another and their breasts were pressed against each other viciously. While Claire had the weight advantage on her side, Rebecca has more muscle than she does which makes them dead even with neither one of them giving way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A minute or two later the match and both of the wrestlers, were still going strong. Rebecca was busy pushing forward with her leg and using her strong softball trained arms to find gain ground. Unfortunately as she pushed against the lake of pudding that was Claire\u2019s stomach, she only re-affirmed what everyone in the school already knew: Claire was heavy! Claire, having never been so <i>physical </i> with others, was unsure of what else she could do other than stay standing and use the weight difference to a heavy advantage in her favor. So, as Claire struggled against Rebecca, Claire awkwardly made to push her over. The act had little effect on Rebecca as she only slid back a few inches, her arms remaining never leaving their grip on the blonde's beefy shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca could feel her muscles getting tired as they strained, and so she went for one last shove. She quickly slid her hands off Claire\u2019s shoulders and charged full force against the mountain of pudge, pushing her hardest into the soft chest as a final attack. Claire cringed at impact, but surprisingly the blow hadn\u2019t hurt as much as she\u2019d expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca seemed equally surprised as her right hand hit slapped against Claire\u2019s soft and squishy fat, but she immediately countered with a shove from her left hand. Again the blow seemed to bounce off of Claire\u2019s blubber. It was no use; her might was no match against Claire and her gastronomic girth. Her hands were now actually sinking into the  stomach rolls of the self professed 'large and in charge' girl; soon her forward progress had halted leaving her running in place, unable to propel the princess and the incredible weight she possessed. Trying with all her might, and now literally face to face with Claire\u2019s weight, Rebecca realized grimly Claire wasn\u2019t budging. In fact Claire was now  looking somewhat amused by her futile effort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was a driven girl, Claire had to give her that\u2026but this was a date with C.J on the line and the Masters never surrendered. Then using her incredible pile of pound she called her stomach, Claire heaved forward, surprising Rebecca with a massive belly bump. The sudden act and shift in weight caught Rebecca off-guard, toppling her over onto her bum like a bag of overstuffed marshmallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated Rebecca gazed up as Claire\u2019s belly entered her vision, her dimpled face beaming down in victory as it as it rested atop of a gigantic gut. Claire then offered a hand to her fallen foe, in a true noble sportsmanship manner. Rebecca ignored the offer electing to standup on her own accord.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice! Both of you will make fine additions to the team!\u201dCommended sensei Toyua as the two returned to the bleachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job\u201d you say as you give a thumbs up to both of them, desperately trying not to show favoritism to either of the feuding female friends of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you C.J! Usually I\u2019m not one for such physical fisticuffs but I rather enjoyed that!\u201d Claire said as she took the spare seat on your left, forcing Rebecca to sit on the other side of Kate. Rebecca unhappily took her spot, not saying anything aloud to you, only grumbling something about a \u2018rematch later.\u2019 \"Oh and by the way I've got a little surprise planned for my big sumo wrestler man tonight.\" teased Claire as she scooted her booty ever closer to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, looking to Rebbecca and Kate for an answer, but Kate merely shrugged, and Rebbecca only frowned and crossed her arms tighter, still angry .   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later...\" Claire assures you as she rested a long and heavy arm around your neck, in order to snuggle even closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly puzzled by what Claire could possibly have planned, you turn your attention back to the ring and watch the next match. As the next wrestlers were announced for each match you would grow anxious hoping you wouldn\u2019t be the one wrestling next. A couple of matches later and you were starting to breathe a sigh of relief; it was starting to look like you wouldn\u2019t even be wrestling at all today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally our last wrestlers are\u2026\u201d Sensei Touya now checked her list for any names that had not been called, and she gave a slight smile as she stopped on your name, \u201cCJ Dalton\u201d The arena is filled with cheers and whistles once more as make your way to the ring, clearly the main event of the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026let\u2019s see your opponent shall be\u2026\u201d  Your sensei trailed off once more as she struggled to read the last name on the list. You yourself had lost track of who had and hadn\u2019t wrestled yet, but who could possibly be left? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was until Delphine Shuzumiya herself slowly skipped towards the stage. Delphine Shuzumiya; those innocent blue eyes, her unbelievably beautiful blonde hair neatly tucked into a ponytail, and that body! When it came to a girls figure were a lover of all shapes and sizes, a bi-sizual if you will, but Delphine sure made a case for girls with a slim hourglass figure. You give a *le* sigh just at the sight of the French girls face, forgetting that in a few moments you two would be wrestling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelphine!\u201d shouts Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delphine...\" Muttered Rebbeca<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelphine\u2026\u201d you say a goofy smile already starting to spread on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOui-er-hai-er-Hi!\u201d she says greeting you in French, then Japanese, then finally English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Delphine you\u2019re uh, joining the sumo team too?\u201d you ask. That's when you notice that Delphine seemed to the only girl here other than Claire that was wearing a custom made sumo outfit. It was a two-tone blue and white bodysuit, with one big red circle placed directly in the center, slightly warped by the large breasts that were stretching the fabric below it. The unique design seemed to represent both the French flag's colors while incorporating the rising sun of the flag of Japan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine seems to notice your glares and assumes it was because of the dashing design and not just because of the jaw dropping figure that it tried to contain. \u201c \"Oh, you like? I have spent many years with my mother in Tokyo, and I have always been fascinated by the sumo wrestling there. Now I\u2019ll finally be able to try it. <i>Fantastique</i>, non?\u201d she asks tilting her head cutely to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I mean yes! I-mean...aren\u2019t you a little\u2026thin for sumo?\u201d you ask one of the few women left in the school who you could actually get both arms around them ig you hugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true, but, as I explained to Mrs. Touya \u2013 I mean sensei Touya, at the heart of it, sumo is not just size, it is in the skills, smarts, and technique of the wrestlers. She was so moved, she agreed I could practice, but has instructed me to indeed, how you say? Put on the pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, Mrs. Touya began to chat with Delphine in Japanese, a language Delphine seemed to be expertly fluent in as she began to converse back.  Just another surprising ability the breathtaking Delphine possessed. Mid-conversation Delphine pauses and bats an eye towards you, then nods at whatever Mrs. Toyua had just instructed her. \u201cSe, Manfique!\u201d she says clapping her hands together as their talk finishes. Was Mrs. Touya giving the lightweight girl tips before the match? Was that cheating, or was it just coaching? Well, it didn't matter too much to you. You were feeling quite confident, that you could at least take down, Delphine. You had to have had at least 50lbs on the heart-stoppingly beautiful waif of a woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mrs. Touya had blown her whistle again and Delphine took her spot in the center ring. She looking quit comical as she stared you down posing in a hunkered into a fist down stance ready to charge, she looked about as intimidating as a slightly angry kitten. You had to smile, thankful that if you were wrestling anyone, it was one of the few girls in the school who actually weighed less than you. Okay It was time to make your sensei proud! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.J are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuzumiya-chan are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui-er-ha-\" Delphine didn't have time to correct her linguistics as Mrs. Touya had blown her whistle signaling the start of the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho comes out on top?</span></div></div>",

At first it was dead even, both of you trying to push the other to the opposite sides of the ring (while that was happening Delphine's breasts were sort of pressing against your chest). But then Delphine broke grip that you had one her and she started to use Harite technique (striking someone with the palms of your hands) on you and would not let up and what worst she was striking you towards the edge of the ring. You stood your ground near the edge and just as she was about to delivery the final strike a sudden burst of energy come over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly dodged the strike and started using the Harite technique as well on the surprised french girl until the you two were back at the center of the ring. Then completely out of no where you grabbed one of Delphine's arms and used your right leg to sweep Delphine's right leg causing her to lose her balance and fall over winning you the match. Being a former sumo champion Mrs. Touya instantly recognized the move as the kekaeshi (minor inner foot sweep) and was surprised that you pulled it off effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very amazing match.\" Mrs. Touya said while clapping her. \"With a little more weight you two will make great additions to the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen being a good sport you offered your hand to Delphine to which she accepted and the still surprised girl back one her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mon dieu (oh my gosh in french) CJ I had know idea you had that kind of energy in you.\" Delphine said in an admiring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the both of you return to the bleachers where the rest of the girls(except Rebecca who's still upset over her match) congratulated the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats on winning CJ.\" Kate said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kate.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go my big sumo of a man.\" Claire said while smothering you in her belly fat. \"Now your little surprise just got a whole lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to fill me in on that Claire.\" You replied muffling through her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tonight.\" Claire stated as she let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire still didn't say anything about what your surprise was, all she said was she'd pick you up at 6:30 pm and to wear something decent. You asked your friends but Kate had no idea about what's going on and Rebecca was still depressed about today. So when you got back to your dorm room, you basically watched a little tv and finished some homework. When it came close to 6:30 you went to your closet and put on a pair of cargo pants and a green and white stripped t-shirt. Then you heard the sound of a limousine pulling up and knew that it was Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd better get going.\" You said while taking a quick glance at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you locked the door and headed to the limo where the hefty maid driver opened the door and saw Claire. She was wearing a fancy purple dress(which was showing some cleavage) with watching shoes and earrings. She was dressed up like she was going to a movie premier in L.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look wonderful Claire.\" You said in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you CJ.\" Claire replied in an alluring voice. \"Hop in and lets get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you quickly got in, closed the door and the limo drove off. While inside Claire was sitting close to you and you felt a bit awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the surprise?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not much, just a dinner date at Shaunty's.\" Claire replied in a nonchalant tone. \"Mint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you the mint you just popped in your mouth was a special mint made by Abida which increases a person's appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and don't worry about picking something out CJ I know just the thing to satisfy us both.\" Claire said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon limo pulled up towards Shaunty's where the two of you got out and entered the restaurant. As soon as you entered one of the waitresses escorted the two of you to a large private booth where in almost no time at all another waitress appeared with a pen and paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Shaunty's where are slogan is high quality food for less my I take your order.\" The waitress stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure of what you were going to have but you had a feeling Claire did and Claire was going to order...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c<i>We </i>shall be having the around the world buffet. Both of us.\u201d announced Claire giggling in anticipation of the feast ahead.  You were a bit taken aback, a trip to Shaunty\u2019s was special enough, but the around the world buffet was the restaurants trademark dinner. The around the world buffet was exactly like a buffet table, but instead of sampling trays full of mass produced meals of meat and produce, every single offering on the lengthy table held the quality of a full course meal and these dishes and desserts were from all over the world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon we're sitting somewhere special\u201d Claire practically commands as she takes you by the hand. Along with the world spanning spread, Shaunty\u2019s also featured a number of private luxury booths, said booths were tables surrounded by a velvet curtain that diners could close if they wanted their dinner to be a little more private and a lot more romantic. Sliding your way into the spacious and secluded booth, you\u2019re only partly surprised as Claire scoots her caboose closer to you, ending up at arm\u2019s length away from your, rather than sitting  all the way across the wide table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire, are you gonna make me slide all the way around every time I  get up to  go to the buffet?\u201d You ask a few moments after your drinks had been brought to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, feeling hungry~?\u201d Claire teases, taking this as a sign that the appetite enhancing mint had gone into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,  in fact I'm starving! It\u2019s just usually when you go to a buffet -\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Mother\u2019s taken care of it. Having the buffet brought to you is the <i>only </i>way we Masters dine.\u201d Claire explains in her proudest of tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, an inconspicuous waiter popped in from outside the private booth, carrying a steaming hot plate of food. He was soon followed by two more, each of them carrying plates piled high with food.  You spend a second marveling at the food now crowding the table, unsure of where to start first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Dig in!\u201d Claire says as she hands you an empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving plate after plate brought to you seemed to go against the spirit of a buffet, usually you\u2019d meander about a bit and get a little of this and a little of that,  but tonight was different, you were eating with Claire tonight, and she made sure your servings were a lot of this and even more of that! Having the food brought to you certainly didn\u2019t taint the quality of the food as everything was still delicious.  The dinner began with a \u2018greatest hits\u2019 of sorts, with a set list that included the most popular foods of Shaunty\u2019s; Bourbon Chicken, Shrimp Fired Rice, and a warm platter of Beef Stroganoff. The hard day of wrestling you had done earlier must have really worked up an appetite as you found yourself quickly eating up a storm. Claire seemed to have noticed this too as she paused from her own eating to reset a soft dimpled cheek on one of her equally soft hands. \u201cHow the pepper steak?\u201d She asked positively glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph good!\u201d you say, mouth still full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I take it the bourbon chicken is good too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph\u201d you add cheeks full and nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m so happy to hear it!\u201d she says practically giddy at your gluttony. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing too. You need to eat more! Claire insists as she scoops more Chicken satay onto your plate. \u201cYou just eat until your little belly is full!  If you want to grow up and be a future sumo star you can\u2019t skip out on seconds and thirds. Especially consider our first meet is in a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly gulp hard on a mouthful of French bread \u201cA...month?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, next month is the first if our three annual competitions with Silverfish academy.  The wrestlers there are such mean girls! <i>And</i>, they\u2019re big and strong too! So if you want to stand a chance you\u2019d better eat up.\u201d She adds sliding another plate towards you, one which you immediately began to work through. Claire sighed lovingly; truly she was at her happiest watching you stuff yourself as she herself enjoyed a feast fit for a queen. Not only would you become her super sized sumo hero, but as every woman of the Masters family knew, the stomach was the quickest way to a man\u2019s heart and right now she was as close as she'd ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s pep talk seemed to win you over, as you quickly discovered no matter how much your tummy filled and swelled and stuffed to its limit, it only increased your appetite. As the meal went on the food became more exotic. Italian Creamy Chicken Alfredo, hearty Irish Corn Beef and Cabbage, Indian Punjab! All  of it went warm and smoothly down the hatch. It was only after some Turkish Baklava when your hyper-digestion began to deteriorate.  A heavy haze now swirled about you, as your mind attempted to catch up with how much you had actually stomached. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my big sumo? Up for some Italian Ice?\" Her royal \u2018wideness asks noticing how flushed your cheeks were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cClaire, \u2026*<b>bruraap* </b>\u2026 uncontrollably a deep burp escapes your stomach relieving just the tiniest bit of pressure from the science experiment of digestive foods currently going on. \"I don\u2019t think I can eat anymore.\u201d You moan gently pushing away the plate. \u201cI\u2026hurrg\u2026just wanna go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course! Of course...\u201d Claire says consoling you matronly. She knew that the sooner you slept the sooner all those calories would go straight to yours sumo in training body. You really had been quite the little trooper, shoveling down all that food like a real champ. She was so proud! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however were not so excited. Curdled in the fetal positional in the backseat of her limo, you begin to feel dizzier and dizzier with every turn the car made. You close your eyes and clench your teeth until the limousine finally stops outside your place.\u201cThanks Claire *<b>hic</b>* I\u2026had a real good time.\u201d  you mumble crawling out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time my little-er <b>big </b>hunk\"Claire says leaning in and quickly planting a wet kiss on your cheek. You're so full you don't even bother wiping the kiss of, and instead merely wave as the limo takes off.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDrowsily you stumble your way inside with your guts splashing about inside you as you finally limp into your bed. Crawling under the blankets you hoped that being a sumo in training wouldn\u2019t always be this\u2026painful. Soon enough the warm lull of food settling in your stomach slowly brings you to a peaceful sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut to:</span></div></div>",

Kate volunteered to hold the dummy so you could go first but Kate had a worried look on her face like something was bugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething on your mind Kate?\u201d You asked while practicing your thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really it\u2019s just that the coach looked at me when she said some of the students barely made it on to the team.\u201d Kate replied. \u201cI don\u2019t really blame her since my match was kind of pathetic and the only reason I won was because of pure luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you practice harder so you can into the swing of things.\u201d You stated with confidence. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to be 300lbs by the end of the month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the other side of the gym Claire was holding the dummy for Delphine since she insisted on going first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe sure to hold the dummy nice and steady mademoiselle Claire.\u201d Delphine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever frenchy just make you don\u2019t get sent flying across the gym once it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Claire replied while looking in the direction you were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was obviously disappointed that she didn\u2019t get partnered with you but there were plenty of opportunities in the future for that. What was really on her mind was that the dinner last night didn\u2019t put much weight on you as she hoped. She asked Abida calculate your weight after that pig-out and your just above 200 lbs. But she needs to get you up to 300 so you can stay on the team. Even with the sumo diet Claire was worried that you wouldn\u2019t reach the goal in time.

Once she got there she noticed that her mom's door was closed (either she was in a meeting or she was pigging out with Ms. Telleri) and Abida was was doing some paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abida I need your help with something.\" Claire stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it young mistress?\" Abida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something that fatten up CJ over a period of time so he can stay on the sumo team.\" Claire replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me.\" Abida said while grabbing Claire's pudgy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbid dragged Claire to an area that was a few minutes away from her mother's office and realized that this was Abida's workshop. If there were two things that Claire learned about Abida's property it was don't enter her bedroom back at the mansion without her permission (because the last she went in there alone she wound up with green hair for a month). But most importantly don't enter her workshop...at all, it was of the few places that Claire kept her nose out of because who know what goes on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here.\" Abida ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after ten minutes of waiting Abida comes out with a small bottle of liquid and an eyedropper that goes with it. The liquid inside is as clear as water but Claire couldn't make any of the words on the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Claire asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret chinese medicine.\" Abida stated. \"This flavorless, odorless liquid when mixed with water will caused the drinker to slowly swell up over time.\" \"All you need to do is go behind the dorms where the drinking water supply is put in CJ's water and he'll become the largest sumo the world has ever know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes when she heard her mother's assistant told her (not to mention that was the longest time Abida talked outside of her short one sentences) and couldn't believe that such a medicine exists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I must warn you that this stuff is very potent.\" Abida stated. \"Only put of a few drops in it if you don't want your beloved CJ to become an immobile blimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening Claire snuck into the dorm's water supply as instructed and looked for the pipe that had your name on it. She easily found it right next to Rebecca's. She opened the small hatch and got the medicine out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how much should I put in?\" Claire pondered. \"I know two drops should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Claire took the eyedropper, squeezed a little of the liquid into the dropper and put two drops of it in your water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ your about to become the man of my dreams.\" Claire said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that she noticed Delphine's water pipe and thought about today's practice and how she barely kept the dummy still when she was practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let frenchy weigh down the team.\" Claire stated as she put a drop of the medicine into her water. \"I know you'll thank me for this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Switching over to you*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were watching TV with nothing better to do you here a knock at your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its me...\" the voice said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\"Mmm..Let's practice now. I really don't like to work on a nice full stomach\" decided Kate as she released you from her uncannily large valley of boob flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" you say happy to be able to breathe again. \"Get your miwashi on and meet me at the sumo practice room.\" So, after one more breath squeezing hug, Kate waddled out of your room. The two of you then squeezed into your wrestling attire before finally reaching the soft mat padded sumo practice room. Getting into stance on one end of the practice ring, you noticed something odd about your opponent on the opposite end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, don't you want to take your glasses off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But I can't see without them\" explained the nearsighted girl sheepishly. \"I mean we're just practicing right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if you want to train, you have to train for real. Plus, I really don't want to break your glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" bemoaned Kate, filling away getting contacts onto her mental to-do list. As she set them aside she was slightly dazed, quite unused to her un-equilibriated eyesight. Slowly stumbling to her spot in the ring, Kate hunched into position while squinting. At the sight you almost burst out laughing, hunched over and squinting like this Kate looked like a defenseless bunny. This was also going to make wrestling with Kate quite the problem. When you wrestled with Delphine, it had been different,  <i>she </i>had been the aggressive one,  but somehow during the match something inside of you had just 'clicked' as you were forced to defend yourself.  Even if attacking Kate like this felt mean, maybe you could  try something to spark her to start fighting back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Kate, I'm gonna try and push you over. I just want you to try and stop me okay?\" you explain cautiously to the ever so kind Kate. \"Don't worry about hurting me, just push back with everything you've got!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Kate still squinting as she was squatting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just put your hands out and stop me, without falling over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.J I don't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I come!\"  you shout speeding at her. You watch as Kate immediate flinches and moved her hands to cover her face. You how ever make contact, pressing your shoulder deep into her chest. You begin to try and move your hands around Kate's wide stomach to get a better grip on your opponent but you only get your arms partway around her. Disappointingly Kate is showing zero resistance to your attack, but  what was even <u>worse </u>was that you were still struggling to push her over!  Sure you could sweep the leg and possibly take her out, or even give her an open hand slap to the chest to possible take her down, but the whole point of this extra training was to get Kate comfortable with wrestling if she wasn't fighting back with you then she definitely wasn't going to be ready against a bigger,stronger, and less friendly opponent. So, tightening your grip on her wide and jiggly waist and using your legs (which had grown strong from weeks of escaping from your fan club) you push against all of Kate's weight and finally overpower her. You could feel her as she toppled over, her butt tumbling backwards and hitting the padded floor with a resounding smack, which then was followed by you landing smack on top of her, her  ginormous grape-fruit like boobs serving as the ultimate airbags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate you've got to push back!\" you explain, (only after taking your sweet sweet time getting up from the compromising position.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" said Kate, still lying flat on her back and looking like an overturned and overstuffed turtle plushie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, change of plans. Why don't <i>you </i>try to attack <i>me</i>? Just come at me and <i>I'll </i>try to stop <i>you</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...if you say so...\" Kate said dourly getting up from the floor. This time Kate started with some distance in between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...Go!\" you shout hoping to spur her fighting spirit. Kate took off charging at you as fast as she could. The sight of a squinting 250+ teenage beauty charging at you was not a sight you got to see every day and you simply had to laugh as she charged you wildly. It certainly didn't help Kate that she was so...bouncy, even with a tight miwashi on,  her bra-less boobies had a delicious wild bounce to them while she was sprinting, maybe if she taped them up... Your face glows red and you begin to get lost in your thoughts forgetting that the wall of flesh in front of you was still aiming to bowl you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAM</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you collide and this time it was you who wasn't fighting back. As Kate's corpulence falls upon you, the two of you collapse into a squirming, sweaty, giggling heap.  Still on top of you, Kate is wide eyed wondering what you thought of her performance. \"How'd I do?\" she asks looking at you for approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ugh. Good, very...huh...good.\" you manage to eek out between breaths. \"Now, help me up please.\" you gasp your face now really getting red.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sure.\" she said extending you a hand.  \"Want to go again?\" she asks as you slowly catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...uh...it's alright. Next time...I want to see you wrestle like that.\" you say gasping (and checking your body for any injuries.)  \"Come on let's go eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your room you begin using the tainted tap water to brew a beefy chanko broth.  The hot water came together with a mix of vegetables and meat, soon the stew started to smell real good. Over two very large bowls of chanko, you and Kate began  making conversation once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we can always practice more later okay?\"  you say finishing the fattening food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and I'll work on getting those contacts too I promise.\" Kate says stomach filled with the delicious dinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at Sumo club, Ms. Touya had everyone pair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we'll be doing practice matches today. Now, don't worry no ones getting kicked off the team if they lose, just give it your all, and make sure you pay attention during every match.\" Ms. Touya had read off a list of names once more and soon it was just four of you; Rebbecca, Claire, Delphine and yourself. Waddling over to your group she explains what she had planned for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.J. Shuzumia-chan. I want you both to try and wrestle outside your weight class today. Delphine I'll let you pick you're opponent first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly thrilled by either of the options in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca was heavy and strong. Sure she had lost to Claire, but it was only due to Claire's immense heaviness (something you still currently working on.) And even with your great ability, Rebbecca was definitely the competitive type and probably could have her way with you if you got in the ring with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Claire was even <i>heavier </i>and just plain <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>big</b></font>. If you were only <u>just </u>able to take Kate down, how well could you possibly do if you went up against Claire? </span></div></div>",

It was like you were punching pizza dough, but except this dough ball could hit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh CJ I didn't know you could get aggressive like that.\" Claire said in an alluring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Claire started to move slightly which caused her cleavage and gut to press against you, making you wonder if she was taking this practice seriously or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your enjoying this aren't you.\" You muffled through her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Claire replied with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far this practice match was not looking good for you.

You were as of yet unable to summon the 'sumo instinct' you had shown against Delphine. Not to mention Claire (whose muscles were by no mean \"strong\") was still certainly heavy enough to have her way with you the entire match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of right now she'd slung  her warm fat laden arms around you, crunching you into the tightest of bear hugs.  Ms. Touya looked on a bit puzzled, the move wasn't exactly illegal in sumo, but was certainly rarely seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUselessly your arms struggled against Claire, pushing against her insurmountable weight. Tighter and tighter she snuggled your face in close against her, letting her hands explore your bare back.  Now blinded by her boobies, you reached for something anything to push out against and push away from this death lock of a hug. Reaching,flailing, when suddenly....What was this soft, yet spongy, it was...you'd just grabbed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" Claire shrieked sound more surprised then offended. You had just given Claire and inadvertent 'titty twister'.  Her hands flung up into the air in wild surprise as a shocked and embarrassed cover your red face. Fortunately she'd dropped you and you'd landed on your feet, the match was still on, you had finally gotten some fresh air into your lungs, and there was still a chance you could win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it when you play naughty...\" said Claire regaining her low centered balance and ready for another attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrestling instincts taking over once more, you realized that the best plan of attack was to sweep Claire's load bearing legs, perhaps the girls only weak point.You charged at her lowering yourself for the sneaky attack. Unfortunately for you there's a bit too much distance between you and Claire and she sees the attack coming. Slowly sidestepping, she turns and gives you a playful slap on your keester. \"I can be naughty too...\" she taunts clearly enjoying every minute of the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that this WAS an actual match Claire decided to at least make sure you looked good enough to stay on the team. So when you came back to give her an open palm slap, she over-exaggeratedly flailed backwards as if she'd been shot. \"Oof!\" she moaned tottering a bit before righting herself. Soon you were locking arms around her waist once more. Claire enjoying the wriggling sensation as you pseudo-massaged her ginormous gut. But clearly the time to end the match was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gave a shake and then suddenly was slowly falling on top of you letting you hit the mat first and loosing the match. Bam! Well more like..SMOOSH! All 300+ belly-centric pounds of the blonde brit topple upon you, covering you in ever pound of her pudge. Claire gets up a few second later, again savoring the sensation of you squashed beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very...good\" says Mrs. Touya after a short puzzled pause. \"Claire is clearly the winner.\" Claire raises her hands in victory to a round of applause from the crowd. Then offering you a hand up asks. \"You okay darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Claire...\"you wheeze standing up. \"Maybe a few broken bones but I'm fine..\" you mutter walking back to your seat. With another wink and a blown kiss from Claire you return to your sport next to Kate ready to watch rather than participate in the next match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho Wins?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mount the stairs to the stage you have mixed feelings about going up against Claire. Yes, pushing your body against hers would be... interesting, but this is supposed to be a competition. Not going to be that easy when you're combating your own hormones and Claire at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest case scenario: you push her out of the ring quickly, before you have a chance to get too aroused. Against a smaller opponent you might try to throw them off their feet, but Claire is like a boulder of flesh. Rolling her is the only option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the circle and take your place, copying the footstomp routine you've seen before and hoping you're not accidentally disrespecting sumo tradition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensei Touya takes her place between you and Claire, asking if you were each ready. After a pair of affirmatives she raises a hand, then throws it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you charge at one another, you a bit faster and more aggressive than her, and with an audible 'slap!' your potbelly smashes against Claire's washtub. You tense your legs and begin pushing, your arms trying to find a good grip on Claire's thick middle. For her part Claire plants her feet and resists, but it takes several seconds for you to realize she's not pushing back, not trying to throw you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmmmm, CJ.\u201d You turn your head to get a look at her face. Her eyes are closed, she's blushing, and you see the widest, sloppiest grin. She throws her own arms around you and pulls you closer, one hand reaching down to grip your butt in a move you are sure is not part of some strategy relating to the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try pushing with your legs, but all you do is press harder against Claire. A full minute passes, the cheers of the audience dying down as the only thing that happens is the spreading realization that Claire isn't trying to win but rather using the 'match' as a chance to get closer to you than any other girl has before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood in the audience is turning against Claire, but Sensei Touya was getting frustrated for a different reason:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMasters!\u201d She snaps. \u201cIf you won't take this seriously I'm cutting you from the team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once Claire gets serious, heaving you up and throwing you around so suddenly you don't react until you're pinned to the ground beneath the gargantuan girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, Masters,\u201d Sensei Touya says, before adding \u201cThough you could have won a lot sooner if you'd tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can get off him now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Sorry.\u201d Claire chuckles, waiting another beat before rolling off you.

If you were heavier you wouldn't have been tossed around like a ragdoll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sensei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't have to worry about CJ getting in shape,\u201d Claire says, throwing an arm around you and squeezing you tight. \u201cI'll make it my personal mission to get him bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire doesn't let go of you for the rest of the practice, to Rebecca's consternation, and after you've changed back into your school clothes and are heading home for the day she's outside the locker room waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ!\u201d she's grabbed an arm and is pulling you towards her waiting limo, \u201cWe need to get started right away if we're going to get you looking like a true sumo.\u201d She pats your potbelly for emphasis, clearly imagining it swelling and getting rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give token resistance as you're pulled into the limo, more habit than anything; there's truth to her words, bulking up would require time and effort, so no time like the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've already called ahead to have my servants prepare a calorie-laden feast for you, and I promise you're not leaving until you've eaten every bite.\u201d She's leaning on you now, getting comfortable, as the two of you sit back and feel the limo pull away from the school. \u201cWith my help, you'll be the biggest, strongest sumo in the ring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d a voice says from across the seating area.

Translation: I don't care why you're in my limo, but how dare you intrude on my private time with CJ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm doing my part to help the sumo team,\u201d Rebecca answered, spreading her arms on the back of the seats and kicking her feet up. Translation: I'm making sure you don't get any alone time with my... friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Translation: What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard what the sensei said to CJ. He's got a start on strength, but he needs size to back it up. And while I wouldn't want to question your ability to pack on the pounds, I'm worried CJ won't reach his true potential with you hovering around him, always making him nervous. He needs to know he has the support of everyone on the team.\u201d Translation: As if I'm going to sit back and let you manufacture your own daily binge sessions with CJ. Someone needs to keep you in line, princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd perhaps you were hoping I could help you get to a respectable size at the same time? You don't have to be ashamed to admit it, not everyone has the gift for the sport that I do.\u201d Translation: You forget your place. A backhanded compliment about my size only reinforces my natural talent and destiny to be the team's star (after CJ, of course), while also allowing me to remind you that you're not enough woman for CJ and your efforts in the club will be woefully lacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving a few more pounds might help, I suppose, though my natural athleticism shouldn't be ignored.\u201d Translation: You're just a spoiled fatass who's too heavy to be moved. Just wait until you're in the ring with me. It'll be a treat to humiliate you at your own game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiles on Claire and Rebecca's faces were hollow, their eyes speaking the truth to the venomous rancor infused in every exchanged word. It's so clear you can't fail to notice it, and as Claire's grip on you tightens you waffle between staying silent or jumping in and attempting to defuse the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a change of subject is needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Claire. What's this special meal you promised me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Claire. I'm interested in hearing about this.\u201d Rebecca says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy waste words,\u201d Claire says,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhy waste words when you can see for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo was slowing down, pulling up in front of Masters Manor. An attendant opened the door for Claire, and you and Rebecca follow her into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home, Miss Masters,\u201d various butlers and maids call out as Claire waddles in through the grand front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the meal ready as I instructed, Emily?\u201d Claire asks a portly maid roughly her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, miss. And will your other friend be dining as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Claire says, putting an arm around you and leading you to the dining room. \u201cShe can use a proper meal, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, who had been gaping at the sheer size of the mansion, now remembered Claire's presence and got irked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how generous of you,\u201d she said sarcastically. Picking up her pace, she comes up alongside you, squeezing you between her oversized hip and Claire's oversized everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the banquet hall (Rebecca failing to hide how impressed she was) the table had been set with a giant pasta feast. Bunnie, the school chef, was bringing in a couple last dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTa dah!\u201d Claire said theatrically, as if she had prepared the food herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's pasta.\u201d You say, feeling underwhelmed after the build-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHigh in carbohydrates, drowning in heavy sauces, an excellent source of quick poundage.\u201d Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you took your seats, you ending up hemmed in between the two girls. Bunnie had gone all out, which was doubly impressive given the short notice she was given to prepare all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunnie, you have outdone yourself,\u201d Claire said, scooping a plate of linguine alfredo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all looks so good, I don't know where to start. But that's always a problem with your cooking.\u201d Rebecca added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say anything, you just start getting some food (it was as delicious as it looked) for yourself while enjoying the respite from Claire and Rebecca's snarking at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't last, though. After a couple courses Rebecca starts to slow down; she's reaching her limit, but she won't just concede so quickly. Claire, focused on her own food, doesn't notice it at first, but soon the porky princess reaches the point where she feels she can slow down and turn her attention toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still eating heartily; you're sated, but the point of this is to get as much food into you as you can, so you keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ, you have to try the ravioli.\u201d Claire scoops some more food onto your plate, then notices Rebecca's languid chewing. \u201cDid you enjoy your meal, Rebecca?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't talk like I'm already finished,\u201d she answers, her irritation coming back to her. And with new resolve she took another massive bite of spaghetti, chewing forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother period of silence, Rebecca's pace slowing down a little until she was nearing a clean plate; and then the promise of reaching an endpoint gave her the last necessary boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last bite she leaned back, content and fighting the urge to pull her shirt up over her belly in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ, dear, could you pass the angel hair in pesto? I've still got so much room.\u201d Claire said, her tone sweet but devious and her words being carried past you to their intended target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to herself, Rebecca reached out to add more food to her plate. The battle was already lost \u2013 as Claire loaded a new plate she continued eating without trouble, while Rebecca struggled to chew a single bite \u2013 but the pear-shaped girl would only concede defeat when forced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part you had cleaned four plates (and the plates at the Masters house were large, much larger than regular dinner plates) piled high with food, but you were reaching your own end point. Claire didn't notice, though, as she was looking through you at Rebecca. Rebecca's belly was swollen big and round, pain was clear on her face. The plate in front of her was still nearly full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I'm not being presumptuous again,\u201d Claire said, \u201cbut I don't think you can eat any more. It would be a waste to throw it all up before you can digest it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she wrapped her lips around a couple ravioli and continued eating with the same vigor as when she started, tipping her plate right to her mouth to shovel the food in faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rebecca's anger vanished immediately, for an idea had come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ? Could you rub my belly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her chair around so she could face you, leaning back and lifting her shirt up. Not all the way, but just a peek. And here, a peek was a lot. Leaning back, her belly loomed in front her and looked even bigger than it was. And with a sliver of flesh winking at you? It wasn't easy to resist reaching out and stroking that big ball of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why resist it? She was asking you to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand was headed to her belly, but Claire spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ needs to concentrate on eating. That's why we're here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't turned from her own food, but apparently her interest in you trumped even her interest in food and some sixth sense alerted her to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can do both,\u201d Rebecca said, \u201cEat with one hand and rub my belly with the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire almost bit down on her tongue, but she didn't have a response to that. So as you switched your fork to your other hand she could only glare straight ahead and keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooh, CJ. That feels soooooo good.\u201d Rebecca moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had no more tricks up her sleeve, and tried to bury her frustration with food. If it were possible she was eating faster now, and by the time you hit the point of pain she was finishing her own gorge as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBWARP! Oh, excuse me,\u201d Claire said, putting her plate down and patting her belly. She was leaning back herself, but it was hard to tell since her belly was so big naturally. \u201cNow the second part: a nap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter a big meal you're supposed to take a nap and digest everything you eat.\u201d Claire explained. \u201cIt's what sumos in training to do put on weight. Actually, they skip breakfast, eat a big lunch and then take a nap, but I think there's a fundamental flaw in that strategy. Namely, you're not eating at any opportunity. But a nice nap to follow a big meal is just a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have a room ready for you, CJ,\u201d and then, in a resigned tone, \u201cAnd I guess you can take one of the guest rooms, Rebecca.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire led you to your room, since it was 'right next to mine!' she said enthusiastically, while one of the maids showed Rebecca to a guest room. After turning down Claire's offer to share her bed ('It's quite large and really comfortable,' she argued) you shut the door and went to lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relief to get away from Claire and Rebecca. Even when they were silent there was a tension in the air just from their close proximity. Kicking your shoes off, you fell backwards onto the bed. Your belly was stuffed, sticking up into the air; even with a year of indulging at Chubbeso you couldn't remember the last time you had gone all out like this, and right now you didn't think you ever could again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your eyes and waited for sleep to take you, but before you knew it</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your thoughts drifted in and out of lucidity, the still air of the room and the burden of food in your belly taking you to the line separating consciousness from sleep even as your conscious mind was still active and nimble. You thought of nothing in particular, unable to calm down and let sleep take you. The curtains were pulled and the room was dark, creating a sense of void; you had lost your sense of time or even where you were. What time was it? How long had you been lying there, trying to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was warm, light was peeking through the curtains, it was afternoon. You were drowsy. You got it in your head you were at your apartment, it was morning, and did you have school today? Then you realized no, you'd already gone to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise, the door opening. You turn over and look blearily, see the door is closed. Then you hear something to your side. There's a door in the wall, Claire is coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right. You were at her house, taking a nap in the room next to hers. And it seems the rooms were connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was attempting to walk lightly, but at her size stealth was not for her. You prop yourself on an elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Startled. \u201cThought you were still asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven't had time to fall asleep yet. Wait.\u201d You notice a clock on the wall. It's almost 4:30. \u201cGuess I did. But why were you sneaking into m- this room?\u201d You almost said 'my room,' but you're sure a slip like that wouldn't be missed by Claire. Give her the chance and all of your things would be moved into the bedroom next to hers before the day was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just bringing a little snack,\u201d and you see she's carrying a giant plate of brownies. You should be sick of food, but as the smell reaches you you decide you do have room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You sit up and take one, Claire inviting herself to sit down next to you. \u201cI don't have much room, but I guess I can have one. You can take the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that will never do. You gotta have more than one if you're going to follow Sensei Touya's command to get in shape.\u201d Claire said, sitting up straight and becoming a bit authoritative. \u201cI can see you need a true glutton's guiding hand if you want to get anywhere. Here's the rule: for every one I eat, you eat one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma'am.\u201d You say, sarcastically saluting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire picked up a brownie and practically inhaled it. Getting into her game, you hurry to finish the one you had taken a bite out of. While you were chewing the last bite, Claire picked up a second one, wolfing it down before you had even started a second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went, Claire racing through a new brownie every time you were almost finished with one. The first couple went down easily, but soon you were feeling a fullness in your belly again. Claire either didn't know or didn't care, for she kept grabbing a new brownie and silently pushed you on to continue your own binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still the better part of a dozen brownies left when you started to have trouble breathing. You were getting full again, rapidly approaching the point of actual pain. But Claire had never left food on her plate before in her life, and she wasn't about to let you do so now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might help you to loosen your pants,\u201d Claire said. Figuring it was dark enough in the room with the curtains still drawn that it wouldn't be unseemly (or rather, that Claire wouldn't get too excited), you undid the button on your trousers and let your belly breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't complete relief, but it was something. Enough to help carry you through the last few brownies (Claire grabbed the last one for herself, her willpower around food strained to the limit by giving up half the plate), though when it's done you have to fall back and lie down, your belly poking straight up into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d Claire said, reaching over to stroke your belly. In your state you weren't fit to fight her, and besides it felt good. \u201cBut we still have leagues to go. A little snack like that wouldn't suit me as a dessert after a proper meal, but here it's left you winded and almost at the point of getting sick. We've got our work cut out for us, don't we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's this 'we,' Claire?\u201d You wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I. I told Sensei Touya I was going to make fattening you up my job, didn't I? Or do you think you can get to 300 on your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your eyes, hoping for a fleeting second that if you don't answer Claire will forget about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that won't happen. A directive from a teacher that you gain weight? If you didn't know better you'd suspect Claire of being behind this, probably using her mother's influence to get Sensei Touya to tell you to gain weight. This had to be a dream come true for her, no way was she just going to drop the matter. Even if you told her you'd gain weight on your own (and how well do you think you would manage by yourself?) she'd try to find some way to play an active role in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you asked her to help you, how far would she run with this? What plans did she have for fattening you up? They would be effective, no doubt about that, but 'restraint' was not a word that came to mind when you saw Claire. You only needed to get to 300 pounds, not 500 or 600.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which would it be: the efficient and risky path, or the reserved but perhaps unsuccessful one?</span></div></div>",

Besides, with the warm weather starting to set in, it\u2019d be perfect to just relax in a cool pool after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-And its g-good exercise t-too!\u201d Kate added, her face lighting up at the prospect of slimming down with the swim team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right, you never did tell Rebecca and Kate about what had happened between you and the swim team captain Chris \u2013 About how you accidentally, again ACCIDENTALLY, ran into her one morning and saw under her skirt (plus, there were other reasons, but it\u2019d probably take about thirty pages to describe them all, so please bear with it). Even before that, the girl didn\u2019t seem to like you at all either\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ Dalton!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in surprise at the sudden calling of your name and immediately look back to see Rebecca and Kate just as surprised as you are. If the call didn\u2019t come from behind, then you slowly look forward, thinking that the worst you could see was a group of your fan girls coming to abduct you and force you into their club based on you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 However, when you turned around, you were now facing what appeared to be a large pair of sweater puppies that struggled to be contained in the school\u2019s girl uniform top. A little surprised, you stagger back slightly to see that those huge knockers (which were on par with Claire\u2019s!) belong to a rather interesting looking girl. She was quite a bit taller than you (at least half a head taller, so you had to look up and past her swollen mammary to look her in those oddly purple colored eyes of hers) and had a very over the top hourglass figure that had the tiny markings of a slightly swollen middle. Her skirt was up a little higher than most girls, but that that was obviously due to the large thighs and buns she sported on her body. Her face was a little chubby, but still really cute and was topped with long black hair (with dark purple highlights) that flowed past her shoulders and most likely reached to the hams that were her backside. The girl had her arms folded under her impressive bust and smiled at you, \u201cOf course you\u2019re CJ Dalton, correct? You are the only guy in this entire school of course\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was a little flushed, but you nodded in response to the curvy young woman before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d The curvy student replied as she sauntered a little closer to you, making your face turn a little bit redder. \u201cAllow me to introduce myself, I am Suzuka Touya, the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the captain of the Kendo Team, right?\u201d Rebecca questioned, making Suzuka blink her large eyes a few times in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you\u2019ve heard of me,\u201d Suzu stated with a warm smile. \u201cAnd you know my title, that\u2019ll save a lot of time then. So, I\u2019ll get right to the point, CJ-kun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp when Suzu added that little honorific to your name, from the girl\u2019s name and accent, she was obviously Japanese, a rather exotic treat to this academy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs captain of the kendo team/club,\u201d Suzu continued, immediately lifting one of her hands up to her face to brush out some hair away from her eyes. \u201cI would like to extend an invitation to you and your two charming little friends here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Little?\u2019</i> You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo join our fine group,\u201d Suzu offered with a warm smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait, what?\u201d You questioned as Suzu turned around, giving you a good look at the meaty legs and bubble butt the girl had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like repeating myself,\u201d Suzu replied as she sauntered off slowly, swaying her hips. \u201cBut, if you and your friends wish to join the Kendo club, my offer still stands, and trust me\u2026 It\u2019s a good offer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, with her making your heart beat like a fast paced engine and your face bright red, Suzu began to disappear into the halls\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Now what were you going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All you managed to do was tire yourself out and force yourself to slide to the ground with sweat rolling down your hair. \u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the sound of heavy footsteps (there was only one set from what you could tell, since it didn\u2019t sound like a stampede) echoed through the hallway. Either it was Rebecca coming to smack you upside the head for ditching her and Kate, one of your fan girls, or whatever. If anything, it probably wouldn\u2019t end well for you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, if it isn\u2019t CJ-kun,\u201d a familiar Japanese accented voice called your name, making you turn around\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 With you being met with a familiar pair of large breasts bouncing right over your head, it didn\u2019t take a genius to recognize who the small potbelly and thunderous thighs belonged to. Quickly gathering your breath, you stand up in an attempt to look Suzuka (Suzu) in the eyes (although you were looking just at the top of her breasts at your full height). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you were trying to look her in the eyes, Suzu leaned forward slightly to help accommodate you, letting her monstrous breasts hang downwards, struggling between the confines of her uniform top (and more than likely a triple XL bra). \u201cYou got here fast than I did. I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be so interested in the kendo club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, I was always i-interested in this sort of stuff,\u201d You huffed out a reply, not telling the over exaggerated hourglass figured girl that you were more interested in losing some weight and improving your strength, heck if you just tired out from trying to open those doors to the club room, then you\u2019d have no chance from trying to break free from your rabid fan club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, hmm, hmm, interesting,\u201d Suzu giggled, making her bust jiggle in rythem with her laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that, well then, should we head in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, t-that\u2019s what I was trying to do,\u201d You replied with a blush on your face. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course, CJ-Kun,\u201d Suzu replied with a wag of a chubby finger at you. \u201cThe door\u2019s locked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally slapped yourself for not thinking of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu on the other hand was standing up straight and had reached into the collar of her top, digging deeper into the expanse that was her cleavage. \u201cI have the key to the room right here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate it, Suzu pulled her hand back out and revealed a key on a long chain link necklace. Not interested in keeping it up in the air, Suzu just released her hand and allowed the key fall in between her large breasts on the outside of her uniform. \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t normally enter in through these doors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d You question as Suzu threw her arm around your shoulders and immediately pulled you close to her large body (squishing your face against her left breast, making a large blush creep on your face). \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, CJ-kun,\u201d Suzu giggled, making you feel the motions in her jiggling breast flesh, the blush on your face growing deeper and deeper. \u201cWe enter through the locker rooms! Hmm, speaking of, since you\u2019re interested in the kendo club, I might as well get you fitted for a kendo uniform. We\u2019ve got some spares in the locker room, and I think we might have a bogu and hakama in your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you want, I could give you a demonstration on how to put the clothes on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-WHAT?!\u201d You yelped as Suzu began to pull you (as you suspected, her size indicated that she was a lot stronger than you) closer to the locker room door. \u201cB-B-But, I\u2026 I can\u2019t! I\u2019m a g-g-guy and if there are any other g-g-girls in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you honestly think that any girls would mind you getting undressed in front of them?\u201d Suzu pointed out, her strength and weight forcing you closer towards the door. \u201cBesides, the club won\u2019t be starting for a good while now, it\u2019ll just be you and me in there, so you won\u2019t have to worry, CJ-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but, I, uh\u2026\u201d You stammer, just as Suzu began to open the door to the locker room.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After being stripped of his already tight fitting pants and shirt, Suzuka had gone to great lengths to dress him up in the largest hakama on hand. While CJ squirmed at the sensation of this busty Asian dressing her, Suzuka almost enjoyed herself too much as she applied the robes while teaching him how to do it himself in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ tugged at the top of his the hakama slightly, adjusting the tightness of the robe around his girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels kind of tight around here...\" CJ gestured to where the top of the robe cut into his waistline before gesturing to his legs\"...but down here it feels a lot looser than my pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Suzuku chuckled at his reply, again sending her chest into a gravity fighting osculation \"want to put on the bogu and see how it feels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No!\" CJ said at once \"This will do for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Suzuka said a little disappointed, but her mood rebounded at once upon deciding what to do next \"then how about I teach you how to use a Shinai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly CJ-kun...you know...the Bamboo sword\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sure, I guess\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just let me get changed and I'll...\" Suzuka spoke as she started to upon the shirt that could barely contain those two flesh lumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-Hey!\" CJ at once panicked and made for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs thought surprised for the reaction, Suzuka stopped undressing and looked up at CJ and asked \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? I'm still in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Suzuka looked genuinely puzzled, as thought she didn't mind CJ standing in her why she changed \"You don't have to leave CJ-kun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait outside\" CJ-kun said and opened the door to leave<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! I'm ready\" Suzuka said with the same genki energy that she seemed to have infinite amounts of \"You know you didn't need to wait out here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of his rare moment of defiance, and after having several minutes to think of his words, CJ explained in a breathless sentence his reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you said about me changing in front of you...but I wouldn't be able to say I respected your privacy if I forced you to do the same in front of me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor only a second, the focus in Suzuka's eyes changed from the dominantly cheerful mode to something that CJ almost missed seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really the true gentlemen aren't you?\" Suzuka said in a low, but admiring breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" CJ barely caught the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N.o.t.h.i.n.g~\" Suzuka giggled, instantly returning to her regular genki personality. Her bust jiggled a bit, but in a Hakama, their movement was more restricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazingly how similar, yet how different she looked in different clothing. Her chest did seem just a bit smaller under her top, just like her thighs which were easily concealed under the robes, but her otherwise chubby body looked at home in the Hakama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because its tryout day, we've got all of the morning till lunch to practice, shall we start with the very basics?\" Suzuka suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\"</span></div></div>",

She had almost sprinted to the racks where she picked up a pair of Shinai's from the only half dozen that were kept there. As she attended to that, CJ took his first good look around the Dojo was it was. It was nowhere near the same as a real one, and it was very clear to his eyes that the Kendo club had seen better days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Suzuka said, handing over one that had been wrapped in a velvet red cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about this one?\" CJ said as he pulled it out of its bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why that's mine CJ-kun!\" Suzuka enthusiastically replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah?\" CJ looked up in surprise, seeing her resting the other one she had picked up over her shoulder \"If this is yours, shouldn't I have that one instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today\" Suzuka replied gracefully before adding in an alluring tone \"I want you to know what a really good Shinai feels like in your hands\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ's enthrallment at her words only seemed to add to his innate curiosity about holding a Shinai for the first time. Taking the bag off the end, he passed the bag over to the already outstretched hand of Suzuka and gripped the bamboo blade with both meaty, pudgy hands. Watching over CJ with her own engrossed interest, she took a safe step back and gave him his next instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, with all your might, show me how hard you can swing that Shinai\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ closed his eyes and flexed his fingers before following her next request and felt his arm muscles feel a bit fidgety as he brought it up like he had seen on television once. After a quick breathe - whether to compose himself or from lifting something up this long - CJ forcefully brought the Shinai down with all the force his since fattened muscles could exert, with a faint 'whoosh' noise, He felt his best effort was unimpressive, but Suzuka saw it another way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite your inexperience, you really have an excellent swing\" Suzuka's lower, serious and admirable tone spoke, this time loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" CJ said, automatically embarrassed at being praised for something he felt he had underachieved at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...You're form is almost right, and despite your...size...you really got some force in that strike...\" Suzuka explained, for the first time sounding like a genuine team captain to CJ's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ's grin was from ear to ear when he said his thanks, Suzuka couldn't have missed it and knew then that she had found her fourth club member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I start with teaching you the proper timing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess?\" CJ replied, still not knowing much of the lexicon to Kendo.<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! You're getting the hang of it now!\" Suzuka applauded as she continued to mimic the most basic of exercises along side the newest member of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut CJ felt like the compliment wasn't deserved. If one simple strike was a bit of an effort, he was sluggishly running himself into the ground just to keep up with Suzuka, who was only going at a very slow pace now to keep in tandem with him. CJ soon summarized that this was probably the most amount of exercise he had ever excreted - not counting running away from his fan-club - since coming to the academy. He couldn't imagine how badly he was sweating now and felt like the weight he had put on were dripping off him by the pound. It was a worrying thought and CJ turned to something to distract them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you something?\" CJ asked as casually as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure?\" Suzuka replied, enthusiastic to see that CJ was stating to get over the shy stage with her \"What do you want to know, my chest size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No! I wouldn't...\" CJ choked on his reply at gasping too much air, the moment passed and he quickly resumed the strike practice before he worried Suzuka \"I mean about the club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...of course, go ahead...\" Suzuka with the same amount of cheerful banter as when she offered to tell the magic number that represented her bust size. If CJ had just the slightest bit of intuition, he might've felt the pang of concern in the busty Japanese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said there were 'girls' before, as in other members, how many members are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Including you, four...the others are looking for recruits right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about the supervising teacher, who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have one anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who is supporting the club? Where are you getting the bamboo sticks and clothes to wear?\" CJ asked in surprise, his sync with Suzuka already coming undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was inevitable, but CJ's out of sync action also distracted him from keeping track over the foot movements that she was teaching him at the same time and at he same time he had overexert the last of energy keeping his body standing in this most strenuous of exercises. His blubber ridden body fell like a bag full of marshmallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...Are you alright CJ-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" CJ breathed loudly as his body finally gushed in pain, not at the fall that his body had cushioned him from, but at the relief of stopping his punishing exercise routine \"...give me a minute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ tried to raise his upper torso, but failed. he then tried to life his head which he could do, but was worthless in doing anything to lift himself up. Help from above came soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you\" Suzuka kindly offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ, without really thinking much at the embarrassment of getting a girl to help him up, was lifted up in stages, first upright, then in one might tug from Suzuka, he was standing again, if not quite so steadily yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I'm sorry you had to do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright...everyone needs helping up every now and then\" Suzuka said, in a tone now halfway between her normally cheerful appearance, and the deeper meaningful one that CJ had so far experienced twice so far \"how about we take a break for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So where do we sit\" CJ asked, Spying around for a chair he had missed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere!\" Suzuka cheerfully said \"In Kendo, we sit on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to emphasis it, Suzuka dropped her mass down to the ground she was standing on, her breasts giving the most jiggle they had been able to in awhile. CJ, having wondered now why he had gotten up at all, followed suit, albeit in a clumsier fashion than Suzuka, who merely giggled at her male co-member's disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after adjusting himself as so to not fall down again, he still found it hard to sit upright, the problem came from his Hakama now digging into his stomach. While he had gotten use to the strain while standing, sitting down pushed more pressure on his gut and made it impossible to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your Hakama is making it hard to sit, you can loosen it up a bit\"  Suzuka commented and giggled, seeing the distressed look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ, feeling he had no choice, pull on the sash rope and freed it from its simple knot, loosening his robe and reliving the pressure, just to be sure it didnt fall off when he stood, CJ then quickly tied it back up at a more comfortable length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes getting use to...and I imagine you have never worn clothes like this before\" Suzuka commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...not really\" CJ honestly replied \"this is the first time I've worn Japanese clothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are the other two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aoi Kamigishi...she is from my class...and is a real nerd and always likes to study, then there is Jessica Mathews, from your grade\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica...\" CJ at once recalled the name from his very early days at the academy, because of his memory, fear crept into his veins, but then his recent memory caught up and his fear dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the girl who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the girl\" Suzuka chuckled, seeing the embarrassment on his face \"only girl to ever be expelled from the CJ Dalton Admirers club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ thought mulled that one over. Jessica Mathews had been one of the founders of the club, also one of the few people in the club that CJ had grown to respect. When they had planned to raid CJ's house to steal all of his boxers and underwear, it had been Jessica who broke ranks with the other chubby followers to warn the still spry CJ about the impending raid. He managed to save all his clothing and his resulting dignity, but it had cost Jessica dearly. Her friends, her social status in the school and even her ability to talk to CJ without being harassed by the club. Absent any contact with Jessica, it was almost like she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's she doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learning to be stronger for herself...she gets bullied because of what she did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your story then?\" CJ asked with deep honesty \"Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzuka smiled again, seeing the true concern in CJ that Jessica had spoken of many times, deciding that there wasn't much holding her back from telling him the story, she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been practicing Kendo since I was a kid, but since coming here...it's become a little difficult\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Difficult?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wasn't easy for me to adapt to this school at first...right now I'm 6 foot 4..I tower over the girls here...Jessica is barely as tall as you, and Aoi is a real short girl!\" Suzuka chuckled again, but cracking past the cheerful composure to show CJ again the side of her that he realized people rarely saw \"Plus I've got these massive F cups... its because I started developing early and by the time I started here, I had a D cup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ could tell at once what kind of story she was telling and went from amazed to stunned. He hadn't felt this guilty about himself since the days back when Kate and Rebecca were bullied about their weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzuka...What did they do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other girls were jealous...I'm barely a half of their weight, but I'm the tallest girl by six inches and I have the second largest chest for my grade, add to the fact I'm Japanese...some of the really others really didn't like how I looked compared to them...especially a girl in my grade named Chris...her and her friends really didn't like me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt hearing Chris's name, CJ's stomach became bitter, she was only person he really had problems with - for accidental reasons - and Suzuka's story only gave him a reason to now resent her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also entered the kendo club at the same I did, but they were new to it all back then\" Suzuka paused a beat, using the time to rest her head on a shoulder. \"...for awhile, they refused to let me even practice...since she thought it was disgusting how big I was. But then they transferred to the swimming team and they simply ignored me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never occurred to CJ until that moment that even in a school full of fatties, that there would still be people teasing a person about their appearance, it was almost astonishing to hear it come from Chris, who had very a well known dislike for even chubby people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize though that Chris doesn't have any friends anymore right?\" CJ replied, again mulling over the stories he had heard on that subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Suzuka smiled again and started to return to her 'normal' cheerful tone \"In a way I feel sorry for her but...she bullied me, she bullied Aoi and she bullied a lot of people for a long time...when she stops hating everyone, then I can forgive her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ nodded and felt it was time to change pace \"So what about the club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzuka nodded and changed tone just as quickly as she turned to the new topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, the kendo club use to be a popular sport here years ago. Kathy, the captain before me, once told me about how the captain before her said they use to have a coach and everything. But then Mrs Masters the principal downsized the sports teams to improve the cafeteria and the grade average here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ nodded, wondering himself in frank honesty if that reallocation of money also explained the chubby size of the student body, but he ignored it for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school doesn't mind that we practice, but the club numbers never rose and when the seniors graduated last year, I inherited the school's dojo became the sole member\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's pretty bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't all that bad...having a club all to myself gives me the ability to pick who I want, so I started gathering other outsiders...first I recruited Aoi...then Jessica...and now today, I'm recruiting you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" CJ pondered before realizing the hidden jibe \"Hey wait! What's so outsider about me? Everyone loves me according to one club?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzuka laughed verbosity at seeing CJ double-take on her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean it that way CJ-kun...gomen...what I meant by that was you're the only guy in this school...as far as gender goes, you are a real outsider...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is that...\" CJ said in surrender \"but you realize that when word gets out that I'm joining you're club...a dozen of so scream fan-girls will try to join, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I let them!\" Suzuka chuckled again \"Then again, I let Jessica join, but she really isn't like those psychos that chase you everywhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had their first laugh together, but it was interrupted by the sound of the door as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Suzuka could go on about the Kendo club's problems, the door leading to the hallway opened. At the same time, Suzuka and CJ turned to face the door and saw two new faces standing entering by the door escorting third person right behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, we found our fourth member!\" Jessica Mathews announced <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean our fifth member\" Suzuka giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had been looking skywards upon her entry to the dojo and had failed to notice the almost 200 pound CJ sitting on the floor besides Suzuka, a minor correction in view corrected that and her multi-emotion reaction followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ!\" Jessica cheered as raised to another level of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jessica, long time no see\" CJ replied as he and Suzuka stood for their new arrival. It was almost a wasted effect as Jessica didnt wait a second longer to bearhug him again like she had done whenever she had the chance during her days in his fanclub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike the overwhelming majority of the club, CJ didn't mind Jessica one bit. Despite being one of the founders from his grade of the now almost school-wide CJ Dayton fan-club, she was also one of the few people in the club that had genuinely respected CJ, enough so that when other club members had planned to raid CJ's house to steal all of his boxers and underwear, she had broken ranks with the other rotund followers to warn the still spry CJ about the impending raid. It had cost her membership in the club and her association with the other girls in the club, but Jessica had moved on from them and found a far more stable friendship in Suzuka Touya and a club that she really could belong to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was - as Suzuka had described to CJ a short time ago - around his height of 5 foot 8, but an inch short. Sporting a weight of around 250 pounds, she had the odd distinction, compared to most girls at the academy, of a very soft freely moving rotund roll of belly that jiggled about as much as her D cup chest. This was a somewhat rare attribute, but one with an easy explanation. Despite still weighing as much as everyone else, Jessica's exercise though the kendo club gave her fat cells the opportunity to break apart from their almost solid state to a almost semi-liquid state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result, CJ noted perversely, gave Jessica just much of a jiggle to her body as Suzuka had in her chest and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you joined the kendo club\" CJ half-lied to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica released from CJ and faced him properly, showing him the dexterity of sanity that set her apart from the rest of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did after those whackos in the club kicked me out...but then Suzuka offered me a place in her club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" CJ said, despite knowing this already. There were times were he felt life was just a little too canny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is this new member for the team?\" Suzuka asked, turning attention to the girl standing by Aoi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natalie Chambers, ple-pleased to meet you!\" Natalie bowed to the captain, only she had heard some where that in Japan, everyone bowed to everyone for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natalie-chan, welcome to the team!\" Suzuka welcomed her - and as she always did, appoint prefixes to people she liked - before bowing back out of courtesy to the newcomer's attempt to keep up with the traditions of Kendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ looked on, feeling slightly envious at the attention turning to Natalie, who he was familiar with as a girl who sat two rows back from him in classes. Short for her age - though not as short as Aoi - Natalie he could tell was use to sitting down at lot judging by her rounded thighs and rear and only partial belly. Her chest wasn't quite as impressive as Jessica who was the same age and otherwise Natalie retained a mildly chubby shape suffering from inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl standing next to her on the other hand was a different story. Shorter than CJ by a half foot, Aoi was by far one the shortest people at the academy for her age. As Suzuka had elaborated, she really contrasted well with the captain. Whereas Suzuka's fat was able to be buried in a much taller body, Aoi retained almost the same weight at a over a foot less in height. Big all over was the result and to top off the nerdy image Suzuka elaborated to, Aoi wore a pair of thin-rimmed glasses while sporting short brown black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ, come meet our newest member Natalie...and my vice captain Aoi\" Suzuka gestured to each girl she referred to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was almost shocked to meet CJ. Despite being in the same class, the fan-club had borderline threatened her more than once to stay away from their idol, to the point of rejecting an offer to work on an assignment with him. her decision to turn down a seat at Clair Master's Music appreciation club had all of a sudden paid dividends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ple-pleased to meet you CJ\" Natalie stutter in a way that reminded him of Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, we see each other every day in homeroom\" CJ laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a joke that everyone found funny and soon he turned to Aoi, Suzuka's best freind and classmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aoi Kamagishi, pleased to meet you\" She extended a hand to CJ, having the stone to be more formal than Natalie who was understandably shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to practicing with you\" CJ replied, returning the handshake, even if it was a little off the usual vertical action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing...\" Suzuka said, building upon her excitement even faster than Jessica had on seeing CJ \"...it's like we're becoming a real team again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly feels like it\" Jessica agreed with a thoughtful nod as she stood next to Suzuka, arms crossed and resting on her gut \"If we get another few members, maybe we can get a coach again...or even start to compete for real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Jess...\" Suzuka waved her finger in the air to make a point \"we take this one step at a time...and we have two beginners to teach as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ couldn't quite describe the atmosphere in the dojo. Having taken a step to observe things from a persuado-distance, one thing that came to mind was that he couldn't compare this to anywhere else in the school. Sure the was friendly coexistence, but he had yet to see so many girls working towards a single goal...that didn't involve stealing his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey CJ, what are doing over there, come on over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" he replied, more confidence than he had felt since entering the dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe discussion had turned to assignment of Shinai and what spare equipment was here on hand for the girls and one guy but before Suzuha could on any further, the door to the Dojo opened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the same time, CJ and everyone turned to face the door and saw two familiar faces standing by the door. To CJ, they looked like they had been searching for awhile, but by the stain his crafty eyes instantly spotted on the uniform Kate wore, they had not exhausted themselves during their search for the dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Rebecca announced as she entered through the door that CJ had entered before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she any pretence of forgiving CJ for running off like he had almost an hour ago, Rebecca had only had to take one look at what he was dressed in now before her anger flared up again. Her reaction was textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charles Jeffery Dalton, what the hell are you wearing?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Rebecca, an equally, but much quietly, surprised Kate observed behind her friend the outfit CJ was in and how it was almost identical to the one that Kendo team captain was wearing. While both had different reactions to what they saw, both soon would have virtually identical reactions to what they smelled. While the other two seasoned kendo club members and the new member had managed to ignore it, the gradually workup had turned into a stench that neither could have noticed themselves, but the two newcomers became the second to notice and the first to feel putrid disgust at the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\" Rebecca coughed \"CJ, what were you sleeping in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you...ki-kinda...reek\" Kate said, joining Rebecca in a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ gestured to his own armpit to attempt to smell for himself, but only caught a marginal percentage of what a complete stranger felt, Suzuka however, having contributed to some of that smell and stayed quiet for now, entered the conversation for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the smell!\" Suzuka's charming, cheerful personality started \"But we just finished pretty light workout awhile ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing, playing in a mud pit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Suzuka giggled \"I was teaching CJ-kun how to swing a Shinai...he is very good you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sing...hi?\" Rebecca mispronounced, almost on purpose \"what the hell is a Singhi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means one of these\" CJ lifted the bamboo blade he had been given by Suzuka \"its really tough work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be...you must be sweating more water than a broken dam by the looks of it\" Rebecca gestured to the clearly soaked patches under his armpit that had long since seeped through the rather thick robes he was wearing \"what are you going to do for the afternoon classes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rebecca...\" CJ replied honestly \"I didn't think of that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate almost tried to say something, but her better judgement decided to wait for a later time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to you?\" CJ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went looking for you after you ran off without us!\" Rebecca simply stated, \" but it took us over an hour to find this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over an hour?\" CJ asked \"How hard could it be to find this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well we got...de-detoured checking out a few clubs on the way... \" Kate honestly blushed when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ rolled his eyes as their explanation only went downhill from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...first we got stopped by the cooking club for a taste sample...\" Rebecca started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we checked out the chess club...\" Kate whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we checked the cheese tasters club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we stopped by the music club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we visited the manga club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we checked out the ice cream appreciation club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we checked the tv-watching club to see if you were there...then we ran into Claire who wanted you to join the music appreciation club for some reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then we went the ca-cake admiration club...\" Kate added, finally explaining to CJ where Kate got the cake stain on her collar in the last hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then we finally found where the kendo gym was and came here...\" Rebecca finished before forcefully continuing on \"Now come on, we have to pick a club for the three of us to join before lunch time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I'm joining this club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words almost hung in the like the bad stench radiating from CJ, which was still fumigating both of his friend's noses with bad memories of dirty socks and PE class in middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rebecca replied a split second later \"You can't be serious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" CJ said \"Despite how hard it is...this actually quite fun\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...didn't you-u say to join a club with us...together?\" Kate stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then join the club\" CJ said simply \"Rebecca, you were saying before you wanted join a team to get in shape...this is the one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca quickly rewound her memory back to just after they left homeroom to look for a club, When the memory of her and Kate's words came back to haunt her, Rebecca only flustered as she started to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no...no...no...no way...Wa-wa-wait...a minute..., its Kate who talked about getting some exercise!\" Rebecca started to move her hands in a wave off signal suitable for a airport runway \"...and I said that if we were to join a team...it should be the swim club, not some kendo club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not?\" CJ enquired before turning to Suzuka \"These two can join too right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now, Suzuka and the others had kept their peace, wisely letting CJ try to sell the Kendo club for her. Suzuka didn't have any doubt CJ had been sold on joining the club and his words of confirmation made Suzuka jiggle with pink-warm joy inside at finding her fourth and fifth team member. Upon CJ's prompting, she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'd be great if you could join as well\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Rebecca replied instantly \"I want to float around in the pool, not sweat enough to fill a waterbed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzuka hadn't been offended when Rebecca preference for the swim club, knowing all too well how hard work it was to sell a often sweaty environment over the fun of lapping about in a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sweat is not all that bad Rebecca-chan...\" Suzuka spoke cheefing, assigning a prefix on the spot to CJ's long time friend \"...its actually quite fun and the sweat is just part of it, think of it a sign of how much work your putting in, its really quite refreshing when finish a practice session drenched from head to toe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca paused a beat before replying in a low sardonic mutter \"Wow...that's a really weird fetish you've got going there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Kate?\" CJ asked \"What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix sets of eyes at once turned their attention to the shy girl who had been standing behind Rebecca, almost using her best friend as a shield from getting involved in this - what she felt - hostile conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly, she was actually thriving at the idea of joining the kendo club. The idea of exercising off some pounds and spending some 'quality' time practicing with CJ at this most exotic of practitioner sports. But one look at Rebecca told her all she wanted to know about her friend's firm stance on joining something else. Kate and Rebecca had been friends all throughout their school years, they had worked on schooled projects together, played together, and though the years had fattened up together. Even if it was for her love for CJ, Kate just couldn't make the logical leap to even consider betraying Rebecca for what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate knew she was fat, shy and stuttered sometimes when confronted, but she also knew that in this school at least, Rebecca was the lamppost that she could lean on in the troubled times. She also knew that CJ and Rebecca had fought it each other before on all manner of issues and always ended up resolving their differences in the end. With that miraculous long thought process, Kate came to her conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think Rebecca is right...we should join a club all of us can do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Even Kate thinks this is a bad idea!\" Rebecca argued \"Come on CJ...lets join the swim club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ felt himself stuck between a rock and hard place, he had two good reasons to stay here, first of which involved his on going feud with Chris, who hated his guts over an accident some time ago and he knew that she would reject all three of them for being too fat anyway...one of the reasons why the club had only one member. And the second reason was Suzuka who had just told him how desperate the club was and how she really needed his support to keep it running. On the other hand, he didn't feel like offending Rebecca and Kate by breaking an unspoken promise with her over their commitment to join a club as a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the end, even if it was just a little selfish, CJ came down on the side of the Kendo club and he started to carefully pick at his words to best convey his message.</span></div></div>",

If the stench, the thought of Suzuka's jiggle-physics body enticing CJ in the first place and the fact they had to even argue about this annoyed her, his intention to stay on put Rebecca over the edge. She didn't explode in anger - it just wasn't like her to - but she did feel very hurt right now...hurt at not only how a complete stranger had roped CJ into something she had no intention of doing herself, but at the implied message that CJ though he wasn't physically good enough anymore, even in a school full of fatties where it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, though her anger, thought about it for a moment. She could still remember how CJ had been reasonably lighter than his current girth before he started at the academy and how his time at the academy had drained away at his ability to even outrun the annoying fan-club. With that in mind, was it no surprise that he wanted to try get in shape, at least a little bit? But if that was the case, then why did he want to join this in this club to get all sweaty, when he could just as easily he get in shape though the swim club? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca felt it took an hour to process all the thoughts for what she wanted and he wanted, but really took several seconds. It saved her from venting on CJ and making a worse mess of the situation than it already was, and she even began forgiving him for his otherwise selfish decision. but Rebecca didn't want to do Kendo, she didn't even really want to do Swimming Club, it had just been an idea in the back of her head to weight against the cooking club and the other clubs she had visited along the way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...do whatever you want Charles...\" Rebecca simply replied, holding ground on her firm stance. \"Come on Kate...Let's go ask the swim club before we run out of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah?\" Kate stuttered, seeing Rebecca seemingly call CJ's bluff to join the Kendo club. \"But...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay Kate...\" CJ assured her, and feeling a pang of guilt for not really considering Kate in this equation \"I'll catch up with you guys at lunch okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rebecca turned to leave and almost dragged Kate out the door, leaving a stunned CJ and Suzuka behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after Rebecca had left with Kate, that Suzuka had realized what she had done to CJ and their friendship. From what she knew of their relationship, all at once felt a pang of guilt for stealing CJ away from those two girls, just for the benefit of her club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really okay to leave them like that?\" Suzuka asked, speaking again in her low tone for serious during a moment of obvious guilt \"You know if they wanted to join another club with you...its alright to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" CJ replied, sounding oddly okay with it \"I actually know Rebecca and Kate pretty well...Rebecca will be mad at me for now, but she wont stay mad at me forever...she just needs to adjust to the idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Jessica asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so...I know it sounds crazy, but we kind of fight every week on things like this...most of them involve Clair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's a long story\" CJ said turning to face the others \"I'll tell you about it another time...but for meantime, I think we should be addressing the smell issue before lunch time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzuka was quite surprised at the revelation from CJ, but never felt more prouder than now at how he proudly committed himself to helping her club out. If his bold defiance to sell Kendo to his two best friends was part of a test to join the club, his funny offhand remark about their sweat was the passing grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Suzuka giggled \"...so do you want me to teach you a few tricks on how to get rid of the sweaty smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" CJ was caught off guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll teach you some pointers\" Suzuka grabbed his meaty hand and started to guide him to the change room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait, we're not going to do this again are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh course CJ-kun...\" Suzuka chuckled, finding the humour again that she had breathed at the start of his first lesson \"...after all, its my responsibility to help out my newest members of the Kendo club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much in the way of prompting, Suzuka pulled CJ into the changing room again, much to the enjoyment of the other members who watched on.________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to pass a lot quicker after his morning session in the Kendo dojo. Upon a fairly extensive - and again rather hands on - lesson in freshening up after a practice session, CJ left the kendo club to find Rebecca and Kate. Surely enough, he had only to look in once place for them at lunch time, the cafeteria, which at this time of day was full of girls filling up on their midday meal. Rebecca had refused even utter a single word at CJ the entire time and it was left to Kate to explain the details on what went on after they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs CJ had feared - or expected - would happen, Chris had turned them down in a heartbeat. Despite the laden hypocrisy that laced Chris's rejection, neither bothered to argue against their senior and left ashamed, only to be rescued by Claire, who had almost dragooned them into her own 'Music appreciation club' which Kate summarized as '1 part music listening and 2 parts cake eating and 1 part Claire talking about important her and her club was'. CJ could've sworn he felt hints that Kate had intended to return to the Kendo Dojo with Rebecca, but this wasn't the time to even venture a enquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair had joined them, as always taking up a special chair at the head of the table and munching down on a three course meal. Between courses, she attempted to persuade CJ to at the very least 'try out' her club instead of the outdated Kendo club. But like before, he didn't move on the subject, his fascination at the possibilities in what he could accomplish outweighed even his friendship to Clair, who at least didn't take offence like Rebecca did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of lunch, word had quickly gotten out about the club that CJ had picked and already a number of the enterprising members of his dedicated fan-club were trying to ask Suzuka, Aoi and even Jessica about signing on. True to Suzuka's word, knowing the effect it could have their club, all of them feigned to stick adherence to the rules and used the deadline of an hour ago as an excuse to not sign on any more members, despite how badly she needed them. It was in part painful for Suzuka reject people, but at the same time it wouldn't do if the Kendo club was suddenly swamped with uninterested club members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was classes and despite CJ's adherent ability to focus on his class work, the feeling in his mind of holding that kendo stick in his hand just didn't go away. It was just like Suzuka had said about getting to know the feeling of a good Shinai in his hands. It hadn't helped make the class go faster, but it did certainly gave him something to look forward to afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, his determination to get a feel for that Shinai again and he couldn't wait for his next club session tomorrow. On his way out of the school, he had managed to run across Suzuka and the other members walking out as a group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to tomorrow?\" Suzuka said \"Because from now on, its going to be hard work all the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>CJ and Suzuka were enjoying themselves everyday at the kendo club. More than that, the two of them were develloping quickly their friendship. It is true that CJ was spent almost no time with Kate and Rebecca, who was more angry than usual at CJ, and dragged the shy Kate away from him. CJ missed his two closest friends, and filled the gap with Suzuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else brought the two of them together. As Rebecca and Kate were temporarely keeping there distances with CJ (Well, mostly Rebecca), there was no one to protect CJ from his fanclub who, through their constant spying, knew that the object of their love (read obsession here) was now vulnerable. Although some wanted to take it out on Rebecca, they mostly realized that they could do whatever they wanted to CJ. But, as Suzuka saw her new friend in danger, she promptly came to the rescue; the new bonds between the two were now forged in the fire from the fanclub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kendo practices were still on, and were hard on CJ. But CJ's passion for kendo grew each day, and he was feeling stronger after each session. That day, as CJ and Suzuka were on their way home, Suzuka wanted to ask something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ-kun, I have a surprise that you might enjoy for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Suzu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to come to my house this evening? I have something very special to... show you\" she said grabbing his shoulder with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to share a special moment with my newest close friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem keen on that word, CJ-kun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have a choice, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope... come, I am sure that you will be surprised\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed; CJ was surprised. In the Touya household, Suzuka dragged CJ, who was now trying to stutter questions or protests to her room. CJ was surprised by what he saw: while he did expected something different than the regular teenage girl bedroom, he was still taken aback. The floor was extremely large, as was most of the house, and was covered by a tatami. On a wall, there were several kendo practice swords. Although he had only been interested (or knew about) kendo for a week, CJ could still tell that those were precious. Next to a wall was a rather large desk with a brand new computer. There were also several cupboards. Suzuka showed CJ around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I keep my regular clothes; this is where I keep my kendo outfits, this is where I keep my regular swords and what I need for practice as well as my old sumo gears\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I brought here today\" As she said those words, she moved toward the mentionned piece of furniture<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ then noticed two pieces of tatami of different colour in front of one another near the center of room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ-kun, you are about to have your first tea ceremony\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea ceremony, my dear CJ\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suzu came back to the center of the room with the set needed for the ceremony, the two sat down. CJ, as usual when initiated to something by his friend, was trying more or less to do what she did when he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will drink twice tea, and in-between we will have dinner\" She then proceeded to explain to CJ the traditionnal way of serving tea, as well as all the modernization she had decided to bring, mostly on the topics that were allowed to be discussed. She usually did this with her mother, and she had not often the occasion to enjoy the conversation as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first serving, Suzu left only to bring back the meal that they were to enjoy. CJ was surprised at the rather large servings that were served, but he nonetheless did his best to eat. He was also struggling with the two little sticks to eat his rice, and was progressing rather slowly. Suzu finished rather quickly, started to wait for CJ. She got impatient, and came across the floor to start to eat CJ's rice, which made both of them laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way, I am hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu kept going though, and quickly finished the bowl of rice of her friend, before returning to her previous spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, the second cup of teas were served. CJ then noticed that the room was very warm. His clothes were already drenched in sweat, as were the one of Suzu. This meant that her cloths were hugging her forms tight; the position in which they were both sitting also put emphasis on her breasts; her huge boobs. Without realizing it, CJ started to stare, as the conversation grew silent. Suzuka, however, realized that she didn't mind. She enjoyed in a way the attention from CJ. CJ realized what was going on, looked up to his friend, and said nothing for a while. Suzuka, finally said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, CJ-kun. As long as you enjoy what you see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ceremony continued without any other incident of the sort. The two friends shared more tea, stories and laughs before CJ had to leave to his home. The two however agreed to make this a weekly habit. When they parted ways, the two hugged, and CJ couldn't help but enjoy the feeling of Suzu's breast pressed against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat next week</span></div></div>",

Once again they went with the ritual, but CJ did not feel quite as comfortable as the first time they had done this. As Suzuka told him that \"tea ceremony tells us that every encounter between humans is different\", CJ did expect the atmosphere to be different; but he expected it to be a little looser, not more constrained. The chit-chat continued as usual, but CJ's joke did not seem to go through to Suzuka as much as it did before. In fact, she has been like this for the better part of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCJ thought he spotted a clue when Suzuka got up to go get the meal, mostly rice and fried chicken. Indeed, he could have sworn that her frame was a little bit bigger. When she got back with the food; he also noticed that Suzu dug in with a little more gusto than usual. And once again, she hurried to CJ's to finish his meal, only this time she leaned forward, which gave a gran view of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was preparing the tea for the second time, CJ finally mustered the courage to ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzu, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Why would you ask that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for one you've been somewhat distant for awhile now. Also, you've eaten more than usual. And you don't seem as careful as last week when you made the tea. Is something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you are much more perspective than I thought. Perhaps those encounters are clearing your mind, after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still not answering, Suzu. What's going on? How can I help you?\" The room was completely silent for a few seconds, before Suzu could no longer stand the gaze of CJ, and finally said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... well, in fact...</span></div></div>",

As a result, she could not really stand up to her parents, especially not openly. And the Touya were also a long line of Sumo champions. So, even though Suzu hated the idea, she was beginning to prepare herself to go back to a sport she had quit because she didn't care for it. It is also why she had snacked and ate parts of your meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will become of the kendo team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.

The girls in the team understood the plan for the succession and had no problem with it. Suzu also promised that she would do what she could to drop by as much as possible. In the meanwhile, you noticed that Suzuka was munching more and more; the tea ceremonies always had large servings and she stole from yours, teasing you along the way. From what you understood, Suzu's attempts to get out leading the sumo team had failed; so Suzu was preparing herself and her body to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two months of intensive preparation, Suzu felt that you were ready. You knew everything that she had to teach; mastery would come with practicing. So, that Friday, she bid the team farewell; and the two of you left for your weekly tea ceremony. Suzu had promised you that no matter what, this tradition of yours would not be suspended. After all, she might not be your captain any more, but she was still your friend. And with Rebecca and Kate still slow in forgiving you, especially when you told Rebecca that you had been made captain of the team, which meant that she could no longer hope to drag you away from it, you really needed her friendship. On the way to Suzu's place, you noticed that she was munching on a chocolate bar, curtesy of Chubbeso academy. You could not help but crack a joke at it; which made Suzu blush a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tea ceremony was going on pretty much the same way as usual. The two of you shared gossip, stories and laughs. You noticed that something seemed off in Suzu's way of looking at you, but you couldn't quite put your finger on it. But you quickly dismissed this as nothing. One difference was that you were unusually hungry that day; all the emotions at the dojo had left you hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, CJ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Suzu. It's MY food, and I am hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I remind you I am captain of the sumo team as of today? Do you really want to fight me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am captain of the kendo team! I don't feat the likes of you\" you answered in a parody of a heroic knight tone; which made Suzu giggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? And where exactly is your sword?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still my food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started to struggle for the bowl of rice. After a while, you held triumphaly the bowl aboce his head; but the joy was short-lived; Suzuka leaped trying to snatch the bowl; you could not handle the full weight of Suzu thrown at him and fell backwards, throwing the bowl aside. Suzu fell, and she now rested on top of you, her large breasts on your chest, her face very close to yours, and her lips very close to yours. All of the sudden, the room fell silent, as you stared Suzu in Suzu's eyes<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her already large body seemed bigger than what it was; especially on her hips and belly, as well as her thighs and butt. You would have guessed 50-60 pounds in two months; incredible for most people, but somewhat normal for anyone at Chubbeso. But you were drawn away from your thoughts and back into reality by Suzu's eyes. Though ackward at first, it was comfortable. No, it was more than that. It was good, it was right. The warmth of her fleshy body resting upon yours; her soft breath on your mouth; the sweet smell. It was amazing; you wouldn't have moved for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Suzu did.

Kate was blushing a little bit due to jealously she was having with Suzu\u2019s figure, while she was by no means thin, but her weight was distributed in a way that made her look thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca on the other hand, well, she looked a little bit annoyed with a death glare aimed directly at the back of your head \u2013 Not that you could tell as you were still day dreaming about the swaying hips of Suzu.

Being one of the slimmest girls in the school (except for her bulbous butt and thunderous thighs), this girl was dressed in one of the smallest uniforms that the school had (it was just barely in the double digits thanks to the large skirt that was covering her thighs), which covered her petite breasts and beginnings of a pot belly. And just like her voice, this girl had an oddly cold, if not cute face that was highlighted by dark blue and light blue hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, I\u2026\u201d Kate stammered, trying to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just thought we\u2019d give it a chance,\u201d Rebecca filled in, not loosening the grip on you for a second. \u201cAfter all, it looks like you\u2019re in need of some members, right Chris?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris hissed through her teeth as she turned her back to the three of you, giving you a decent look at her plumped up behind.

It wasn't long after that Rebbecca got the wild idea in her head that you all should hold some sort of celebration, Chris included.

The heat of the moment is getting to her. She looks down to her side and slowly her big green eyes travel back to yours, like a child who had just broken her mother's vase. \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help it, a smile escapes you and lets the letters o and k slip out.

You can't help but notice how big she was getting, even from a distance you could see those big blubbery calves of hers struggling to fit into her socks. From underneath her skirt (not that you were some kind of pervert or anything) didn't do her hamhock buttcheeks any dignity, with every step those meaty cushions of hers would lift the garment up and reveal a new pair of panties every day (this time decorated with four-leaf clovers, if you had to guess) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I better text Kate.\" you say aloud, shaking those thoughts from your head, \"Better make sure she knows what the plan is...<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the place, your cleaning job isn't half bad all things considered.

Your meek friend quietly helped herself to some chips as she read, the TV blaring in front of her to keep something going in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca insisted, uniforms weren't allowed on Game Night (or whatever this abomination was going to be called in the book you would surely write one day) and everyone had changed into some casual wear. Kate was no exception, having ditched the blazer and short skirt for a simple t-shirt and sweats. While never fashionable, it was pretty hard for her to find clothes that looked good <i>and</i> fit her heavy body, so no one (except for maybe Claire) gave her a hard time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too had changed. Deciding to wear a plain white t-shirt, some jeans, and an unbuttoned bowling shirt. Much to your dismay, the shirt was too small to be buttoned up comfortably. And rather than look like a stuffed sausage, you decided to leave it unbuttoned. But then your chubby belly peeked over the waistband.

Buddy.\u201d she prods a finger into your doughy stomach and smiles. She gets up, then turns around remembering something important she had to mention. \u201cOh, and try not to let anyone else find out about you joining the swim club. I can\u2019t be a swim captain and cow herder at the same time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten up at her authoritative tone. \u201cYes, mam!\u201d you say with a salute and a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grins back and says \u201cThat\u2019s more like it!\u201d and you watch as her bubbly booty bounces out your door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, school had already ended and you were at swim club.  Ever since last night you\u2019d been looking forward to swim club more and more and now standing poolside, in your swim trunks that felt a lot tighter than you remember, you were ready to start swimming. Your bad luck with Chris seemed to be over, but you were still hoping you wouldn\u2019t do anything embarrassing in front of Chris and the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Actually, now you can see more swimmers headed this way! Headed right towards you dressed in their swimsuits were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How the swimsuit was staying on her impressive frame was a mystery to you. \u201cCJ! There you are! Ah, what a marvelous swimsuit you have on there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, t-thanks,\u201d You stuttered, standing up on the side of the pool, prepared to jump into the pool if the girls following Claire (It was a given that the girls were all on your fanclub, you recognized most of their bloated faces). \u201cBut, uh, why are they all here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were answered with a flood of \u2018To be with you!\u2019, \u2018To see you in a swimsuit!\u2019 and some sprinkled lies such as \u2018to enjoy the pool\u2019.

Chris was wearing her usual aqua colored one-piece swimsuit which her lower half was rubbing against it. Kate was wearing a black and yellow striped, two-piece swimsuit. Which made her look like a bloated bee and was embarassed about wearing it. But it was the only swimsuit that still fits her other than the school swimsuit but that one makes her chafe. Rebecca was wearing an orange one-piece swimsuit with palm tree prints on it. She just bought it a few days ago and it already felt tight but she didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you not to tell anyone CJ\". Chris said. \"I didn't tell anyone honest\". You say defending yourself. \"Actually Chris, last night I did tell Claire that we joined\". Kate said with a guilty look on her face. Well that explains why the princess is here, but how did his fanclub find out\"? Chris asked. You remember \"that when it comes to you the girls of your fanclub are all seeing and all knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Chris gathered herself and walked towards the mob recognizing a few familiar faces as some members were former members of the swim team. \"Listen up, many of you joined the team or came back because of this guy over there\". \"I know that you fanclub members just go your own ways about doing stuff and think you can take over because you out number me, well think again\"! \"Here I'm in charge and you'll take me seriously or I'll personally drag all of fat hides out of here do you understand\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girls started talking to each other about what they just heard while Chris turned her attention towards Claire.\"As for you princess, just because your the principal's daughter doesn't mean you can just walk and do whatever you want to do, either you play by rules or don't play at all\". Clarie looked at her unphased by her glare. \"As long I get to be with CJ we won't run into any problems sea cow\". Claire said with a confident look on her face. Chris then turned her attention back to the fanclub. \"And what's your answer\"? She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fanclub all nodded their heads in agreement. You couldn't believe what you were seeing Chris actually had the fanclub under control and they didn't take over. She even got Claire to cooperate (to some extent). Chris then looked at you. \"Its all good CJ, its all good\". She said with a smile. Then you sighed a breath of relief that Chris wasn't going to bite your head off. \"Alright everyone let's start swimming\"! Chris said excitedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stare anxiously at the unforgiving little red hand flashing before you on the sign, willing it to morph into the leniant little fellow who told you to walk. Getting antsy, you start checking your watch in ten second intervals, as if simply willing it to change would speed up the process of time. Your eyebrows crease slightly as you focus your innate frustration from your hectic school year (and slowly increasing girth over which) into your stare, hoping that the little hand would sympathize with you and make his job quick. However, it seemed that the flashing appendage on the sign actually started to blink slower. Jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo focused on your staring contest with the walk/don't walk sign, you hardly seem to notice the slight tremors that accompanied your fanclub as they closed in on you (having studied your sleep habits the entire first semester). Slowly, their fat bodies waddled eagerly up to you, hoping to perhaps catch your gaze and steal your heart with their feminine wiles as their estrogen crazed bodies plodded closer and closer to the only boy in the school for them to pour their affections onto. If this was a fairer world, Chubbeso Academy would have been a co-ed school (or at least let you know they were coming with like, a neon sign or something) But unfortunately, this was a cruel and harsh world that had unfortunately granted your dream of being surrounded by women. Even now as they inched closer and closer to the object of affection, you remained clueless to their presence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one of them reached out and touched your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swift, jerking motion you turn around to face the first dread of the day: the CJ fanclub that had been established shortly after you enrolled; dedicated to studying, pampering, and above all loving CJ Dalton. Unfortunately, <i>you</i> were CJ Dalton. Eyes as wide as many of the dinner plates your heavyset fan girls have surely licked clean, your standing position quickly becomes a mad dash for school, a sanctuary that proved just a little bit safer than out in the rich neighborhood you had settled into. You jaywalk past the flashing sign, coincidentally only now flashing the okay for you to start walking, and run like a hysterical Kermit the Frog in your frantic dash for escape from the lovesick gaggle of lardos behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you were in much better shape than either of the ten-some-odd girls tailing you, (\"How'd that big one even squeeze into her uniform?!\") and escape was fairly easy. But, like a hoard of zombies, the fat girls followed you clutching their heaving chests in search of air to fill their lungs. And actually, that new paunch of yours is weighing you down somewhat! You feel tired and sluggish every morning, but only now are you starting to feel the effects of your lazy rich lifestyle as you yourself start hobbling down the sidewalk in a frantic dash for safety and adequate oxygen amounts. Finally, it happened; you couldn't run anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the chubby girls drew closer and closer to your gasping, wheezing body. You look around in a desperate attempt to find some thing blunt to start swinging (hey, act like animals, treat them like animals!) only to find that there was nothing. All you could do was lay back and accept that they had gotten you this morning... no telling what they would do to you now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as melodrama often was, the chase was shortlived as a black limo pulled up right beside you. Stepping out of the frontmost passenger seat was a rather plump woman in a chauffer's outfit. Without much hesitation, she easilly lifted your 185 pound frame and hoisted you into the back, heading back up to the front seat, sliding over to the driver's side, and immediately putting her pedal to the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed and confused, you look around the plushly apholstered limousine for signs of a definate answer. Not even 9 'o' clock in the morning and your day was already stranger than most people's. However as your coherency returns to you, you start to recognize the familiar purple decor around the limo and a strange wave of normality hits you; for while you had narrowly escaped the cruel faceless pan that was the CJ fanclub, you may have just been tossed into the familiar, though just as disturbing fire that was the Princess of Chubbeso academy, your absolute #1 fan girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, seated directly across from your slack body laying down on her carpeted floor. Even at an astonishing 320 pounds, there was no denying that this princess had killer looks to match her killer curves. With round, rosy and appled cheeks that melded into her giblet so smoothly, resting on her huge breasts which in turn rested on a billowing belly. She was so wide that her doughy arms had been pushed out to the side, even as she sat down, in order to better acommodate her large lovehandles that hung from her waist. In her school uniform, altered of course, her chubby knees were on display as were her blubbery calves, since you were already thrown to her feet kneeling to the princess, you couldn't help but notice that she had kicked off her shoes in order to keep comfortable. Her strawberry blond hair rested upon her shoulders, frontmost layer draping all the way down to her breasts, and bunched up as she rose slightly to greet you. \"Good morning CJ!\" her tone was always informal towards you, considering just how highly she thought of both you and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only smile gratefully, \"Good morning Princess!\" you say somewhat sarcastically, causing her to pout, \"Oh CJ you know I hate that nickname, call me Claire, please call me Claire!\" she giggled, causing her expanse to wobble about somewhat in her still-seated position. You slowly shift yourself to a more posture-friendly position to the seat across from Claire Masters, the daughter of your principal, and try to engage in non-awkward conversation with her; which was pretty hard with her. \"Yeah, yeah, anyway thanks a lot for helping me out back there.\" she was always doing stuff like that, which was probably good. Whenever Rebecca and Kate weren't there to help you out with a hastily made disguise or pull you behind the counter, Claire always seemed to do a good job of fending off the hormone-crazed, man hungry blobs that inhabited Chubbeso Academy... though Claire may be more of a converted enemy than a friend like your other blobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, hey you wanna walk me to class today?\" she asked eagerly, striking a small pose and winking at you; only for you to decline, like you always did. Every morning. Since Enrollment. Six Months ago. \"Sorry, I'm meeting Rebecca and Kate outside their lockers...\" you trail off slightly before realizing the inevitable, \"Oh no! I'm late, they're gonna think I ditched them!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire huffed, \"Hmph, Rebecca, I hate that snotty cow.\" she stuck out her lower lip and crossed her arms, \"But since you're late, and we all so <i>conveniently</i> have the same home room, we can just show up together can't we!\" she squealed. You could only laugh, having friends with connections really paid off sometimes. \"Sounds like a plan, Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, call me Claire!!\"</span></div></div>",

But when you got there you quickly looked at the clock to see that its 7:23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap there's no way I'll make it to homeroom in time.\" You grunted. Then you gathered your things, closed your locker and walked as fast as you could to Mrs. Kawasaki's room. Unfortunately her room was on the other side of the school from where you are so you need to move it. As soon as you could see her room on the horizon the bell rang and you were late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I knew this was going to happen.\" You sigh. \"Hope she's in a good mood today.\" You took a deep breath and opened the door and all eyes were on you.

You were so busy making a route that your trash bin was full of crumbled up paper filled with failed plans and ridiculous ideas (one of them was moving in with Claire). It was about 10:45 pm when you finally came up with the perfect route in which to get to school on time and avoid the fanclub at the sametime. After you traced the route in red pen you heard grumbing noises coming from your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like I've been spending so much time planning that I forgot to eat dinner.\" You stated.

It had a strange color to it, almost a dirty tan color but with a hint of banana yellow. There was a single rug, an ugly long brown one at that, in the middle of the hallway which ran evenly between two other doors. One was a bathroom, as you had inquired earlier, and the other a study (as the door had been left ajar, as if used recently and forgotten to be fully shut.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest room, your room, was down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and gripping the thick fabric that made up the handle of your luggage, you exhale listlessly as the situation sinks in. For the second time since leaving home, you were leaving home. While by all means not your actual home back in the States, the grandoise apartment that Headmistress Masters had set you up with had become very much a second home to you. Your friends would come over nigh constantly, a good majority of your stuff had to be scattered amidst their own abodes, and things were warm. As you opened the door to what would be your new room, your thoughts were but whispers of forboding misery to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't warm at all; as you found the room was an antithesis for the imagination, with offwhite walls and a dull ray of light across the carpet. A lonely wooden desk sat in the corner, next to a window, its only mates being the undersized dresser that matched the sullenly bland bed donned in equally abysmal gray sheets. Luckily you had packed some decorations of your own along with your computer, but you doubted that Mrs. Kawasaki would allow you to perform a total overhaul on the room itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the wheels across the thick floor fur, you let your luggage stand straight up as you collapsed into your matress. While it was far from pretty, you were pleasantly satisfied to find that your sleeping conditions might not have been as terrible as you'd have believed them to be. While it looked like a rock, the matress provided for you was actually quite soft. Two pillows on the bed, goosedown if you weren't mistaken, as well as a noggin-sized cushion made of memory foam. Not bad, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, the still overhead light hovering over you like the snapshot of a helicopter. You hadn't bothered turning on the lights, you didn't plan on spending much time in here anyway. If at all possible, you wished you could be with your friends right now. Becca, Kate, Claire, hell even Beatrix if she'd have you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to miss having an awesome apartment where all your friends could come over whenever they wanted at any time they wanted, having grown quite accustomed to a lack of a suitable schedule during your enrollment at Chubbeso Academy. Somehow you didn't believe that the blubbery brick wall downstairs was going to allow you much leniancy when it came to matters regarding anything other than schoolwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Dalton?\" the wall bellowed from downstairs, \"If you're finished unpacking, we could have dinner if you'd like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, you could only roll off of the bed. If the decoration of your room was a precursor to how Mrs. Kawasaki treated her meals, then you were in for a bland experience and an even more bland semester...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for you in the dining room was not the simple bowl of porrige or bland steaks you had anticipated before coming down the steps, but something else entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining table was a polished, tanned miniature majestry of surfaces. A heavy dark wood made up the entire frame as well as the head, and a pristine white cloth draped from atop it and down its sides. Fine china had been used in the serving of today's meal: which consisted of a pot roast cooked to absolute perfection as it sat there succulently on its plate steaming from the middle, a medley of vegetables, and even a basket of dinner rolls between the flowers and some pictures on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I trust by the drool emenating from the corner of your mouth that you're ready to get started?\" Mrs. Kawasaki said with a wry tone to her voice, \"If you're done washing up then we should dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't washed your hands, but there was really no need to tell Mrs. K that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would only delay the intense gratification that your mouth was about to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your seat at the seat opposite to Mrs. Kawasaki, being able to make out her bloated features between growing leaves and flowers. Her fat shoulders bulged from underneath her sleeveless top, her jacket having been removed upon entry of her humble home, and her entire upper half seemed hungry enough to try to get to the food itself by nibbling at the table. She looked up at you as you sat, the same cold stare she gave you in class, and heightened her eyebrows when she heard your chair scrape across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you quickly apologized as you grabbed the napkin set aside for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't scuff up the floor, CJ.\" she chided as she grabbed her own, flabby arms jiggling slightly at their sudden movement, \"I'd hate to leave trackmarks on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for the roast, it being the first thing on your mind of course, before Mrs. K swatted your hand away. She grabbed your plate between her fat fingers, picked it up, and cut you off a sizable portion. You couldn't help but notice that her heavy breastline was absolutely crushing the flowers as she leaned over them, but you were torn between holding back your laughter and your intense hunger from the sight of that thick juicy slice of roast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the plate back in front of you and went back in for another piece, grabbing one about that and a half the size of yours before being satisfied with the amount of meat on her plate. You noticed that, as you went for the vegetables, she did the same. As with even the dinner rolls, she would just smack at your hand and get them for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, um,\" you hesitate, having never dared speak up to the Iron Gut before, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serving, Mr. Dalton.\" she said curtly as she cut into her own piece of roast expertly, \"Good manners. Maybe in your time here, they'll rub off on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, defeated by the Iron Gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly that pot roast didn't look so good anymore.</span></div></div>",

She was going to tell you her life story! This is going to be awful. You decide to pay attention so you don't seem disrespectful to your new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I became who I am today, I was married to a man. His name was Hayato Kawasaki. We got married about two years before I came to Chubbeso. We soon moved to the UK where we settled down. As time went on, he became more and more disrespectful to me. It got so bad eventually... he beat me...  At that point I decided it was over, and we divorced as soon as possible. I lived alone for months, I didn't have a job because my husband was an aerospace engineer and he made enough money for us already. I had a degree in Mathematics and Education, but all the schools denied me. One day I was reading the paper when I saw an advertisement in the paper. It said a school in the town of... what's the name? Oh well, anyways that school happened to be Chubbeso Academy, where I was accepted as a teacher. When I met with Mrs. Masters, I was shocked to see a woman of such... magnitude! I soon adapted to the Chubbeso lifestyle and put on all this weight, and here I am today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. K... I am so sorry.\" you say in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be sorry about CJ you didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so taken back by Mrs. K's story.

Why did you make me live with you when I was late. It goes against some of the schools policies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. K blushed a bit, not expecting you to ask such a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see CJ-- Mr. Dalton, in my eyes you're a good mannered young gentlemen, though a slacker sometimes, that is always there to help anyone. You have a heart of gold. In a sense-- I know this may sound weird-- but you had the traits of a husband I had always wanted, sorry for sounding so forward.

I will do anything to my hus-- I mean to ensure my guest is happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that first conversation, you and Mrs. K have gotten to know each other a lot better. Every dinner time you shared embarrassing stories about your friends, while Mrs. K told you stories about the teachers in the school.

A loud \"Come in.\" was all heard. You opened the door, as he walked in he triped over a box and fell straight first into a dirty laundry pile. Of course knowing your luck you fell face first into Mrs. Kawasaki's dirty underwear. It took you a second to realize the large smelly garmet wasn't a towel and threw it away in disgust. As you got up he noticed something that he thought he would never see from Mrs. Kawasaki... The house was a mess. Old pizza boxes were scattered everywhere, 2 liter coke bottles were almost in every room of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be in the wrong house...\" You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard from the other room \"Take that camper!\" as he walked in. You could not believe his eyes there sitting between old pizza boxes and bottles of coke was Mrs. Kawasaki..... Playing Xbox!

I'm actually Daltionator...\" You said shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. K beamed with excitement \"Oh my god your Daltionator, now we can play all the time!\" Mrs.K screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment You could not tell, would this be heaven, or would this be hell.</span></div></div>",

No worries my mom already made you a late pass so won't get marked for being tardy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress we have arrived at the school\". the maid said. \"Alright come on CJ let's go\".

A voice shouted. \"Who said that\". Claire said in annoyed voice. You then saw then saw Rebecca and Kate waddle towards you. Rebecca stood there with her short, brunette hair. Her fat arms layed across her pudgy breasts which layed on her broad belly which jiggled with every step she took. \"CJ where were you\"? She asked in a somewhat annoyed tone. \"I was running late, had a run in with the fanclub again and Claire saved me from the mob\". You said. \"So where are you going with the princess homeroom starts in nine minutes\". Rebecca remarked. \"First off stop calling me that I don't like being called princess\". \"Second I was going to get CJ some food since he forgot breakfast this morning\". Claire said in your defense. \"So your trying to make him even fatter so he'll be even harder to hide when his mob of love-thirsty girls comes after him again\". rebecca said in an even more irritated voice. \"No I just don't want him to go hungry in the morning\". Clarie yelled. You realize if you don't do something soon things are going to get really ugly really fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it you two\". A voice said quietly. Then everyone turned their attention towards Kate. She stood there with here long, light brown hair. With her huge belly and breasts resting on top of her belly it looked like her uniform was about to rip apart. \"Um truth be told I forgot to eat as well so can I join you for breakfast\". She asked. \"Very well, you can join us, are you coming as well Rebecca\"? Claire asked. \"I might as well get something to eat to and make sure you don't anything weird to CJ, but you need to give me and Kate late passes as well\".

Due to the early hour of the day, however, the area was, for the most part, deserted. After all, it was homeroom.

She was pretty enough to stall your intentions of purging yourself long enough for the thought to be completely cut-and-pasted with the thought of just how lovely this one girl's face was. Even from your position (the fourth bathroom from the right) contrasted to her's (the first from the left- not so much a great distance but far from face-to-face) her good lucks were set to kill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long, platinum blonde hair that fell down to her back. It looked so smooth and silky soft, like she could brush up against your face and not feel a thing. Her skin was pale, but not in a way that suggested she lacked any sort of sunlight. In the way a doll was pale, or the way that fine china was pale. And she was thin too! Hard to believe in this sort of institution, but yes, this girl had a perfectly sculpted body! Wrapped up in her Chubbeso uniform, the plaid green skirt hung just above those slender thighs that moved so seamlessly. It had been a long time since you'd seen such a cooperative, well adjusted thigh that didn't jiggle or wobble. Her slender figure, fully accentuated by her tight Chubbeso jacket, was a near perfect hourglass that kept her toned arms (presumably toned, you'd imagined that they were toned anyway) help high. Just from the back of her, your heart started with the standard Hannah-Barbara response of threatening to leap out of your chest. But then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft blond locks of hair curled up at the front, dangling attractively in front of her face. Her big blue eyes looking innocently in your direction, yet they seemed to be looking past you. Fully turning around, you notice the moderately large pair of breasts that she'd been carrying. Nothing like you were used to now, but still quite nice. However while you were busy eyeballing her, the mysterious girl had started towards you. Instantly, you felt your brain go completely dead. You had been reduced to something completely lifeless and devoid of any thoughts. You had plenty of feelings though, mostly of lust and testosterone-driven fantasies of what you would like to do to this <b>amazingly hot</b> student; the only, save for you (kinda), thin attendant of Chubbeso Academy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" she said innocently, those big blue eyes of hers remaining round and jovial. From her introduction, you guessed that she wasn't a local of Wales, her accent suggested that she didn't speak the native English. That explained it, she was a foreigner! \"My name is Delphine Shuzumiya, and I am new here.\" from the expanded dialouge, you would have guessed something along the lines French controlled areas, maybe from the big Eiffel Tower itself- Paris! \"Pardon me but, is Chubbeso Academy not a school for... girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. She was actually talking to you. Not only that, she was looking at you too! Stay calm, there was no need to panic. Just show the really hot girl that you can engage in normal conversation and she'll be sure to think you're normal. Just take a deep breath and let out a reasonable, intelligent response to her innocent query...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" was all you could muster from your drooling lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubbeso Academy, it is a school for girls, non?\" she repeated, as if <i>you</i> were the one who didn't speak English. \"Oh, uh, yeah it is!\" you stammer, cursing yourself for seeming so brainless. Delphine tilted her adorably blonde head slightly and furrowed her eyebrow, \"But aren't you... a boy?\" she narrowed her eyes at you questioningly, causing you to panic somewhat. \"Oh uh, yeah I'm a boy, and yeah this is a school for girls!\" you start to sweat somewhat, \"But you see, I uh, well, it's a uh... well, actually, I'm not too sure why I'm here either.\" you laugh slightly, as does she let out a slightly amused giggle. \"Oh, are you that smart; to get into a school of all girls?\" she ribs you, now that you are directly in front of her- the object of your affection stands a good three inches taller than you. \"I guess some guys are just lucky.\" you lie. You were NOT lucky. Until now that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyway, I'm CJ Dalton.\" you stutter, was that polite enough? Sure it was polite enough. Or was it a little wierd to throw your last name in there like that. How many CJ's were there in the school? Why did you just <i>have</i> to put in your last name?! Only LOSERS introduce themselves with their last name when not prompted to! How could you be so stu- \"Oh, I had a friend back home with the name CJ.\" she says in a friendly manner, \"Of course, her name was short for Chi Jikuro, and with my terrible accent I practically butchered the japanese language.\" Delphine giggled as she recounted. \"Wait, you're Japanese?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui, on my mother's side.\" she stated matter-of-factly, \"But I am French on my father's side, so I spend a few years with each of my parents.\" You let slip an excited \"Wow!\" before going completely otaku on her. The thought of having someone who spoke fluent (kinda) japanese <i>and</i> french was pretty cool! However, just because she was japanese (half no less) didn't mean she was just going to accept your animanga obbsession. But regardless of your excitable behavior, Delphine smiled warmly towards you, \"Oui, ma mere sends me all kinds of things from home, perhaps you would like to see them sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only let out an excited squeak, real items from the orient?! <i><b>COOL</b></i>. \"Oh, uh yeah sure!\" you say a little too enthusiastically. Something had to be wrong with her, no one was this perfect! \"Bon oui!\" she said excitedly, \"But first, I believe I should make my way to my first period, CJ Dalton, I have no idea where I'm going you see, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could show you around you know.\" you slip, expecting her to back away slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how sweet of you, but I couldn't bother; you should be in class too, non?.\" she says, nearly crushing your dreams, \"Besides, I'm sure to find Madmoiselle Kawasaki eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your heart race once again. She had your first period...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpic Win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, that's my first period!\" you say excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon Oui!!\" she cheers, \"I guess we can walk to class together then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your face turn beet red as she grabs your arm, \"Lead the way, CJ Dalton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpic-er Win.</span></div></div>",

She was, after all, quite the cutie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class ended, Delphine left to go to another room, waving as she walked off.  \"I'll see you later!\" she called back, the two of you having exchanged phone numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waved after her, Kate and Rebecca approached, looking at you with mild concern.  \"What's wrong?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that girl so skinny?\" Kate asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, metabolism maybe? What does it matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters a lot, actually,\" Rebecca said, resting her arms on her substantial belly, \"How many skinny girls have you seen here since you came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, point taken, but it's a rarity I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she might be breaking in from another school?\" Kate considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either that or she's bulimic,\" Rebecca replied, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or she's just an ordinary girl!\" you defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ordinary for the outside world? Definitely. In here, though, she may as well have four heads.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooh well lookie here, it's CJ Dalton: Big Man on Campus!\" a hip young woman behind an oven off in the distance shouts. She has no problem leaving the large appliance unattended, and comes to greet you shortly after her outburst. And while she didn't notice it, several women rushed to take her place so the kitchen didn't catch on fire. Again. The busty woman struggles to shoulder past one of her extra large co-workers and nudges her way into your line of sight. She, very much like Delphine, had remained thin throughout her duration at Chubbeso Academy. Which in itself was shocking, considering how thanks to her no one else did. \"How long's it been, two, three days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been since lunch yesterday, Bunnie!\" you go along with her little game and correct her, \"But hey, it seems so much longer than it really has been doesn't it?\" She giggles at your innocent banter, \"Oh come on now CJ, I don't think you started holding up the line just for me to flirt with you, how 'bout some lunch?\" And as always, your hearty appetite can't pass up one of Bunnie's dishes. You accept heartily and the line starts flowing behind you, having held it up a considerable amount of time ribbing with your lunchlady. The smell of your designated meal fills your nostrils as the steaming plate of meatloaf stews in it's own delicious juices on your plate. Just looking down at it now you notice the little bits of tomatoes and onions that someone, Bunnie no doubt, had painstakingly chopped up and sprinkled about the loaf. Without even tasting it, you knew what to expect. Perfection. And it made your mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ?\" Rebbecca's voice pipes up from behind, snapping you from your trance. \"Oh, uh, Rebbecca!\" you stutter, trying your best to keep the drool <i>in</i> your mouth as the soft images of meatloaf fled your mind, \"Sorry, I uh, skipped breakfast this morning...\" you chuckle meekly at the end of your weak defense, only for your tubby friend to give you a glance-over, \"Yeah, and then the Royal Sow treated us all to a killer buffet, remember?\" she balanced her own tray in one hand while placing the other one on the remains of her hip, long ago buried underneath her muffin top and other various folds. \"Well yeah but, I...\" you struggle to form words as you turn a bright red, \"Hey, I'm a growing boy!\" you finally manage after a long string of failed sentences. Rebecca giggles and playfully pokes your slowly expanding potbelly, \"Yeah, but are you growing up or out is my question, Chunky.\" she teases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" she says nonchalantly as she stabs your loaf with her fork, taking a large portion of your lunch and placing it into her mouth. \"H-Hey!!\" you shout again, louder this time, only for Rebbecca to chew her food while stifling laughter. As she swallows, she chokes out, \"Hey look, it's that Delphine girl!\" While initially you considered Rebbecca may have just been teasing, your gaze follows her finger and sure enough, there was Delphine. But amongst all the other round tables that accommodated equally round students, Delphine was seated in the far back with no one around her. The cream-colored tablecloth only bore Delphine's plate and five empty seats arranged in a circular pattern. \"Hey, why's she sitting all by herself?\" the blobby brunette girl asks aloud, \"Think we should go sit with her?\" you ask, only for her to scoff. \"Of course we should, she seems nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said she was bulemic with four heads?\" you quip back, narrowing your eyelids to emphasize your point, \"I said she might as <i>well</i> have four heads, and either way it looks like all those heads are pointed at <b>you</b>.\" Rebecca points as inconspicuously as she can to reveal Delphine looking at you from across the cafeteria with those big blue eyes of hers. The sight of those crystalline orbs aimed directly at you makes your face burn a hot red. \"Well I guess we don't have much of a choice now, do we?\" you try to feign reluctance, try to seem like you're not excited, but Rebbecca knows you better than that, \"Oh come on, you know I know you want to go sit with her.\" she says playfully. \"A-And what's it to you if I do, huh?!\" you combat rather sharply, sending a quiver down Rebbecca's expression. \"Oh, no reason.\" she hints, \"No reason at all... I'll just go tell Kate and Claire that we're all gonna sit with Delphine today.\" she says, seeming somewhat off hand as her mighty form waddles further down the dining area towards your usual table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was wierd.\" you murmur, resuming your trek towards Delphine's lonesome table.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Oh, CJ Dalton, I <i>thought</i> you were coming over to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you thought right, can I take a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Delphine's face becomes much more noticeable as you inch closer to one of the plastic chairs that surrounded her, filling up the apparent emptiness with your company. \"Of course, why would I turn you away, non?\" she scoots over somewhat. Wait, did she think you were fat? Is that why you needed so much room? Because you were fat?! Wait, hold on, that's stupid. She just didn't want to touch you. That's it, she didn't want to come into contact with you! How terrible! You had already disgusted this hottie with your simple presence! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well take a seat!\" she says, snapping you out of your worries, \"I have heard wonderful things about the head chef inside, are the rumors true?\" her gaze seems to numb you, but at the same time keep you nimble, \"Oh, Bunnie?\" you point towards where you guessed she might have been, \"She's awesome, I mean really awesome. We play video games every chance we get, she's really cool.\" this brings you back to the meatloaf, which you still haven't got a chance to sink your literal nor proverbial teeth into. \"Video games?\" Delphine repeats in that cute accent of hers, \"The headmistress allows le personnel to have video games?\" You blush slightly as you prepare your answer, repeating it quickly in your head to make sure this comes out right, \"No, she comes over to my place with my friends, she's really good at Tekken 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scandalous!\" she teases you, \"CJ Dalton having an affair with an older woman?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you start to turn beet red, embarrassment levels reaching fatal stages. Great, now she thought you were some kind of pervert. \"Well, I, uh, you see-\" when both of you seemed to notice a sudden outbreak of tremors coming from behind you. \"Why yes, yes he is.\" a familiar voice emanates from behind you. The vibrations caused by this particular speaker were immense, and very familiar to you now after a few dozen rounds of her sneaking up on you, covering your eyes and shouting \"guess who\". You didn't even have to turn around (and get a face full of her billowing jelly belly) to know that it was Claire Masters. Jealous fan girl numero uno (or rather nombre un, all nationalities considered)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wraps her meaty arms around you and forces the back of your head between her mammaries, the engorged milk sacks deafening you with soft flab. \"Oh CJ I missed you so much this morning!\" she squealed, \"Why'd you bail on us?\" she asks in a normal tone of voice before Rebbecca succeeds her from behind and yanks her off of you, \"He probably had to use the bathroom with all the crap you stuffed him with.\" she says satistically. Kate followed closely behind, waddling with even less grace than usual as she heaved around both her enormous belly and breasts along with a haul of her own, Claire's and Rebbecca's food. \"G-Girls?\" she peeped, her poor little head hidden behind a mountain of food so big even she couldn't devour it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, CJ Dalton, you are quite the ladies' man apparently!\" Delphine giggles before Claire yanks the waify blond from her seat, \"Outta my way, Frenchy.\" she snorts as she plops her sizable <i>butin</i> in Delphine's place, using her chubby fingers to both inch Delphine's plate closer to the nearest available seat (beside Kate) and the rest to get all up in your junk. Delphine was surprised, but somehow managed to keep her cool and took the seat graciously. \"So, I am Delphine Shuzumiya, and I can guess that you are all CJ's friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca nodded, flicking Claire across the fat cheek from behind your neck, \"Yeah, I've known CJ since we were little kids, Kate too. We go way back.\" it seemed a little odd for her to just blurt that out, especially now that she was grabbing at your shoulder. She never did that! Delphine was silent for a bit before continuing, \"And you, Madmoiselle...\" the Princess, a little offended that she had yet to learn her magnificent name, finished her sentence rather curtly, \"Claire.\" she grunted through a bit of chewed up food. \"Ah, <i>excusez-moi</i>, Claire', how do you know CJ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lovers</i>\" she said in a breathy voice, whispering it into your ear loud enough for Delphine to get the picture. She just laughed and started pecking back at her food; seeming like she felt a little out of place with such good friends surrounding her. If you had to guess, she must have felt somewhat like a third wheel or a tag-along. \"Delphine!\" Rebbecca suddenly burst, \"How have you not eaten your meal yet?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked down to the french girl's plate, realizing that not only was it poorly portioned, but it was hardly touched! \"No wonder you're so skinny!\" Claire huffed, \"Luckilly I'm more than enough woman for CJ to handle, riiiight?\" she inched closer to you, struggling to lift up her massive hindquarters. \"Please, don't sit in my lap again?\" you beg. Delphine giggled before...</span></div></div>",

There wasn't a distinct point where she became a ravenous beast, but rather the development was gradual, slow. The first plate of food she had she finished relatively slowly, though faster than before, each forkful returning to her mouth a little faster than the last time. No one took notice, but, on her second plate, she started to eat a little more heavily, hastily, until she reached a third plate, at which she shoveled the food into her mouth, a girl possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Claire, a giant ball of flab herself, couldn't help but stare in awe at how the slender, lithe girl packed the food into her stomach. She burped loudly in the climax of her meal, covering her mouth, bashfully. \"Excuse me,\" Delphine stammered, her cheeks filled with blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might just deserve a round of applause, actually,\" Rebecca replied, resting her pudgy arms on the table, laughing mildly, \"Where do you put all that food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in my stomach?\" Delphine replied, unsure how to answer the question as she placed her hands on her food baby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that's pretty impressive,\" you stammered, eyes wide and astounded. Delphine tucked her head into her shoulders, embarrassed yet blushing in just a way that made your body swoon. What was it about her? Those eyes? There was something so damn cute a bout her, but you couldn't place your finger on one physical attribute more beautiful than the rest...</span></div></div>",

Literally; bounce, bounce, bounce, man she had a big chest for such a skinny girl! Said slender frame stopped as she met you and Rebecca in the hallway with a big smile on her face, \"CJ, Rebecca, I have had the most wonderful time at this lycee!\" she giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's great Delphine!\" you cheer, \"What's your fourth period?\". Rebecca couldn't help but roll her eyes at the sight of you two, not that you would have noticed what with your eyes bulging out of their sockets and everything. \"Cuisso- um, excusez-moi, <i>cooking</i>!\" Delphine said merrilly, \"I haven't gotten to touch a stove yet, but I got these wonderful cookies!\" she gesticulated very oddly, not like before. Almost like she had been shot up with something between lunch and now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled, somewhat amused at the situation, \"Yeah, I had cooking last semester.\" she said in a forced tone, \"That's why you're so hyper, Ms. Telleri's cookies are loaded with sugar and crap.\" she let out a small chuckle before asking how many she had eaten. \"N-Neuff...\" Delphine said in an embarrased voice before holding up her fingers for the translation: Nine. <i>Nine</i> cookies?! Where did this girl put it all?! \"A-Anyway!\" you were plenty eager to change the subject off of Delphine's appetite. The thought that the skinniest girl in the academy's greedy belly getting the better of her was the last thing you wanted to think about right now! \"S-So what's up Becca, you wanted to ask me something right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I just wanted to know if, well, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, CJ!\" the overstimulated foreigner grabbed at your arm like a cat at yarn, \"I left my purse in Madmoiselle Telleri's room!\" Rebecca's speech fumbles, growing quieter as Delphine stole her spotlight once again. \"Well that's no big deal, me and Becca can just walk you down there and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, I'll get it!\" Rebecca suddenly pipes back up, starting ahead of you and your sugar-fingered escort. \"A-Are you sure, that's a long walk you know?\" you ask, only for her to respond with a smile, \"Hey, no big deal, I'll get it back to you when we all head over to CJ's for game night!\" she said in a rather aloof tone of voice. Delphine suddenly decided to calm down a bit, \"Oh, non non, it's not a problem, besides it would feel weird asking another girl to go hold my purse for me.\" before you step in, eager to get some alone time with this jolie fille, \"Oh hey, come on, it's not like she's gonna go through it or anything!\" you say eagerly, \"Come on, I'll show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine's sugar-raddled brain seemed to process this over and, deeming Rebecca trustworthy, decided to take you up on your offer. \"Bon oui!\" she said excitedly, \"Thank you so much Rebecca, I will see you tonight at CJ's flat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, tonight. at CJ's...\" she stuttered before waddling off down the hallway in search of her teacher's room.

Her exotic blood mixture of French and Japanese? Or heck, maybe you were just like any other guy and couldn\u2019t help but feel attracted to two certain aspects on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, you were giving this exceptional academy girl a tour of the academy, which had eventually led the two of you to the academy\u2019s indoor pool\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagnifique!\u201d Delphine gasped as the two of you entered the area. Yeah, that was the perfect word to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the academy was known for healthy amount of funding for catering, school supplies, catering, professors, catering and property \u2013 And the indoor pool was no exception, the pool was comparable with that of those used in Olympic competitions surrounded by beautiful blue and white tiles that had fancy grooves in them. The entire room was basked in the sunlight that the very high glass ceiling provided and reflected on the cool, crisp waters of the vast pool. There was calm music playing the background (you thought it was something by Beethoven, but you weren\u2019t a master of classical music).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than likely, the most impressive feature of the pool, was the diving board that was near the edge of the pool \u2013 it was easily about twenty feet above the water with a lowered springboard to the right of it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 That\u2019s when you realized that someone was standing atop of the taller diving board, right at the edge of the board. But she didn\u2019t stay there long, she immediately jumped off the board and spun through the air before she dove directly into the water \u2013 And to your surprise, she didn\u2019t make much of a splash of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, the students here sure are surprising,\u201d the foreign student admitted with a warm smile on her face. \u201cFirst a male student in an all girls\u2019 school and an exceptional diver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking to yourself how any girl could actually be a good diver, you figured that most girls here would create nothing short of a tidal wave, the girl who just dived was climbing out of the pool\u2026 And boy, were you surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you saw, was her matted down dark blue (with several streaks of sky blue thrown into the mix) hair that was covering her face and onto her shoulders. As soon as she kept pulling herself from the pool, you could see that she was dressed in a black school swimsuit that covered her slightly chubby torso and small breasts (heck, they were the smallest that you saw here at the academy). At first, you thought that perhaps that there was another thin girl besides Delphine right in front of you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Then the rest of the girl climbed out of the pool, revealing that while from the waist up, she was only on the verge of getting big (the beginnings of that pot belly was evidence of that), it looked like most of the weight was focused on. Her flared out hips and thighs puffed from her swimsuit and it was likely the same case with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was something in the back of your mind\u2026 Something yelling at you that you saw this girl before, you just couldn\u2019t put your finger on it though. Surely you\u2019d remember a girl this size (heck, she looked to be around your weight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was you,\u201d The girl growled as she lifted her hands up to comb her hair out of her face. \u201cCJ\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought that perhaps that maybe this girl was a part of your fan club, but when you saw the cold eyes that belonged to the pretty face that was uncovered, you realized that this was much, much, MUCH worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, h-hey! I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ? Is something wrong?\u201d Delphine asked, either unaware that the girl in front of you was giving off a killer intent from her eyes or that she didn\u2019t think anything of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of your first day began to flood your memory\u2026 Oh, how it was an interesting day how you were late to classes and ended up bumping into this very same girl\u2026 While at the same time you managed to sneak a peak at the blue-and-white striped panties that she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you also remember the black eye that this girl gave you\u2026 But, it didn\u2019t stop there, you kept having bad luck with this girl, getting into similar predicaments that ended up with you embarrassing her and with you getting a new bruise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Heck, it wasn\u2019t until the last incident (which involved you escaping from your fanclub and you accidentally pushing her into a nearby trashcan) that you learned her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-H-Hey, C-C-Chris,\u201d You muttered with a cold sweat rolling down the side of your head. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you were here in the pool\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the captain of the swim team,\u201d Chris hissed, crossing her arms under her small chest. \u201cAnd I\u2019m practically the only member now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glare that she was shooting at you was now lusting for blood\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It definately wasn't fake or forced, she actually had found something funny in this situation: the portly captain of the Swim Team's name! She giggled cutely as she repeated the name in her head over and over again after confirming that the bubble-butted shape in front of her was indeed female. \"Heehee... 'Chris'... She is named after a boy in an all-girl school, et CJ <i>is</i> a boy in an all girl's school!\" she said aloud, \"This is so bizarre.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, THAT'S MY NAME, WHAT OF IT?!\" Chris snapped back at Delphine, still lost in her own little world as she continued to giggle immaturely at the blue-haired girl's handle. However, as she caught sight of Delphine's lovely shape, the icy aura around the swimmer melted into a cool gentle wave. \"You know,\" she said with a refreshing amount of calm in her voice, \"You look a lot like one of my old team mates, before she gained two extra chins and a buhdda belly and all that.\" she grabbed at Delphine's hand and shook it eagerly. \"My name is Christina Walker, you can call me Chris, and would you mind if I asked yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure 'Chris', my name is Delphine Shuzumiya.\" the blonde foreigner said with a sense of forged familiarity, \"And I'm sorry to hear about your team mate.\" the big-bootied captain shrugged it off, a luxury that must have been limited strictly to Delphine; had you mentioned anything like that to her, Chris may have left you with another black eye. \"Don't worry about it!\" the bottom-heavy student said in a relaxed tone, as if she hadn't been interrupted in the middle of a very important question, \"It's not like <i>you're</i> the one who founded an entire sub-culture of lunatics with your average looks and no-doubt incredibly small-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CUT IT OUT!!\" you shout from the sidelines of this little conversation, knowing exactly who she was referring to and exactly what would have followed that sentence. \"Delphine, don't tell me you know this loser?\" Chris said flatly, (admittedly) pretty face staring you down like a cockroach. \"CJ?\" Delphine pointed straight at you. The worst came to mind, like that she was going to denounce you in front of her new friend. Of course she'd rather be friends with a girl, not some freak who was stuck in an all girl's academy! She would probably turn on you like a dime, becoming Chris' friend instead of yours, slowly growing to resent you more and more just like Chris did (even tough you still had your doubts as to why)! Oh the shame, she'd probably get loads of girls to join the swim team too, get them all skinny and get them all to hate you! What then?! You'd live an unfulfilling life as a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui, CJ Dalton est tres magnifique!\" Delphine says, stepping back over to your side and grabbing your hand, \"He has been very nice to me and he has introduced me to a lot of new friends today!\" She turned to look at you with those big blue eyes of hers, sending another wave of spine-melting woozines throughout your body, \"And I happen to think he's very beau, if I do say so myself... but I wouldn't know about his-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DELPHINE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D\u00e9sol\u00e9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris didn't seem too impressed. She crossed her arms underneath her tiny breasts and let out a huff. \"Really?\" she said flatly, arching an eyebrow questionably, \"He's got you brainwashed too?\" she let out a sigh. \"Well I was <i>gonna</i> ask you to join the swim team, but forget it. I don't need you going on and on about CJ Dalton all day long.\" she said, turning on her chubby toes to turn her back on the two of you, bubble butt shifting and swaying with her steps. While you sighed, relieved that you had ecaped this one unscarred, Delphine seemed to have a very different notion of how to deal with the scathing hatred that filled Christina Walker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why don't you come by CJ's flat with us?!\" she hollered after her, \"It will be very fun, and there will be lots of other girls to talk to besides CJ, who you despise for some reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned around, her gaze narrowed and sharpened directly at the outspoken girl who held you by the hand. You gulped, this one was definately not going to be pretty. Namely for you, since you're likely the one to get injured. \"What makes you think I want to go anywhere with Stupid and his gaggle of fat chicks?\" she hypocritcally placed one hand on her enormous hip, pivoting her pelvis so that her chubby belly jutted out a little bit further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lunchlady will be there...\" she said, proposing a weak arguement to combat Chris' reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that seemed to work for some reason. Chris had once tasted something marvelous from Bunnie Blake's kitchen: a shrimp medley with light sauce and heavy basting. The thought of that dish made a little bit of drool come from the corners of her mouth as since then, she had never before had the equal to Bunnie's cooking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine!\" Chris shouted, \"I'll go! But she has to make something just for me, a shi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon oui!!\" Delphine shouted, cutting her off yet again and tugging at your arm. \"Meet us at CJ's house in an hour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delphine, I live in an apartment; one that I'd prefer not to have disclosed to the girl who wants to KILL ME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then meet us outside the building, CJ and I will greet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE'LL KILL ME!!\"</span></div></div>",

Rebecca and Kate were already at your place, helping you Though it was not the first game night you hosted, that night was going to be somewhat... different. Indeed, for once, Bunnie decided to bring the food herself, instead of the usual, somewhat small meal. And whenever Bunnie cooked, she didn't leave things halfway through. Bunnie brought enough food to feed thirty people; more than enough for the night. But this was her cooking, so you couldn't bring yourself to bring the subject into the open. Besides, why spoil what was about to be a great Game night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bunnie and the food, came Delphine, stealing your attention, to Becca's displeasure (To put it mildly). She was followed quickly by Claire, who was immediately all over you. Until she smelled the carefully laid food. But you remained distant to all of this. You were worried about a certain blue haired storm that was closing in. You were staring through the window, watchful to the people in the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsieur CJ, quelque chose ne vas pas?\" Asked Delphine in her usual cute<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris is coming soon, I can feel it\" You said, not worried that you were sounding somewhat creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Je suis sure that everything will be just fine. I'll help you when she'll come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she went back to the buffet. You could hear Rebecca and Bunnie struggling over Bob. From Tekken. But the voices in the background faded out for you; as you kept your watch on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delphine! There she is! Come with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine said something, but the mouthful of cake prevented you from understanding it. Reluctantly, she accompanied you towards the street to greet Chris.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of being annoyed or anything like that, she just giggled and told you not to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really okay\" Delphine said as she got up, she then started rubbing your belly, \"A nice, big man like you couldn't possible know this was going to happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine giggled again before wrapping her arm around yours and started walking, you smiling dumbly as you were lead into the cafeteria. It wasn't until the both of you were sitting down that you got our of your stupor, and noticed your plate was significantly bigger than Delphine's small plate of chips. Your plate was large, it had two burgers on one side, a few hot dogs next to them, some dessert treats, and next to the plate were five large cups of thick-shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything OK?\" Delphine asked worryingly as she rubbed your arm and shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" you say with a lite smile, \"It's just there's so much here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Delphine said proudly, \"A growing man like you should be eating like this every meal, and this 'Bunny' girl said she was so happy that you were going to eat more of her cooking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly at those words, who were you to argue with her, and if it also made Bunny happy? You shoved down the food, so fast and messy but just shy of sending mess flying everywhere. You stopped when you noticed how fast you were eating and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" you say meekly, \"I must've seemed like a pig to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" Delphine said, loud enough to gain slight attention from people passing by, \"A man like you should be able to eat however he wants, non?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, how did Delphine even exist? You resumed back on your food, not as fast as before, as you looked at Delphine, who seemed to have a glaze look in her eye, what Claire gets when the two of you are alone and just look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a handsome man\" she said as she rubbed his back, easing the pressure, \"I can get you another plate if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't give an answer before you walked of, returning with a plate that was more filled before, she smiled sweetly at you when she placed it in front of you, your old place immediately being picked up by a school assistant. Delphine stared sweetly at you as you ate, and normally all this attention would freak you out, but you kinda liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good\" you say as you pat your belly that was starting to strain your clothes, \"I don't think I've ever eaten that much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to snap Delphine out of her stare, a look of worry appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you underfeed yourself so much?\" she asked as she brought him into a hug, \"Is there anything wrong that would stop you from eating normally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed into the hug as you thought of how to answer. Sure what you normally ate was normally a quarter of that first plat, which seemed like a huge gain compared to what you ate before you came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just didn't know I was being underfed\" you said truthfully, \"Before I cam to this school, what I ate could have been considered starving to what I normally eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good at all\" Delphine said as she rubbed your shoulder, \"Someone so underfed shouldn't be healthy, why didn't the nurse say anything, I know!

Her thin legs were surprisingly strong, since she had no problem lugging your stuffed body out of the cafeteria, and out toward Mrs. Master's office. You could barely take this speed. You hadn't needed to run this fast since middle school. Just why was Delphine moving in such a hurry--?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine stopped once she felt her companion's sweat on her palm. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I got worried, so I didn't think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave off her concerns. \"It's fine. I just--just--need a minute to catch my breath.\" Your belly and chest rose with each wheezing breath. You really had gotten out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine waited for you to collect yourself before she brought you delicately to Mrs. Masters. She barely listened to the receptionist at the front desk, opening up the headmistress's door without bothering to knock. Mrs. Masters was in a conference with a parent, but Delphine remained undisturbed by this. Said parent now looked from Mrs. Masters to the incoming students, a look of surprise on her round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Masters cheeks turned a muted shade of pink. \"Can I help you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ has been underfed. His health might be at risk. We need to help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine said it breathlessly, as though her own flesh and blood were being prosecuted and tortured. The parent glanced at your middle, then frowned. Mrs. Masters, however, gave the topic some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you talked to the nurse about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine furrowed her brow. \"I assumed it would be better to bring this to your attention. I've seen people underfed, and all those nurses do is just blow off my concerns. CJ is a growing boy, and needs food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Masters stroked her chin one more time. \"In that case, we need to see that he gets to eat enough.\"</span></div></div>",

You have to admit that you were excited to get to know Delphine more (maybe even watch her grow too) but you were still confused on why she wanted you to eat more. For now, you shrugged it off. After Delphine celebrated, she took you the cafeteria, good thing lunch was so long at Chubbeso, otherwise you may have missed some of your next class! She took your hand and took you to the cafeteria, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were taken (pulled), you fell behind a lot, but during these moments you couldn't help but stare at her figure from behind. Despite being thin, she had a nice butt. The way it swayed from left to right, it was surely a sight to behold! The view along the way kept you going instead of getting tired like last time. You had absolutely fallen for this goddess of a girl. You loved every bit of her, she was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the cafeteria and you somehow find an empty table.

Which consisted of usual things which you'd see in any principal's office and some family photos that layed on top of a wide desk in the center of the room and there the person sitting in the huge reinforced swivel chair was Jessica Masters, Claire's mom and principal of Chubbeso Academy. Despite being in her forty's she looks like time hasn't aged her a bit and looks like she has the skin of a teenager. Her long blonde hair rested on her super-sized breasts that layed on her blimp of a belly she has the largest body out of everyone in the entire school. Her belly was so big that her really flabby arms and legs were hardly visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Claire, son-in-law\".

You said breaking the awkward moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its about what happened this morning with the fanclub\". Jessica said shifting to a somewhat more serious tone. \"I know its not your fault and I'm not blaming you for any of it but you bearly manged to get away from them today with the help of my daughter\". \"If you keep gaining weight like you are now it will get harder and harder to get to school from your apartment without your fanclub ambushing you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that she made a good point when you first came to the school you could outrun them in a heartbeat, but now you barely have the energy to run as fast and eventually they'll catch up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why me and my mom came up with one solution that will most likely help you\".

Claire asked with cute look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thinking deeply about this, on the one hand living in the lap of luxury with Claire and her mom sounds pretty alright with you.

You don't have to worry about that. You turn around and that her mom said that from the other side of the limo you and Claire were sitting. I gave an you and my daughter an excuse to miss school today and coming home too because I really don't have much going on at the office today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso I had the liberty to move your things out your apartment and into our house. Her mom said with large smile on her flabby face. After a short drive the limo pulled up at Master Mansion, which is even larger than the school itself. We're here. Said the limo driver. Alright, come on CJ let me show you your new home. Clarie said excitedly. Then you, Clarie and her mom got out of the limo walked(well you walked and they waddled) to the entrance. When the three of you entered you were all greeted by by a small army of maids, varying in weight from small potbelly to so fat that their maid outfit looks like its going to rip apart at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome back Mrs. Masters and young mistress. The maids said at the same time. Its good to be home everyone. Mrs. Masters said formally to the maids. Now listen everyone, starting today we'll be having guest living here with us. My daughter's beloved boyfriend(even though your not her boyfriend yet.) CJ Dalton we'll be living here so treat him like he's part of the family. Of course Mrs. Masters. The maids said (and some of them look excited that you're living here). This is nice place you have hear Claire. You said. Ahh thank you CJ. Clarie said while hugging you again. Now come on there's a lot of things to do around here.</span></div></div>",

Claire replied, finally letting you go. \"Hey mom I'm going to show CJ the house\". \"Go ahead sweetie I'll meet you both later for a special brunch\". Mrs. Masters said while some maids were taking off her shoes since she couldn't do it on her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then grabbed your arm and started showing you around the mansion starting with her mom's prized flower garden. \"Wow Claire your mom grew all of these\". You said amazed at all of the different flowers. \"Every single one of them\". Claire replied with a smile. \"Even though its sometimes a bit of a hassle with her being huge but its one of the thing that makes her happy\". After that she took you to the family room. It was awesome she had a giant HD tv, a nintendo wii with wide variety of games and king-sized massage couch. Your mouth dropped like a hammer and you were so amazed you were speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty amazing huh\". Clarie asked. \"Oh ya\". You replied. Then she took to the bathroom which of course was large. The bathtub looked like a small swimming pool, the sink looked massive and fancy and the mirror was larger than any mirror you've ever scene. \"Are you sure this is a bathroom\"? You asked confused. \"Of course it is everything is customized to compliment our weight even our toilets are reinforced so they don't break under our girth\". Claire said giggling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she showed your new room (she'd show you more of the house but she's getting tired from all of the waddling). \"I had the liberty of putting your room right next door to mine so we won't have to be far apart\". Clarie said excitedly. She then opened door and you saw in your opinion the most awsome bedroom you have ever seen in your entire life. A large tv (though not as big as the one in the family room), a big king-size bed, all of your personal belongings, a closet full of your clothes and some new clothes that Claire bought for you, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing Claire\". You said in amazement. \"Aww thanks, but there's one more thing\". She said. She then clapped her hands and two maids instantly appeared. \"You called for us mistress\"? The two said at the same time. \"CJ, allow me to introduce you to your personal assistants Megan West and her younger sister Emily\". Claire said showing the two girls to you. \"We looked forward to serving you Mr. Dalton\". The two said happily. \"Thanks\". You replied. \"Man I could get use to living here\". \"I'm sure you will CJ, i'm sure you will\". Claire said with an alluring grin.</span></div></div>",

Then the two of you leave your room and headed downstairs to the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered it looked enormous, it looked like it could fit over 500 people in there. The table was really big and could be adjusted to how many people are there. The chairs were really wide and reinforced so that they wouldn't collapse under immense weight. Above was a really fancy chandelier that was in the master family for generations. The rest of the hall itself was impressive from the painting of the walls and the carpeting of the floor to all of decorations around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey CJ\". Said a familiar energetic voice. \"Bunnie what are you doing here\"? You ask confused seeing her here. \"I guess i should've mentioned that not only I'm lunchlady of the school but i'm also head chef of master mansion\". She said happily. \" \"When I heard that you moved in I decided to make a meal that would be my greatest work yet so sit on down and chow down\". \"Okay\". You said. Then you sat down with claire sitting right next to you and Mrs Masters sitting on the other side of the table. Then some of the maids including Megan and Emily came in and stood around the table and other maids came our from the kitchen pushing three trays full of food. \"I hope you'll enjoy you meal CJ'. Claire said lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Megan opened your tray and you saw that Bunnie made one of your favorites inside-out cheeseburgers. Apparently Clarie knows your apetite all to well Bunnie's inside-out cheeseburger is one fo your favorite foods. It was served along with a large pile of fries and large, thick vanilla milkshake. Claire was having her favorite pizza while her mom was having the seafood jambalaya. You then quickly started digging in, surprisingly since you forgot breakfast you finished your tray in minutes and you felt like you belly was pushing up against your pants. \"Don't worry CJ that was only the first course, there still two courses left\". Clarie said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later after eating a plate full of big wings and a large slice pie you were done to and you felt like you've like you gained 10 lbs. Claire's gut started peaking from underneath her shirt due after her meal and Mrs. Masters looked totally bloated. Megan and emily started massaging your belly so that you wouldn't throw up. \" I told you the food would be good\". Claire said lethargically. \"Yes you did Claire, yes you did\". You replied.</span></div></div>",

One minute you were being chased by your fanclub and being saved by Clarie and the next thing you knew you were living a luxurious lifestyle with Claire and her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of those thoughts were flowing around in your mind you remember there was something you forgot to do this morning and that was to shower. But since they didn't have a shower you'll just take a bath. \"Megan, Emily I'm going to take a bath since I was in a hurry this morning and I forgot to take one.\" You said. \"Would you like us to clean you up?\". They asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be neccesary, I'll call you both if I need anything else.\" After the two portly maids left room you left and went to the bathroom. You still couldn't believe that small pool was their bath. Then you got undressed, left you clothes in a basket grabbed a towel and went in. The water felt so nice and warm that you were gonna fall asleep and the steam was really opening your sinuses. After a short while of relaxing you saw ripples on the water and heard loud footsteps heading this way. At first you thought it was Claire but the steps were much louder and then you saw the large behemoth figure that was Claire's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh CJ I didn't know you were in here, but since you are here what do you think of my body without any restricting it?\" She asked while in a sexy pose and winking at you (like mother like daughter as they say). \" \"Y-you look very beautiful\". You stuttered trying to hold back the blood dripping down your nose. You tried to get out of the tub feeling a bit embarrassed but Mrs. Masters quickly grabbed your arm and you were pulled into here body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't act so cold, how about we talk while I clean you up.\" Mrs. Masters said in a motherly tone. \"Okay.\" You muffled. Then you both went back in the bath and Mrs. Masters started shampooing your hair. But while she doing that her belly was pushing up against your back and her large breasts were resting on your shoulders.<br>\r\n\"You know CJ I haven't seen Claire this happy in a long time.\" She said. \"Really?\" You said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, when she was in middle school the boys didn't really notice her much.\" \"They pefered those rail-thin girls and didn't really care for girls with a lot of meat on their bones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Claire had a lot of female friends but hardly any of the boys talked to her and she felt dishearted.\" \"Sometimes she'd use cry into her pillow about never finding a boy that would like her.\" \"When she started attending Chubbeso she didn't have worry about that problem anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But her problem vanished when you started going here.\" Mrs. Masters said. \"It did?\" You asked. \"When she first looked at you she saw something different in you.\" \"She didn't feel any judgment from you and felt that you like people for who they are and not what's on the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she realized that you were the one for her and I never heard crying from her about boy problems again.\" You never even imagined that someone like Claire would have trouble getting a boy to like her let alone talk to her. \"So I'd like to thank you for making my little princess feel good about herself CJ.\" She said happily. </span></div></div>",

In all the excitement yesterday you had only gotten one meal. You throw on the first outfit you find, not being too particular about your appearance, and step out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to realize you have no idea where to go. During the tour yesterday you were so taken by the size and opulence of the mansion you hadn't paid too close attention to where everything was. The hall you were in was two-stories tall and the damn near the length of a football field, typical dimensions for the gigantic abode. You spend what has to be at least fifteen minutes wandering around, trying to orient yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you'd made your way to the banquet hall (your sense of smell helped for the final part of the search) you were starving, which made the spread of food look even more delicious. It all looked so good you barely register Claire and her mother's presence there, the two obese women already well into their meals. It's only when Claire sees you and breathlessly exclaims \u201cGood morning, CJ!\u201d that you notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Claire. Mrs. Masters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's mother looks oddly reserved; she smiles and nods at you, but then quickly turns her attention back to her food, shoving another bacon strip into her mouth. You don't think anything of it as you load up your own plate (even the dishes are tailor-made for the Masters women; the one in front of you looks closer to a serving tray), but once you're eating you notice Claire seems a bit pensive and as the meal progresses you feel a distinct chill between mother and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the food wasn't so good you might try to make a little conversation, but Bunnie's cooking was just as divine here as it was at the school and it was hard to tear yourself away from it even for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all things must come to an end. Mrs. Masters was the first to leave the table, having to head to work early, leaving just you and Claire. By now you were pleasantly stuffed, and Claire seemed to be hanging back, nibbling on sausage rather than gorging herself properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d She asked when it was just the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I have never felt a bed as comfortable as that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to warm up, but you could tell something was bothering her. It was a change of pace for the usually forthright and sometimes overbearing teen, and for once in your time knowing her you were in a situation where it seemed you had to lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing for a second, but then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry about yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the bath.\u201d She was blushing now. \u201cThe thing with my mom and I... smothering you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. Well, it's not the first time I've been overwhelmed like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but the reason we invited you to live here was for your well-being and on the very first day that happens! At first I was angry at my mom for causing it, told her as much yesterday, but after a while I started thinking and I realized I'm... not entirely innocent myself. I can be a bit over-enthusiastic, especially when,\u201d she was bright red now, \u201csomeone else is getting close to you. I get jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why Claire was suddenly embarrassed about this. It's not as if her feelings had ever been hidden. Perhaps she had thought of herself as just being really friendly before now. Or maybe she rationalized your keeping her at arm's length as obliviousness to her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I like you CJ. Not just as friends, but in the way that makes me want us to be closer. It's why I was looking so forward to you moving in with us, but I guess we got off on the wrong foot there. And I don't want to keep repeating what happened yesterday, accidentally causing you problems and driving a wedge between us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd like to tell her not to worry, but she doesn't give you a chance before she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I want to stop playing games and just ask you: would you like to go out with me? If you say no I'll understand, and I'll try to give you your space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's staring straight at you, an intensity around her you haven't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's sudden, but not out of left-field. You're just surprised she would be so direct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is something you've thought about, wondering how you would respond if Claire ever wanted to take her usual antics to a more serious level. It wasn't an easy question to answer; there were other girls in your life such as Rebecca, and you knew about Claire's designs for you if she had her way (you looked down at your plate, where what had been a mountain of food was now just smears of syrup and assorted crumbs; even without her influence you were doing a good job fattening yourself up). A 'yes' answer was going to have repercussions in other parts of your life, but you can't say 'no' just because it was the path of least resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to you while you were passed out, Claire had dutifully took it upon herself to sleep by your side in case you were sick or had any more nosebleeds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was getting pretty obsessive, but thinking over what Mrs. Masters had said about how much Claire felt for you, Clare was just very caring. Actually as you watched her still blissfully asleep you notice how nice she looks when she\u2019s not fawning over you. Her rounded cheeks had soft looking dimples that made her look like she was smiling in content as she slept  (most likely having a dream about you.) Her hair too looked nicer then you remembered, although that was probably because you were more used to running away from it whenever you spotted it heading towards you. Then you realized exactly why you had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Claire was not only a hog for food; she was a hog when it came to bed blankets as well! She must have unconsciously pulled most of the blankets from the bed and used them to cover herself why she slept, and who could blame her there was a lot of her to cover! Your pajamas did little to keep you warm so the sudden cold must have been what had awoken you. In fact you were<span class=\"cblue\"> <b>freezing</b></span>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option you cuddled up closer to Claire letting the immense heat and warmth her large body was providing warm you up along with the lavish blankets. Nestled in closer you clenched to her tightly in a teddy bear like hug with Claire\u2019s stomach was so large your arms could not completely wrap around it. You let yourself sink tighter into her pillow fat and let her big rhythmic breaths lull you back to sleep.

She squeezed you even tighter against herself, feeling her immense boobs push against your body, and some of her warm boob fat going around your neck.

You eat slowly, but watched with complete fascination as this behemoth girls shoved tons of food into her mouth. After one cart her belly was already huge, but she kept eating until she emptied all four carts. She looked back to you and noticed you ate only half of one. She heaved her ginormous bulk over to you. Her fat thighs pushing against you, and her huge belly overlapping your left leg. \"Now eat up CJ, I need you to get bigger and stronger if you're ever going to be able to handle this!\" She giggled, as she sent ripples throughout her obese body.

Most of these things you insisted on doing yourself but you eventually gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the second week you had settled into the high life and had been embracing the food and pampering. Claire by this time had made multiple attempts to come onto you but you kept your cool. Although at every attempt she made you took longer to push her away, you were weakening and she knew it.

The masters had been treating you like family and your body was starting to look like their's as well but aside from this fact nothing of much interest happened except for the fact that Claire was able to get you into your underwear before you were able to turn her away.

Then you turn around to see that the sound was your fanclub heading right towards you. Ordinarily you could out run them but since you started living at Claire's the fanclub has gotten closer and closer to you, kind of a trade off for not worrying about them when heading to and leaving school. Pretty soon you were surrounded by the love struck fat girls with their guts practically rubbing against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came what you feared the most they started swarmed all over you.

The three of you left before this could go from amazingly awesome to horribly wrong. \"But mom why would you do this\" whined Claire, clearly displeased with her mothers decision. \"Calm down Claire, i'm entirely aware of you standing fight for CJ with those two girls.

Rebecca and Kate did not know what hit them; they just stuffed themselves almost constantly with delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After two weeks, they didn't care anymore. They had stopped going to class altogether, having been exempted from school by the principal. Time was passing by in a blur for the two girls; they were barely living their room anymore, going to the bathrooms only when needed, occasionally changing clothes. The girls were in a constant food induced blissful state. Meanwhile, CJ and Claire were spending more and more time together. They were growing closer and closer together, to the point they were cuddling in front of the TV while the two other girls were away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Another week went through.

Kate was confused; why couldn't she move? She was starting to panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca! Rebecca! wake up!\" She was trying to shout this, but it was barely higher than her normal voice in her old self<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REBECCA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmmwhat is it Kate?\" Rebecca answered, coming out her slumber<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Hold on, let me help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rebecca was also unable to move; she also felt a great weight on her. The two girls were starting to panic, as they trying to wriggle on their beds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, here? What happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you see?\" A cold, mocking voice said near the door. It was Claire; she was wearing a red sundress that was also revealing her breasts slightly, and offered a gran view of her cleavage. Next to her was standing a mysterious woman, one they had not seen often; she seemed to be Mrs Masters' personal assistant, Abida Idhar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! Claire! You have to help us! We can't move\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Help us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think so, Rebecca. That wouldn't go well with my plans, now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I know that the two of you had always been after MY CJ\" Claire said, still on her calm tone. \"So, my mother devised a plan by letting you in this domain. Haven't you noticed how much food the two of you had been fed? Haven't you noticed that you saw CJ less and less for the past few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... what... why?\" Kate could only stutter those<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my dear Katie Kate? Because CJ is mine. Your intrusions, your parasiting him and keeping him away from me has lasted too long. One does not meddle with a Masters without paying the price. Although, you've both blossomed into truly magnificent girls, so I wouldn't complain. As for what, I think it's obvious that the two of you are now immobile. You can only watch and eat, as long as you are here. And unless we move you, you will always be here. As for the how, that is the beautiful part. You see, we've drugged every single meal you've had, every single scrap of food you've put into your tummy since you've been here. Weight gain solutions, always refined by the best scientists of course, but also caffeine to keep you up for midnight snacks and lower your metabolism. And lately, we've made a small addition; we've added this new chemical; it numbs the muscle, and makes them weaker and weaker. Until, well, you can't move anymore. Curtesy of mother's assistant, Abida\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two balls of flesh were silent for a minute; they were seeing all the plans, they were also lost as for their futures. But before long, Rebecca started to yell insults at Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush there. Now, I am not a cruel person. You will be moved out of this place, back into your dorms, where you might be able to lose weight during the summer and perhaps return to mobility by next term; of course, for all your absenses, you've been held back a year by our principal, who, I might add, is 'very disappointed with your lack of attendence. Especially you, miss Granden'\" In a semi-serious tone, that sent her laughing. \"Meanwhile, I will now truly make CJ mine, once and for all. And you'll get to watch it happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said those words, she clapped her hands; the doors were slammed open by two servants that brought in a TV. Onto it were the surveillance cameras feed, which changed to keep a watchful eye on CJ. The two girls were horrified to see that Claire's room was there, as well as CJ's; they would probably have to watch if the two of them started to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I even have better she said\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, they saw themselves, laying completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... us?\" Not only could they not recognize themselves in what they saw, they could not get where the camera was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To give you the best view of me and CJ, I figured a spy camera placed in between my boobs would give you the perfect view of what it could had been if either of you had done what I will do with CJ\" Claire said, with yet another evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for now... I shall leave you with Abida. Should you stop watching, I am sure that she will find ways to have her fun with you, right Abida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow</span></div></div>",

So she opened the door and saw you lounging on the bed while  a group of maids wait on you hand and foot. One maid was feeding you a hot-fudge sundae, another maid was massaging your massive stomach, and the other maid was rubbing your shoulders. Claire couldn't help but smile at you, all those months seduction, showering you with gifts, convincing you to move in with her and fattening you up were about to pay off. Over the course of the four weeks that Rebecca and Kate were here, Claire managed to get you up to 317 lbs making you big enough to become part of the Master family, while Claire now weighs 342 lbs (why Claire didn't gain that much is because she wanted to wait until you and her became a couple that way the two of you could gain together).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will do it girls.\" Claire stated. \"Let me and CJ have our privacy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" The maids replied as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the maids left, Claire waddled to the bed and sat right next you with her belly rubbing against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk about this early in the morning.\" You yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well CJ you've been living here for a while and we've been bonding for quite sometime now.\" Claire stated as she pressed her cleavage against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and in all honesty I've enjoyed living here.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that, so I was wondering if well...\" Claire paused as she reached into her cleavage and pulled out a box which had a gold wristband with your initials on it. \"We could become a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of thinking you realize that you and Claire have been spending a lot of time together, plus you haven't seen Rebecca and Kate at all lately, so you made up your mind and gave Claire your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we could be a couple.\" You announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Claire heard those words a surge of overwhelming happiness overcame and hugged you causing you to fall over with Claire right on top of you with both your bellies pressed against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ Dalton you just made me the happiest girl alive.\" Claire as she started kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" You replied after there was break in the kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour the two made out like there was no tomorrow with Claire squeezing the fat on your belly and having you feel her breasts. But you honestly didn't care about that anymore, all you cared about was Claire. Meanwhile back with Rebecca and Kate they were horrified to the fact the lost their best friend to a devious mastermind and they were powerless to do anything about it. They wanted to look away but if they did who knows what Abida would do to them, so they continue watching as all hope for the two continue to dwindle away into sadness and despair.</span></div></div>",

Eventually other people heard about his good fortune they went up the mountains as well to get a piece of it and a town was established.  It was four years later when my great-great-grandfather was tending his garden. He went to his tool shed when he noticed that the ground he stood on felt a bit loose. It was actually a sinkhole, but he found out too late and fell in. Thankfully he did not fall too far and was not injured, when came to he discovered that his property was underneath a large vein of silver.

An in-flight movie was playing on the large screen in front of you and Claire was leaning against your side while watching it. The huge breakfast had made you far too groggy and sleepy to follow the plot, so you enjoyed the comfort and occasionally shoveled more popcorn in your mouth. Mrs. Masters and Ms. Telleri were sitting in front of the plane, both munching down some cakes while gossiping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the plane had landed your group took a limo to the harbor and switched to a yacht. After enjoying another large meal on the big deck of the luxury yacht you arrived on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped on the pier you have to stop and admire the mansion in front of you. It was huge, big enough to house at least 3 families. The garden next to it was as amazing as one would expect and the ocean view was simply breathtaking. One side of the island even had a small beach. While you were busy looking at the view the three women were slowly but steadily waddling towards the mansion. You decided to slowly make your way to there too, admiring the garden on your way to there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid was already waiting for you, offering you a large glass as you approached. \"You must be feeling full after breakfast and the snack during boat trip, Master Dalton. Please drink this, it'll help you digest. Trust me, you'll need all the help you can get to make it through the meals Madame Masters has planned for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked the maid and started sipping the drink as you entered the mansion.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes she would have her cleavage pressed against your neck and sometimes it was a little bit of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you took your seat next to your mom the smells of breakfast woke Claire up in an instant and instantly start munching on a large stack of waffles that the maids gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...where\u2019s my breakfast?\u201d You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is actually part of your second trial CJ.\u201d Mrs. Masters replied. \u201cAbida will explain what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mrs. Masters.\u201d Abida said obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said that, Abida left Mrs. Masters side and her way to your side of the table with that same indifferent look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ Dalton, current weight 335lbs.\u201d Abida stated. \u201cYour second will trial will be a blind taste test to see if you have the taste buds of a Master.\u201d \u201cA dish will be presented to you and you\u2019ll taste it and describe what that food item is.\u201d \u201cGuess right and you can proceed to the next dish, guess wrong and you\u2019ll have to eat the whole food item in question.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have ten tries but you only need five to pass.\u201d \u201cIf you take the blindfold off anytime during the taste test, you\u2019ll automatically fail.\u201d The only time that you can take off the blindfold is when you\u2019re eating the item that you guessed wrong on.\u201d \u201cDo you understand the rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201d Abida replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbida then put the blindfold over your eyes and one of the maids presented the first dish to you. While you are tasting it you notice that it is very small and flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a saltine cracker with crunchy peanut butter and strawberry jam.\u201d You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second dish was also flat but it was a bit larger and had a sort of runniness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fried quail egg with parsley and sea salt.\u201d You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed wrong on the third and fourth dishes which were: bananas foster on top of Belgian waffles and spring rolls with sliced carrots, celery, leeks and onions so you had to eat all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fifth dish the item had rich, buttery texture and had a thick sauce on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cButtermilk biscuits with mushroom gravy.\u201d You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you guessed wrong on the sixth dish which was: a lobster tail with a pinch of garlic salt and kale which you ate pretty fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the seventh dish the item had a very sweet and powdered flavor to it which felt like it had powdered sugar on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeignets with powdered sugar on top.\u201d You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way to the eighth dish you can\u2019t help but notice that your time with the Masters has improved your taste buds a bit. You\u2019ve never eaten a quail egg before or seen Belgian waffles yet this food is very common in the Master\u2019s household. That being said your taste buds haven\u2019t improved that much since you\u2019ve only been living there for a few months and the Masters have been eating this kind of food for most of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was shown as you guessed wrong on the eighth and ninth dishes which were: a turkey leg covered in a bourbon barbecue sauce with rosemary mashed potatoes and wagyu short rib with saffron and chives. Which you had a slower time eating due to all of the food you ate. You were down to your last try and you needed to guess right on it otherwise you\u2019d have to do this all over again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tasted your final item you noticed it had some juiciness to it and tasted like it was from the sea but nothing you\u2019ve ever tasted before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSevruga caviar with egg yolks on top of a slice of brioche bread.\u201d You guessed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited anxiously for what seemed like eternity for Abida\u2019s response and you got it seconds later which was\u2026</span></div></div>",

You relaxed your bulk into your seat, your entire body sagging as you rested your fingertips atop your bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wrapped her meaty arms around you, choking you just a little. \"Never doubted you!

The Third Trial shall commence at midday. Relax until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked--or rather waddled--away from the table, Claire close behind. \"You full? Need a belly rub for the third challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be opposed to it.\" You grin as you fall onto the nearest sofa. You unbutton your pants, and let that soft, warm chub roll out, warm and stuffed enough for Claire to run her fingers over it, pressing, prodding, squeezing handfuls of it. You recline as she churned your middle, churned the food you had devoured, until warm, soothing easiness swept over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, it was midday. You woke from your nap, a little groggy.

But when you got inside the only thing you saw to change into was some neon-green loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d You asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a mawashi.\u201d One of the maids explained. \u201cA traditional loincloth that sumo wrestlers wear in their matches.\u201d \u201cNow please hold still while we get you prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the maids began undressing you and put the mawashi around your waist. It looked kind of snug on you but it will have to do and the color was a nice choice as well. You then exited the door on the other side of the room and entered what looked like an authentic sumo ring (or dohyo for the correct term) as it had every little detail that the traditional rings do. On right side of the ring you saw Abida who was waiting for Mrs. Masters to come out and on the other side of the ring were your mom who was checking her hair and Claire who was also waiting but also giving you that lust filled look that you knew all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three minutes of waiting Mrs. Masters exited the dressing room on the other side of the room and she made the sumo look work for her. Mrs. Masters had her long hair done in a ponytail so it would not get in her way during the match. She was a wearing a rose colored leotard with cherry blossom prints on it and a ruby colored mawashi. As Mrs. Masters made her way on to the ring you were starting to get nervous. Not only did she have the weight advantage on you, but she\u2019s anything like Claire, Mrs. Masters will probably use her body to distract you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready CJ?\u201d Mrs. Masters asked in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d You replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019m not going easy on you.\u201d Mrs. Masters stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Abida walks towards her position as referee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere are the rules CJ.\u201d Abida explained. \u201cThis is a single elimination round where the traditional rules of sumo wrestling apply here.\u201d \u201cMrs. Masters wins if she manages to either pin you the ground or pushes you out of the ring.\u201d \u201cCJ you\u2019ll win if you manage to either pin Mrs. Masters to the ground, push her out of the ring or survive two minutes in the ring.\u201d \u201cNow with that out of the way are you ready to begin CJ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes I am.\u201d You said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica Masters are you ready.\u201d Abida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen begin.\u201d Abida said while getting out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen right out of the starting gate Mrs. Masters came charging at you (which from your point of view was like watching an elephant sprint). Before you knew it you were getting a face full of cleavage as Mrs. Masters began to slowly push you out of the ring. With quick thinking you managed to break free from Mrs. Masters grip and side step to the left which caused her to lose her footing momentarily before regaining her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick thinking CJ.\u201d Mrs. Masters commented. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be much fun if I beat you that easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so she\u2019s a lot faster than you thought she would be.\u201d You thought to yourself. \u201cI need to come up with a plan or I\u2019m screwed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

But you\u2019ve manage to avoid most of them by the skin of your teeth thanks to some last minute dodging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter CJ?\u201d Mrs. Masters asked in a taunting voice. \u201cAfraid of little old me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Masters is a lot of things, but little is not one of them.\u201d You thought to yourself.  \u201cNot really, just have to keep away from you for just a little longer.\u201d <br>\r\nYou replied to Mrs. Masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is how much longer can you keep this up? With only a minute and five seconds left you\u2019re nearing your breaking point. But you also wondered how long Mrs. Masters could keep going as well. But the fatigue was finally catching up to you as Mrs. Masters finally got a grip on you and proceeded to push you out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s only forty seconds left.\u201d You thought to yourself. \u201cI have to give it everything I have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the clock ticking away, you mustered what remaining strength you had and began to pushing against Mrs. Masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you finally decided to fight back CJ.\u201d Mrs. Masters said in an excited tone.  \u201cWell bring it on then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mrs. Masters proceeds to push even hard as her gut presses against yours, her thick legs rubbing against your legs and her large cleavage pushing against your chest. But, like you originally thought Mrs. Masters is still stronger than you and she\u2019s slowly pushing you towards the end of the ring. But you can\u2019t give in no matter how tried your legs were getting or how much your joints were aching, you had to endure. But just when it looked like you were about to be pushed out of the ring\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d Abida stated. \u201cCJ has passed the third trial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Abida said time was up Mrs. Masters released her grip on you and fell back to the ground with a large thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* *pant* WOW, I have *pant* not moved like that *pant* in ages!\u201d Mrs. Masters exclaimed while gasping for breath. \u201cAbida get *pant* me some water *pant* please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d Abida quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Abida left, you fall to the ground due to exhaustion as well, but your quickly met with a hug from Claire much like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay to go CJ I knew you had it in you.\u201d Claire said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Claire, but it was a close one though.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice work sweetie.\u201d Your mom said. \u201cBut that was a short match though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSumo matches don\u2019t usually last that long anyway Bianca.\u201d Mrs. Masters said after catching her breath. \u201cAnyway, CJ you did very well against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Masters.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Abida returned with water for Mrs. Masters which she promptly gulps down like she was dying of dehydration. Abida then looks at you the same way she did this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour third trial will be during dinner.\u201d Abida stated.  \u201cYou can relax until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went back to your changing room and were about to put on your usual clothes, but were stopped by the two maids from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies CJ, but you have to put this on first.\u201d One of the maids said while showing what looked to be a corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d You asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the constrictor corset.\u201d The maid explained. \u201cDidn\u2019t Abida explain this to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she did not.\u201d You said while shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe constrictor corset had always been used for the final trial of being accepted into the Master\u2019s family for generations.\u201d The maid explained. \u201cFinal trial is eating so much food that it will cause the constrictor corset to burst right of you.\u201d \u201cAlso, if Abida explains the trial to you, don\u2019t tell her that we already explained it to you or she\u2019ll have our hides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d You said in a reassuring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the two maids proceeded to put to the corset on you and you see why they call it the constrictor corset. The thing was squeezing your gut like a giant python and made you look like you lost 200 lbs (something Claire would never stand for). After making sure the corset was on nice and tight, you put on the rest of your clothes on and headed back to your room to watch TV and relax before the coming dinner storm.</span></div></div>",

Just like before, you were filled with anxiety about what was going to happen. Also the corset was making you feel uncomfortable and it\u2019s a little itchy. Before you knew it you were back at the dining hall where your mom and Mrs. Masters were already sitting down at the table and waiting for you patiently. Claire was also there but she looked displeased for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom does CJ really have to wear that stupid corset?\u201d Claire complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Claire.\u201d Mrs. Masters replied. \u201cI know you were not looking forward to this part, but just bare it for a little longer and it will all be over soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat corset makes you look like how you were before you went to Chubbeso sweetie.\u201d Your mom said in a joking tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mom.\u201d You replied as you took your seat by Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow CJ for the final trial, we must see if you have the appetite of a Masters.\u201d Abida explained. \u201cI will be in charge of your portion sizes which will increase bit by bit as the dinner goes on and it will be over when the constrictor corset bursts off.\u201d \u201cUnderstand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mam.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first dish that was brought out were deluxe cheese burgers that had two wagyu beef patties, fresh vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions), bacon, three kinds of kinds of cheese (American, Swiss and Colby-jack), all on a toasted sesame seed bun. Beside them were large baskets of French fries and a tall glass of water. Abida handed gave you two burgers and a plate of fries and you started to chow down immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected the food was amazing, the fries were well seasoned and crispy which were how you like them, and the ketchup brings out a nice sweetness to them. The burgers were nicely cooked with no pink in the meat, the vegetables added a nice crisp texture and the bacon adds the right amount of saltiness to the burger. Within fifteen minutes you finish the entire plate of burgers (and fire) and you\u2019re starting to feel full already. This makes you wonder if all the food for dinner was specifically made for making you fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this food have empty calories Claire?\u201d You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Claire replied while wiping her and rolling her eyes to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know whenever Claire rolls her eyes to the left like that it means yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn to the next course.\u201d Abida stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the first trial had more refined and high class food this one just simple food that you were familiar with. Each dish you devoured one after the other: pepperoni pizza, hot dogs, buffalo wings and fish tacos. As the dinner progressed the corset was growing tighter and tighter on you, but you so busy eating that you didn\u2019t notice it. It was when you were eating a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs you realized how much staying with Claire and her mom affected you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you would\u2019ve been full after one meal, but now you feel like you could five or six more meals. You can\u2019t remember the last time you did anything labor intensive since the maids do almost all of the work for you except for eating and very minor stuff like playing video games. Claire has made so many advances on you that you almost expect to see her sleeping in your bed, getting a face full of her cleavage or for her to smother your body with her own fat gut. Mrs. Masters acted more like mom towards you as each day passed that it almost felt like you were related to her. It truly felt like you were becoming part of their family: a Masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pasta was finished, it was time for desert. Beginning with a giant slice of devil\u2019s food cake with cookies and cream ice cream, a large stack of salted caramel covered brownies with a chocolate milkshake and a large bowl of butterscotch pudding. But when you were finishing a big piece of peanut brittle you heard a ripping sound followed by seeing something getting flung across the dining room. You look down at your gut and see that you shirt is ripped apart and that the constrictor corset is gone which means you completed the final trial. But just before you could celebrate with everyone else, you passed out due to the sheer quantity of food you just ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours you began to regain consciousness and see your resting on someone\u2019s  pudgy lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see your up sleepyhead.\u201d The person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the person\u2019s face and see that it is\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since she was not going anywhere, Mrs. Masters decided to wear something a bit casual. So the maids put on a simple red long sleeve shirt and grey wind pants. She then proceeded to the dining hall with Abida following from behind while the maids resumed their usual duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre CJ and Claire eating breakfast?\u201d Mrs. Masters asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re still asleep.\u201d Abida quickly replied. \u201cFrom what I heard from the maids, the young mistress kept Mr. Dalton up all night with a non-stop party celebrating his success with becoming a masters. \u201cOdds are they will not be joining us for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d Mrs. Masters replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few more things Mrs. Masters wanted to talk to you about, but that can wait for another time. Pretty soon, Mrs. Masters arrived in the dining hall where your mom is just finishing up a large bowl of fruit salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Bianca.\u201d Mrs. Masters said in a cheery tone. \u201cReady to enjoy our spa day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there Jessica.\u201d Your mom replied while wiping her face with a napkin. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been excited about it ever since you told me about it on Thursday.\u201d \u201cI always wanted to go to a spa but I could never afford to go to one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Bianca, prepare to get pampered like never before.\u201d  Mrs. Masters stated while eating a giant cheese omelet. \u201cA Master\u2019s spa day makes all other spa days feel puny in comparison both figuratively and literally.\u201d \u201cOnce I am done eating we\u2019ll head out, but before we do which would you like to do first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

In a matter seconds the fountain had completely risen from the hatch and had was already pouring out chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a chocolate fountain?\u201d Your mom asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just any chocolate fountain.\u201d Mrs. Masters said proudly. \u201cA chocolate fountain that is using Hans&amp;Gretels special reserve chocolate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe special reserve chocolate!\u201d Your mom said in shock. \u201cThat stuff is not easy to come by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, this special chocolate only comes out once every five years to celebrate the company\u2019s anniversary.\u201d Mrs. Masters explained. \u201cEven then the chocolate is sold in limited quantity and very expensive, but once it comes out most people will do anything to get some.\u201d \u201cOnly eleven people know how to make the reserve chocolate and Augustus is one of them, the other ten are employees that he trusts without a doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also heard a rumor from one of the employees that the reserve chocolate is super fattening and that add pounds on a person in a matter of minutes.\u201d Your mom added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course the rumor is true, the reserve chocolate is one of the contributions to this vast figure of mine.\u201d Mrs. Masters said proudly while slapping her gut. \u201cNow, bring out the somen flumes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the maids brought out two, long flumes that were usually used for somen noodles and brought them towards the chocolate fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those for?\u201d Your mom asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese will bring the chocolate to us while we get our message.\u201d Mrs. Masters replied with a grin on her face. \u201cNow let's get our spa day started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two women went to their respective massage tables and laid down with their backs facing up. At the same time the maids adjust the flumes so that the chocolate would pour directly into their mouths. Once the flumes were adjusted, the one maids went towards Mrs. Masters and another maid went towards your mom and began massaging their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of the maid\u2019s hands rubbing and pressing against the flab of their backs was a pure feeling of pleasure like wet clay being molded. All the while drinking the special reserve chocolate that was pouring down the flumes, which added more pleasure in addition the to the massage. Both women could feel their bodies growing as they drank more and more of the chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, this is great.\u201d Bianca said happily. \u201cCJ needs to try this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrinking special reserve chocolate while getting a full body massage, truly there is no greater feeling out there.\u201d Mrs. Masters replied calmly.</span></div></div>",

She was huffing and puffing, and her head was sweating a little bit. Claire was bending over with her hands on her knees. From looking at her backside her butt crack was showing a little bit. I could not help to think that all of that was sexy. When I thought it could not be any better, Claire walked over and grabbed my hand and put it on her belly. \"Look at me CJ, I think i'm wasting away here\" Claire allowing me to touch her middle i tried my best to not make my nose bleed. While I was touching her belly I could here the sounds of Claire's sexual moaning. \"I you have any requests CJ let me now tomorrow\" Before she walker to her side of her room, I walked up to Claire gave her a long kiss.

You looked up and saw you'r belly protruded, you're worried if you grow at this rate, that you will soon be immobile. As soon as Claire said that, the girls as if they were trained (they probably were), started massaging your belly to reduce the pain of the fullness.

All of your shirt buttons have popped already leaving your large flabby stomach and man boobs exposed. The sleeves on your shirt were tight due to your New fat arms.  Your hands were fat as well and your fingers were comparable to sausages.  Your pants button and zipper have long since popped and broken. Even your belt had ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had found a new Kind of laziness while lying down and had found it extremely difficult to get up. Your double chin wasn't helping either considering it acted as a second pillow. You were really hungry even though you had eaten an hour ago. <br>\r\nYou were just staring at the girls as they gave you lustful looks and licked their lips as they rubbed your stomach and man boobs circling around your belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen bunny came back with another two carts of food you groaned.

Help him up so we can test him\"<br>\r\nThe two big girls who had Been rubbing your stomach and lying on you so that you wouldn't escape helped you up. They took out  a scale and a mirror. When you stepped on the scale you couldn't even see it. Your new huge belly prevented you from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"382\" the girl said happily <br>\r\nYou gasp and look over to the mirror and saw that it was true. You had gained over a hundred pounds in five short weeks. Claire seemed more than happy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cj could you do me a favor and try to touch your toes\" Claire asked<br>\r\nYou tried bending over a little bit but your stomach was preventing you from going two inches past your knees. As you tried some more you got out if breath pretty quickly and started panting and sweating. Even though you tried again and again it just didn't seem possible. On your tenth try you heard a big 'RIIIP' ..... your pants had just ripped. All the girls squealed even more. One even fainted. <br>\r\nThe sound of the rip startled you and caused you to fall backwards making the floor literally shake. When you tried to get back up you found that you couldn't. You tried again and found yourself already out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww let's help our chubby bunny back up\" Claire said as she helped you up with the aid of two others.  \"I think he should get his food now\" she pushed you back on to the bed where you were actually glad to be. A meal is what you needed. As you got on to the bed two big girls placed their chubby bodies on your arms and legs for restraint. Not that you needed it. You weren't going anywhere soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ohhh my head... where am I\"? You said. You take a glance of your surroundings and you soon figure out that your in the gym, more specifically the sumo ring. Chubbeseo academy while its sports aren't the greatest the sumo team is the best team in all of Europe. The sumo team has won many trophies and has even made it to nationals. Although they lost to the Japanese team and came in 2nd place but came really close to winning. The arena itself was custom built for the school and could hold over hundreds of people. Everything inside looked like a traditional Japanese sumo arena so it would feel more authentic. \"How did I end up in the gy..ow\". You said trying to stand up but you bumped your head. \"What the\"? You then see the metal bars that surrounded you and realize that your in a large cage. \"Why I'm a in a cage\"? You were thinking about it and just as soon as you figured it out you heard rumbling again. It was the fanclub coming out of the lockeroom wearing the traditional female sumo outfits. \"Look girls he's finally up\". Said one of the more larger girls. \"So lets get this tournament started\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tournament\"? You said confused. You remember from the school events board that the sumo team is not facing anyone for another two weeks. Then the largest girl of the group waddled towards you and informed you about what's going on. \"You see CJ we were all talking in the lockeroom about who would be the perfect girl for you, but things got a little out of hand during the discussion and everyone started yelling and pushing each other\". \"In the end we decided that the only fair way to settle the matter is to have a competition and the winner gets to be your girlfriend\". \"Oh and we put you in that cage so you wouldn't run away but we'll let you out when its all over\". You knew that the fanclub was crazy but you didn't think that they were this crazy. A sumo tournament and your the grand prize its just plain nuts. The large girl then turned around to the rest of the club. \"So is everyone ready\"? \"Yeahhhh\"!! They all shouted with fiery determination to win. \"Then lets begin\". She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast you pack of love-hungry wolves\". A voice shouted. The fanclub turned around to see that it was Rebecca, Kate and Claire. \"Oh its CJ's bodyguards what brings you here\"? She asked in sarcastic tone. \"You know why were here as soon as CJ didn't show up for first period we knew something was up\". Rebecca said in an aggravated voice. \"At first I thought that the princess here finally went off the deep end and kidnapped CJ\". \"But when me and Kate talked to her she said that she hasn't seen him all mourning\". \"How many times do I have to tell you not to call me that nickname\". Claire sad interrupting Rebecca's deduction. \"Let me finish\"! Rebecca said. \"So anyway we all figured that only other group of people that would be crazy enough to pull a stunt like this just to get to CJ would be none other than his fanclub\". \"So let him go now before I break that stupid cage open and give you all a piece of my mind\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that you won't be breaking anything\". The girl said in a calm, confident tone. \"The cage is made of reinforced titanium and completely blast proof, you won't be able to put a dent in it\". \"Plus I have the only key that opens the cage and only the winner of the tournament gets it, so if you want to save CJ you need to compete in our tournament and win\". \"I guess we have no choice but to enter\". Rebecca said unwillingly. \"Rebecca you can't be serious\". Kate said with face bright red full of embarrassment. \"I don't like the outfits they squeeze my body and are uncomfortable to move around in\". \"Plus I don't want CJ to see me in that outfit\". \"We don't have a choice in this situation\". Claire said calmly. \"Its the only way to fet CJ out of that cage\". Her voice then changed from calm to anger. \"Furthermore no one puts my CJ in a cage and walks scott free\". \"So what's it going to be are you in or out\"? The girl said waiting impatiently for an answer. \"Alright we'll compete in our little tournament\". Rebecca said. \"Alright then put the outfits on an we can get started\". A few minutes later the three girls came out with sumo outfits on. \"Okay now that everyone's ready we can begin\".</span></div></div>",

Making sure to keep an eye out for anything, you turn your head to the right and then to the left\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you breath a sigh of relief, so far, nothing was out of the ordinary. Even if the fan club was up to something, in the hallowed halls of the academy, you could hear them stomping after you or even hear their tired panting. But you figure you\u2019d rather not take your chances, you were proven wrong by the club when you thought you could outrun them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you quickly grab your books, quietly close your locker, double lock it with the padlock you had on it before (you learned the hard way that there was at least one girl who knew how to break into lockers in your club, so you decided to do some double security when you realized that your gym clothes \u2018mysteriously\u2019 disappeared one day), and dash off and headed for the corner\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Only for you to collide into something (or someone) that was almost the exact same size of you. The force sent both you and the other object tumbling to the ground with your books bouncing on the floor. \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOF!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of it, you smacked into someone rather than something, and slowly you open your eyes in order to make sure that you didn\u2019t seriously hurt someone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 And the moment you do, all you can see is blue, a large amount of blue pointed straight at you. Could it be possible that you were looking at a vast sea? Or even the sky outside? Your eyes widen slightly and you realize what you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t the sky or the sea, but rather a large pair of light blue colored panties that were covering a large and round butt (Not the largest you\u2019ve seen, but certainly one of the shapeliest you\u2019ve seen at this academy and it certainly wasn\u2019t at regular size) with creamy flesh spilling out from the side of the fabric. At first you can feel your face getting red at the sight before you, but then you realize that the person you were looking at was starting to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in front of you gasped loudly as she quickly stood up and pulled down the large skirt she had around her waist. And that\u2019s when you finally got a good look at the girl who was spinning around to face you, her slightly long dark blue hair (with a few sky blue highlights in the front) whipping around her cute yet cold slightly chubby face glaring down at you. From the waist up, it looked as though the girl was only a little bit over weight with the beginnings of a pot belly and small breasts (certainly some of the smallest you\u2019ve seen at the academy) that were wrapped up in the baggy uniform top. But from the waist down, you could easily see where this girl\u2019s weight was distributed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Although, judging from the death look in her eyes, the large blush on her face, and the fact that she was cracking her knuckles \u2013 That might not be the best thing to bring up right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, you knew who this girl was \u2013 And unlike a majority of the school, she practically hated your guts! This incident more than likely just threw more fuel on the fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 G-G-Good morning, C-C-Chris,\u201d You sheepishly chuckle as you slowly began to crawl backwards in hopes of getting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ\u2026\u201d the girl named Chris growled loudly as she took a step forward, a dark aura slowly become visible around her entire body. \u201cI see you\u2019re still wandering the halls\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d You answer quickly with a nervous smile on your face. \u201cL-Look Chris, it\u2026 It was an accident! I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your world went dark when Chris\u2019s fist collided with your head\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then recognize the familiar surroundings of the infirmary and huge women sitting next to you in the chair which is the academy's nurse Erika Young. She short red hair and pretty brown eyes which always leave guys spechless once they look at her. She was wearing her favorite pharmacist jacket and her stethiscope which was laying on huge breasts (that are even bigger than clarie's). Her large gut was pushing up and against her shirt and her pants which really didn't bother her, she likes the feeling of being bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was I out Ms.Young\"? You said worried that you'd miss most of your moring classes. \"Oh CJ you know you can just call me Erika\". She said rubbing her fat hand on your cheek. \"Also you've been out for an hour\". \"An hour\"! You said shocked. \"Don't worry I gave you late slip, besides I don't think that's real problem\". Erika then handed you a mirror. \"What are you talking abou.. OH MY GOODNESS\"!! You yelled. Your reflection showed you that you got a black eye and a really bad one at that. You then remebered before you got knocked out by Chirs, she must've puched you in the eye. \"Ohh man\". You said. \"What are my friends going say when they see this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and came in the last person you'd want to see your black eye Claire Masters. \"Good morning Ms Young\". Claire said waddling through the large door and towards the nurse. \"Hello there Claire, what brings you here\"? Erika said curiously. \"Just came by to give some of the muffins Bunnie made\". Claire replied. \"Just put them on my desk, I'm tending to someone right now\". Erika replied back.\"Who are you tending to\". She asked curiously. She then peeked behind Erika's large figure after placing the food on her desk and saw her beloved with a blackeye. \"CJ, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU\"?!? Claire said in total horror of seeing your blackeye. \"Hi Claire\". You said trying to sound alright. Claire then waddled very fast towards her love and sat right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you...it was Chris wasn't it\". She said angerly. Claire and Chris never really saw eye to eye, in fact they couldn't be in the same room without getting into a fight. While Rebecca and Kate are unaware of Chirs's hatred towards you, Clarie was well aware of it and what Chris did now made the princess full blown mad. \"Where is that glorified sea cow\"!! She screamed clenching her fat fist. \"When I get my hands on her I'm gonna make her regret the day she ever layed a finger on my precious CJ\". \"Clarie its no big deal\". You said trying to calm her down. Claire then turned her attention towards you and gave you a large hug. \"Don't worry CJ I'll make sure that sea hag never touched you again I promise\". she said lovingly. \"Good to hear now can you stop hugging me\". You muffled through her belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then let go of you and then got up from the bed. \"CJ, Clarie you'd better get going to your next class\". Erika said. \"Of course, come on Clarie let's get going to\"..</span></div></div>",

You said calmly. Just then a girl lunged towards you and gave you a hug. \"AHHHH\". You screamed being scared out of your wits. You fall down on the floor dropping your stuff and looked up to see the girl in front of you. Then you see the familiar uniform that stood out from the usual uniforms with different color patterns, cat patches scattered across the uniform and buttons with pictures of dragons in place of the normal buttons. You then know that its Katherine Anderson the fashion designer of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi CJ, a little jumpy today aren't you.\" She said while giving you a hand getting up. \" Hi Kat, sorry about that I thought you were someone else.\" You said embarrassed. \"No worries, I was just on my way to Mrs. Telleri's class and I saw you.\" \"Since its rare to see you without your two bodygaurds (referring to Rebecca and Kate), the princess clinging to you like a parasite, or being mauled by your fans I thought I'd say hi\".  She said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way to mrs Telleri's class to, by the way I noticed that your uniforms looking a bit tight.\" You said. \"I know I've gained a few pounds, I'm trying to keep my figure since less than a tenth of the girls here are thin and if I turn into a fat blimp or I can kiss my fashion dream goodbye\". She said while poking at here belly. \"Anyway we should get going\". After picking up your stuff you went towards your first class of the day, cooking. Once you and Kat reached the room you both went to your seats. You sat in the front of the room in between Clarie and Kate while Kat sat near the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then noticed that Mrs. Telleri is not here. \"Hey Kate where's Mrs. Telleri?'

Kate, who wanted to be close to the action, would occasionally bump her hip into CJ's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we'll get you see you with your shirt off,\" Claire said, smiling, \"and you'll get to see me almost naked too.\" This wasn't always so. While they did pull their shirts up to get their measurements, they never stripped students unless they wanted to be stripped, and CJ, knowing the sort of controversy it would cause, knowing how he'd be glomped and crushed under the masses of hundreds of horny girls, would never take his shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the line waned until their quartet was up. CJ swallowed hard as they were measured...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So the four of you stood in one of the many lines formed by the voluptuous student bodies. Judging by headcount, you were in the seventh row down out of fifteen. Despite the ostentatious prosperity of the Master Family, which served direct funding for not only much of Chubbeso Academy but also for their own lavish lifestyle, there was not really a room designated for this type of event. So, rather than shell out a couple hundred thousand pounds for an add-on to the already heavily modified campus, it was decided that they would instead repurpose the gymnasium. Lets be honest, its students and faculty weren't using it to its full potential anyway. One day without gym wouldn't kill them; they'd survived plenty by the looks of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho, so you're in line behind Rebecca and Claire with Kate behind you. Kat is visible as the third head behind Kate, and you even make out the dreadful blue locks of Christina Walker not too far from you. In front of Rebecca, there's one girl waiting to go after the one already getting examined. At your old school, checkups were a bit of a private matter; but this was something else entirely. The students, ranging from small to large to incredibly so, stood on a sort of platform with a drawn curtain that stood a good eight feet tall. Each station was manned with their own physician who had a small countertop to place his or her things. Obviously most of them were flown in, as your extended stay in the melting pot of a campus has graced you with the ability to pick out different accents. Amidst the clamoring voices of your classmates, you can hear some faint remarks of from the doctors: being either words of encouragement, comfort, or even flat-out lies to either console or subdue the overfed rich girls being examined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Claire?\" you whisper as you lean into her earshot, \"Whats up with these doctors, don't they find something... off about all the weight issues with our classmates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress turned, \"Oh that?\" she says dismissively, \"My mother flies these people from all corners of the world just like she does our classmates. She pays for their first class tickets and accommodations while they stay in-campus for the distinct purpose of keeping the girls here happy, since a lot of the school's money comes from investors who dote over their daughters.\" she crossed her thick arms under her heavy breasts and turned to face the crowd on her left. \"Yep, my mother's a genius alright. She's made this place way better since she bought it.\" You can't help but think that outright lying to such young girls was a little underhanded of Ms. Masters, but seeing as how this entire school was just a little nuts, you decided to let it go unsaid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to your left, you could see that the previously examined girl had stepped out from behind the curtain and was wobbling down the stairs as the next nameless student waddled up the stairs, careful not to fall. You could only sigh as your mind travels back to this morning, and several other mornings prior to that one. If you kept up this rate of gaining, it would be no time before you were as big as a house. The strain on your waist was only a harsh reminder that spending time in an academy that served to cater your every whim seemed to bring out the glutton in you. Well, the glutton in everybody by the looks of things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst!\" a foreign, hushed voice beckons, \"Psst, Mr. Dalton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the addressment of your name, highly doubting that you were in any danger. If it was anybody out to hurt you, they would have just punched you in the face. And if it was one of your fangirls, they'd have just squealed and suffocated you. Nope, this was new. Finesse. Eventually after several more signals, you see the hulking form of a familiar nurse. \"Hey, I'll be back. Hold my spot.\" you say to Kate before stiff-legging it over to Nurse Young; a long time acquaintance whom had kept you nice and functional after the long hours of suffocation underneath overpowering amounts of lady-blubber. She was in uniform, as usual, though it wasn't her usual scrubs. She was dressed in a full-on doctor's robe similar to the ones that the physicians here were wearing. \"Hey Ms. Young.\" you say nonchalantly, \"Aren't you running Check-up day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika Young was a stout, well lots more than stout, half-Asian woman who had all but outgrown her office. She was taller than most women in her ethnicity, but still only placed about average to other women. For what she lacked in general height, Ms. Young made up for in overall girth. She was a portly woman whose overall dimensions alone were suffocating. Her stomach spilled outwards quite a bit from her actual waistline and dripped over non-existent belt line; almost completely censoring her from the waist down. Her large breasts sat atop this wobbling pagoda; a monument to her overindulgence, and shared very much the same consistency. Full and in excess, the heavy scrub-puppies in addition to her overall obesity were more than enough to keep everyone's favorite nurse in more than just occasional back pain. \"Absolutely.\" she said excitedly, her prominent round face's movements echoed in her thick double chin, \"And I thought, since last year your changing caused such a ruckus, that you'd have no problem with a private session under my care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, since it was to be expected, you could only smile and turn a little red at her proposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, CJ, you're probably the most constant man in my life right now, but I think you're a little young for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were graced with privacy due to the curse of your gender, or perhaps the intensity of desperation that was deeply rooted in a good majority of the opposite one, your friends were left to go without your presence. Fortunate for two of them, they got along like peaches and cream while you weren't around. Claire, due to a harsh rivalry brewed quickly between herself and Rebecca, wasn't quite as lucky. Slowly, each member of your social clique took their place inside the physician counter and their weights were finally revealed to them...</span></div></div>",

Nodding and making sure that the curtain was securely shut behind her, Rebecca removed her uniform jacket and started to unbutton her blouse. With her significantly portly fingers, unbuttoning and rebuttoning these days was starting to become a real challenge for the headstrong tsundere. She grunted slightly as she struggled with the tiny pearl colored buttons of her stark white uniform, managing to get one out of its slot in about a minute or so. After about three, her heavy sagging breasts were finally allowed to breath. For not being very big for a girl her size, her girls seemed to require a lot of ventilation. They spilled outwards, stretching the fabric a little, after their confinement slowly released. Soon, her stomach felt the same relief as its thick sloshy texture fought against the tight shaping uniform. Later rather than sooner, Rebecca was entirely naked from her bottom up; having forgone a nonexistent bra that fit this morning \"by accident\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going commando, today Miss Maglen?\" the doctor asked snarkily as she choked down her breakfast at the sight of Rebecca's round form. Breathing rather heavily and face flushed with embarrassment, Rebecca could only mumble incoherently as she struggled to remain composed. She waddled over to the scale and set her shape rather heavily onto the over-sensitive black mat- her entire upper body a quivering mound of unstable gelatin as her stomach swayed back and forth. After a few seconds of recalibration, the bright red numbers bore and even 250 pounds and Rebecca stepped off. The doctor took a gander at her chart from last year, \"Miss Maglen... it says here that you started last year with a weight of 185... thats a gain of almost seventy pounds since last year started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was ever going to get that fat Chubbeso bonus check from that overstuffed sow, Ms. Masters, she was going to have to play it nice with these girls... even if it killed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, standing at... um, 1.7 meters, I-I think it balances out quite nicely. Your BMI should be about a 38 s-so with a little diet and exercise you should be just fine the next time I see you. N-Now would you mind tying your hair back so that I can get your measurements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, yeah, thanks.\" Rebecca said rather rudely as she deciphered the hidden comments about her weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, being much more \"generous\" in size than Rebecca was quite the sight for the practicing nurse who was forced to stare at this heaping hill of royal jelly. While the first girl had at least been rather tall and seemed to have some general shape about her sagging form, this next one was an absolute tub of goo. She was fat all over, like a little ball of blubber. It made her look rather young, with pink rosy cheeks that were so wide it squinted her eyes ever so slightly. Shirtless, she drooped everywhere. Like she was actually <i>trying</i> to make herself look fatter. Her long strawberry blonde hair fell over her shoulders and rested between the folds of her overstuffed arm fat and her enormous hooters. She smiled at the doctor, \"So, how do I look?\" she asked, seductively striking a pose for the knowingly-paid off doctor; who almost vomited as she watched Claire's body slosh by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well at 321 pounds and 1.45 meters, you might have to consider a little exercise, Claire. You're getting pretty heavy for a girl your age.\" she thumbed through the charts after catching the dissatisfied look on her spoiled patient's face, \"B-But with only a gain of fifty pounds since last year, I have to say that you must keep off the winter weight better than any of your classmates!\" she feigned mockery. She lied, of course. \"Did I mention,\" Claire said slyly, \"That my mother, Principal Masters, is quite the heavy woman herself? Maybe I should be judged on a curb due to genetics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, w-why no you didn't!\" the doctor said frantically as she tried to cover up her social boo-boo, \"Wh-Why if thats the case than you're the epitome of health, young lady, surely your mother does a great job of raising you nutritiously and generously- tell her I said that- here, have a cookie!\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Kate... Miss Granden...\" the doctor said flatly as she failed to wrap her longest piece of pre-measured twine around the heavyset brunette, \"I'm just going to go with \"diet is prescribed\" and move on, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely naked from bottom-up and with a huge rip across her bum, it was a miracle such a short, wide girl was still functional. She was incredibly large. But most importantly, she had enormous knockers. They limited her vision and got in her field of mobility. Entering her little check-up area alone, Clumsy Kate accidently knocked over everything on the counter! Of course, standing at only 5\"1 would do that to a girl who weighed nearly three hundred pounds. Her BMI? 53.1, way beyond obese. It was almost kind of funny to watch her waddle around nervously. However, it was <i>not</i> funny to have groped such a fat girl only to find that her enormous breasts where too big to be measured by her tools at hand. Still, nice rack, even the cynical doctor had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was horrified and humiliated. She was just so scared, she really just wanted to go back to her dorm and lock herself up and hide. But of course, that wasn't happening. So she just shrivelled up into the warm embrace of her own flab and meekly peeped every now and then as she shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah... you're pretty fat.\" the doctor said confidently after seeing the special note made by the previous doctor noting that she did <i>not</i> come form a wealthy family. \"So, go for a few jogs and eat a little less, you might just come out of your shell and surprise everyone.\"</span></div></div>",

With your round stomach now flopping over the top of your waistband you felt a little awkward, and you were positively sure you\u2019d put on more than just a few pounds since you were last weighed. You were a bit embarrassed, standing nearly naked in front of large Ms. Young, and her poking and measuring didn\u2019t ease the awkwardness. In fact her stomach had frequently bumped into you while she was measuring, and once or twice her breasts had thumped into you accidentally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed you've been getting a little<i> rounder</i> Mr. Dalton?\u201d Ms. Young notes as she brings the measuring tape across your new begging of a pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, and at 187lbs you\u2019ve put on some pounds too\u2026.<b>35</b>\u2026. to be exact.\" She records on her paper, sounding more delighted than appalled.  Noticing you turning red she adds, \u201cOh you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about; in fact I think you look quite handsome.  And from the way I\u2019ve seen you running from your *big fans* your still quite healthy.\u201d Smiling warmly she hands you your clothes. \u201cSo let\u2019s just blame your gains on muscle weighing more than fat, and not Bunnies cooking. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right!\u201d  You shout, sliding back into your semi-tight uniform.  Exiting as discreetly as you could, you began to sneak towards where Rebecca, Kate, and Claire were waiting. You see Delphine and Suzuka strolling by and chatting with each other, both equally happy with their weigh-in results despite their size differences and make your move. Using their bulk for cover you trod behind them and sneak towards a pair of large curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Ms. Walker you seem to be quite healthy\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops one that was currently in use, AND BY CHRIS WALKER OF ALL PEOPLE. Oh man if she caught you here\u2026she\u2019d\u2026 she\u2019d\u2026 probably think you were trying to sneak a peek, and then, then probably punch you hard enough to break your nose. Why did this keep happening! Before panicking further Chris shouts drown out your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? <b>HEALTHY!</b> DON\u2019T THINK I CAN\u2019T TELL WHAT THAT MEANS!\u201d you hear the angry voice that belonged to the blue haired bottom heavy swim star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. What I meant was that-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU THINK YOU CAN JUST LUMP ME IN WITH THE REST OF THE CATTLE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not at All!\u201d said the nurse speaking as quickly as she could in order to calm Chris down. \u201cIn fact there are plenty of successful swim stars who have a body\u2026<i>like yours</i>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S IT!\u201d Chris said finished with re-dressing herself. \u201cI\u2019M OUT OF HERE! AND YOU BETTER GET THAT SCALE FIXED TOO! THERE\u2019S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY I WEIGH THAT MUCH! THE NERVE!\u201d  Chris angrily stomped out from the curtains and past you. She was in such a huff she didn\u2019t even notice you, or her sweat pants as they snagged on the edge of the curtain. You decide you'd better get that for her before she rips her pants completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to get the caught thread and watch as it begins to slowly unravel its parent pair of pants. Tracing the thread to the pants you watch helplessly as the small tear moves up and up until her booty hugging sweat pants had become a pair of revealing short shorts. Chris was clearly oblivious and had yet to realize what was going on, that was until a chorus of laughs erupted around the gym. Turning around she follows the thread to your guilty hand and you can only simply stand there shocked, mouth agate.  Rather than pound you now she simply glares nastily at you, her full cheeks red with embarrassment. She points a single condemning stubby finger at you and pounds a fist into her hand, silently saying \u201cYour dead meat\u2026\u201d before leaving the gym mortified.  You feel an evil shiver up your spine as she walks away and your rub your left arm in anticipation of the bruise yet to come.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you rejoin your trio of friends, noting each of them was wearing a different look on their face from the weigh-in results.

Rebecca shot her a mean look but Claire was unfazed.  \u201cWell<i> some</i> of us take pride in our good health.\u201d She said snobbishly. \u201cI\u2019ll have you known that my nurse informed me that for a girl of my height and<i> refined </i>upbringing I\u2019m 100% perfect!\u201d She added with a smile, sending an earthquake of dimples to ripple across her chubby face. \u201cHow about you Kate?

Lose some weight, <i>please!</i> That nurse would know a thing about healthy if she-\u201d Rebeca continued clearly fired up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Becca-\u201c Kate began trying speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you think we should do?\u201d Claire asked actually sharing a moment with Rebeca. \u201cMaybe I could get my mom to fire her!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Claire really it\u2019s-\u201c Kate again tried to make herself heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trios continue to squabble when you see Kat strolling by smiling happily and your mood brightens. Her weird buttons and exotic attire shimmer and crackle as one of the few still skinny students of the academy heads toward your group. \u201cHello again CJ\u2026\u201dshe says with a flick of her dark and pink striped hair. \u201cGirls\u201d she says with a nod three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cat\u201d Rebecca said calming down a bit. \u201cUm, how did things go for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fine\u2026\u201d she says twisting a strand of pink highlighted  hair in her finger. \u201cThe nurse says I\u2019m pretty good for a girl my size even though I put on twenty whole pounds since I got here. I guess that\u2019s what I get for working on designs rather than going to gym. She <i>did </i> tell me to watch my diet and do some exercising though.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Rebecca said cooking up an idea to invigorate her best gal pal. \u201cWell Kate here was telling us how her inspector said she needs to lose some weight, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell duh!\u201d Kat began, but caught herself in the reflection from Rebecca\u2019s nasty glare. \u201cDuh-there\u2019s no way she does! Are you <i> kidding </i> me? She must have been crazy, quite unprofessional. Listen Kate,\" she now said placing a hand on one of the Kate\u2019s meaty shoulders, \u201cI would<i> love</i> to have curves like yours!\u201d This wasn\u2019t too far from the truth as Kat really <i>would </i> have loved to carry some of the curves the voluptuous Kate was carrying. Just some, not all. \u201cIt\u2019s like they say in the fashion design industry. Some girls are a size three and some are a size thirteen, they make a dress looks good either way.\u201d  And at the saying the girls all nodded in agreement, all except Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s finally settled, did you get your checkup C.J.?\u201d Kat asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,Yeah! Ms. Young took them right over there.\u201d You say pointing to Ms. Young\u2019s private booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! Your measurements will finally be mine!\u201d she says gleefully heading in that direction and quite happy to get her nimble fingers on your measurments magic numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Kate?\u201d Rebecca said not missing a beat. \u201cWe\u2019re all growing girls, and you\u2019re still blossoming into a fine-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeca!\u201d Kate said now uncharacteristically shouting in order to be heard. \u201cI was thinking maybe I <i>should</i> try to slim down. I kind of have been knocking a few things over accidentally, and the nurse did say that it might help with coming out of my shell\u2026\u201d Kate explained reverting back into her oh-so-shy fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rebbecca said flatly. Rebecca recalled how Kate had often talked of slimming down before\u2026only to gain more weight. Plus too much exercise would disagree with Rebecca\u2019s secret quest of bulking up for you. \u201cWell Kate, I would love to maybe jog with you sometime, but with school and all well, you know, maybe Claire would be better partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Please</i>, exercise is for those not blessed with noble bodies such as mine.\u201d Claire commented haughtily, causing Rebecca to roll her eyes. \u201cBut if you feel like it, I suppose I could ask my mom to keep the gym open after school when the sumo club isn\u2019t using it.  All though if I<i> do</i> ask my mom, it might cost you something C.J.; maybe a kiss on the cheek or two?\u201d  She offered with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...what about you C.J?\u201d Kate asked suddenly turning to you and flinging you head first into the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re fast enough to dodge your fan club\u2026most of the time. Would you want to be my workout buddy?\u201d  She asks you sweetly. Kate was one of your longtime friends and had always been very nice to you. You try to remember the last time you\u2019d actually seen Kate in her gym uniform and faintly recall it looking rater tight, and that was a few months ago.  Watching Kate (and possibly Rebecca) exercise in tight clothes or running a few laps behind them might be quite an interesting sight. Kate did sound set on trying to slim down, and the idea of seeing them sweating and bouncing and wobbling the whole time took the idea from good to great one. But on the other hand you weren\u2019t really one to exercise when you didn\u2019t have too, and you\u2019ve always felt Kate looked fine no matter what \u201csize\u201d she was\u2026Maybe you could change the topic?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What exactly was a boy to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kate had known each other for more than half of your respective lives; if there was anybody that either of you could be completely honest with, it was between your three-way friendship with Becca. And, honestly, while Kate had never been exactly a skinny girl you felt that her weight had been hindering her slightly. Not that there was anything wrong with a little bit of extra weight, but poor Kate was to the point where she was finding it hard to find clothing... mostly bras. The teachers were really hard on her about indecency, obviously not taking into account her naturally introverted nature, and the more green faculty members sometimes even threatening a trip to the Headmistress' office in regards to her uncontainable breasts that bulged up and out of almost everything the poor girl tried to wear. Again, while it was really sort of hard to picture a trim fit Kate, it was a lot easier to picture the one who could at least fit into normal (well, junior miss plus) sizes. The one that walked through the doors of Chubbeso Academy on her first day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you <b>knew</b> Kate Granden; and she was not one for dedication in the physical sense. Ever since junior high, when things started to get a little tough on Kate because of her reserved nature and expanding figure, Kate had occasionally experienced spells quite similar to this one: expressing an interest in dieting or exercise only to fall short of any execution. There were some times when she would put so much time and effort into researching an effective workout regimen that she forgot to exercise at all! <b>That</b> was Kate Granden; studious, forgetful, but passionate and kinda cute. However no matter how off the handle she usually got with her ambitions, you and Rebbecca were always there to help her no matter the costs. So why should this time be any different? She needed support because, even if she didn't manage to slim down at all, it was more important that she know that you were behind her all the way. At the very worst, keeping the gym open for you could help trim off those extra thirty-five pounds or so you'd gained since enrolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll go talk to Claire's Mom about keeping the gym open for the both of us.\" you say kindly, attention turned fully to Kate who, now beaming, could only stammer red-faced and dumbly. \"Th-That's great!\" she stuttered, \"Thank you so much CJ!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped you into a deep hug, the lower portion of your torso being immediately enveloped in the soft breasts of Kate Granden. To emphasize a bit on their size, you could clearly feel them brushing against your slight muffin top and then some. Another couple stone or so on Kate's already overstacked frame and they could be pressed together with you inbetween them. \"Hey, no problem.\" You pat her on the back of the head for support as her grip tightens around you, \"I better go talk to her now while Physical Exams are still going.\" You say as you pry yourself away from Kate's embrace and Claire's notorious green eyes of envy. \"Later guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the remaining members of your social circle, there was a myriad of mixed responses. Kate, obviously, was simply ecstatic. Out of the three of them, she had never scored any face time with you since enrollment, being overshadowed by Rebbecca's superior physical prowess and Claire's suffocating affections. For her, a girl with a normal amount of attraction for a normal guy, this was a great chance to start looking better and start working her way back into your life. Rebbecca had a sort of mixed feeling about the arrangement. For starters, she was not one to enjoy change in schedule, scenery, or her friends. She loved both you and Kate to absolute death, but since her inkling on your preferences were just that -an inkling- and her significantly hedonistic habits developed since forming that suspicion, she was extremely wary about being wrong and becoming the \"fat girl\" of your group. Losing you to Kate was simply something that Big Becca couldn't handle. On the other hand, she was genuinely happy to help her friend in any way possible since she was so unhappy with her physical appearance. And if Kate was thinner, she might be able to branch out and be more social. That'd be great, considering that she had always been such a wallflower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, a total obesophile, was absolutely appalled that her darling CJ had been conned into losing that precious ring of blubber that hung so precariously over your belt line. She had spent all of last semester trying to spoil you fat, and that bespectacled poser wasn't going to dare undo all that work. However, under the assumption that Becca's assumption of your sexual preferences was correct, then she was in the lead by a good fifty pounds ahead of Kate. All she would have to do is go through the opposite direction that Kate was. This noble body shape wasn't for everybody, Claire was more than understanding of that... however some people were more deserving than others...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThe Headmistress' office was more than a long walk away, especially considering that you weren't very much used to long walks these days. However it gave you time to think, something you didn't get to do very often in this crazy hamster wheel of an academy. Out of the gymnasium, which opened into the western courtyard, there was a large span of flat land where you were told that the team belonging to the school that stood before Chubbeso would play soccer and football. Now, in the ten years since its buyout, it had been polluted with the laziest, chubbiest of girls who seemed to treat it like a trash dump for old discarded treat wrappers. Of course there was always a team to come by and run maintenance so as to keep the campus looking beautiful, but the time inbetween said cleanups was simply atrocious. They lazed about, resting on their fat bums and patting their full bellies while they helped themselves to the many snack vendors that sat adjacent to the stone walls. They hung out in cliques, just like normal girls, friends with friends and whatnot, but each one was simply an overstuffed parody of what you had expected. And, no matter the social standing, all were simply lazy and slothful creatures that littered the beautiful fields. Actually kind of sad, really. At one time, these girls could have been (some were, during your time, as you had enrolled with or observed at least a few of them at one point) so much more outgoing instead of the complacent layabouts that sat in the grass... They looked to be having the time of their lives though, so why bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop at the halfway building between the Eastern and Western Courtyards, which contained (big surprise) a surplus of snack machines a row of water fountains, and a ladies restroom, and going through you found that it was almost a mirror image of the courtyard before. In fact, so was most of the campus. Now that classes weren't in session, any girl who had finished early was left to her individual whims which- except of course that said girl had somehow kept a strong head for fitness through the overwhelming first semester- usually had some sort of layabout activity entitled to it. Even the Headmistress' office, surrounded by individually shared offices that accommodated two educators at a time, was subject to the same laziness and sloth that its students were. Not disgusting, just disappointing. And, with a little hesitation on your part, you knocked on the door; knowing that while the same spirit was practically embodied by Ms. Masters, your arrival would at least put some spirit into her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no booming footsteps lumbering to the door as experience had taught you to expect. Only light tip-taps of sophisticated heels. Granted, Ms. Masters wore only the finest of footwear amongst everything else, but it was more of a clapping when the overstuffed principal decided to wear them instead of her usual flats. Much to your surprise and excitement, it was not in fact Jessica Masters coming to the door! If experience had taught you anything else since enrolling into Chubbeso Academy besides \"don't eat the mysteriously placed cake on the ground\" and \"there's a good chance that I'm probably going to suffocate soon\" it was when to recognize your favorite member of the faculty: Bunny Blake. Her silhouette made her appearance known not because of the messy-cutesy way she wore her hair, or because of her rare(around here) thin waist. No, you were not-so-sorry to say that the reason you knew it was her was because of her giant gazongas. Her breasts were absolutely ginormous. Not that you were complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ!\" she answered as she swiftly opened the door, \"What's up Kid?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunnie!\" you mimic her enthusiasm, giving her a quick knuckle bump as a customary greeting, \"I just wanted to talk to Ms. Masters about something, is she in right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie hesitated for a second with a troubled look on her face before responding, \"Gimme a sec?\" and turning her head back into the office. \"Ms. Masters? Someone's at the door for you, are you in?\" The sound of mastication was audible from behind Bunnie, with a little grunting and moaning indicating some hurried eating, \"I'm in a meeting!\" she shouted back. \"She's in a meeting.\" Bunnie parroted woefully, \"But its alright CJ, I'll tell her you stopped by and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ Dalton?!\" she said excitedly from behind, \"Gimme a second, let me make myself presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie smiled and stepped aside, \"She'll be right with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you step into the office only to find it a complete mess. The place was covered in dishes and utensils, the aroma not unlike that of the cafeteria. Seated in front of the desk, rubbing an absolutely engorged gut of epic proportions (but hey, that was normal) was Ms Jen Telleri, the Culinary Arts teacher. Short brown hair curled against a wide dinner-plate face, several chins bunching together as she giggled. She took up the entire bench that sat in front of the Headmistress' desk! And, of course, her heavyweight superior was no better. They were giddy like a bunch of overfed schoolgirls at your arrival! \"Oh, Mr. Dalton.\" Ms. Masters said in a sultrily playful voice, \"I wasn't expecting you to drop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sight of two beautiful women enjoying eachother's company get you a little excited?\" Ms. Telleri joined in the game<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two Cougars knock it off?\" Bunnie said protectively, placing her hands on your shoulders and bringing you close into her chest, \"Sorry CJ, these two get a little raunchy when they're together. I was only supposed to be feeding Ms. Masters, but then Jen decided to do one of her famous pop-ins and I went a little overboard. This place is such a wreck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its cool, actually I need to talk to Ms. Masters about something...</span></div></div>",

Now that you looked at it the pie looked fantastic. You loved Bunnie\u2019s apple pie with its thick and wonderfully warm fresh apple filling and its sugar sweet topping, and the crust <b>OH THAT CRUST</b>. Not a single student (yourself included) felt ashamed when they went up for thirds or fourths of that pie, especially with a crust like that. The urge to sneak a slice was tempting but with Kate depending on you, the choice was already made. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d You say regretfully. \u201cMore for us then!\u201d Ms. Masters jovial announces placing half of what was like a \u201csliver\u201d of pie and more like a slab on both plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow *munch munch munch* what would our most manly student here at Chubbeso want to talk about?\u201d she asks between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the weigh in was today and Kate, one of my friends, was kind of unhappy with her results.\u201d You explain as you watch the both of them dig away at what had to be a pound of pie on each of their plates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>What</b>!\u201d Ms. Masters shouts looking like she was about to choke. \u201cImpossible! I paid them all to-\u201c she caught herself and set her fork down on her plate. \u201cI mean that\u2019s a terrible terrible thing to hear.\u201d She says sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, she was wondering if I could maybe help her slim down in the gym after school, but the thing is it\u2019s usually locked most of the time.\u201d You explain.<br>\r\nMs. Masters nods sympathetically bouncing her chins like a basketball. \u201cSure I don\u2019t see the harm in it. Although I think if any student wants to adjust her figure and do some training then why not?\u201d She slowly sticks a thick arm underneath her desk and retrieves a golden key. \u201cHere\u201d she says as she offers you the small key on her large hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mss. Masters!\u201d You say politely as she entrusts you with the key. \u201cSee you around Ms.Telleri.\u201d  You say as you head out. \u201cBye Bunnie\u201d Ms. Blake gives you a quick wave \u201cRemember not to train too hard!\u201d Bunnie adds with a wink. As you leave the office you glance at the golden gym key shiny from its under use. <br>\r\nYou were excited that things had gone so smoothly and at the idea of getting another smushy hug from Kate. In no time at all your back in the gym and quietly reunite with Kate and Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? How'd it go?\u201d Kate asks quickly swarming over to you, her hands gripped together in anticipation only exaggerating her pronounced bust line.  Smiling a valiant grin you take the key out from your pocket \u201cShe said it be fine after school. In fact if you want we could even start  tod-<b>oof</b>!\u201d You\u2019re caught off guard as Kate hits you with another hip smothering hug.  You almost drop the key in question as she wraps you up in a tight but soft and fleshy squeeze. \u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Thankyouthankyouthakyou!</font>\u201d she says rapidly, and then realizing how she was crushing her \u201ccrush\u201d she stopped the hugging and wobbles back a few steps. \u201cUm\u2026sorry about that,\u201d she says looking quite red. \u201cI\u2019d better get ready\u201d and with that she went waddling off. You see Rebbecca looks quite shocked at the excitement Kate has for once again trying to slim her figure. You also notice that you\u2019re minus two girls rather than just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey where did Claire go?\u201d you ask knowing you couldn\u2019t possibly overlooked anyone with the body like the princesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since there are no classes for today she decided to head home. <u>Thank goodness</u>.\u201d Rebecca adds. \u201cAlthough I did hear her muttering something about \u201cfixing a surprise\u201d for you so stay on our toes.\u201d She adds with a laugh. Then she suddenly looks around her as if she didn\u2019t want anyone to hear what she was going to say next. Then taking a step closer she asks \u201cListen C.J. I really appreciate what you\u2019re doing for Kate I mean she\u2019s getting all worked up about working out\u2026again. But, do you think I should, go too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course! Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d  You say immediately, not catching one the tom girls drift.  She looks almost insulted by your response, maybe she was asking <u>Do I have to go?</u> \u201cOh-uh I mean I guess if you had something else to do Becca, I\u2019m sure Kate wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d She shakes her head and rolls her eyes, silently informing you that you still missed the point.  \u201cDo you think\u2026\u201d she held her breath before continuing \u201cI look\u2026okay? Or maybe I should try to slim down with Kate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh-<i>Ohhh</i>!\u201d you say now understanding the odd question. \u201cNo way! I think you look awesome!\u201d you quickly and honestly compliment her, not realizing the true weight of your praise. \u201cI mean you were one of the best softball players in middle schools even!\u201d Rebbeca\u2019s eyes widened and gleamed like a pieces of hard candy. She looked happy-no-relived by your answer. \u201cOh um, good!\u201d she said reverting back to her usual nature. \u201cBecause I was, umm, going to do some of Mrs. Kawasaki\u2019s math homework.\u201d It was sort of odd but she was practically humming the fact she had school work to do. \u201cBut, I\u2019ll stop by later and see how you and Kate are doing. Cya\u2019 CJ!\u201d And with that she left the gym, unbeknownst to you she was off to do more snack munching rather than number crunching.Now alone, you felt quite defenseless surrounded by all dem fat girls and so you too scurried back to your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour or so of channel surfing, internet browsing, and homework neglect, you get a text from Kate telling you that the gym was cleared out and locked up. She had everything ready if you wanted to work out now. So jumping into a t-shirt and a pair of shorts, both of which were a little tight but thankfully button free, you make your way through the air conditioned halls back to the gym where Kate awaits looking labored already from lugging her backpack around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kate. What\u2019s with the bag?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did some research and brought some stuff we might need with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201dshe slides the heavy pack down to the floor and unzips it. \u201cI\u2019ve got water, a stopwatch, my laptop in case we need to look up some exercises my mp3 for jogging music-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d you say. Kate was obviously going to really try and make an effort today.  As you slide the key in and re-open the gym doors Kate sets down her backpack again inside. \u201cSo\u2026*<b>huff</b>* start with a jog?\u201d she asks already sounding a little winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell how do things go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach fat crumpled together as she began to crunch, her wide gelatinous end rose and trembled into the air prominently as she shifted her weight forward, her bulbous bosom and noticeably not concealed within a sports bra as well as her round dome of a stomach, drooped downwards as Kate stretched her hands lower and lower until\u2026\u201cOne-<b>oof</b>\u201d Kate said falling flat onto her well-padded front.

Running was something you knew you were good at, and hopefully jogging would be a good start for Kate.  Deciding to not try and run all out for speed you start slow and try to go for endurance. Letting Kate start in front of you, you \u201cslow your roll\u201d and meet Kate\u2019s steady pace. Wobbling in her lane just slightly, you notice she has her eyes straight forward and focused listening to her mp3. Inaudible to her you hear a heavy smacking noise every few steps and look about you for the culprit of the sound. *<b>Smack Smack Smack</b>* You check her shoes thinking maybe they were making a heavy smack every time they made contact with the rubber tracks floor. *<b>smack</b> huff <b>smack </b> huff* Now Kate\u2019s puffing breaths joined in rhythmically with the strange smacks. Looking upwards you see it wasn\u2019t her feet but another part of her body, her two biggest parts. Hypnotically her chest was flopping wildly as she jogged in rhythm, her stomach joining in every now and then for a few jolly bounces. Up and down smack *<b>smack </b> huff <b>smack </b>huff* Now her already strained shirt grew tighter with every lap and the sweat that came with it clinging against mounds of belly and chest fat.  After about 15 laps or so Kate\u2019s wheezing but determined to finish one more, after which she slows down into a nice slow walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2026\u201d she says removing her headphones. \u201c*huff*\u2026that wasn\u2019t so\u2026bad\u2026I feel better already!\u201d She says taking a seat on the schools x-tra wide bleachers. You join her and rest your legs, realizing that even if that wasn\u2019t the farthest or fastest you\u2019ve ever run it was still quite an accomplishment for Kate. Taking a bottle of water from her bag, and handing you another, you both greedily gulp the water down. An act that seriously upsets your stomachs\u2026Your stomach gurgles and you remember how you\u2019ve missed lunch, and passed on a piece of delicious apple pie.

Odd, considering that the plump princess of Chubbeso hardly ever set foot within anything resembling an exercise facility. Seriously, like ever. Aside from the annual check-up days, Claire absolutely despised the very idea of a gymnasium or exercise in general. She had even decided to put off her mandatory Physical Education credit until her senior year so as to stay as ripe and plump as possible! Now what could she be doing there, standing outside the very double-doors of her antithesis, with the biggest smile on her face for? Well, Rebbecca <i>did</i> say that she had a surprise waiting for you, perhaps she was going to deliver it while you and Kate were working out? Of course, Rebbecca also said that he should probably watch your back. But what were you to do? Claire was right there; waving her hand eagerly and smiling at you though the window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, hey Claire!\" you stutter, opening the door to face your chubby would-be girlfriend like a man. \"Oh CJ!\" she wailed, grabbing ahold of you like the last slice of pie in the cafeteria, \"I hope you're not overexerted, did that Kate girl make you work too hard?\" Unfortunately, similar to her grip on said last slice of pie, Claire practically came with Kung-fu grip action when it came to hugs. That bulbous shape of hers and general avoidance of basic physical exertion hid a secret vice that seemed to only clamp around your waist. \"Nah, I'm fine.\" You choke through labored breathing, the plump arms of your number one fan cutting off circulation to your diaphragm. \"I knew you would be, but still, I don't like to see you working so hard.\" she said in an overfamiliar tone of voice. She released you, struggled to tilt her circular shape over slightly to grab the monogrammed tote bag sitting next to her. Once she had it firmly in her perfectly manicured hands, Claire immediately rushed past you and into the gym; namely towards the still recuperating Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Katie Kate!\" Claire said in that same friendly manner. Odd, not only had Claire never set foot in the gym while being used for its intended purpose, but she had also never called anyone by anything other than their name or an insulting adjective that described them. For the first half of last semester, Kate Granden was \"glasses\" or \"four-eyes\" if she wasn't just \"hey you, get out of my way.\" But now she was Katie-Kate? What exactly did Claire Masters have up those stuffed sleeves of hers besides her flabby arms? Without giving the poor girl enough time to respond, Claire immediately plopped her plump buns down next to the sweaty heiffer. Between the two of them, despite an almost fifty pound weight difference, it seemed that Kate was actually the larger one. Probably due to standing height, her weight was all scrunched up on a littler body than Claire. Still, it could have also been her hooters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought that you two were working out so hard, I should bring you both a little treat.\" Then, placing the monogrammed purple baggie on top of her neatly straight legs, Claire proceeded to pull out a triad of slender red wrappers. On them, you could make out the name \"X-S MASS\" written out in bold white letters. \"Energy bars?\" Kate said quizzically, having been handed one. She scrutinized the packaging studiously, rotating it with her chubby fingers. \"Only the best kind for my best friends.\" Claire said, almost too chipper, \"Well, they're not the best. The ones from Sweden work way better, but they're really for body builders and stuff. Plus Mom was against buying from Swedish after they delivered the wrong daybed to our mansion... she won't even go to IKEA anymore.\" Of course, Kate didn't really pay attention to the plumper princess' ranting about the Swedish people and their fabulous furnishings. You could clearly see it in her eyes, that Kate was about to devour that protein bar without a moment's hesitation of Claire's real intent. Rather nimbly, her chubby thumb and index finger tore the side of the package wide open to reveal a heart of oats and chocolate chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, wait a second!\" you holler, interrupting both girls. Slowly, you walk over to Claire and her mysterious bag of goodies to get a better look at them. You had a right to be suspicious of course, given Claire's history of dirty dealings in the past. However these actually seemed to be legitimate protein bars meant for the purpose of slimming you down while filling you up nicely! \"Something wrong, CJ?\" Claire asked innocently. You glared slightly, \"Why the sudden interest in helping us get into shape? You've spent the last six months trying to fatten me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have done no such thing!\" Claire said innocently, letting loose a coy smile to let you in on her falsities in a flirtatious manner, \"I happen to like my men with a little bit of bulk on them CJ Dalton, and you trying to slim down with Kate is a great thing, so I figured that I would treat you both to a little muscle-builder!\" she said cutely. Her hands traveled to her own bulbous gut, palming it with both hands and a mournful look in her eye, \"I know that there are some girls out there who don't like being so well taken care of, so well-fed, as myself. Obviously Kate's one of them, so I thought that I would help out a little. These are supposed to be loaded with carbs- and if Kate sticks to her workout then she should start shedding her extra weight and putting on some genuine muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll except for the unanimous rumblings of Kate, Claire's, and even your own stomach. Apparently, all things were forgotten in time as the three of you sat down to enjoy a heaping helping of X-S. The subject of suspicion was dropped entirely, and you and your two porker pals wound up having a great time in the empty gym just to the three of you. Kate still seemed a little winded even after so long had passed after her run, but she was laughing hysterically when Claire pushed you off of the bleachers playfully. Her enormous breasts bounced heartily with every bout of laughter, something you didn't get to see often; Kate laughing so openly instead of just covering her stifled mouth. Claire was actually pretty tolerable towards Kate, all things considered. Sure she was loud and a little obnoxious, but that was pretty much a given with her. And you! You had a wonderful time! You three actually spent more time recuperating on the bleachers than you and Kate did working out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as you escorted Kate back to her apartment, leaving Claire at her doorstep, you didn't quite see the haughty smile behind Claire's chubby cheeks. For while she had genuinely enjoyed her time with the both of you, and told the absolute truth about those bars she had brought you; in that they were really for athletics hoping to slim down and build muscle, she had neglected to tell you one key matter. That one bar was loaded with so many carbs and calories that it would take a professional kickboxer an entire match to burn them off. You and Kate, having just gone through a brisk jog, were nowhere close to kickboxers. And, on top of that, the both of you had eaten at least five. Of course, so had she, but Claire was actually <i>trying</i>  to bulk up, remember? The thought of growing fatter not only excited her in the mental sense, but her obesophilia was a serious contributing factor towards her actions. The thought of <b>you</b> growing fatter alongside her so that the both of you could be thrusted into a coddling hoggish obesity was her absolute dream... give or take Kate. Whatever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost amazing you returned to your apartment after dropping off Kate at her\u2019s. It had been a while since you were tired enough to just fall asleep\u2026 Of course, you still had homework to deal with, so you had to use whatever energy you had left to complete the daunting mental task. And although you didn\u2019t have much of a work out, you still felt rather tired as you brought the pencil over the papers you had to fill your homework on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the point of the matter was, as soon as the final question was answered to the best of your ability, you quickly dragged yourself to your bed and just fell face first into the mattress, not caring that there was still daylight to burn, or for the fact that you hadn\u2019t had dinner (for some reason unbeknownst to you, those bars that Claire gave you were actually quite filling and managed to do a number with your stomach). The moment you hit the mattress, you fell into a deep trance of sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~several hours later\u2026~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Which was interrupted when you realized that the sunlight was gleaming through your windows, making you open your eyes and squint in annoyance. \u201cDamn it\u2026 Mr. Sun, why\u2019d you have to ruin my sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if you were actually fully awake, you would\u2019ve realized that the sun was actually a friendly reminder to you to wake up \u2013 Since according to your clock, you only had twenty five minutes to get to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d You yelped when your groggy eyes finally met with the alarm clock (which didn\u2019t have its alarm set anyway. It was kinda broken due to the fact that you threw it against the wall a few times when you couldn\u2019t find the snooze button) and the amount of time you had to get to class. \u201cOh damn it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, leaping from your bed, you immediately rushed towards the bathroom to get a quick shower in\u2026 And maybe if you were quick you would be able to catch a quick breakfast\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck on the breakfast that morning, heck breakfast was the last thing on your mind (although your stomach did voice its complaints) as you quickly did a mad dash towards the academy, less than fifteen minutes to get to your locker and first class. So, here you were dashing through the streets, aiming to quickly get to class while taking a different route (heck, you didn\u2019t want to be caught by your fan club again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you turned the corner near the final stretch of the school, you saw a familiar slim (compared to the rest of the girls around here) hourglass figured girl with long platinum blonde hair walking only a couple of feet in front of you. Almost immediately you took a deep breath and tried to compose yourself to greet the girl \u2013 \u201cGood morning Delphine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of her name, the girl quickly turned around and your suspicions were immediately answered \u2013 For standing and waiting for you to catch up was the same Japanese/French transfer student known as Delphine Shuzumiya, and as she waved for you to come closer, you couldn\u2019t help but eye her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cute face with those large blue eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locks of long hair that curved around said face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat awesome rack of hers that fought itself for space in her small uniform\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat belly of hers that was pressing against the bottom of her uniform jacket that had a bit of her tummy exposed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer to Delphine, you took a second look at her, and indeed, the usually hourglass figured girl was sporting a noticeable belly on her (although, her hips and bust did a good job covering it up). But you just saw her yesterday during the health examinations talking with Suzu\u2026 Did she have it then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think any further on the subject, you finally reach Delphine and smile brightly at her as she reaches into her bag. \u201cMorning Dlephine, how\u2019s the morning treating you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBon oui, Monsieur Dalton,\u201d Delphine replied as she pulled out a small bar (which was wrapped in an oddly familiar wrapper that you knew that you had seen it before) and tore it open. \u201cIt is a merveilleuse journ\u00e9e! Especially since I get to start it with you by my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but blush when Delphine said that, and you had to admit that getting a compliment by such a girl was rather flattering. While you were enjoying the compliment, Delphine quickly took a bite from the bar she had and you immediately raised an eyebrow. \u201cUh, Delphine? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? This?\u201d Delphine replied after she swallowed the chunk of energy bar she had in her mouth. \u201cMademoiselle Claire came up to me after the medical examination and told me that these bars were perfect for keeping in shape and said that I should help myself. She was so nice that she gave me a box of these and said that she\u2019d be able to keep getting me a fresh supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love these things! They\u2019re so tasty and low in fat, I couldn\u2019t help myself to eat them as snacks when I was working on my homework last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d You said as you rubbed your chin. In all honest, you thought that Delphine didn\u2019t have to do much to keep her dynamite figure\u2026 Of course, that pot belly she was now sporting was evidence to the contrary now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of keeping in shape,\u201d Delphine stated, breaking you from your train of thoughts. \u201cI also heard that you\u2019re now in charge of the gym now-a-days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, word traveled fast, then again, this was high school, that kind of stuff was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering Monsieur Dalton,\u201d Delphine stated with a little twinge of red on her cheeks. \u201cIf I\u2026 And a couple others, if it wouldn\u2019t be an inconvenience you, if we could join you in your little workout session?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to stop and think again. The workout session was between you and Kate, but she didn\u2019t say that she wanted it to just be between you and here, if she had, then she wouldn\u2019t have offered the same to Rebecca. Then again, you didn\u2019t want to be mean to anyone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me talk it over with Kate this morning,\u201d You said, buying yourself some time before you had to give Delphine an answer. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know by lunch\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerci! Merci!\u201d Delphine cheered after she finished that bar she was eating and immediately wrapped her arms around you, allowing her amazing bosom to mash into your body and her small belly squish into yours. After the quick hug, Delphine reached into her bag once again and pulled out two more bars. \u201cMonsieur Dalton, merci. Please, take this as thanks for now and I shall see you in class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding you one of the bars, Delphine quickly trotted ahead while munching on the second one. With a smile you ripped off the wrapper and began to eat your makeshift breakfast while you made your way to class once again.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Shrugging off the lack of attack you headed towards your locker amazed that you might make it to class early for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your locker you\u2019re suddenly hit from behind by what feels like a big squishy wrecking ball. Oh No! The club must have snuck up on you!  What good was all that jogging now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa got you!\u201d came the unmistakable voice of Rebecca. Turning around you see it was Rebecca who had playfully hip pressed you into your own locker, a joking way she\u2019d say hello from time to time. Backing off of you she greets you with her warm smile.  Now standing a bit away from you something seemed different about Becca, almost as if her uniform didn\u2019t fit right. For one thing it seemed stretched across her top, (well stretched further than usual.) You chalk it up as having shrunk in the wash, because Rebecca certainly hadn\u2019t gotten bigger overnight\u2026right?  Although Delphine did have that small paunch this morning too\u2026 You push the thought from your head; it was too early to think about this and it was all probably a result of the previous days weigh-in and work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour actually on time for once!\u201d Rebecca congratulates you.  \u201cDid you have to skip breakfast or what?\u201d  As if it had overheard the question itself your stomach gurgles in reply. Before you can react Rebecca was already on the move. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes\u201d she says with a laugh, and a knowing smile. Unzipping her backpack and she pulls out a familiar looking bar. Handing it to you, you don\u2019t have to re-read the wrapper to know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cX-S Mass?\" You ask, knowing it was indeed the ubiquitous bar. You did have one of those delicious snacks courtesy of Delphine this morning, but you decide on eating it anyways figuring another bar couldn\u2019t hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Rebecca starts, sounding like she was looking for an excuse. \u201cThe princess was giving boxes of them out to everyone as if she owned the company.\u201d  Rebecca then stopped, picked out a bar for herself, (her third of the day,) and began opening the wrapper before continuing. \u201cAnd even though I\u2019m not really trying to lose weight\u2026\u201d she paused again to take a massive bite of the bar before her before continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s just they do taste really good and since she was handing boxes of them out for free, I was all \u201cWhy not?\u201d  You nod in agreement as you finish your own bar which tasted just as crunchy and good as the first one Delphine handed you this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways how did the workout go yesterday?\u201d she asks after swallowing the last of her own calorie laden energy bar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell-\u201c <b>BZZzz</b> The school bell signaling five minutes till class stars cuts you off before you can reply. As you both head to Mrs. Kawasaki class, you quickly explain the events of yesterday afternoon; the short jogging, Claire unexpectedly showed up with the X-S mass bars, and how Delphine\u2019s interested in working out with you and Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d you ask as the both of you enter Mrs. Kawaski\u2019s with a few minutes to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she did make her mom by the company or at least half the stock in it. I know she\u2019s friggen loade-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo I meant about inviting more people.\u201d You say trying to keep Rebecca on track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well I\u2019m not so sure. I would just ask Kate. She won\u2019t mind if you ask her first.\u201d She assures you. And she was right Kate was one of your best friends and wouldn\u2019t mind if you at least asked if Delphinine could join. In class you take your seat between where Kate and Becca sat. The school uniform Kate had on was as ill-fitting as ever, but something about her was different. Sitting there she looked\u2026well...perky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, C.J!\u201d she says in a happy tone.\u201d You excited to work out again today?\u201d  You turn to Rebecca who looks equally flabbergasted at her friend\u2019s new found poise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..yeah Kate \u2026\u201d you begin, \u201cthey don\u2019t call\u2019em sweat pants for nothing\u2026But I wanted to talk to you about that. Delphinine asked if she could come too today, but I thought I might as well ask you first. Would it be O.K. if she came too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Well\u2026umm</font>\u2026\u201d Kate stammers in a whisper instantly turning into her shy self. You could tell she was conflicted with answering. Kate was never really the decider in your group, and was perfectly content to just go with the flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she had to decide, now she had to speak up, and raising her voice so you could just barely here it she said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind you, a roving trio of rather indiscriminate gals trail; all but floating on air as they basked in your confidence and delight. They swooned at the very sight of you, and as news travels fast around Chubbeso, these more docile (and, let's be honest, sane) admirers were more than willing to help you whip yourself into shape and get all smooth and muscly. So much so that they would happily donate their X-S bars in hopes of appeasing your appetite. As you smiled and took their scarlet-wrapped munchies, they all giggled and blushed as young girls tend to do before waving you goodbye in those suddenly adorable British accents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, of course, you were double happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwrapping what must have been your tenth one today, you slowly peel the shiny wrapping paper off the bar like a banana and take small bites. These things were actually pretty good, considering that you must have eaten a box all to yourself and you weren't sick of them yet. All in different flavors too; you'd only had about three that were chocolate so far, but the rest were all really creative like sherbert or yogurt. There was also a pina colata, but that wasn't supposed to be very good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you were on top of the world now that you had your and everyone else's new favorite snack. Granted you were still pretty high up there before you got this... coconut flavored delicacy, but the granola bar really put things on Everest for you. With Kate no doubt waiting for you on the other side of these gym doors, flared up and raring to go on another one of your exercise adventures, you were psyched to finally have a work out buddy. A little shocking that said work out buddy would be Kate, but that's not the point (if anybody, you expected former right-fielder Becca). The point was that you two were going to have an awesome time running today. You had brought your ipod, taking on Kate's example from yesterday, and your personal water bottle just in case. Yep, things were gonna be smooth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou confidently blast the doors open with your newfound energy, beaming the biggest smile that could possibly fit on your face. \"Hey Kate!\" you shout excitedly, \"You ready for another round around the track?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you should have taken a better look to the newest fixture in the room before deciding that today's routine would be enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, plopped on the bleachers like her usual lump-on-a-log self, was Kate looking morose as ever. You couldn't tell why, she didn't look any different from yesterday. Illfitting white shirt that exposed just a hair's bit of blubber around her waist and a pair of overtaxed athletic shorts that all but choked on her generous lower half. She even had her tennis shoes on, tied and ready! But there, in front of the bleachers, was the problem. Or at least it's newest throne. Reinforced steel (painted gold) bent into a double-wide fold out chair with purple heavy duty rubber acting as the seat and back was enough to give it away. The color scheme was one you had grown to fear and fear even more during your time at Chubbeso. And sure enough, without saying a word to Kate, when you gandered at the back of the seat your heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, written in pretty golden cursive, were the words \"Coach Claire Masters\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she possibly have made this so fast?! Suddenly you understood why Kate was so down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, CJ!\" she chirped, emerging from the ladies' restroom, \"Do you like my chair? I thought having me around acting like one of those coach-people would help give you and Katie-Kate some incentive!\" she said perkily, waddling across the gym floor towards the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSans any resemblance of physical fitness at all, she certainly looked the part for playing coach. Dressed in a purple tracksuit that looked soft to the tailored touch, her wide blubbery body no longer jiggled with every movement now that it was confined. Well, not as much anyway. It was more of a solid ripple. Underneath, her black tank top was clearly visible underneath, the hooded jacket was half-unzipped for style apparently, as was a little crown insignia on the corner of her right breast, stretched until it looked somewhat like an upside down jellyfish over Claire's generous upper mounds of flesh. Her pants, purple as well, looked like the drawstrings were about to find some way to pop. You weren't sure how that was even possible, but the poor things were drawn all the way into their holes to accommodate Claire's heavy rear. You wouldn't blame them if they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" she asked promiscuously as she did a clumsy little turn, \"I think Ms. Touya's gym class would have a lot better attendance if she looked this good in sweats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I guess.\" You answer half-heartedly, still getting over the initial depression that came along with Claire forcing herself into yet another one of your hobbies, \"Listen, I know you wanna help, but Kate kinda just wants me and her to work out in-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then no worries!\" Claire said with enthusiasm, reaching into her surprisingly loose pants pocket to pull out a pair of Gucci sunglasses and a whistle. \"I said I'd be your coach, not your workout buddy.\" she said flatly, slipping the sunglasses atop her chubby cheeks, \"I'm not one for physical labor, you cute little naive thing you, I'm here to act as motivation! See my whistle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then blew on said instrument. Loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whistle means business!\" she giggled as she waddled over to the big-boobied brunette sulking on the first bleacher, \"Katie here said that she wanted to get in shape, that's what we're gonna do!\" she giggled once more as she placed a hand on Kate's well-insulated shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, and you knew it was all over here, Claire waddled over to her chair and plopped herself inside it's ostentatious arms. In one giant wobbling sensation, Claire had fastened herself in using only her rolls. Her stomach weighed her down from the front, and her side blubber was caught under the arms. She was stuck fast, and there wasn't a damned thing you could do about it. With a look of pure haughty satisfaction on her face, she smiled one more time before slipping the whistle over her long strawberry blonde locks and giving it another good blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, Mister Dalton and Miss... um... Kate.\" she said playfully, \"You start running and I'll tell you when to stop! And, for every... um... let's say three laps each of you do, you can have an energy bar! Or maybe for every kiss in CJ's case... Oh, CJ, that reminds me, go grab my duffle bag; you can't miss it, it's purple and gold and I think I left it in the restroom. Then start. Actually, get a few out for me; I'm hungry. Then you can start.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good job you two!\" Claire cheered from her seat, rightfully wedged into her throne by her royal posterior's considerable width, \"I want you to do two more... um, times around the track and then you can both take a break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean laps, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, two more laughs and then come and sit down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a longshot to say that Claire had little ability to do much of anything other than boast, brag, or buy things; especially not motivate. Her life of self-centered hedonism that focused solely on food and cute boys encouraged by an equally food addicted boy-crazy narcissist of a mother had left her somewhat lacking in the social department. It wasn't really a riddle to be solved though, plainly obvious to all those who cared to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it was her undeterred attempts in tutoring anyone who she deemed worth the time of day in subjects that she knew almost nothing about that really got on most people's nerves. Yours included. Granted, she was a really sweet (sycophantic) girl who really just wanted everyone to be her friend (prima donna) and who just so happened to get her jollies through overeating and excess flesh around the waist (obesophile). And you just so happened to be the only boy in school, its only natural that she devote an unhealthy amount of attention towards doting over your well being and eating habits, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that would be her justification for any other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour assistance in Kate's exercise regime was a cornerstone in her physical activity, or at least her attitude regarding it. You remembered yesterday fondly; reminiscing about the short bout of running that seemed to go on forever, the quiet simplicity of the gymnasium and the deeply rhythmic thumping as Kate jogged heavily across the track. Sure there was lots of running and Kate's footsteps hadn't gotten any lighter, and while it sure did seem to go on forever the gym certainly wasn't quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Claire in the big echoing room, there was no hope for a peaceful respite from her incessant giggling awkward grunts as she repositioned herself. If it wasn't noises, it was flirtatious remarks to your \"impressive\" stamina (of course that single lap around the track must have seemed impressive to a girl like Claire) or how \"if [you] wanted, you could come back early and sit on her lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yeah, like there's even a lap to sit on.'</i> you snort sharply to yourself as you slow your pace, your gaze traveling clear over to the other side of the gym where poor Kate trod hopelessly forward. Her entire body was visibly aching, with one flabby arm craned to arch her poor overtaxed back as her heavy endowment pranced proudly a foot in front of her. Her short brown hair matted slightly with her increase in perspiration and her chubby red cheeks bouncing with every move. Earlier you heard her say something about her ipod being confiscated by a certain princess claiming that it \"distracted her from her exercise.\" where upon it was promptly shoved within the confines of Claire's overstuffed bra. So obviously things weren't exactly going well for poor 'Katie-Kate'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you were faring all too splendidly yourself. Granted, all those energy bars certainly gave your energy levels a kickstart. But ten of them sloshing in your belly on top of one of Bunny's heavy meals was a little much. It didn't so much speed you up as much as it did slow you down. With a slightly swollen paunch bobbing out in front of you, your own steps were just a little bit more cumbersome than yesterday. And, while you weren't the least bit sore from yesterday's little dip into exercise, it seemed much harder than earlier to complete your lap. However you would certainly pull through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nso long as Kate didn't pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling behind slightly so as to give the bespectacled girl a little boost in confidence, the familiar sounds of yesterday's run get closer and closer. They're slower this time without any rhythm to guide them, but all the same in your experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*smack* *smack* *smack*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's plain white tee, already slightly discolored with sweat around the crevices of her womanly body, did little to withhold the massive blobs of flesh balloons that came so precariously close to knocking her in the mouth as she jogged. With every lackluster pull of the knee, up went her chest. And ever time her chest went up, so did her shirt. Slowly the somewhat tight garment found its way up onto Kate's round belly, resting on a fold until it either fell or she manually tugged it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her breathing came into earshot, \"*smack*...hoof....*smack*...huff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely slower than yesterday. Perhaps it was the lack of a positive beat to motivate her, or perhaps it was simply Claire's presence in your regime (that had certainly demotivated you more than any poster could). But for whatever the reason, Kate looked like she was ready to just fall over and die right then and there. Slowing down even more to let the awkwardly jogging plumper catch up... then slowing down considerably more, you finally met Kate's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh...\" she wheezed, \"Cee...CJ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how you holding up?\" you ask with genuine concern for your desperate friend, \"You don't look so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh I'muh... I'm fine!\" Kate said with a fake smile plastered across her chubby red cheeks, pumping her arms and flaring her hips in exaggeration, \"I've... I've just gotta catch my second wind; you go on and finish so you can sit down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow critically as Kate's gait picks up a bit before falling behind once more. You decide not to go against her wishes, but still keep pretty close to her speed wise. The remaining lap is a relative breeze for you, having grown so used to running from your squad of psychotic admirers in the duration of your enrollment. Kate however seemed to grow slower and slower until her awkward jogging was her usual waddle, her poor back arched so badly she was stuck permanently  gazing at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Come <b>on</b> guys!\" Claire whined from her seat below, unwrapping yet another one of her special bars and stuffing it into her kraut, \"You were both going, like, so fast! And now you're all slow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come up here and try?!\" you bark down to Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh silly CJ, if I did that, what would be your motivation for you to finish?\" she giggled, \"Unless you want to see me all hot and sweaty, this tracksuit clinging to my every womanly curve-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Enough!!\" Kate shouts somewhat uncharacteristically, she's doubled over now and sounds as if she's breathing through a coffee stirrer, \"I-I've had it! I-I can't run anymore!\" her tone lowered, but still quite audible, \"I'm... I'm just gonna sit down for a while so my back will quit hurting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl then retreated down the stairs, waddle made even more awkward by her inability to even remotely tense her spine. Her breasts were stuck far up in the air, so much so that you could only make out her face from the nose up. Probably the reason she fell flat on her bum on one of the stairs. Luckily there was still lots of padding to break her fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate!\" you shout, making haste over to your fallen friend and helping hoist her up, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" she whimpers, tears visible in the corners of her eyes, \"My back really hurts, CJ! A-And ohhh... my feet are killing me, I-I think I need to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, still situated in her own fat, pats the bleachers beside her blubber-enclosed seat, \"There there Kate... sit there.\" she says softly, \"You should really take it easy with this whole... um, \"exercise\" thing. Its a really dangerous process.\" she says with a mouthful of granola and chocolate, \"First you lose weight and get colder easily, and then you don't fill out your bed as well so you get even colder, and then you catch pneumonia- which they won't let you eat ice cream in bed for like tonsils by the way- and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Claire, just get her some water, alright?\" you can't help but cut her off from whatever nonsensical direction she was going with that, \"Do you think you'll be okay? Think you can finish your laps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly!\" Claire chidingly as she reached into her duffel bag and pulled out a Chubbeso-offbrand energy drink and several bars, \"Poor Katie's chest nearly broke her back and you want her to run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she should be fine in a second after she runs and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Here Kate, eat these and you'll feel better.\" Claire said sternly, pushing the food towards Kate, \"I've got more if you get hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

Seeing how Claire looked like she wouldn\u2019t be getting up anytime soon, you hurry across the gym to your bag and hand a bottle of water to Kate. Immediately she drinks wildly from it carelessly letting it soak both her beet red face and the near see-through sweat soaked shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew\u201d she sighs after guzzling the last bit. The harsh redness had left her face and her cheeks returned to their natural fleshy pink hue.  \u201cThanks CJ, I needed that.\u201d  Kate then gave a slight groan as she raised her arms upward stretching her achy back muscles. The unconsciously erogenous act enhanced how tight Kate\u2019s shirt was, and only emphasized the trio of oversized pumpkins that were her bra straining breasts and belt unbuckling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026good.\u201d Came a curt voice just to your right. You blink, realizing you must have been staring as Kate stretched, and glance towards the voice of Claire. \u201cMore for me then\u201d said Claire, using one of her favorite phrases. Claire looked unmoved (literally) by Kate\u2019s accident. Sure Claire was glad that Kate was safe, but Claire knew that accidents like this were one of the <u>MANY </u>risks that came with this loathsome exercise thing in the first place. Unable to decide if she\u2019d rather keep coaching or just go home, she haughtily crossed her arms and frowned at the exhausted exerciser much like a royal Marquis would at a tired peasant (her purple throne and crown insignia  only enhanced this effect.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026one more lap?\u201d Kate asked looking unperturbed and determined to reach her goal of three laps. You nod and help her up from the bleachers slowly.  Back on the track (again literally) Kate looked much better. She still had a slight hitch from her achy back, but her spirit was still there. Soon the final lap was within reach, but of course just as things started looking up\u2026\u201d<b>WHUMP</b>!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate\u2019s foot looked like it had gone down wrong, and you could only watch helplessly as the rest of Kate came down with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOomph\u2026Ow..<i>Owieee</i>!\u201d Kate shouted, not crying like before but clearly still in pain. Gritting her teeth, she sat up gripping her ankle and lower left leg in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate! Kate?\" You say hurrying to her side. \"Did you break something!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d she whimpers as she rocks, \u201cIt\u2019s a cramp\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to panic not knowing how to help in a situation like this (Thanks in no small part to Chubbeso\u2019s lack of a real PE class.) \u201cUh, don\u2019t panic Kate! Should I massage it? Or let\u2019s see, uh, keep it elevated! No wait.. Call Dr. Young!\" You look towards Claire who looks equally frightened and confused in her chair.  Masterfully she reaches for her bag and grabs it without having to give up her comfy throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026.<b>urgh</b>\u2026I think it\u2019s easing up\u2026 I can make it home.\u201d Kate says looking up from the injured muscle.  \u201cBut\u2026\u201d she grunts, turning to you with pained eyes \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna have to help me walk home\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d You agree quickly, wanting to do anything you could to help. Kate drapes a plump arm around your neck and shoulder before trying to stand up. Jerkily using you for support, the two of your half sway half shuffle your way out of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, who had been busy looking for her cell phone buried under a pile of bars and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">weight gain shakes</span> energy drinks lifted her phone from her gym bag in victory. \u201cHa! Got it! Hang on Katey Kate I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d   Claire looked about the empty gym and realized the two of you must have already left. She went to catch up with you except\u2026Except when she went to get up she found she was stuck in her new coaching throne. Her layers of lard had somehow wedged into the plush posh leather of the seat securing her into place. The\" Royal Figure\" Claire so prided herself on had once again slightly inconvenienced her.  \u201cNot a problem\u2026\u201d she said aloud and to no one in particular. Small problems like this (hips brushing against doorways, fridge doors hitting her boobs) came along with such a well figured frame. She\u2019d simply phone for help and be out of this seat in no time. Suddenly, before she could even fat thumb a text, a new set of figures came into the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonjour Claire.\u201d Came the unmistakable soft accented voice of Delphine.  Claire could see that it Delphine wasn\u2019t alone either, Chris Walker and Suzuka Touya also plodded their way into the gym.  Claire was mortified at the thought that they might actually be here to work out too. \u201cNow that CJ and the how-you-say \u201cbashful\u201d Kate have gone, we can exercise now, no?\" Delphine announced confirming Claire\u2019s suspicions.  \u201cOh and what is zis? Claire! You\u2019ve come dressed to be our coach and exercise with us? And more X-S Mass bars too? Se magnifique!\u201d Delhpine added as she closed in on the \u201ctrapped\u201d Claire.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\u201cWait! No!\" Claire tired to explain. \"I\u2019m not here for you! Kate! CJ wait up! Nooo!\u201d she shouted as the group of girls lovingly helped her out of the chair and onto the jogging track for some exercise. It would be a long afternoon for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two of you shambled out of the gym it seemed there was no else around to lend you a hand with the injured Kate. Even worse was the fact that Dr. Young, who would probably knew exactly how to handle injuries like this was all the way in her office at the other side of campus. Fortunately Kate\u2019s dorm room wasn\u2019t too far from the gym, so you decide to just go there. Kate was felling better, and was even able to put some of her tonnage back on the injured leg, but some was not all, and your back ending up taking the brunt of her bulk. With Kate shorter stature practically slumped on your shoulders and most of her expansive rack pressing against you, it felt like you were wearing a heavy plushy jacket, or a cumbersome squishy comforter. In fact, if her weight wasn\u2019t giving your legs the workout of their lives you might have noticed being semi-squished like this actually felt kind of\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry CJ\u2026\u201d Kate suddenly says in a sad and apologetic voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s my own stupid fault you have to carry me fat ass home.\u201d Kate, never one to swear, sounded on the edge of tears again, the sound of it was even harder for your to bare than her weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErugh\u201d you grunt readjusting yourself before talking. \u201cKate, it\u2019s not a big deal and it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it<i> is</i>!\u201d she sobs louder and now definitely crying.  \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t wanted to do that stupid last lap\u2026I\u2026Look at me, I shouldn\u2019t even have been jogging in the first place. I\u2019m a fat stupid loser who can\u2019t even run a few laps without falling down on my face or twisting my back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate!\u201d You say getting pissed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a loser!\u201d You\u2019re just letting the words come out now, not exactly in control of what you were saying.  \u201cI think it\u2019s great you found something you want to do. Just because this time wasn\u2019t that great doesn\u2019t mean you should stop. Even If you fall down and twist your ankle, or get a back spasm the next ten times I\u2019ll be ready to uh, massage it out\u2026or however you treat those things \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she whispered, sniffing back her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! And even if I had to carry you back from the gym every time you\u2019d still be my friend and Becca\u2019s too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate seemed encouraged by your words. \u201cThank you so much CJ\u2026\u201d She said leaning even further onto your shoulder to wipe her tears. She tightened the half arm hug she had on you even tighter and almost tilted you off balance, steadying yourself, you smiled at the tender act. Kate was going to be just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the two of you reached Kate\u2019s dorm room.  Kate headed inside first, her tenderly pained leg only enhancing her usual waddle. Leaving your shoulder she hobbled as gingerly as she could to her couch where she flopped down having finally reaching relief. This sent her whole body a quiver: her sweaty sweater puppies bounced rhythmically, and her stomach shook underneath the restive fabric that was her clingy t-shirt. Her stomach had decided that it was quite happy to rest on top of her thighs bobbing up and down with every pant Kate gave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too decide to take a seat, even though they had been relieved of the weight on your shoulders, your legs still felt like they were on fire. You move your over-worked, but steadily thick legs towards a wide and relaxing chair, realizing how few times you\u2019d been to Kate\u2019s place. (Claire had made sure your dorm room was the biggest around and so it was often the place of choice to hang out.) Kate\u2019s place wasn\u2019t all that different from your own, it was a lot smaller, but it was also far cleaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumped on the couch Kate takes a few more deep breaths before perking up with a thought. \u201cHey CJ since you\u2019re staying here\u2026you know what\u2019d be really good right now would be some nice cold ice-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it! Don\u2019t get up!\u201d you cut her off not wanting Kate to strain her already injury leg. How could have not thought of it. Ice! Putting some ice on her hurt leg would be exactly what it needed.  In fact you could go for a glass of cold water yourself, considering all the \u201cweight lifting\u201d you did today along with your jogging. Walking into the kitchen your grab yourself a cup and pour a big glass of cold water, and then opening the freezer to get some ice you\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d you say aloud.  Kate\u2019s freezer looked more like a miniature ice cream store! It was filled to the brim with what had to be a pint of every flavor of ice cream available.  You and Rebecca had long know of Kate\u2019s not so well hidden passion for ice-cream, (with Kate ordering the hugest split  available whenever the three of you went out)  but you never knew of this secret sweet stockpile Kate had at home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026I was going to say some ice cream would be good right now.\u201d Kate said sheepishly as she read the confused look on your face from the couch and looking a little embarrassed to have a freezer so full of ice cream. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take a pint of rocky road since you\u2019re up. Oh, and feel free to have some yourself\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and gulp down your glass of ice-less water, ice cream did sound really good right now\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to the comfy chair two pints of ice cream and two spoons in hand.  As Kate opens hers she immediately digs in, not getting enough in her mouth fast enough.  As you sample some you agree the ice cream us delicious, but the way Kate was devouring hers, it was like she hadn\u2019t eaten in days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I thought you weren\u2019t hungry\u2026\u201d you say recalling how she turned down Claire\u2019s offer of a X-S Mass bar smorgasbord. This seems enough to draw Kate\u2019s attention away from the mutilated pint of ice-cream in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I kind of was\u2026\u201dshe admits giving you a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026with Claire there I didn\u2019t want to\u2026Claire can be sort of\u2026\u201d her shy nature was showing as she held back from saying what was really on her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnnoying.\u201d You suggest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d She says with a giggle sending her boobies a \u2018bouncing once more.  You were beginning to think that the dairy treat she love so much and her own swelling milk jugs weren\u2019t unrelated. Regardless, they hardly get a chance to rest before she\u2019s back face first into her ice cream. Your eyes widened as you realized Kate was almost done with her entire pint, while you\u2019d barely scraped the top of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her finish you continued making conversation \u201cLook Claire\u2019s just doing the whole \"coach\" thing to get to me. Don\u2019t let her annoy you, she can actually be pretty nice sometimes, I mean she <i>did </i>give everyone those delicious bars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready finished Kate set her empty container aside.   \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claire won\u2019t stop me.\u201d She said giving a flex that was peculiar as there was more flesh under the arm then over the bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..Oh my back!\" She says suddenly arching her spine. \u201cYou know that massage you offered back there does sound really\u2026nice-I mean it would *<b>owie</b>* really help. \" She says getting up. \u201cBut I'm a sweaty mess right now, I\u2019m going to shower up and be right back\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow  Kate had the energy to swing her top-heavy self backward and forward, this sent her bloated belly to jiggle and fold up on itself, hoisting herself up from the confines of the couch. Carefully nursing her left leg she made her way to way must have been her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d you call after her, a little surprised that Kate mentioned or even remembered your offer from a few minutes ago (If you could even call it that. an offer it was more like a speech, but now you were just over thinking things..)</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Curiously you raise an eyebrow as the Kate hobbled rather awkwardly from her couch. A change in course was visible from her initial course towards the bathroom, she turned back and to the left, towards you and the couch. Her face, apparently still colored from lugging her cumbersome body around on a bum ankle, was a deep scarlet that shone brightly against the contrast of her usual somewhat pale self. Her lips twitched into a shaky smile and she waved one chubby hand for your dismissal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, haha...\" she puffed, \"I was... um, just kidding about that whole massage thing; y-you don't have to stay and take care of me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, rather strange behavior. But then again Kate was pretty strange. She probably just wasn't comfortable accepting a massage from you when she was all 'sweaty and gross'. Besides, you gave terrible massages. You could only smile and cock your head to the right playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine fine.\" you jest, \"Should I at least wait on you to get out of the shower... you know, in case you fall or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face seemed to get even redder at your proposition. \"U-Um no, that's not... that's not necessary CJ!\" she said hurriedly, \"I'll... I'll take a hot bath, just so I don't have to stand okay? You go home, I know Ms. Kawasaki assigned us homework... and you're terrible at math.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine I can take a hint.\" you smile before prying yourself from Kate's well-worn couch. In retrospect, the Chubbeso-Brand ice cream was probably not the best idea, especially after such a light workout; it left you feeling a little bloated in your stomach. \"Just call me if you need anything, okay Kate? Don't do anything you think you can't handle.\" you offer politely, \"If you need something from the store, just call me and I'll run and grab it for you. Sound like a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate gazes at you from across the room, sparklies in her eyes and an ecstatic expression on her cherubic face. \"O-Oh CJ, you don't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat.\" you say kindly as you slip your arm into your uniform's jacket, \"Just let me get my eight hours and we'll call it even. Sound like a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a slight pause between you. Kate's mind switches to hi-def slo-mo as her heartbeat jumps rapidly up and down. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">D-D-Deal!</font>\" she manages to squeak before you smile and make your leave from the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"B-Bye... CJ...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you (by which I mean the reader, not CJ) Kate would not be the only one taking a bath tonight. As customary, Rebecca Maglen would end her long hard day of studying with one of her favorite past times- bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when most people think of \"bathing\", what comes to mind is the general understanding of the word: you have hot water, soap, some shampoo, and a back scrubby with a washcloth. And all of these elements were of course present. The tub in her flat, not provided by the Masters Family but kept up at her own family's expense from the States, was not one of grand opulence; most assuredly unlike the one Claire Masters' bathroom held fixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this simple white (mostly <i>plastic</i>, even) tub had been transformed into one of Rebbecca's most personal attachments. Well worn by the soaks lasting an hour-or-two at a time nightly, the valiant bath had grown aged with hard water stains and even a slight ring where the water usually fell. But when she was in it, the tub took on a whole new life. One of candles and salts, a slight bubble mixture and lotion thrown into the mix to give it all that smell of lilac that wafted and gently filled her apartment... it was her heaven; her secret sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never be caught; being so girly as to enjoy a long relaxing soak in the tub for a frivolous amount of time like this. Certainly not with you (CJ this time) anyway. But behind closed doors, Rebecca was a habitual bather- one who could take the most unelegant fixtures and turn them into thorough masterpieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire might have had all the money in the world, but Rebbecca could most assuredly proclaim that she had never so vividly enjoyed a soak like she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it showed. Whenever she emerged from her tub, she was at ease. She changed into whatever pajama pants still fit her round rump and grabbed a simple hoodie (a tee or tank when it was warmer) and plopped down on the couch for her favorite shows. And when she missed them? Let's just say no one wanted her to miss bath time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we gaze downward at Rebbecca Maglen's opulence, sitting stark naked in a tub of her own design. Filled with warm steaming water, which stills until one of her thick legs makes a movement. So small was the tub that lately her whole body seemed to fill it. Well, mostly her backside. While she was running the water, she had to clench her tremendous cheeks so as to avoid an uncomfortable slapping as she dragged them down to the cold porcelain. But regardless, she made it work. Her lovehandles, too, touched the sides of her beloved sanctuary. And while at first its touch was icy and her own withheld, as steam filled the room and water began to drip from the ceiling she managed to loosen up and allow herself, <i>all</i> of herself to come undone and fill the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both hands positioned queenly on the rim, flesh from the arm pooling as it sat in its own mass, Rebbecca took another spoonful of her yogurt and slowly lifted it to and eventually past her lips. This was another perk recently amended to the overall tradition of Bathing; food. Always something just a little sweet for hungry young Becca to snack on, her tastes usually revolved around anything that wouldn't crumble. Chocolate bars, ice cream, yogurt, all of which she had been known to sneak into the tub along with her in rather generous portions. She wasn't above bringing an entire Chips Ahoy! package into the bathroom with her and not leaving the tub until there were little crumbs of cookie floating in the water and down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, her eyes traversed the slight mist that had gathered in her time spent in the bathroom and settled on a particularly round, generous bulge that surged from the water and folded into two neat jelly rolls. It was her belly, growing bigger by the day it seemed sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking to make sure it was empty first, she gently dropped the packet of Yoplait and brought her chubby fingers to her stomach. Soft and delicate, sitting on the ample perch her suffocatingly thick thighs provided, it had always seemed so different than the rest of her body- <i>especially</i> since joining this pampering academy. In her youth (her younger days of youth) Rebbecca had played sports, namely Ladies' Softball. And while she still retained a mean pitching arm to this day, that was all that really remained of Pre-Academy Becca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had certainly always been big, but she had always been rather active too. With no sports teams to feed her need for activity though, Becca couldn't help but feel that she was being spoiled. Her hands had lost callus long ago and whatever muscle she retained was quickly piled over with fat and thensome. With these uncalloused hands, the heavy girl shook her gut, making light ripplings in the water. She regretted letting herself go soft at first, until she gained the sneaky suspicion that you (again, CJ) liked soft. However she still retained a twinge of guilt when she looked at her body. So out of shape. So round. So much like a certain princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid tummy grumbled in a spoiled fashion, knowing that it would get what it so desperately desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrmmm...\" she grunted slightly to herself as she drooped one wet arm over the edge of her white porcelain paradise to grab another sweet; Oreos this time, a gift from Mom no less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation or sincere cognitive thought, Becca slowly peeled back the freshness flap on the bag and grabbed three at a time; popping them into her mouth with expert precision before sinking further into her own juices with a smile of wicked delight on her face; pleased at her own indulgences and more than happy to forget her guilt... even for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would find that, twenty minutes later, her unflexed flaring thighs had made it difficult for her bodacious bod to leave the tub she, ironically, so desperately never wanted to leave. But it would be too late, as she would fall asleep before hand with cookie crumbs and frosting remaining on her plump lips (actually not an uncommon occurrence, especially not lately) and wake up at one with a frightful sneeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would unwedge herself, slip on some pj's and go to bed after one more sinfully delicious cookie...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you overslept and found that once again you were late and, once again you were also forced to rely on your new stockpile of energy bars as a replacement breakfast. Finishing the second bar as you entered Chubbeso\u2019s main hallway, (mmmm blueberry) you were surprised to hear a small buzz as the school wide P.A. system clicked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.J. Dalton, may I see you in my office at once?\u201d Headmistress Masters\u2019 husky voice spills out from the speakers. An echo of giggles from the nearby classrooms surrounds you. Usually when you were called to the headmistress office it meant Claire had cooked up some crazy idea and asked her mom to help see it through. You make your way to Mrs. Masters\u2019 office once again as you count off \u201cthe princesses\u201d previous schemes; there was the time she had the whole school go to the beach for a field trip (which you soon realized was created just for a chance to see you in your swim trunks), or the time where she convinced her mom to cancel school on your birthday (which admittedly was pretty cool except that it meant the entire student body was chasing after you the whole afternoon.) Yep, sometimes you just had to wonder how Mrs. Masters got the job of being a headmistress in the first place. With that in mind you entered her office wondering what sort of craziness you were about to meet today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the headmistress office (which still featured a few crumb laden dishes strew about) you were surprised to see that not only was Mrs. Masters out, but apparently you weren\u2019t  the only one who had been called here. Kate was already sitting in the long cushiony bench like chair that faced the headmistress desk. You sat next to her and realize she was looking rather gloomy.  What could Mrs. Masters want with the both of you? And what could have made the usually cheerful Kate so down in the dumps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kate...what\u2019s up?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey\u2026 it's this\u201d she says, her face perking up as it met with yours, but only for a moment. Her sad eyes look back down to the floor (or at least what would have been the floor had her squishy gut and monster titties not been in the way) following her gaze you see what they were gazing sulkily at. Kate\u2019s injured ankle had been wrapped in a miniature cast, not of thick heavy duty plaster, but with enough gauze to insure the injured appendage would stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was the sound of thunderous footsteps, sending the plates on the desk in front of you a jittering. The office door swings open and filling in the entire doorway is Mrs. Masters.\u201cHello Mr. Dalton.\u201d She begins smiling at you like a piece of chocolate chip cheesecake. \u201cKate and I were just discussing how the whole exercise after school thing was going.\u201d You frown getting a sense you knew exactly where this conversation was headed, regardless of your grimace Mrs. Masters\u2019 gladly carries on. \u201cYou see C.J, Kate came in to see Dr. Young this morning, and Dr. Young informed me that Kate practically limped as she did. Turns out, Kate has a severely sprained ankle. Isn\u2019t that right Ms. Granden?\u201d Put on the spot Kate nods her head looking awful guilty. \u201cSooo\u2026\u201d the heavyset headmistress continues as she takes a seat, leaning backwards in her deluxe reclining lay-z-girl chair, \u201cafter much thinking and discussion with Claire, I\u2019ve come to decide that using the gym unsupervised is much too dangerous.  I\u2019m going to have to ask for that key back please...\u201d Leaning over her desk she extended her hand to you as if across a dinner table for seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the hand for a second or two before answering. \u201cBut\u2026that\u2019s not fair. Just a few days ago you said it was fine. Kate and I were just jogging when she-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInjured her leg?\u201d Mrs. Masters cuts you off. She eases back and her face loses its smile, her voice takes a more sincere protective and motherly tone. \u201cCould you imagine if she broke it? On school property but with no adults around to help her?\u201d She frowns and shakes her head to dismiss the thought, sending her upper half wobbling as she does so. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I care too much about the students of Chubbeso to let something like that happen. So, until I do some further research and hire a professional physical education trainer, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll need that key back, and you and Kate will have to sign\u2026this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides a piece of paper over to you one that is completely covered in small print. You eyes glance over it and you attempt to read a line \u201cDictates that herby litigation from both the undersigned parties will not \u201cmake use\u201d of gym <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(see subsection c, clause b) </font>and...\u201d Your brain, still waking up, can barely make any sense of the legal jargon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Masters apparently senses your confusion and explains \u201cIt\u2019s basically saying you won\u2019t exercise, at least in <i>our gym</i>, until Claire-I mean, <b>I</b> give you my approval. Now please\u2026\u201dshe hands you a pen and looks expectantly at you  then at the paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Kate before signing, but she can only shrug as if to say \u201cWhat choice did we have?\u201d  Sighing at this annoyance you sign the paper and hand the gym key over. Kate follows suit and as soon as she finishes signing her name Mrs. Masters scoops the paper off from the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now\u201d she glances at the slip for a second before tucking the paper away into a desk drawer. \u201cThank you Mrs. Granderson, and thank you C.J for being such a gentleman about this.\u201d She slowly flops forward, up and out of her chair. She plods to the door and holds it open. Taking the hint, the two of you make your way out \u201cI do hope your exercising goes well  Mr. Dalton. Women like a man with a bit of beef to them\u2026\u201d she says laughing gutturally and causing you to blush on your way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed to class Kate explained her morning\u2019s ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..so yeah it\u2019s fine to walk on it.  Dr. Young said I just can\u2019t  put too much strain on it. So I guess that means no more jogging for us for a while huh?\u201d she adds with an uneasy laugh. You also laugh, nervously, and having to force it out. Kate really had her mind set on jogging with you, but now that she had an injured leg, and now that you two were both locked out of the gym, you had no idea what to do next.  \u201cHey don\u2019t look so worried C.J, exercising isn\u2019t the only part of getting in shape right? Eating healthy is just as important. We could always try dieting\u2026\u201d she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, you had been eating a lot more since you got to Chubeso Academy.  But it\u2019s not like you could give up Bunnie Blake\u2019s cooking. The sweet, chef of sweets, was probably humming to herself right now as she was cooking something up, her pink hair and breasts bobbing along all the while. Bunnie had always made the best most delicious food you had ever tasted! You didn\u2019t think you were strong willed enough to pass up on<i> any</i> of <i>her</i> meals! On the other hand if Kate was going to try and skip out you wouldn\u2019t want her to do it by herself either\u2026  Quickly you come up with the perfect excuse. \u201cSure a diet sounds great, but, it\u2019s just...\u201d and here you really tried your best at acting, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt Bunnie\u2019s feelings and not eat her food. She\u2019s always been so nice...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course not\u201d Kate says starting to smile. \u201cBunnie\u2019s cooking is way too good to miss. I\u2019m just thinking maybe passing on seconds and thirds.\u201d You nod, feeling that sounded a lot easier. \u201cAnd hey,\u201d she continues as she pulled a familiar looking shape from her pocket, \u201cthese bars are pretty filling anyways. Maybe we could have one or two before lunch and see if we eat a little less?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan!\u201d you agree heartily. On the inside however, you could only hope you\u2019d be able to resist whatever delicious concoction Bunnie made today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch\u2026</span></div></div>",

Simply passing off the both of your plates to the next willing consumer of her fine cuisine, the Calamity Pink cook searched high and low for a modestly sized ladle to scoop out your servings, having been here so long she almost forgot what one looked like! With a disrupt look on her face, Bunnie could only raise her brow as she plopped the spuds into place. She searched the dish for two steaks of the requested smaller size to match some whole wheat dinner rolls. This had, meaning this quite literally in the entire span of her admittedly short career, never happened before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per her usual, Bunnie invited you over to her personal counter so as not to hold up the lunch lines with your idle conversation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's up with you guys?\" she asked sharply, \"Is everything okay? I mean usually you two come through here and are more than happy to tear my line up, but today you're leaving with 'undersized steaks'? Seriously, what's up with that?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mutual understanding of the situation ran through the both of you, your heads hung low in a shared disappointment in yourselves. Looking at each other mournfully, you could only express with sincerity that there was nothing wrong with either of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're just not very hungry today...\" Kate said sadly as she looked up at the young chef through the sneeze gaurd, \"We're really sorry Ms. Blake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie frowned, \"Don't be sorry...\" she sighed, \"I guess I can't <i>make</i> you guys eat. I mean, it's just... well, I feel like there's something that the both of you aren't telling me.\" she said sadly, \"And I completely get that; but I just want to make sure the both of you are alright. You know how I worry about you guys sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was the Look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike so many test-batches of cookies past, so many deformed muffins ago, the \"funny tasting\" turkey heroes from way back when or one of the many other countless food-related casualties inside your tummy, Bunnie Blake had brought out her Look. That strange look that seemed to be a mix of your typical pleading stare of a hungry puppy and the cornered glance of a scorned lover; you could never tell if Bunnie was aware of this powerful technique or not. You weren't the only one susceptible to its powers, as both Rebbecca and Kate had been subject to it in the past, And now here you and Kate were again, being forced to face the Look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We should really get going.\" you struggle, tugging at Kate's uniform coat to get her attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, B-B-Becca and Claire are p-probably waiting for us outside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie huffed, resting her diamond chin in her palm as she propped her elbow against the countertop. \"Oh alright fine. Go.\" she said scornfully, \"I guess you guys just don't want to talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving herself from the countertop, Bunnie begrudgingly got back to work as she boredly continued to serve the feeding fatties that littered the lunch line. The two of you could only head out the door, a heavy burden weighing on both of your hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you think we hurt her feelings?\" Kate asked meekly, looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we did...\" you could only tell your bespectacled friend the truth, as there was no hiding it from either of you, \"She loves to cook for us. I think we should have at least told her why we're trying to cut back.\" nervously you shuffle towards the usual table you and your round cohorts grazed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate could only plod along sadly, heartache the only thing slowing her down today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They made me run!\" Claire huffed angrilly as she stuffed a spoonful of gravy-laden potato past her plump lips, dabbing at some stray topping dripping from the corner of her mouth, \"<i>Me</i>, Claire Masters, waste <i>my</i> precious energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Rebbecca answered condescendingly as she poked at her own plate absently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Claire continued, heartily taking a big bite of steak from her fork and choking it down before continuing, \"My metabolism is not used to such plethan tasks like jogging! The Masters women are meant to be prized and nurtured... not sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say...\" Kate said meekly, nibbling at her bread<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then, when I fell, that Walker girl had the audacity to suggest that I rise under my own power when <i>she</i> was the reason- well, one of three- that I was forced to 'jog' anyway!\" she growled, stuffing her kraut with one tasty dessert cupcake prematurely, \"Honestly, I never understood this whole fascination with exercise! But I showed them, I talked my Mother into closing down the gym so I could-\" she caught herself, dropping her fork down to her plate, \"D-Did any of you hear that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never liked her either...\" you answer halfheartedly as you poke at your steak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back and forth today was pretty much like this. Since neither you nor Kate felt much like giving imput, and Rebbecca never really paid her much mind anyway, Claire was allowed to run rampant with her own thoughts and feelings about whatever happened to pop into her empty little head. Luckily for her, none of you were quite up to dealing with her today. So her previously incriminating slip of the tongue went unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to her haughty self, Claire lifted another large spoonful of miscellanious foodstuffs to her mouth and wrapped her plump lips around it. The act of swallowing long since invisible underneath Claire's mighty second chin, you could only have guessed (if you'd been paying attention) that she did so quickly enough to warrant an immidiate second bite. And then another. And then a fourth one after. She was glutting herself at a much quicker rate than usual today. Most likely trying to make up for the burnt calories from last night's horrible exertion of brisk jogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she wouldn't be the only one stuffing herself for the simple joy of stuffing herself today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite to her, your longtime friend Rebecca Maglen seemed to have developed a bit of a tapeworm overnight. Or perhaps she had always been eating this much, and it only just now dawned on you due to your eating so scarcely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping nearly up to speed with the abhorred pampered princess of Chubbeso, Rebbecca's appetite was very impressive... if you were into that sort of thing. She managed to scarf down every bite on her plate and go back for seconds easily (so long as you didn't count getting her stomach caught under the table) and resume eating as if the refill never happened. She ate with something much less Gusto and more Moxie, leaning in hungrily as she devoured morsel after morsel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her and Claire, you felt like you were going to crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverly hungry when it wasn't necessary wasn't a feeling you'd ever liked to experience. And since coming to Chubbeso it was apparently a lot easier (not that you'd experienced that feeling much since enrolling.) And watching these two hogs- your best friends eat themselves so sinfully was almost too much to take!</span></div></div>",

You couldn\u2019t stand it, watching your two friends pig out (well pig out was a bad choice of words for it, eating with gusto sounded better,) whatever you called it, watching Rebecca and Claire help themselves to as much dessert as they could eat was getting to be too much for you two to watch. Maybe it was because this was your first day of dieting and your partly empty stomach was making you a little irritable, maybe it was the fact that you were missing out on Chocolate Cake-<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Ala</span>-Blake another one of your favorite desserts that Bunnie made (weren\u2019t they all,) but whatever it was, if you had to watch for another minute, you probably would\u2019ve given in and gotten yourself the largest slice of cake you could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, (<b>mmph</b>) are you guys feeling okay?\u201d Rebecca asked as she bit into the warm and gooey molten chocolate center of her slice. She waved her forkless hand in front of Kate\u2019s entranced staring eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to garner a reaction as Kate spoke up and finally blinked. \u201cNo, I mean yeah.\u201d She huffed obviously frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s just the gym was closed and now\u2026we\u2019re\u2026\u201d she trailed off sounding like she was receding back into her mind, back where she too was having a piece of that yummy cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go back to class.\u201d You say, swiftly getting up from the table. \u201cT-th-That sounds good!\u201d  Kate announced loudly as she got up from the table herself. And without a chance for anyone to question, you both left the cafeteria as quickly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly you both knew you had to get your mind off of food. The bars may have been secretly calorie laden, but they had only faintly done their job of helping you feel full. What was worse is that you had actually run out of the initial crateful that had Claire had supplied you with. You were sure all you would have to do was ask and Claire would be over at your place with plenty more in an instant, but you weren\u2019t really in the mood to talk with Claire right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the smell of warm chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven passes over the two of you. In your rush you\u2019d taken the route past Mrs. Telleri\u2019s cooking class where there was always a teasing aroma of goods baking in the classrooms many ovens. You both hasten your paces and make it back to the empty Ms. Kawasaki\u2019s room. Quickly you dashed to a window, opening it and letting the breeze of fresh air blow in, make the room feel about 20% cooler. You and Kate take a seat on the counter top windowsill, letting your pudgy legs dangle over the wide counters ledge like meat hanging in a deli. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you both silently enjoy the air and sunshine, a gust of wind came in from the window, blowing a few long strands of Kate\u2019s hair over her face, but also bringing with it\u2026the scent of sweet cherries?  Was that perfume Kate was wearing? You hadn\u2019t noticed it until just now, and closing your eyes you took another big whiff of the alluring aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that perfume new?\u201d you ask making small talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Kate says tucking the gusted strands of hair back behind her glasses. You noticed she was turning awfully red considering how cool the room felt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it smells really nice.\u201d  And it really did, but you probably would have enjoyed the smell of garbage right now if it didn\u2019t remind you of how hungry you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate felt this was good of time as any, her heartbeat was going anaerobic. This perfect moment had come suddenly, but she had been ready for it.  She didn't want to be just another friend of yours, that\u2019s why she was going to do it\u2026she was going to finally confess her love! And sure it seemed sudden, but now was her big chance too. It felt like her breasts were about to burst\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026C.J\u2026\u201d she began, looking down at the ground then at you forcing herself to make eye contact. \u201cDo you remember that time in Elementary School where you stopped those bullies from picking on me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you not remember! You had just met Rebecca and Kate earlier that school year. One day at recess two older looking bullies had pushed Kate down off a swing and onto the wood-chip covered ground. You hadn\u2019t heard exactly what they had said, but from across the playground you could tell it wasn\u2019t anything nice. Kate was crying, and they began to pick up dirt and cover her in it. No one else had noticed yet that she was getting picked on and so, inspired by too many Saturday morning cartoon heroes, you started running as fast as you could, running as hard as you could into both of the bullies and knocking them both down with a satisfying tackle. Kate watched amazed for a moment, then took off. The two stronger bullies had given you a few good punches to your ribs, when a still sniveling Kate returned, not alone or with an adult, but with a furious Rebecca Maglen in tow. The bullies never stood a chance, each returning to school the next day with a black eye but neither revealing just exactly how they earned it. Unbeknownst to you, ever since that day Kate had quietly fallen for you, her hero, but she had never worked up the guts to finally say how she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with your mind back in the present you thought about how well Kate had changed since then. She was still the bookish type, and she tended to keep to herself, but recently you felt like you were just meeting a newer side of Kate, one that was just opening up. Outgoing and friendly, always trying to look on the brighter side of things rather than cry over them. Kate looks rather stiff, her milky white complexion turning pinker by the second, making her large and shimmering eyes stand out behind her frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze Kate, I haven\u2019t thought about that in forever\u2026What did you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEEEEEP</b> The school bell rang signifying the end of lunch and breaking this magic moment between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...I was just thinking about it\u2026\u201d she squeaks out before giving a warm smile. It was the first time you\u2019d really seen her smile all day and you returned it. Inwardly Kate gave a short sigh, there was always later she supposed, not today, but when the time was right. For now she could stand being just a close friend with you, but not much longer...\u201cOh, I almost forgot\u2026\u201d she says quickly before she had to head to her next class. \u201cC-could you pick up a few things from the school store for me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re puzzled for a split second at the request before remembering your offer yesterday and of course her injured leg. \u201cSure what do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh, here.\u201d She reaches into her pocket and hands you a neatly folded square of paper. \u201cYou\u2019d really be helping me out, and uh\u2026maybe\u2026 we could\u2026I could...help you study for the math quiz on Friday?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019d be great!\u201d Gentleman that you were, you would have gone shopping for the handicapped Kate either way, but now that she would be helping you study for the nigh impossible math test Friday it was icing on the cake\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thankyou thankyou thank you!\u201d Kate hobbles over and with a force that almost topples you, wraps you into one of her pleasantly plush hug, and the warm feeling of that hug stayed with you for the rest of the school day. </span></div></div>",

Remembering that entering the gym while you and Kate were present would upset the latter, Delphine had taken it upon herself to instruct that the team meet sometime around four thirty in the afternoon; giving you plenty of time to finish up with Kate and giving them plenty of time to change. And after such a fantastic first meet yesterday, the members (well, at least two of them) had high hopes for today... had being the operative word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C'est tellement horrible</i>!\" Delphine exclaimed as she read the notification taped to the door\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Closed until further notice.

That's why I joined the swim team, and why little miss Wonderbra here worked so hard to play with her bamboo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kendo.\" Suzu growled, \"You're very disrespectful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point being, no.\" Chris said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do not worry, Suzumiya-chan.\" Suzu said warmly, \"We can always go back to the dojo and practice swordplay together.

Or, perhaps if that isn't to your liking, we could always float around uselessly in a hole of chlorine water and our own filth like another bottom-heavy algae sucker I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's crossing a line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mes amis</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... <i>mes connaissances proches</i>, please do not fight!\" Delphine wailed, \"I am aware that you two are not on good terms, but could you please at least try to get along? We all decided to work out together because our exercise regimes were lonely, non? <i>S'il vous pla\u00eet</i>, just while we are together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked rather shocked by Delphine's emotional outburst. Suzu's loss for words was strong and Chris' red cheeks poorly disguised her embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" both girls said after some hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon oui!\" Delphine smiled, \"Now, what should we do to fill our usual gap left in our schedule together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would suggest going back to our usual routines.\" Suzu said solemnly, \"It is rather obvious that my relationship with Christina-chan is tensed and it upsets you. And while the lonliness is rather crushing, I suppose that you could alternate between the two of our routines... otherwise I fear that being left to your Cooking Club may\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blow you up like a parade float.\" Chris finished sadistically with a malicious chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Non non non</i>!!\" Delphine said hysterically, \"<i>Je ne vais pas!</i> Suzuka, Chris, you must keep me company and help me keep my waistline trim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu and Chris giggled, making their respectively overstuffed anatomies wobble slightly as they did so. \"Do not worry, Suzumiya-chan.\" the enormous Asian said warmly, \"Christina-chan and I will do our best to keep you nice and... um, how you say, <i>petite</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui.\" Delphine embraced the heavyset girl like an overstuffed teddy bear, \"Thank you both so much for being nice to me... the English girls here can be so mean to me just because I am French.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Chris said impatiently, \"Now let's get down to business.

While it was true that the store did contain rows of student living necessities, a whole aisle for beauty products, and a complete section for the latest books, the Chubbeso school store was primarily used for one thing\u2026 snack food. The store was one big vending machine to students who could splurge to their stomachs content, using the allotted amount of \u2018Chubbeso Bucks\u2019 on their ID card, (your own card had been loaded with plenty of \u2018Chubeso Bucks\u2019 courtesy of the Masters family.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfolding Kate\u2019s note for the first time you begin reading her neatly handwritten list. \u201cOkay let\u2019s see, glasses wipes, and some vitamin water\u2026..Top Tarts? Kringles potato chips? Twonkies?\u201d The fact that these were all name brand snack foods was not lost on you, and your stomach gurgled rather loudly as you read down the list. Kate must have written this shopping list before deciding on the whole dieting thing. Rebecca had mentioned once or twice about Kate\u2019s stress snacking, and when the three of you studied together, you had often seen how Kate could absentmindedly finish a whole bag of chips by using her own patented study and snack system. Neither you nor Rebecca could argue with the results of said strange system either as Kate seemed to have earned an A on just about every test she\u2019d taken with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to struggle down the various aisles lined with snacks and sweets was doing little for your diet. As you added a pack of Top Tarts (cinnamon frosted) to your cart your mouth was actually running a little dry, and by the time you made it up to the yellow cake cr\u00e8me filled delights that were Twonkies you felt yourself beginning to buckle as you craved for maybe just a bite of one. You paused, knowing this was a deciding moment for you, would you end up buying a pack of your own delicious snack cake goodness to munch on, or would you remain chaste in your quest for a slimmer stomach? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the store, surrounded by so much good food, the cosmic power of that possessed all cheaters of diets slowly set into you, you began to barter calories. Well, you reasoned, maybe a little snack after school was fine. Dieting didn\u2019t mean starving yourself, and already today you were feeling like you were more on a guilt trip than on a diet. In fact, you figured that you both deserved a little reward for managing to make it through that strenuous lunch. And since you were here already here, you might as well get some snacks for tomorrow as well, in fact, all week if your were serious about this dieting and skimpier lunch thing. With a crazed look in your eye, and drool forming in your mouth, you through two pack of Twonkies in your basket, and made a dash back to where the Smore's flavored Top Tarts and Gummi Bears were located. Knowing your card had an almost unlimited balance here, you were quite literally a kid in a candy store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne carrying cart of candy and junk food later you were making sure you had got everything on the list before you checked out of the store, and after getting a knowing wink from the student cashier as she saw your snack stockpile for two, you hefted your bag of treasures straight to Kate\u2019s room where\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Red plastic material had never felt so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContents were packed unto the basket; set so tightly within themselves that they resembled a well-played game of Tetris. Chips (crisps, that British girl called them) pushed neatly, though not tightly, into a niche between a package of to-be-devoured muffins and a row consisting of every assorted gummy organism in their respective Kingdoms. Boxes of creamy sponge cakes and miniature frosted chocolate cakes were no feat, until the space left by the latter's more compact size was filled with fried, glazed dunkin' sticks on either side. Delicious, malnutritious Top Tarts (let's just call these knock-offs) sat next to a variety of prepackaged donuts and a sixpack of off-brand cola; all beckoning into your little ears, \"Ceeeee Jaaaay... oh Ceeee Jaaaay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while it was certainly quite a haul, all in all it wasn't quite so heavy in the material sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was heavy was your conscience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of weakness, you had abused your near-unlimited funds for junk food with full intention of cheating on your diet. And what's worse; you were about to bring Kate in on it too. Knowing how badly that she wanted to stick to her new resolution of eating healthier (one that she made with <i>you</i>), you were going to wave all these goodies in her face like a cat and laser pointer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those treats were rather tempting sitting so precariously on those shelves. Claire had let slip many times the secret of the Chubbeso sales plan, in where items of foodstuffs were placed at an angle so that walking down the aisle a certain direction made it seem as if they were staring whatever hapless customer happened to stroll by. And given Chubbeso's \"understanding attitude towards a young <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">girl's</span><b>student's</b> needs\" and the lax attitude that this attitude seemed to adhere to, they weren't likely to complain when some of the girls (or you, apparently) waddled on through with enough empty calories to send them into a deep food-induced coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, up chocolate river without a popsicle stick, you had all but skipped your way back to Kate's place; illprospered haul in hand like some sort of weakwilled Red Riding Hood. Now that you were at Kate's door, you couldn't help but feel waves of anguish pass over you like so many fizzy soft drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to yourself that you just couldn't stand out in front of the door all night, you nervously took a step towards the door and gave a light rapping, only afterwords did you realize that there was a rather familiar sensation of slight trembling behind room 182B...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight mumbling, barely detectable. Probably Kate, who was ever quiet even behind her own closed doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't get up, I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight tremors continued, growing closer  and closer before the door opened to reveal quite the friendly sight; dressed in her usual post-academia slacker chiq was Rebecca Maglen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi CJ!\" she greets you excitedly, \"Kate, it's just CJ, you want me to let him in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Kate's raised voice is barely on par with the norm, \"He's probably here with my groceries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Kate's agreement, Becca smiled warmly and showed you in, closing the door behind you. \"I've just been taking care of Kate's place while she rests her ankle.\" she said warmly, \"There's not much to clean, but her heater works.\" She sped in front of you, giving you a generous glimpse of her heavy bottom. The words \"Chubbeso Academy\" printed around the waistband of her sweatpants were partially obscured by the rolling waves of Becca's mighty meat form, each lovehandle escaping her tank top (so called 'belly shirt')  and covering the better half of the phrase and a large roll of bulging near-butt blubber creeping outside the sweats and leaving you with only the lower half of the school's namesake. \"And besides, someone's gotta make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore thumping from another part of the apartment, much more awkward and off-step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear you, you know!\" came a whimperous whine from Kate's bedroom, \"Leave me alone when I'm not there to defend myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you chuckle before Becca gets a good glance at your package. \"Looks like Kate was a little behind on her shopping, huh?\" Becca chuckled, reaching for the crate carrier, \"I'll help you lay all this out, Kate'll know where it goes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your guilt, your hand jerked the carrier away from Becca's touch, shielding it from her behind your leg. \"O-Oh no problem, Bec. I got this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" she asked, leaning in slightly, getting a better look at your haul, \"Sure looks like a lot to put away by yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence between you seemed to go on forever before she finally let the conversation pass. \"Alright, Big Guy, you can put all these up by yourself. Sheesh.\" she said, \"Bunnie said you were acting weird. You sure you're not sick? Passing up some 'ala Blake isn't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps picked up again, booming closer and closer until Kate's bedroom door opened. Her brown locks coiled tightly together in their damp state as they draped over her shoulders, glasses fogged, and still covered in a thin layer of water. Black fabric clinging tightly to her overfilled mammaries, Kate had squeezed herself into an outfif very much in the same spirit as Rebbecca's, along with a generous wrapping of gauze around her injured ankle. Apparently she had just left the shower... getting used to the colder air of her apartment had some... erm, effects. You know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, fueled by your initial grief at dangling all that good food in front of her, was bound to make things just a little akward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to hide just how bad you were at diet shopping, you practically tried to shove the crate of goodies up any orifice it would fit- anything to just avoid the inevitable placating that Kate would most definitely deliver... if only it were Becca. She'd just smack you and get it over with. Of course she was never really one for diets, either. Point being, you suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and to make things even worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CJ... why are you... staring?\" Kate asked, round face growing bright red behind her glasses. She curled into herself slightly, trying to hide the anxiety that came with meeting your gaze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, was I? I-I had no idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the realization that you were, of course, staring all you could do was try <i>not</i> to stare. That was always offputting, when one of your friends thought you were staring at them. Because of course you weren't- at least until Kate said something about it. So now here you were, a big perv with chocolates and candy and crap who was going to cheat on his diet with one of his <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">breast</span> best! Best... you meant one of you <b>best</b> friends while you stared at her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CJ... stop... hehe...\" Kate giggled, turning incredibly red. She didn't sound all to offended at your gaze, though it did seem to put her off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, s-sorry.\" you stutter, \"Oh, I, um, got you your... um, groceries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd cue staring. Great. Now she thought you were a freak. Here you were yesterday in this exact spot feeling so at ease with Kate and feeling so confident about this whole 'diet' thing, and now all you could do was babble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this is... just great.\" Becca said in a huff, bringing the attention back to her own portly self as she started towards the door. \"I'll uh, just leave then.\" she says, obviously put off by the tension in the room. Or perhaps the staring you did towards Kate's gozangas upset her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate if you... you know, if you need me, just call me.\" she left for the door before turning back, \"I guess I'll... just go upstairs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then an awfully loud noise for such a delicate shut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know... she was just fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kate had been left alone. Becca's sudden spell of antisocial behavior aside, things hadn't changed behind you- namely where you had gotten so much food for \"Kate\". Of course you two had such similar tastes in junk these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, are those my groceries?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u201cA-Are these your groceries?\u201d you nervously parrot Kate\u2019s question by reflex.  \u201cUh...well sort of\u201d you admit guiltily as you bring the basket out before you and set it on a nearby counter top. \u201cI got everything on your list...and...um...some snacks for me too.\u201d Now it was Kate\u2019s turn to stare, but this time at the basket. The cornucopia of calories caused her eyes to widen as she cataloged its contents. She marveled at every snack cake and cookie stack she pulled out from the basket, licking her lips quickly as  she watched the snacks laid out like some sort of snack smorgasbord on the counter, that was before she quickly turned said lips into a small grimace at the remembrance of the diet. Before she can say anything you spurt out more, your voice strict on yourself because you knew the ever-forgiving Kate wouldn\u2019t be.\u201cI probably should have known you didn\u2019t want any snacks, and I didn\u2019t wanna cheat, but I didn\u2019t have any bars, and I was craving just a little snack after school and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCJ, it\u2019s fine <i>really</i>!\u201d she says reaching into the bag for her true goal that was the glasses cleaner. Using the included spray and rag she cleaned her still slightly steamy glasses, looking a lot more serious and a lot more mature without her glasses as she went on. \u201cI probably would have done the same thing if I was there. I mean I was starving after school too, I had an X-S Mass bar which helped, but, but  sometimes you just get cravings! Everyone does! Especially dieters like us.\u201d You nod glad there was this side of Kate that could be direct with you, and not instantly forgiving. You also notice that it\u2019d been forever since you\u2019d seen Kate without her glasses, and right now with her wet hair she looked like a different much more wilder and forthright person. Kate placed her glasses back on, and they instantly went back to giving her a more naive look as well as compliment her round cheeks. \u201cBut, just because we\u2019re both craving something sweet it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going overboard on all this. Just maybe a few snacks after school so I-we don\u2019t end up binging on ice cream later. Hey, I could even show you my snack and study system!\u201d She says clearly excited by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d you say feeling pretty excited too, and you knew it wasn\u2019t the idea of studying for a math test no; it was the combination of getting your chocolate fix while watching Kate\u2019s innocent yet seductive jiggling that had really got your blood pumping now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just remember more when I have something to munch on. P-<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Pretty</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">weird huh</font>?\" Kate explains blushing for what must have been the tenth time today. \u201cUh, anyways bring a pack of cookies and follow me to the back\u201d she says as she began to half walk-half hobble down the hall. Grabbing a pack of cookies, (a brand here at the academy called Biscuits Ahoy!) you follow the tottering brown haired bookworm as she heads to her dorms backroom. Once there you find a mostly empty room except for a large comfy looking bed, a full bookshelf, and a long table complete with two chairs where a math book was already splayed open surrounded by papers, pencils and a calculator. Kate places herself in a chair and you take the other, setting down the cookies between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now\u2026\u201d she sighs contently as she adjusts her chair so her wide front comfortably fit around the table. \u201cBasically, how this works is you don\u2019t get a cookie until you\u2019ve got the question right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou mean like Claire giving us a par every three laps? Or that Padlock guy's dogs? You know, the guy with the conditioner, and the drool?\u201d You suggest but getting no reaction. Kate keeps on staring until a light clicks behind her eyes and she cracks into a big hearty laugh sending her ballooning breasts bouncing once more. The laugh, warm and bubbly, was the kind was the kind you could just listen to (and watch) again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Pav<i>lov</i>? It\u2019s classical conditioning, not conditioner and this would be Operant conditioning rather than Classical, because we already um, really like junk food.\u201d Kate said sounding like she had been swallowing textbooks rather than weight gain bars. \"But, yeah it's just like that, and there's nothing wrong with rewarding some good behavior. Now let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d she flips through the math book and picks out a problem from earlier in the semester. \u201cHere try this one\u201d she says pointing to a simple equation, one that you solve pretty quickly as you move a Y from one side to another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kate says with a smile after checking your work, and as she expertly opened the package of goodies. \u201cHave a cookie.\" she offers, sounding like a teacher to an elementary school student. You do help yourself to one, and a rush of chocolate chip goodness hits you for a brief moment until you swallow and the flash is gone.Your hand reaches for another before catching yourself, reminding yourself that you were going to have to get another practice answer right before having another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you understood Kate went right to studding, flipping back to the outlined chapter and reading a problem, all the while looking like she was in a trance. It was her eyes and brains that were doing the exercising now both working faster than her legs ever had. Her fingers worked the calculator just as quickly as she dialed in a few digits, then checking her answer she found she was indeed correct. She gave a purr of delight as she made short work of her sweet reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe study system understood and underway, the room grew into a pleasant silence with Kate humming softly as she filled out her paper work, only stopping to chew on another cookie. She was already outpacing you, but not because you were just learning this stuff, every now and then out of the corner of your eye you would sneek a peek at Kate. Once, she was adjusting herself, tugging down on her ill-fitting shirt which only caused her breasts to mash upwards, an innocent act that was both crushingly cute and devastatingly sexy. Another time she was brushing cookie crumbs of off her chest, her fingers brushing all around her bosom almost as if she knew you would be secretly spying on her and she was guiding your eyes all over her body, purposely pointing out her newly enlarged aspects as she polished off a third cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.J! Look at me! \u201c she says abruptly and you freeze like a kid who was caught with his hands in a cookie jar.You turn to Kate and the both of you looked into each others eyes for several seconds. Ready to apologize a trillion time, you could only think of the slap you were about to get for checking her out again, or worse how she could get Rebbecca to do it for her, and then you'd never be friends with them again...Oh no here it comes...Kate was slowly moving closer and closer to you, it was like she was about to\u2026 \u201cC.J, I've eaten three cookies and you've only had one! What are you having trouble with?\u201d she began to lean over to read your paper exposing you to even more bare flesh and cleavage \u201cUm, <i>are</i> you having trouble?\u201d she asks rotating on her perk bum to better face you. Immediately you turn your red and wide eyed face back to your notepaper and second problem which you must have been working on for at least the last five minutes, fortunately everything you <i>had</i> written down was correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no, I guess I just work a little slower than you.Yeah!\u2026umm\u2026yeah\u201d you admit, relived that your bust browsing hadn't been busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she says, \"I guess you're right.\" Which was quickly followed up with \"Don't worry it gets easier the more you do it\u201d she consoles, sounding again much like a teacher as she reached for her fourth cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got to keep on chugging along.\" You agree, eyes still completely locked on the book, and not on the jaw dropping, mouthwatering rack that was still hovering inches away from your face. \"Eyes on the prize and everything.\"  As you eyes settled in for further studying you're oblivious to Kate as she smiled to herself, now quite certain that these days you were more focused on another sort of prize, one far different from when you had began running laps together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n <br>\r\nTime passes and you were now going over the outlined work. You found Kate had been right, the answers were coming quicker now! You had somehow formulated your own incredibly weird junk food based system of solving answers; Take this one for example; <b>Solve for Sine</b> your book reads. At the word \"Sine\" a picture of a chocolatey log with swirled cr\u00e8me filling flashed in your head the unmistakable image of a Hostess OH-OHs\u2026so that meant S=O/H: Opposites over Hypotenuses!  Smiling you type the equation out and write your answer, then the moment of truth\u2026you check the back of the math book\u2026and your answer is right! Delighted and only slightly weirded out that your thoughts were based on junk food, you reach for another cookie with satisfaction\u2026except when you reach for one your hand doesn\u2019t feel the bumpy chocolate chip specked surface of a cookie, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo what you felt was\u2026</span></div></div>",

She hadn't been stroking the back of your palm. No, it's far too early in the story for any heavy petting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if, like your own, Kate's squishy digits had too expected that there be something remaining in the clear plastic tray other than crumbs. Touching you with her thumb, fore and middle finger as if she were to pluck up your hand and pop it into her mouth like candy. She seemed to catch her innocent mistake at the same time you did, though it took a moment for her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore jerking away, you could have sworn that there was another sort of movement. Almost a cupping, delicate and ginger in delivery. However you could definitely be wrong. Really, why would Kate fondle a cookie? Rebbecca and Claire? They'd totally fondle cookies. But Kate was never really one for such strange habits... unless she knew that there was no cookie there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would definitely have been awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh!\" Kate whimpered as she jerked her hand away, resting it over her engorged mammary, \"M-My fault, CJ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's cool.\" you respond as nonchalantly as possible, ignoring the elaborate chain reaction of cancerous thoughts spreading through your subconscious like lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw as Kate looked down, struggling to see past her own generous valley of cleavage and get a glimpse at the empty container. Frowning somewhat at the crumbs and the uncomfortable neck position, Kate huffed slightly before removing her hand from the clear plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're all out of cookies...\" she said quietly, \"I-I guess I-I must have eaten them all... I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, I ate plenty myself.\" you respond coolly as you chuckle slightly, \"Guess that's just proof that you're an awesome teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate smiles and thanks you bashfully while turning seven different shades of red. She looks down, however, with a sense of remorse and doubt. \"N-No, we said we'd diet... and here I am teaching you with junk food.\" she whimpers, \"I-I guess it really didn't cross my mind... that this was a little counter-productive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you respond with a gentle nudge to Kate's flabby arm, \"I picked 'em up, the least you could do would be to make the best out of my screw-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you smiled awkwardly to each other for a second or two. She seemed really off tonight. Or really on. Truth be told, Kate always seemed to be going through the motions whenever she was just hanging out with you and Rebbecca. But lately she just seemed so... different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was always <i>different</i>. At least in the sense that she was a really nice, sweet girl who loved books and actually liked to study. Always a little heavier than most (weighing more than your somewhat waif of a fourth grade teacher while the three of you were <i>in</i> the fourth grade) and always a little too introverted. The two of you had never really hung out alone together, without Becca... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was incredibly smart, though you knew that already, and a lot of her methods and reasoning made sense. That is, after she explained them to you. For the longest time, not just before enrolling in Chubbeso Academy but your Sophomore year itself, you had always thought of Kate as somewhat of a wallflower. Though now it seemed that she was beginning to become... so much more of... well, a <i>person</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um... C-CJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You've been staring at me for, like, two minutes... straight.\" Kate whimpered while red in the face, \"It's... a little... d-do I have something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrat. Another one of those lost in contemplation moments. These things were really going to get you hurt one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, ha ha... Just trying to see if I remembered everything from today... ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked down slightly, with a dim look in her eyes as if remembering something fondly. \"Yeah...\" she sighed to herself. Tugging for what seemed like the twentieth time at the hem of her shirt, she tugged the black fabric over her bulgingly girlish figure in hopes of hiding her milky white belly from your gaze. Oh how she loathed her belly; especially when if decided to puff up so much so as to restrict her wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CJ?\" she asked again meekly, turning to you on her plush bum, \"D-Do you remember when you had to call Becca to beat up those mean girls in Primary school? I think it was in the fifth grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" you answer unconvincingly, as Kate was always the type to get picked on back when you were kids. So it seemed that a lot of her stories began very similarly. Sometimes it just took a few more details than 'those mean kids who were picking on me'. \"Maybe you could be a little more specific? I mean, no offense, but... that's a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate giggled, \"I mean, when I started to... um, <i>develop</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I remember how old we were when you started to grow boobs?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know! When Jessica Southerland and Bonnie Fitzgerald tried to beat me up when I... when I started to... get <i>these</i>?\" here, and I should note as it as possibly not an entirely innocent act, Kate motioned gently with her shoulders to emphasize said breasts. Not exactly shoving them in your face, but the gentle hand motions that followed weren't all too helpful to keep you from staring, \"And you couldn't beat them up because they were girls? So you called Becca and she did? And you still got detention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca still owes me her allowance from that week...\" you mumble to yourself, finally remembering the event in question. \"But yeah, I remember. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well... they... Jessica and Bonnie were picking on me... and they said that I'd never... that I'd always be overweight. And that was the only reason I had boobs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, Bonnie kinda puffed up a bit during eighth grade.\" you say, \"But I get what you're saying, that was terrible of them. But we never really liked them anyway, why're you letting it bother you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Kate inched a little farther away from you, seeming to try a self-shrinking exercise. \"W-Well, a-all this dieting... or lack of it... has got me worried.\" she whimpers, \"W-What if I never lose any weight and I'm always... this heavy? I don't like being so big, CJ. Even here, I just don't feel... pretty. And I'm worried that if I don't get my weight under control, I'm going to wind up really, really heavy and I'll never-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere she stopped herself one more time. She had hesitated after looking at you. Soft tears dabbed gently into the corners of her eyes, her lips quivering slightly as she looked you dead in the face. She started to finish her sentence, only to buckle down. Taking a heavy broken breath, Kate cleared her mind and resumed her story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guys just don't like bigger women. No matter how big my chest is, most guys won't bother if everything else is just as huge. A-All I want to do is be thin... that way maybe I can get a certain...\"-another pause as she corrects herself-  \"erm, <i>type</i> of guy to go out with me because... um, <i>they</i> might not like chubby girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate... you can do whatever you put your mind to.\" you say solemnly, \"If you want to lose weight, go for it. And if you don't, then that's fine too. But you have to do it for you, not anyone else. If they don't like you for you, then they're not worth your time! But, again, no matter what the choice is, I'll be here to help you out along the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh CJ... c'mere. Gimme a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the night ended on a relatively sappy note. Kate's tight embrace forced you into her sea of soft, pliable flesh as she held you deep in her cushiony valley of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was times like these you wished would never end...</span></div></div>",

There were only a few days till the test on Friday, and you still felt unprepared, and you wouldn\u2019t mind spending some more time getting to really know Kate (and perhaps better know her rotund dimensions as well.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure!\u201d Kate says without a second thought. The next two days flew by with the both of you cramming your brains while cramming your kraut full of food after school. Rebecca, still taking care of a few dorm room tasks for her partially handicapped BFF would answer the door, and then Kate would greet you in whatever ill-fitting attire she had on, you\u2019d both pick a certain snack from your secret stash and from there the two of you would head to the back room, leaving a very flustered and confused Rebecca behind you as you started snacking and studying once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was Friday: <u>Test Day</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fan club as well as your self-proclaimed number one fan Claire had all seemed equally as anxious about the test as you were because they hadn\u2019t bothered you that entire morning. Ms. Kawasaki had a student pass out the test forms and you were still a little anxious but at least had your pencil and calculator at the ready. Kate gives you a wink and a thumbs up and you return the act. Finally, you\u2019re handed a test sheet and your eyes drift over the first problem\u2026 Hey! You knew this one! Oh, and this one too! You\u2019re amazed at how easy the answers are coming to you and thanks to your studying and snack food based thinking you\u2019re done with the test in no time. Going over your answers you feel like you\u2019ve gotten most of them correct and you hand the test in feeling very confident. It wasn\u2019t till after another grueling lunch containing Bunnie Blake heartbreaking and X-S Mass bar munching that you could finally ask for your test back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Kawasaki?\u201d you call out as you entered her empty classroom finding her still grading another class's tests in her room. \u201cI was wondering\u2026Could I get my test back today instead of Monday?\u201d you ask smiling as you plead. To the rest of the school Mina Kawasaki appeared to be a piece of hard candy, but it seemed like when it was something you wanted and if you asked nice enough, Ms. Kawasaki was as soft and lenient as a marshmallow (and sometimes, like when she\u2019d gotten herself stuck in the classroom doorway, you had found the marshmallow similarities were literal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cC.J! I thought you might have wanted your test back.\u201d She pulls out a paper that was separated from the huge stack on her desk and hands it to you a giant red A+ shines back at you. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing but keep up the good work!\u201dshe says as you continue to stare and gape at the A and the neat little plus sign next to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks Ms. Kawasaki!\u201d you shout and fly out of the classroom. Wow an A+ in math! This was a first for you and you knew you owed a big thanks to Kate for her help. Where was she? As soon as you found here you were going to give her the biggest hug.  As you traversed the sizable academy in search of your plump pal Kate, you instead find Rebecca on her way to her next class looking a little irritated and strangely without her corpulent counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Becca seen Kate since lunch? I kinda have something I want to say to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s on her way to art\u2026\" she says at just above a mutter. Her lower voice and tone is lost on you as you were more worried about thanking Kate before lunch was over and classes started.\"Oh okay, well-\" you begin as you turn to leave, well before Rebbecca cuts you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast! Listen...CJ...you\u2019ve been coming to Kate\u2019s a lot more often now, just tell me...Is-is something up?\u201d she asks finally getting her accusing words out, her frustration reaching its peak and putting a slight crack in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou bet there is!\u201d You say enthusiastically as you turn around to dig into your backpack looking for your test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, you didn\u2019t see Rebecca\u2019s face as it began to lose its color. A river of thoughts and emotions began to flood Rebecca\u2019s mind. So there <i>was</i> something up between you and Kate, and you both had been keeping it a secret from her! She <i>knew</i> it! Ever since you showed up with all that junk food at Kate\u2019s, she'd watched you as you practically undressed Kate with your eyes,and  then you\u2019d both just snuck off to Kate\u2019s bedroom, thinking it was some sort of secret what you were both doing back there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rebecca\u2019s imagination began to run wilder as she angrily fantasized what you both had been doing. You with your presumed \u201cbig girl\u201d fetish alone with Kate on the bed. She could just imagine as you sensually stripped Kate to her undies, Kate\u2019s stomach so large that it now sagged over her panties and her bra so overflowing with fat goose-bumped tit flesh that her skin would have lines from where her had bra cut into them. Then, the both of you would probably lie on her bed, Kate skin still a little wet from the shower, a pile of plastic wrappers standing by waiting to be sacrificed to Kate\u2019s insatiable appetite. Her pale belly would rise and fall slightly with each breath, its immensity crowding her impressive chest till her breasts threatened to smother her where she lay. Then taking whatever sugary delight was closest in one hand you\u2019d feed it to Kate, letting her suck on your fingers as you did so, your own tongue licking any spare crumbs that happen to land on Kate\u2019s draping bosom, all the while letting your other hand explore, tease, and play with her weighty belly and breasts until finally\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oooh! </b>She couldn\u2019t even stand thinking about it now! Knowing that she\u2019d been in the room right above you as this went on Rebecca felt betrayed, then sad, and then ultimately <span class=\"cred\"><b>PISSED</b></span>! How could you guys go behind her back? She probably wouldn\u2019t have minded if Kate had asked you out, they\u2019d both known of each others feeling for you, but the fact that you and Kate were sneaking around her like she was some sort of idiot was what really made her <u>furious</u>! Well she was about to let you have it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a lot more time to find your test than you planned (you really needed to clean your backpack out one of these days) so you repeated the joke to make sure Rebecca got it. \u201cI\u2019ll say something\u2019s <i>up</i>! My GPA\u2019s <i>up</i>! Now that I got this\u2026AN A PLUS!\u201d you can barely contain your excitement as you begin to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rebbecca shouts, turning a fist that she'd for some reason made behind your back into a finger and pointing at the paper. A long pause followed. (You assumed it was probably because of how awesome this test and the joke was.) Life sprung back into Rebecca\u2019s face and she must have really liked the joke, because she began to burst out laughing on the spot. \u201cYou-You guys were studying back there? <b> Ha!</b> Why didn\u2019t you tell me, huh? I-I thought the two of you were-\u201d*<b>Psht-Hahaha </b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you guessed it...\" you admit, missing her last sentence as it was drowned out by her giggles. \"It <i>is</i> kind of funny I really needed the help though. Rebecca, this stuff was hard and Kate really helped me out!\" you explain. \"Oh, and that reminds me, I was thinking maybe we could have Game Night at Kate\u2019s tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReally you want to have it at Kate\u2019s?\u201d Rebecca asked sounding a lot more relaxed after a good laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know since her leg and all. It\u2019s a smaller dorm room than mine, but she\u2019s got plenty of snacks and ice-cream too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ that\u2019s a great idea! I mean if Kate\u2019s cool with it I\u2019m cool with it.\u201d Rebbecca says agreeably. *<b>Bzzz</b>* the alarm bell rings signaling lunch was over for the oh-so-many girls who were still busy eating. \u201cJust call me and let me know what\u2019s happening alright? Later CJ!\u201d The naturally pear shaped girl adds taking off to avoid being trampled by the<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> bulls</span> girls leaving the lunch room. As she walks away she again gave you a marvelous view of her vast hips and bubble butt, bubble was a good analogy as Rebecca was practically floating as she left, feeling so relived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching Rebecca walk away (for quite a few seconds) you hurry to the art room and found Kate alone. Gleefully, you proudly show her the A+ paper, and her face lights up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d she shouts giddily and you're so caught up in the moment this time you wrap <i>her</i> into another warm and doughy embrace of thanks. Parting from the partially smothering hug, and thankful that the rest of Kate\u2019s art class hadn\u2019t arrived from lunch yet, you remember your second purpose for finding Kate; game night. You explain your plan to hold game night at Kate\u2019s rather than your own dorm, Kate was indeed cool with it, especially since the party was a good chance to get rid of all the tempting goodies now laying around the house waiting to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a few calls to the usual Game Night attendants (Rebbecca,Claire, and of course Bunnie Blake) and head to your last classes of the day, your head and stomach already anticipating the giant celebration planned tonight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rush home still full of excitement from this awesome day. Quickly taking off your Chubbeso uniform and throw on a pair of jeans and a plain t shirt, ready to just hang out and have some fun tonight. The t-shirt is a little smaller than you remember, as your potbelly stomach refused to remain covered. More excited about the party than how well your shirt fits (or if you had bothered to notice, how your little paunch wasn\u2019t so little anymore) you grab your gaming system and dash back over to Kate\u2019s for another famous Game Night; a long standing tradition and one of the few bearable things about this absurd academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ!\u201d Kate greets you at the door barely refraining from hugging once more. \u201cUm, come in and make yourself at home!\" She beamed as she gestured to the cabinets and countertops laden with the junk food you\u2019d purchased earlier that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Rebecca, as per quo having already made herself quite at home in front of the TV with a box of top tarts and dressed in a bright yellow \"Ba'Li\" shirt, the name stretched out over the vast expanse that was her boobies, and her usual Chubbeso sweats. Clearly she had the courtesy to bring snacks, cookies from home (Mrs. Maglen was all too aware of her daughter's friends' appetites... namely Kate) and a few bag of chips. It appeared that she did not, however, have enough to refrain from taking it upon herself to christen the bag of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohai!\" Becca says nervously red, you having caught her with her mouth full, \"I wub jusht... ub...\" here she swallowed, \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou politely decline as Kate motions for you to follow here into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay so remember how I was freaking out a few days ago...\u201d You nod instantly recalling Kate\u2019s tears spotted face. \u201cWell I was thinking about what you said and\u2026Well\u2026I figured maybe I could push the diet thing back for just one more night\u2026You know since it\u2019s a party and everything?\u201d She sounds unsure of the idea, wanting to hear what you thought. And of course you wanted Kate to have a good time tonight so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Kate, one day won\u2019t hurt.\u201d You declare as you pick a pile of foodstuffs smiling a voracious grin.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was the next to arrive, bringing in a whole box of X-S MASS with her. She was wearing a relatively simple getup, despite her royal tastes. You had no idea that Halter tops were popular in England, let alone made in the plurally x'd size that Claire Masters must've required. Yet there was one wrapped around her doughy form, stretched graphic of a golden crown and all. Her skinny jeans (certainly only skinny to her) and Ugs all making her look very approachable... aside from the fact that one might suspect that she could eat you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Kat girl's told me just what is \"in\" back in the States, so I decided to let her whip something up.\u201d she says handing the box to you, \"And these are for you. Since I <i>-cough cough-</i> can't coach you anymore, my Mother said she would stock these energy bars in the vending machines full-time now until we can get a proper gym teacher as... it's become simply too stressful for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then took it upon herself to give herself access to the modest amount of junk food Kate had lain on the counter top before her royal rump roasts enveloped the couch cushion farthest away from Becca, putting them both on an arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie would be the last one to arrive this evening. Her attendence record at these little get togethers was less than admirable. And, opposed to her usual garb of a light fuschia lunch lady's uniform, she was allowed to dress loud and proud as Bunnie Blake... boy was it loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a State's girl only a few years older than yourself, her tastes were still understandably metropolitan. A bright pink top that wrapped around her midriff and spaghetti-strapped around her shoulders; the front of which was dominated by a lone though sizeable lime-greed star whose uppermost point adjusted drastically to accomodate Bunnie's impeccable hooters. Simple faded blue jeans as bottoms, ripped and torn from walking around bare feet in her own complex no doubt and marked upon in Sharpie from people you and your friends had never even heard of, and a pair of new black converse- strings replaced to match her hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it\u2019s your favorite and I always make plenty... so I saved ya some leftovers, Ceej.\" Bunnie says warmly as she handed you the tuberware in her hands, a wishful smile on her face as you examine the box<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean...\" you gasp as she opens the lid, struggling with the surprisingly heavy weight of the package, only to find-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, a few slices of my Chocolate Cake-ala-Blake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone manages to help themselves to a slice or two before setting into their usual groove. That is of course before the obligatory moment in every Game Night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey whats a party cake without ice cream? \u201d Claire asked to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca in one of the rare moments she agreed with the princess \u201cKate has plenty of ice cream don\u2019t you Kate? You don\u2019t mind do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have some!\u201d you interject \u201cI mean it\u2019s a party after all.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course we know you\u2019ll have some Big Guy\u2026\u201d and on the last two remarks she sticks a finger straight into the center of your visible paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecca stop-haha.\u201d You can\u2019t finish as Rebecca had given a direct hit to your ticklish area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot used to such attention (there was a <i>reason</i> these things are usually held at your house, and it wasn't space) she began to stammer slightly, as she always did when confronted, \"Y-Yeah, there's plenty of ice cream in the freezer. Um, help yourselves.\" Kate added grimly realizing all to well what those words could mean for students with such big appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was first and forwent all formalities, when confronted with delicious food and around people she only half-respected anyway, simply grasped a pint straight from the freezer and a spoon. After which she merrily waddled back to her seat on the couch and resumed her tyrannical rule over the poor cushions underneath her heavy bum. \u201cOkay time for gossip...Listen to this I heard that Delphine and Chris were at the pool but guess who else was there\u2026\u201d and like that your three friends slowly became three girls and began to glut themselves on ice cream after waddling up and about the kitchen, never wishing to miss a bit of gossip about the schools and the latest rumors they might pertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one for girl talk, you now found yourself alone with Bunnie Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you got your appetites back!\u201d she says serving you you're second piece of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we were just a little bit nervous about the test.\u201d You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she nods. \u201cI remember getting the same way around test time too. Don\u2019t worry just like my mom said \u2018Sometimes the best thing for a stomach full of butterflies is to keep it full of food.\u2019 But If you\u2019re still not feeling to good I guess I can go easy on you later\u201d she trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey even if I was sick I could still whoop you at some video games! \u201cyou say as a snarky grin creeps across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. It. Is. ON!\u201d she says riled up from your trash talking. She sets down her cake server and stomps past the gossiping trio right to the console picking up a controller. \u201cCome here so I can make you eat those words!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt proved to be another excellent game night, with Bunnie taking on all challengers at Mortal Kombat. Things seemed like they couldn\u2019t get any better.</span></div></div>",

And oh yes, suck on some of <i>this</i> Scorpion!!\" Bunnie Blake hollers triumphantly as she delivers a Fatality to the afformentioned yellow-clad warrior, \"Barakus wins... <b>again</b>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FATALITY!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Bunnie! Just pick another character!\" you can't help but whine at this point. Those three were only the most recent of her onslaught, seeming to forget Smoke and Liu Kang due to a relatively hyperactive mindset, \"You know what, just let <b>me</b> be Barakus just this once, you never pick anyone but him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Bunnie gurgles as she looks up at her victorious \"I could never even think of beating up Barry! He's so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a mouth like that, I'll be he could eat everything I put in front of him! Those rock-hard pecs wouldn't go unnoticed either...\" she crinkles her nose excitedly, \"Such a turn on.\" she says throatily before giggling at your expense<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's like, part snake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, next to you in an \"occupy Kate's couch\" movement, somehow all three of your ponderously paunchy pals had managed to squeeze their fleshy forms in the same seat. At your house this would have been no problem, however that was due to your flat's luxurious furnishing; as in the anticipation that you and Claire would be spending much more time together than you actually do, all of your own furniture was reinforced to hold even the heaviest of girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Kate and Rebbecca, due to not having penises and therefor not registering on Claire Master's radar, were to go without when it came to furniture until it broke, where it would be disposed of, dismantled, upsized, replaced and reinforced at the easy-easy cost of fifty pounds per. So putting carelessly calorie-carrying Kate, rotund in the buns Becca and Claire Masters (who <b>ate</b> the rhyme I provided for her) into one couch was no easy process. In fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move over, Kate, you're on my leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right. All three of these girls were so generously proportioned along all axis' that they had filled the couch. Not to the point of immobility while on it, but the doughy white balls of blubber had officially fused personal space bubbles. Kate had to keep her arms as close to eachother as humanly possible due to Becca's insistance on flopping out and about the armrest, which casued her to feel too contained in the breastial area. Claire kept her hands neat and folded where her belly met her lap, though she was terrible about the constant effort of crossing her plump little legs, constraining Kate from leg movement due to just how thick and immovable those obviously not interlocking logs of flub were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd below were you and Bunnie, seated happily on the rug playing video games to your mutual heart's content. She hated video games with a passion... except the visual novel games from Japan that you had shown her so long ago. Those were pretty fun, like Higurashi. But not fighting games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't really fit in with Becca and Claire either. Despite a lot of protest from either side, the two were a lot alike. Kate liked to think that Claire would have been very much like Rebbecca if she had grown up alongside her clique, and Rebbecca could easily have become Claire if she had lived as a 'Masters girl' her whole life. They both were rather obbsessive and stubborn, but would stand up for things that they believed in. And most importantly, they were both gossips; something that Becca wasn't before enrolling. Despite all this, when they weren't gossiping, they were usually trading insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they totally hated eachother!\" Becca said from across Kate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Total. Lesbos. I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priya and Delilah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh! No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate couldn't help but feel just a little bit out of place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever things had certainly been fun. No more different than things had been at your house. There was a little more courtesy, and things seemed a bit more cramped than usual (either due to size or, well, occupant size) There were a few things that would certainly have to change for the next few times... assuming that her ankle got better that quickly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I think I'll have CJ move that chair over here so we're not so squished on the couch'</i> she thought maternally as she made a mental checklist of next week's improvements, <i> 'Bunnie said my place was a little drab... maybe I could put up that framed poster of Einstein I have! Oh I hope they like it next week!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate sighed inwardly as she thought fondly of what she could do. So lost in her mind she was that she didn't catch sight of the two of you on the floor rising to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kate, I had a blast!\" Bunnie says happily as she delivers a quick hug and hops out the door, hollering back to them, \"Chicken Alfredo with broccoli tomorrow, don't be late!\" as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed, \"Yes, I have to be going to.\" wiping a bit of ice cream from her lips, she carelessly tossed the container behind her, \"I have a dinner to attend to with Mother and her boring friends. And her boring friends' daughters. Yuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I can stay a bit.\" Becca says faithfully, \"CJ, why don't you help Princess Blubberbutt up off of her royal hiney so we can all have a moment alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes CJ,\" Claire says seductively as she wobbles around on the couch in as sexual a position possible for a girl of her size and shape, \"Come wrap your arms around me... don't worry, I'm sure you'll get the <i>heavy lifting</i> done once we're out the door together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, let her sit there.\" Becca says coldly, \"She could afford to miss a few meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!!\" Claire whined before you all burst out into laughter...</span></div></div>",

During lunch, you both remained strong and avoided seconds, except for a granted system that allowed another helping; such as after a big test, or after a similarly worthy accomplishment. After school you were usually one to hang out with Kate along with Rebbecca and occassionally another drop-in companion of yours, usually around the plaza that Chubbeso's small community had gained over the course of it's founding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca, ever the extrovert and secretly suspicious of how quick you and Kate seemed to become even chummier than normal, was always one to suggest some kind of three-person friendly activity; such as going to the movies or taking a stroll around the mock neighborhood. While her innate jealousy was no doubt a slight motivator in her actions, she genuinely wished to spend more time with the two of you, feeling somewhat neglected as your friendship progressed further and further. Her favorite activities usually consisted of afformentioned moviegoings, spending time with ridiculous competitions between company present, or even just loitering in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, much more introverted than her bottomheavy blowhard of a companion, was actually rather enjoying the time that all three of you seemed to spend together lately. Now, again, you three had spent plenty of time together in the past, but ever since enrolling and the constant ambushings and the neverending gaggles of girls following you around, she had noticed an undeniable dip in time <i>actually</i> spent together with you. And while she wasn't nearly as \"active\" (per say) as Becca in her preferred activities, hers were none the less entertaining in their own rights. Going to the library, the quiant cafe run by a branch of the Chubbeso staff (interesting note: Bunnie highlights here on her weekends off, leaving the kitchen staff to do her dirty work) or even that quaint stroll in the park that Becca seemed to be so fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were more than happy to oblige both young ladies in their flights of fancy. You weren't quite picky yourself, so you and your two compadres seemed to settle on whichever idea sounded like the best idea at the time. Leading to a usually hassle-free environment for your mutual friendship to blossom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you had company outside just the three of you, things tended to get a little hectic... which seemed to impede your dietary progress</span></div></div>",

Being squished so tightly as she was, her belly rolled outwards heavily, resting inconsiderately atop her flaring thighs. Her double chin, soft though unyeilding, was bunched up against her breasts, despite attempting to sit as a proper lady should. Her attempts at maintaining that status were only second to her attempts at stuffing you full of scones like a prized hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're one to talk about hoity-toity.\" Becca snarled from her own seat, one not quite so overloaded as the one the Princess' mightily meaty mass dominated upon, \"Where we, CJ Kate and me, come from the only \"special order\" we put in with our mothers is whether or not we want Eskimo Pies from the grocery store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" you concur quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I <i>do</i> like Eskimo Pies...\" Kate agreed meekly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took another long sip of her tea, a bite of her scone between her thick fingers, and then another sip before dabbing her pouty lips with a napkin before her rebuttal. \"It's CJ, Kate, and <b>I</b> Rebbecca.\" she said with her nose high in the air, \"Honestly, you Americans. And secondly, shut up and enjoy the treats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" Becca sat the cup down hastily as she leaned forward slightly; a vein on her forehead appearing ominously, \"Your royally rotund maids will rough me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave Bernice and Gretchen out of this, y-you overstuffed harpy!\" Claire huffed as she attempted to lean forward against her own bulk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pampered Pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimwitted Sow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Claire's shifting became too much for the poor overworked piece of furniture beneath her. At the constant movement of her royal buns, Claire noticed the legs buckling beneath her at the start of the meal, and while normally she would find pride in this fact, it was still quite the inconvenience considering that there was no time for a replacement to be ordered. The splintering lumber beneath her now would prove her wrong as her soft, heavy form was sent down to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Kate jumped slightly, her own bulk wiggling a bit in her surprise, \"C-Claire, are you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>MOTHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!</i>\" she hollered at the top of her lungs...</span></div></div>",

Namely Kat, however she wasn't exactly without her faults either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kat, I r-really don't think... that this suits me...\" Kate pleaded brokenly, her face absolutely burgundy with the amount of embarassment that this new outfit entailed (though it probably had something to do with the tight girdle that it entailed as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you look great!\"  Kat patronized the poor plump girl as she paced about, almost like a vulture as she circled around Kate's meaty form absolutley bursting out of her latest ensemble. Tentatively the pony-tailed girl knelt down and examined some of the more constricting areas of her outfit, which seemed to revolve around one certain area- this being a strapless and backless dress and only to be supported by Kate's enormous hooters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate your boobs are really spilling out of this thing, aren't they?!\" she said abruptly after a minute or two of scrutinizing the reddened area, \"I mean that's no surprise... your boobs spill out of everything you own... but seriously, ever look at breast reduction surgery? These monsters have gotta be <b>murder</b> on your back!\" she said loudly, cupping them as best she could with her hands. \"If you'd be interested, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands... or even half would do me just fine if I split them between what I've already got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat!!\" you couldn't help but to get a little red-faced yourself at the events taking place in front of you, \"Please will you knock it off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it, CJ!\" Kat chided you as she continued poking and prodding at her newest mannequin's flesh bulging from every open orifice of her dress, \"I've got to see what areas are tight on Kate if I want to get this thing juuust right... hmm, are you sure you haven't had implants? These puppies are wild!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAT!!\" both you and Becca have to shout, catching her attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry.

She turns awkwardly, her expansive thighs tight in the tight white dress, before her back is turned to the three of you. Kat carefully attempts to pry the fabric from Kate's smooth cushion of backfat. She can't even get an inch off of the poor thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with so much in the front, I guess I'll have to spin off a bit more fabric and adjust the size... again...\" Kat said, not bitterly but with a professional's pain of having to readjust their work for the third time, \"In the meantime, I guess we could all go see a movie or something, what's playing?\" she asked, turning to Rebbecca as she reached for an all-too-familiar brand of energy bar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CJ?\" Kate whimpered from atop the stage, \"Do you think we keep dieting, I'll be able to fit into this dress?\" she asked with a sparkle of hope in her eyes (though that could have also been the studio light from Kat's flat against her glasses)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will!\" you answer wholeheartedly, though squeezing into <i>that</i> dress wouldn't really be much of an accomplishment, \"I'm sure that Kat's gonna have to make it a whole lot smaller before she has to make it any bigger for you to wear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CJAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!\" she hollers as she suddenly plummets from the top of the stage, landing on her front and forcing all of her flab atop itself, popping Kate out of the dress like a lobster too big for it's shell! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she landed on her breasts, so the only casualty would be her glasses as the fell from her rounded face and shattered on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate!\" you holler, \"What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I might know...\" Kat said mournfully, seeming somewhat... wider than just a second ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I popped a button on m-my... m-my uniform...\"</span></div></div>",

You learned that rather early on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Se Magnifique Madame</i>!\" the softly accented tone echoed throughout the cooking room, not that you had entirely noticed just how much it echoed with Delphine in front of you. \"Madame Blake, she est tres gifted, non?\" the blonde girl gushed as she helped herself to another forkful of Bunnie's latest confectionery concoction heartily, actually leaning in to lessen the time taken from fork to mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you like it, Pheeny.\" Bunnie's voice rang from the back of the room as she sat, looking positively dwarfed in Ms. Telleri's custom built, oversized chair. \"When CJ and Kate asked that I started cooking healthier from now on, I thought I had done something wrong, but knowing that my healthy food is just as good as my apparently \"not up to some people's standards\" food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bunnie, we were only trying to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'm just teasing, Kate.\" the calamity-pink cook grinned towards the topheavy girl beside Becca, \"You too, Romeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but jump, considering you were used to male-oriented nicknames around here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So another week had passed. You were in class and Mrs. Kawasaki was collecting your homework, she stops by your desk hand outstretched, and you move to hand your homework in only\u2026only you didn\u2019t have it? Oh that\u2019s right it was still in your backpack. You and Kate had just worked on it together. You search your bag high and low and still couldn\u2019t find it! Mrs. Kawasaki stares testily down at you as you search for the missing paper. Suddenly, a whistle came from across the classroom; someone stood up and was pointing at you. But why?  Your shirtless that\u2019s why! <i>Oh great</i>! You had come to school pants-less too. In nothing but your underwear you trembled in your seat. Frozen and red-faced the classroom you feel the classroom filling with giggles. But suddenly there was another sound, and something like an earthquake began to shake you at your desk! You were sinking into the ground! Only wait- it wasn\u2019t the ground-it was butterscotch pudding? You will your arms and legs to move but no matter hard you try they remain stuck. You begin to sink lower and lower, apparently the only one who noticed that you were slowly sinking into this warm stuff.  You legs go numb as they go under and you\u2019re up to your waist in pudding when a grinning face appears from above.  Not Kate\u2019s as you for some strange reason had expected, or even Rebecca\u2019s, but Claire\u2019s, surrounded by what look to be the entire CJ Fan Club army behind her. The gigantic girls, who were now all in bathing suits, jump high into the air performing cannonballs into the new pudding pool. Claire was heading your way, but butt first\u2026Your hands still stuck; the last image you see is the firm outline of Claire\u2019s cheeks as they\u2019re seconds away from your head when\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flip themselves open in reaction at impact and you wake from the strange nightmare.  You almost yelp as you\u2019re greeted by the framed face of Albert Einstein, his disheveled hair and outstretched tongue making him look just as surprised to see you too. Your mind takes a second to take the image in and then it takes a few more blinks and few more seconds before you realize something\u2026you weren\u2019t waking up in your bed\u2026you weren\u2019t even in your own dorm room! This was Kate\u2019s (recently redecorated) room!  And this defiantly wasn\u2019t your pillow.  For one thing your pillow wasn\u2019t pink like this one and your pillow certainly didn\u2019t feel as nice as this one either, gently rising and falling\u2026wait a minute\u2026this wasn\u2019t a pillow at all! You lightly raise you head and find that you were now, and apparently had been, lying gently upon Kate\u2019s magnificent pillowy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the realization that you had probably been motor boating one of your best friends as the both of you had slept, you immediately went to jerk away. *<b>No not like tha</b>t* Pulling and tugging yourself *<b>hee</b>* you found you couldn\u2019t move at all!  Getting a better hold on yourself *<b>OK! I\u2019ll stop</b>* you realize that your arm had become trapped underneath your stout schoolmate\u2019s tonnage, and that was why you couldn\u2019t move from this very provocative looking situation. You attempted to piece together how exactly you had ended up in this situation but a pounding headache began to drum through your brain stopping any attempt you made to think. Well, first thing first, you needed to get your arm free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom underneath your blankets you shift your body ever so slightly, trying to adjust yourself to better pull out your arm. As carefully as possible you moved just a tiny bit lower, taking utmost care not to wake the sleeping Kate.  You tug again but still no effect, your arm is still asleep and quite immobile, unable to move from under Kate\u2019s smothering weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself rest for a second and lay your head back down gently before you make another careful and stealthy attempt when-Hey! Instead of two pillows you were now laying on one big plushy one; Kate\u2019s stomach.  Her stomach, fully revealed by her pajamas inability to cover her girth seemed even bigger now that you were this close to it. As you began to find Kate was quite the literal body pillow your head comfortably sank into her stomach. Your muscles go lax as you feel Kate\u2019s stomach rise and inflate with every one of her sleeping breaths, only to gently sink with every exhale. Lying here in the quiet and warm dorm room, laying on this big warm improvised pillow you realized that it was\u2026it was\u2026it was\u2026 nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace to face (to face to face) with Kate's apparently still budding breasts and stomach you  enjoy your situation for just a bit\u2026Shifting your head back for just a moment you nuzzle against Kate\u2019s chest, and it feels just like you imagined;  they\u2019re firm yet still giving like a water bed in their consistency. And her belly! Well words really couldn\u2019t describe what it felt like. Soft, warm, squishy, none of those were the exact word why her stomach made such an awesome pillow! In fact it was just nice to have a belly that wasn\u2019t coming at you at practically the speed of light looking to smother you. You pause for just one more moment longer enjoying the soft skin on skin feeling, basking in the warmth Kate\u2019s stomach possessed, slowly letting your face sink cheek first into the chub that was just as tender and gentle as Kate was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a snore or snorts of sorts and you could just crane your neck to the side to see where it was coming from. Apparently you weren\u2019t alone here! Rebecca had spent the night in Kate\u2019s living room too, and she also looked to be in a deep sleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few wild moments of uncontrollably pressing you luck are cut short as common sense and fear take over. If Kate, or even worse Rebecca, happened to wake up to this crazy scene you have some <u>serious splaining\u2019 to do</u>!  Almost as if she was sensing your urgency Kate began to shift, she raised a chubby arm and you swiftly dodge its grasp as Kate slowly began to turn in her sleep. As she began to roll over, your smushed hand is freed, and you manage to wedge yourself out of the plush prison. Head still throbbing, arm still tingling as more blood began to flow back into it, your carefully stand up to take in your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see; Kate\u2019s glasses on the table over there, empty pop cans and ice-cream pints, snack wrappers, blankets, it seemed like you\u2019d been through one heck of a night! You yourself seemed to be in your pajamas/sweats.  Your head still throbbing, you search your fuzzy memories to piece together the big question: <b>How exactly had you got here?</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Let\u2019s see\u2026It was three weeks ago now that you had gotten that A+ on the test. The awesome memory was still fresh in your mind because it was your first A+ in math and you were just so excited about it\u2026and after that was\u2026game night! You remember agreeing with Kate that night that splurging on snacks would be a game night only thing. But there was still something important in the back of your mind-what was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present day, you decide to get some water from Kate\u2019 bathroom, so as quietly as you could, you make your way to get a glass of cool water.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe test had been three weeks ago, lately you remember getting to know Kate\u2019s place very well. Almost any night when you two weren\u2019t studying together, Kate had called you and Rebecca over to help do some small chores (she did still have an injured leg after all.) You had moved a few chairs, cleaned a few floors and overall made her place look a lot snazzier. One day at Kate\u2019s in particular had really stood out in your mind. While you were hanging up a poster of Albert Einstein, you had turned to ask Kate how it looked, but in the one split second after you spoke up you were sure you has caught her staring at you. For once instead of you admiring Kate\u2019s bountiful breasts, you had caught her apparently sneaking a peak at what you supposed was your butt, or maybe it had just been at the poster, either way she had turned absolutely red, and had taken a deep breath of air like she was just about to say something important\u2026but all she did was peep a small \u201cYes\u201d agreeing that the poster did look fine where you\u2019d put it. Between then and now there had been the trips to Masters\u2019 mansion for tea, the two times you\u2019d gone to Kat\u2019s place to hang with her, and Bunnies\u2019 special lunches you\u2019d shared with Delphine\u2026so that left just a few days unaccounted for.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou reach Kate\u2019s bathroom and flick a switch, the rooms bright lights flicker on and scorch you corneas at first, then things ease into view as your bleary eyes adjust. You take a glance into Kate\u2019s bathroom mirror, mystified by what you saw. Was that you? Apparently the diet hadn\u2019t been working so well for you as it had for Kate. Kate had maybe put on a few extra pounds only really noticeable because she seemed to gain in just two main areas\u2026but you, you had really grown all over! Perhaps it was because Kate was a little bit more serious about the diet than you were, (always offering you the last few donuts or brownies of a pack when you were studying together) perhaps it was because Claire\u2019s constant insistence that you remain \u201cwell fed\u201d whenever you were around her, (making sure her big athletic man had plenty of X-S Mass bars at all times of the school day) or maybe it might have been the \u2018special\u2019 lunches with Delphine (which while still lower in calories, Bunnie now served in portions of what could only be considered \u2018Chubbeso size\u2019 which sometimes led both Kate and Delphine passing their uneaten leftovers onto you, quite possibly the #1 fan of Bunnies cooking.) Whatever the reason was you certainly looked a lot\u2026larger then when you\u2019d began this diet. Well, not that you looked bad; your small potbelly wasn\u2019t so small now, and your arms fit just a tiny bit tighter into your pajama top, your face certainly looked a little more\u2026round, but really, you weren\u2019t complaining. Sure you had gained a pound or two on this diet, but you were actually on a \u201cdiet\u201d because you hadn\u2019t wanted Kate to go it alone as she had on her many diet attempts before. So, if taking a pound or two for Kate is what it took to finally slow her gaining, then so be it, you would gladly do that for your friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sheer curiosity you went over to Kate\u2019s bathroom scale. You step on it and (having to just slightly lean over your beginners belly) you were able read the digital display. The red numbers shuffle till eventually reaching 206lbs. The number sends a small shock in your mind as you realize you had now passed the 200lb mark. You pause to think back again\u2026you were 187lbs on weigh in day\u2026so that was about a 19lb gain in a little over three weeks! You\u2019re given another small jolt as you calculate that to be almost a pound a day... You instantly begin to rationalize the numbers, comforting yourself with the fact that you would have probably gained more if you weren\u2019t on this diet, and that fact seems to move the issue from your mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou head back to the bathroom\u2019s sink and mirror, drinking down a few Dixie cups of cold water. That\u2019s when you noticing the slight smear on your hand, was that\u2026chocolate cake? You wash the chocolate smudge from your hand recognizing it as residue from the snack cake you enjoyed last night\u2026last night\u2026. THAT\u2019S RIGHT! Yesterday has been Game Night at Kate\u2019s, making it the third-no wait-fourth time now! And yet this revelation, while a step in the right direction, sill wasn\u2019t the important thought that pervaded your grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall attempting to hold back on what you snacked on during the week, (well when you weren\u2019t studying, which seemed to be quite often now-a-days.) The abstaining of snacks had only increased your hunger and anticipation of game night; a night where diets were basically thrown in the garbage and buried under ice cream pints and whipped cream bottles. You remember splurging so much the other night, and well, you certainly looked like you had been too. Something had happened though\u2026Something last night!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour thirst quenched, you walk back into the main room, gazing at the two heavy heavy sleepers before you, and they seemed content to sleep their mornings away. Your head throbs once more as you take in Kate, donned in her pink fuzzy pajamas, apparently having crashed on the floor in a half opened sleeping bag beside you, mouth still open with just a hint of drool trickling out. Then just to the other side of what you guessed to be your sleeping spot and \u2018original\u2019 pillow was Rebecca, donned in red flannel PJ\u2019s and also still snoozing away. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess how you must have ended up in such a tight situation this morning. You assume that Kate must have rolled over towards your sleeping bag and more to the point your hand, and from there your head just assumed that Kate was your pillow. There, it was as simple as that, nothing naughty had gone on. But there was still the question of why had you been sleeping here at Kate\u2019s?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen it suddenly hits you, memories of last night rushing at you all at once; Game Night last night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt had been one of the best nights ever; Claire had pouted all that week that she couldn\u2019t come due to some family obligation, but Bunnie had still managed to make it over bringing tons of her award winning pasta with her. She had also been trashing your mercilessly at Tekken all night long (Bob being her \u201ccute\u201d weapon of choice last night.) You also remember Kate and Rebecca had been talking heatedly about something in the background, a few time Rebecca had even raised her voice but she never exactly sounded angry at Kate. In the end like most of their conversations it had ended in laughter. Whatever they were discussing you had been distracted to notice as you were too badly getting whooped at Tekken to make out the specifics, you weren\u2019t sure but you might have heard your name dropped in the conversation two or three times. But still, that wasn\u2019t the thing that was just escaping your thoughts.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou remember how you embarrassingly refused to let Bunnie leave until you had won at least one match, and you think it had taken till just around midnight before she\u2019d finally given up and simply let you beat her. After that Bunnie had to go, but Rebecca had wanted to watch a movie, and so after that, you remember feeling really tired and on the cusp of a sugar shock sleep for the ages, that\u2019s when Kate had suggested you sleep here for the night, citing it was already practically a pajama party. You agreed, and Rebecca had left to go get her sleeping bag, leaving just you and Kate alone for a moment.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat was it! You both were making a bed out of unused blankets and pillows when Kate had said something to you, something really important!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow if only you could remember what it was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Being half asleep at the moment, it was a miracle that your response had any sort of recognizable consonants or vowels. Staring at a television screen all night was certainly a strange way to tucker one's self out, but you had definitely found a way to do it. Somehow watching those poor avatars onscreen fight to the death (mostly just get beat to death by a chunky blonde guy) had really taken the wind out of you. That and the cheering, constantly getting up for a drink or two, using the bathroom; on top of all the jokes, laughter, and that ten minutes where Bunny claimed you as her throne and used your back as the seat- Tekken still whirring inside the xbox. Things had certainly been interesting that night. Well, as interesting as most Game Nights wound out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was understandable that you'd be a little winded, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ?\" Kate asked again with a whisper as she poked your plopped form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngughhh...\" you whimpered, \"...Ya? What's up Kate...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe topheavy girl knelt with noticeable difficulty, causing considerable strain on her bunched up tee as it rode up as her belly pressed up against inside it's confines. As she reached the ground, a smile on her chubby cheeked little face, she failed to notice the impeccable strain present on her pajama bottoms as her plush buns filled the seat to max capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she started off sweetly, \"Could you... y'know, wake me up tomorrow?\" she asked shyly, \"I-I mean, Dr. Young told me that I should get my ankle checked out, a-and I made an appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'great\" your already slumbering brain answers for you with a grumble<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate smiled again, \"I know, right? Pretty soon we'll be able to work out together again!\" she said in an excitedly hush tone, \"I can't wait, but I need you to wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow morning. I-If it's not too much trouble, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bout of silence before your light snoring came into play, filling the flat with your gentle inhales and exhales...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CJ?\" she asked again, nudging your shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'mah wake.\" you stammer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you going to wake me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeayeah, sure... wake me up...\" you murmured before finally losing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. You were totally supposed to wake up Kate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, Kate!!\" you holler, shaking your jiggly body pillow in attempts to rouse her, \"You've got to wake up... <i>now</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your shaking, your two friends slowly shook the sleep from their eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to grumble about being awake wasn't Rebbecca, that wouldn't come until later. The absolute first thing to come out of Becca's overstuffed body was a low gurgle that would emanate from the pit of her stomach; signifying that, like most other times lately, Becca was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after this that the audible groans of waking came into play. With a frown plastered on her chubby face, she proceeded to make her usual \"don't wanna\" sounds as she shifted about in her lumpy sleeping bag. Apparently fighting to find the zipper, she struggled and squirmed within its thick confines for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obviously apparent that Kate had left hers open from the beginning for a reason. You see, being quite used to her rather large front, Kate had long given up on sleeping comfortably in confined spaces. This meant that, as she only grew larger, she expected to give herself a little leeway. While Becca, stubborn as a mule, preferred to sleep tight. Unfortunately, she would be sleeping far too tight for her own tastes- her bodacious bod and considerable rump were two main features that had gotten her stuck in her sleeping bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's the matter, CJ?\" Kate asked, blushing slightly at just how close your faces were so early in the morning. It wasn't but ten seconds later that realization hit her as well, her eyes darting open as she struggled to rise past her own swollen proportions. She searched around for her glasses frantically, her chubby face looking quite naked without them, \"Oh no, I've got to get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Becca could only watch, not feeling quite able to do much to help your struggling friend as she nervously hobbled around on her bum, chubby leg...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was a knock at the door, a light rapping that somehow seemed very prominent without being too overbearing. As the three of you looked to each other to see who would answer it, you decide to take charge and open the door. Noticing to some degree that the uppermost section of your thighs had begun to brush together as you walked, you managed yourself over to Kate's front door and opened it; revealing Abida Idhar, carrying herself in her usual soulless no-nonsense manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate Granderson?\" Abida asked flatly, ignoring you entirely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Erm, Kate <i>Granden</i>, yes...\" she responded meekly from her standing position, still nervously twiddling her fingers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an appointment with Doctor Young.\" Miss Idhar hissed, \"I was asked by the Headmistress to escort you to the premises.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah...\" Kate grimaced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbida seemed to dead-eye all three of you behind her sunglasses. Her lips remained curving downwards in a stoic neutrality that scared the ever-living daylights out of just about everyone she came into contact with, yourself included. It was only natural that Kate be a little hesitant to go along with a woman that you had long ago concluded was a sociopath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to you and Rebbecca before making her decision:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm still in my pajamas...I-I didn't wake up in time...\" she said sadly, \"I'd imagine that, since my friends didn't wake me up, I don't have time to change do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Abida answered flatly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Kate turned back to the two of you, you specifically, with a look of betrayal clearly detectable without her glasses, intentional on her part or not. Her hands traveled down to her exposed midsection, plump hands running over your pliable body pillow of the night, and her head hung low in shame. \"O-Okay... let me just get my glasses?\" Kate pleaded with the stern woman, only to be met with a jerk in the opposite direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was an awkward silence between your remaining pair as the nurse-bound two left the apartment, you and Becca being the only ones left in an apartment that wasn't yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I feel like a jerk.\" she said aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but agree with her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kate, feeling rather dejected slowly slogged down the hallway trudging behind the swift figure of Abida. The dark shape was the only way she would be certain she was heading in the right direction, for, while she wasn\u2019t completely blind without her glasses it was only if she squinted hard enough, sans-squinting she could hardly discern any of the blurry objects that surrounded her, let alone find her way to Dr. Young\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fuming that a certain someone had forgotten their promise to wake her up, and unable to know how many of the blurry blobs in her vision were actually other students surely making fun of her as she plodded along in her teeny tiny pj\u2019s. Kate was left feeling both angry and gloomy, but it was only a few moments of silent brooding later when the shadowy shape in front of her abruptly stopped. Even without her glasses Kate recognized that they were front of Dr. Young\u2019s office. Kate then heard a quick plastic click as Abida pulled out a smart phone from her suits inner pocket and made a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Student Kate Granden has been delivered. Yes Mrs. Masters.\u201d said the monotone voice of Abida. Kate then heard another click, this time of the metallic variety as the door to the Dr.\u2019s office swung open. Half blind Kate could recognize the blobby figure of the woman standing in the doorway as the shapely Dr. Young. Abida only gave a quick nod to the doctor as she ushered Kate forth towards the office, Abida then swiftly turned about on her heels and silently disappeared back into the Academy\u2019s hallways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerribly sorry about Ms.Idhar Kate, but headmistress Masters insisted that you be escorted to your check up. Chubbeso does care ever so much about all of their students.\u201d Dr. Young proclaimed as she led Kate to the check up room. \u201cMore like \u2018cares about not getting sued.\u2019\u201d Kate said sharply just under her breath, her foul mood seeping into her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few weeks Kate had turned to Dr. Young for some health and dieting guidanc,e and from those frequent visits a small bond had formed between the two. Kate with her love of science, particularly anatomy, found Dr. Young much more friendly and likable than the meanie who had humiliated her on weigh-in day. Kate, also welcomed the comfort of doctor patient confidentiality, finding Dr. Young a level headed and understanding adult she could talk to, although there were some days  Dr. Young got a little too inquisitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you managed to get here either way, I was worried that you had-er. Is everything all right?\u201d Dr. Young asked mid-waddle as she noticed the sluggish pace of the top heavy teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s just-I just-forgot my glasses because I woke up so late, and in case you didn\u2019t notice I\u2019m still in my pajamas.\u201d Kate answered in a rather sour tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh- well I\u2019m sure I could hook you up with some discount contacts if you want, we do have a vision test here and I could pull some strings so-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh that sounds great Dr. Young, but not today\u2026I\u2019d really just like to get back-\u201d Kate just managed to hold off from mentioning that her friends had spent another game night at her place, knowing that the sentence would start Dr. Young on a gossiping binge, and Kate was<i> definitely</i> not in the mood for chit-chat after such a rude awakening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate climbed her way onto the examination table and let Dr. Young begin testing her injured leg\u2019s reflexes. A quick pound of a rubber hammer sent a rippling effect up and down Kate\u2019s legs and thighs, but Kate\u2019s leg had responded with a healthy jerk, and few tests later Dr. Young asked Kate to step down and try her leg out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, a little more pressure on it, gently now. Wonderful! Now take some steps\u2026Brilliant! I\u2019d say your leg is good to go if you want to start exercising again!\u201d Dr. Young announced happily seeing that Kate\u2019s leg was back at full strength. Strangely, Kate herself didn\u2019t seem as excited as she should have been now that her leg had healed. \"Speaking of exercising, how\u2019s the dieting going?\u201d asked Dr. Young, leaning in closer to her plump patient. Dr. Young had seen a lot of herself in Kate, (and not just in the unbalanced, buxom, body shape they shared) Kate was a young, smart, girl with dreams, and while Dr. Young was upset Kate didn\u2019t exactly share the 'positivity towards pudginess' that she did, she admired Kate\u2019s resilience towards earning a trimmer waistline in a healthy manner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? My dieting? Uh, okay I guess\u201d Kate really didn\u2019t feel like talking, she wanted to go back and just tell C.J. off while she was still angry! But, maybe talking for a bit and letting herself cool down for a while would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJust <i>okay</i>? Not over doing things are we?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no of course not, in fact that might be part of the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Problem</i>? Kate, you\u2019ve haven\u2019t gained a thing since the last I saw you. What could be the problem?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m happy about that, but\u2026well\u2026C.J\u2019s not doing so well, he\u2019s getting kind of\u2026<b>husky</b>\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Dr. Young said, her plucked eyebrows flickering. \u201cTell me more\u201d and with that she eased back into her three wheeled doctor\u2019s chair, ready to enjoy off Kate\u2019s schooldays gossip, which in Dr. Young\u2019s opinion was far better than any of the soap operas or dramas she followed. Kate then went on to explain how she started feeling partly responsible for C.J\u2019s growing waistline, how she had been teaching him a new study strategy that grew his G.P.A along with his waistline, all of this along with their agreed once a week snack binges, and frequent X-S Mass bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he\u2019s looking a bit healthier he\u2019s still a growing boy.\u201d Dr. Young began. Kate looked unsatisfied with her answer.  \"What I mean is that...Kate your only 14 and C.J\u2019s just 15\u2026 All I\u2019m saying is that <i>both</i> of your bodies are still growing and changing and it can take a while till you find a weight your body\u2019s naturally comfortable with. I mean look at me, I didn\u2019t know what a comfortable weight was for me till I started here.\u201d Dr. Young had been rather underweight before joining the Chubbeso lifestyle four years ago, and from there on she surely had GROWN well accustomed to the plush life the academy offered. And while Dr. Young had never explicitly ordered any of her patients to gain more weight, she was more than a little biased towards the heavier side of the scale when it came to her idea of a healthy body size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate didn\u2019t nod or shake her head at this answer, only feeling slightly better now that she got some of her troubles off her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, I happen to think he looks a lot better now that he\u2019s how did you put it\u2026huskier. How about <i>you</i>~?\u201d  Dr. Young added with a catty grin, causing Kate's cheeks to burn bright red. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.y-you promise you won\u2019t tell?\u201d Kate asked curling up into herself as she did whenever she felt nervous, or anxious, or any combination of the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr.\u2019s honor.\u201d Dr. Young assured, knowing that she'd hit the nail right on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u201d Kate said quickly before following it up. \u201cI-I feel so guilty and weird that I want to get thinner but I actually don\u2019t mind that he\u2019s getting\u2026 (she had to swallow a bit before she could say the taboo word) fatter. Is it weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not at all! You like what you like.I happen to like my men hunky too if you know what I mean~.\u201d  Dr. Young said  as she bounced a single eyebrow provocatively. Kate couldn't help but crack a smile, and  Dr. Young was happy to see that the girl had brightened up. She decided to go on. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m also a certified Love Dr.\u201d she added, giggling from her chair. \u2018Want some advice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nodded studiously, forgetting that today had started out as one of her worst mornings ever.</span></div></div>",

It was probably an accident but I suppose you\u2019re understandably a little mad at him, right?\u201d Asked Dr. Young. Kate nodded again ready for soaking up any tips on love. She had just finished explaining the disaster of the morning she had been through and was ready to learn from the 'Love.DR.' \u201cOkay, so you <i>could </i> be angry with him the next time you see him, or you could mention that he owes you one.\u201d Explained the doctor, her tone that of a chef who was revealing one of his secret recipes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust say he owes you a favor or something, like a trip to the movies,or to the ice cream place at the plaza, something small like that. Just make sure he\u2019s doing it to make things up to you, and that your both going alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know...C.J\u2019s done so much to help me already...I don\u2019t know if I could\u2026\u201d Kate said shirking up into herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen he\u2019ll feel bad enough already, he\u2019d gladly take the first chance he can to make things up to you.\u201d Kate was amazed that the large doctor could sound so giddy, in fact she almost sounded like a school girl she was getting so bubbly. \u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026Then you dress up. I mean your absolute <u>best </u>outfit, understand? Something that will really wow him\u201d Kate\u2019s mind immediately traveled to the dress she had been modeling for Kat and her eyes lit up at the idea of it. This plan was certainly sounding better and better. Kate loved dressing up before she'd enrolled in the academy, but now thanks to the Academy's uniform policy there were so few chances to actually put something elegant on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Dr. Young as she hefted herself out of the chair and began swaggering around the room. \u201cso, date\u2026dress\u2026uh\u2026\u201d she had hit a roadblock. Sure she had watched enough drama shows on television that she could fantasize plenty of dates out in her mind, but she had never thought past the first two parts. \u201cUh, then you...You just wrap your arms around him in a big hug, and lean in close, and then whisper something cheeky in his ear even if it\u2019s something   just like \u2018I love you\u2019 and then see what he does\u201d The saucy idea sent both of them laughing once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Kate said finally. \"No way! I'd probably die of embarrassment!\u201d The idea wasn't all bad though, it <i>did</i> make for  the perfect excuse for a 'date' with CJ. But then again she'd have to think it over before she'd actually do something as bold and romantic as that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll think of something when the time is right I'm sure of it!\" said Dr. Young giving her a hopeful thumbs up. \"By the way Kate, I have a few more minutes left till my next patient is due, want me to walk you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that'd be great!\" Kate squeaked as she half stumbled into Dr.Young forming what could have quite possibly been Chubbeso's fleshiest 'breastiest' hug ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile way before Kate had even <i>reached </i>Dr. Young\u2019s office; you were still feeling miserable over this morning\u2019s events. While you were cleaning up your sleeping bag and beating yourself up for not waking up Kate, Rebecca was convincing you into some breakfast at Chubbeso plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if she\u2019s gonna be mad at us anyways, why let it be on an empty stomach right?\" Rebecca explained her early morning hunger pains urging her to get something eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d you only faintly struggle with the idea. There really wasn\u2019t any point of waiting here till Kate came back. If Abida hadn\u2019t shown up and taken Kate so quickly you probably would have went with Kate to hear the good news. But now\u2026now all you could do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon\u201d Rebecca said thumping you hard on the back. \u201cBunnies at the caf\u00e9 today. One of those Mocha-Frappa-iatto thingys is sure to pick you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...O-kay.\u201d you concede, still sounding rather glum to your big bummed chum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and maybe some pancakes, I'm craving pancakes or-\" continued Rebbecca as the two of you headed for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver breakfast at Chubbeso plaza\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm so sorry to have troubled you with my innocent worryings, Becca~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you've really gotta stop sending me on those guilt trips... even if they are fake.\" Becca grumbles with a smile, \"I think you've been spending too much time with her Holy Heifferness, she's starting to rub off on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, Claire's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, however, Rebbecca was actually referring to a much more different symptom than any sort of false melodrama that you would sling for entertainment and sarcastic purposes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca can't help but stare at how large you've become in such a short time. Last year, you barely packed on thirty-five pounds since enrollment. In your brief duration as a Sophomore, however, you'd nearly reached that amount of poundage already. Granted, she's become a much bigger girl than the merely chubby Freshman who intially walked onto the campus herself, but something about you didn't seem quite... right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lazier, and you tended to eat more. You barely mentioned working out and you were spending more and more time on couches at your friend's house than on your feet. And all this was swell and dandy, she did it herself. And at first it was fine, it gave her more opportunity to be with you over... well, no one considering all the women you seemed to hang out with were just as lazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were getting... dare she say it... <b>fat</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypocritical as it may sound to the currently two hundred and sixty some-odd ball of bootycentric blubber that Becca may be, she wasn't really attracted to fat guys. She was attracted to <i>you</i> yes, and always had been since that fateful day in first grade. But something about you gaining weight didn't really... sit well with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached for a roll, Becca acted on instinct and slapped your fuller hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you whimper, \"What was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Ceej!\" she barked playfully as she lifted up another roll to her lips, \"These are mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca swallows heartily, another large lump sliding down her throat as yet another doughy morsel meets its demise within the confines of Becca's ever-digesting gullet. She takes out another one and takes a large chunk out of it, \"Well too bad.\" she says after swallowing much easier this time, \"Too bad for you, anyway. You know I love bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you do.\" you admit weakly, \"You do love bread...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would never deny me anything that I <b>looooooove</b> now would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" you whimper as your round tummy begins to growl, \"Now who's starting to sound like Claire?\" you muttered that last part under your breath, lest you tick off a girl of Becca's generous size and proven hostility streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuzzat?\" she asked through a mouth full of dough<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin'.\" you whip, lips pursed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your meal arrives, shortly thereafter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, Rebecca relinquished the rolls leaving you to sample just one of the baked biscuits. Not long after that a waitress appeared complete with a silver cart with the first part of your breakfasts.  This was a hot and steaming platter of what was practically a Lincoln Log\u00a9 fort of bacon, and not just any bacon either; expertly seasoned, smoked, and fried, and featuring the perfect ratio of pork to fat, the wholesome bacon served here was beyond compare. The both of you snacked away on the arrangement, chatting on how classes were going, how it was getting slightly colder out now, and news around the school.  As the small talk went on you noted that you were in fact doing most of the talking today as Rebecca\u2019s mouth seemed to be busy ravenously working its way through breakfast, mowing through three pieces of bacon for every one you could get your hands on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress then returned with both of your main courses on cart. \u201cOne bacon and mushroom omelet, and one Shaunty\u2019s Saturday Special short stack.\u201d She announced as she removed the respective lids covering the plates. A small wave of warmth and steam washed over you, along with the smell of the cooked delights. Rebecca\u2019s six egg omelet looked to be cooked perfectly as did your own short stack. In fact \u2018short stack\u2019 was a bit of a misnomer, for this was a Chubbeso sized short stack; a five piece pile of plate sized blueberry pancakes (blueberries the \u2018dieters\u2019 alternative to chocolate chips in your view) all slathered with maple syrup, butter, and powdered sugar. Salivating you take fork and knife in hand, and were just about to bring cutlery to cakey goodness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Rebecca suddenly says, spotting you were about to glut yourself on the calorie laden creation.  \u201cUh, that looks<i> really</i> good, mind if I try a bit first?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Rebecca\u2026\u201d you say as you slide the plate over. Sharing had always been a welcomed part of eating out with friends, but that sort of thing never happened at the beginning of meals. Rebecca then began to saw through not one but all five pancakes on the plate, and a large cut at that! Certainly more like half your breakfast than just the \u2018bit\u2019 she\u2019d advertised. Sliding the preposterously large portion onto her already crowded plate, she then helped herself to a forkful of syrupy scrumptiousness.  Your eyes widened as you puzzled over how hungry could Rebecca possibly be today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca!\u201d you shout surprised at her pancake pilfering.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, trying to look innocent as one could with cheeks full of flapjacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s like half of my breakfast!\u201d you say pointing out what should have been quite obvious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oh it is not</i>\u2026\u201d she lied. Rebecca had knowingly taken a large piece of your pancakes, but only because she was such a good friend and trying to cut some calories out of your diet. And while any other time Rebecca would have proudly stated you were doing something that was irking  her, outright saying you were getting fat seemed a little mean. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll make it even...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">big baby</font>\u201d with a few more expert cuts with her fork and knife she placed a small sliver of golden yellow omelet back on to your plate. As she slid the plate back, you decided that rather than raise a fuss over how the trade was far from 'even', you'd just enjoy the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pancakes (or what was left of them) still tasted amazing; their melt in your mouth sensation, the syrup\u2019s sweet thick flavor, and the overall yummy factor of your meal, all combined into one incredible flavor experience.  Although you were unable to truly savor their flavor, as you were slightly bothered, thinking over what you would do next time you saw Kate, and what you had done to make Rebecca start stealing all your food.  Rebecca sensing the frazzled looks on your face, finally spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.J\u2026Look, I didn\u2019t want to say this but\u2026I think Kate\u2019s making you...soft.\u201d She accuses pointing a forkful of omelet in your direction before plopping it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoft?\u201d you ask you wipe a bit of syrup and golden griddled goodness from your small hint of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, aren\u2019t you being a little soft on her? \u2026You know, too easy?\u201d she continued hoping she could make her point without offending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...maybe.\u201d You admit.  \u201cReally when we started off I was just there to support her. But\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut?\u201d  Retorted the round rumped Rebbeca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026at first things were fine.\u201d You quickly explain.  \u201cBut then Claire showed up to be our coach, and then Kate hurt her leg, and then Mrs. Master\u2019s closed the gym\u2026and\u2026\u201d And there was something more, too complicated to detail at the moment. There was Kate\u2019s studying and snacking strategy, the tender moment when she had wrapped you in a tear stained hug, and the hardest thing of all to explain, how certain feelings between you and Kate were starting to grow. Somehow, after all that you had convinced yourself that putting on weight during a diet wasn\u2019t such a bad thing, if it meant Kate was losing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d Rebecca says leaning in closer to regain your attention while cautiously remembering from to not put too much weight on the table as Claire had before. \u201cIf you keep this up do you think you\u2019ll be able to outrun the fan club?  I think you really owe it to Kate to take things more seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you on the ropes now. Now that you were seriously aware of your poundage predicament you felt a little torn. Sure, the pounds had been a bit of a\u2026surprise, but your grades had gone up. Really, you were ambivalent to how big you were becoming, but Rebecca sure made a strong case for getting back to working out. Kate\u2019s injured leg had been one of the real reason you\u2019d stopped jogging, so maybe\u2026maybe if Kate was okay to start exercising again today, you could turn things around. But it was true; Kate really wasn\u2019t the strictest of coaches, well maybe on herself, but when it came to enforcing rules on others Kate was as Rebecca put it\u2026<b>soft</b>. Yup, Rebbecca certainly knew just the way to put things, always ready to tell it like is and get strait to business...IN FACT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d you begin, spouting your idea as fast as soon as you thought of it\u2026 \u201cCould you help Rebecca?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sudden offer Rebecca swallowed her mouthful of half chewed omelet, hard, so hard in fact she\u2019d almost begun to choke. Thankfully a few swigs from her tall sugarywhat'sitcalled helped clear the way for her a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa\u2026well\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d She stammered, suddenly finding the already half empty plate in front her more interesting that you for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut you\u2019d be a better coach than Claire!\u201d you insist. \u201cAnd you had to have done tons of practice training from softball\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ, that was back in middle school, I don\u2019t even know how much I remember from softball training\u2026\u201d Rebecca chewed the idea over as she chewed over another piece of bacon. If she did agree to help coach you, <i>she </i> specifically wouldn\u2019t be the one dieting and exercising, plus it would be an easy way to keep an eye on your hopefully shrinking waistline, and another eye on how \"close\" things were getting between you and Kate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019ll give it a shot!\u201d she concedes with a shrug of her plump shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but just to try it out for a bit, no yearlong membership guarantees at club Becca.  And remember; a good coach has to be strict sometimes, so no whining either!\u201d She says already asserting herself with a commanding tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod approvingly, feeling a sense of strictness is what you needed. This new deal seemed to invigorate Rebecca as she finished her breakfast, including what was practically most of yours, with an even quicker pace. You too found yourself regaining your appetite, even after this morning\u2019s incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rebecca\u2019s hands had moved from holding a fork and a knife and switched to massaging the stomach that they had just been continuously feeding. It had rounded out, distended further and tightening, as it had been filled to the brim from within, and the pokes and prods from her hands helped ease the ache. In fact if you hadn't known any better you would have thought she was practically playing with it right in front of you. Shaking it and wobbling this way and that, bouncing it between her hands this way and that in almost hypnotizing fashion. Finally, she seemed to forgo formalities all together and let her stomach surge free from under her shirts constraints. Smooth, stretchmarks-less skin came gushing forth, and Rebbeca's chubby fingers seem interested in learning every new inch of the wide world they walked upon. It finally took your own stomach to eventually break your gaze away from the sight. It gurgled and moaned for perhaps just a bit more food, but you today's pep talk had reset your own resolve. Rebecca gave a big  sigh, inflating her gut to full \"spare tire\" size before asking. \"So\u2026when do we start\u2026Today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe not right now.\u201d You plead, knowing that exercising right after eating did not sit well in your case.  \u201cCan we at least see how Kate feels first?\u201d You ask quickly avoiding anything to do with exercise after such a pleasing meal. \u201cI still feel bad about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right...Oomph\u201d Rebecca begins carefully sliding her booty out of the booth. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you didn\u2019t screw things up too bad.\u201d She jokes as she offers you a helping hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBECA!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u2026I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo off you both trod, unsure just how you would find Kate when you returned to her dorm room.  When you arrive\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ohhhh...I think I ate too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the rumbling of your own doughy tummy, you couldn't help but agree with her. Becca, only calling her that because 'Chick who Stole my Breakfast' was a bit more of a mouthful than what you had gotten to eat at breakfast, had almost eaten herself sick on what was to be your morning nourishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, usually soft and rather malleable as far as stomachs go, had been stuffed to the very brim of comfort with all of her own as well as a good portion of your delicious breakfast food as it expanded inside of her. Becca's belly swelled outwards, singing a sweet song of digestion as the contents sloshed back and forth beneath the skin of the dome like structure. Rock hard and taut, her massive middle swayed back and forth with her every step as she fought gravity and her own lacking willpower to stay upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say you did.\" you grumble as your stomach growls some more, \"I mean, I know you're trying to help, but you could have left me at least a little bit more of <b>my own food</b> than you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... not now, CJ!\" she whimpers as her stomach goes through a rather heavy Food Baby contraction, \"My stomach really hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you ate all my food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the elevator dinged softly upon your arrival at Kate's door. The cold metal doors of the modest complext slowly slid open, graciously allowing the two of you exit of the confiningly cramped carrier. You take a brave step forward, your shoes brushing against the carpeting of Kate's hallway as you graciously act as doorman for the stallwart Becca; however your bulgy middle takes up a little more of the way provided than Becca would have liked. \"You coming?\" you ask in your halfhearted gruff, finding it rather hard to stay truly mad at Rebecca Maglen for anything, especially when she really had your best intentions at her clogged little heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo... I really don't feel like getting yelled at by Kate\" she whimpered as her stomach groaned audibly, \"I think I'm gonna go... sleep this off or something. Lemme know how it goes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words sounded so strange, especially coming from her own mouth. They were flat and uncaring, not a trace of her usual meekness within earshot. So bold and powerful, enough to send you away without so much as a second thought... She had to admit, she rather liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Kate felt terrible at being so mean to you, especially through the doorway like that. She had always been a really good friend to you in the past, and not only because of her so <i>expertly</i> hidden feelings for you either. You were always so sweet to her, you looked out for her, and you were always there for her when she needed it. The whole act seemed a little strange in retrospect, but she just told herself that it was for the best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself as she pictured your face when she finally did it... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">asked you out!!!</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stifled as squeal by smothering her chubby cheeks with a pillow- she was so excited! Just the thought of working up the nerve to go out on an <i>actual</i> date with you was making her so giddy! Unable to contain herself, she plopped her rather heavy body onto her full bed, which made an audible creak of disapproval... diet or not, she was still quite the plumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that really didn't matter right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace still covered, she kicked her thick legs back and forth at a rapid pace as she continued her shrill cries of joy directly into either the poor cushion's face or back. She squeezed it against herself (finding that rather difficult due to her large hooters) one more good time before rising with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Katie, calm down.\" she told herself, unable to wipe that stupid grin off of her face, \"You've got to get ready. Sunday's the last chance you get before school, and he needs to feel guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowingly, she'd have slipped up at some point during the week. If this plan was to work, you had to remain completely in the dark regarding forgiveness. You had to be undoubtedly guildy, without a trace of redemption, so she could be the super-cool best friend and swoop in with this... this... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">date!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she was so excited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, she had to do some planning. She was going to follow Nurse Young's advice more or less to a tee. After all, Kate could only assume that a pretty woman like her had gone on plenty of dates before, she was so certain that she knew what Kate should do after all! And that meant that she needed something excellent to wear, something to really make you fall head over heels! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had just the girl in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come... on... <i>fit!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was currently experiencing her own difficulties with wardrobe at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a fashionable young woman of today's age, Kat Anderson was always one to have a multitude of clothes that were currently \"in\" style, as well as a plethora more that had faded out of mainstream fashion but were still rather wearable. The problem was that, out of all styles colors and brands, nothing fit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in her own bed, she lay face up and stressed as she attempted to bring the button into the appropriate hole of her black skinny jeans. Her arm muscles, made rather strong from rolling fabric and working with difficult models, proved useless against the laws of physics. Her hips were just too darn big to squeeze into these jeans. She let out a deep exhale, allowing her appearingly slender middle to pooch back out into the little potbelly it had become. It forced her top to ride up as it lost the battle of the bulge with Kat's soft, pale middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of this extra stress on poor Kitty-Kat, the sound of her electronica ringtone almost brought her to throwing her phone out the window. Thankfully she refrained and leaned onto her softer side, noticing that the biscuit dough that resided on her middle bunched over too, forming a small roll where the blubber met the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?!\" she growled into the speaker<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod her head as Kate's request filled the earpiece, listening intently to her plea. Her instincts as a designer kicking in, she smiled (causing the faintest of dimples to appear on her somewhat rounder cheeks) and giggled a bit as the plan was explained to her. She already had a basic dress in mind, though Kate was too big for it then. However now that she had let it out just a bit, the poor busty girl might not suffocate in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, sure.\" she said as she played with one long strand of black hair, \"Something saucy, I get'chu. Ceej isn't gonna know what hit him. I'll get down to the art room on campus and grab what I've already got. Security knows me, y'know. And I'll bring it back to my place. Come pick it up before curfew, I've just got a few things I've gotta do to it, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she hung up with the biggest smile on her face, grunting slightly as she rose to her feet. Then her line of sight traveled to her inflated middle as it rose out and about from underneath her shirt. She grumbled before an idea hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the jeans, got a safety pin, and forced them uncomfortably together. Then an old pink-and-black flannel shirt, one from an old boyfriend pre-Chubbeso, and slid it over herself. Undoing the neck and making it wide enough for her breasts to fit through, she tied the two sleeves around and in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon checking herself out in the mirror, she was more than satisfied.... but only because you couldn't see her stomach that well. Colon backslash...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sniffled, heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was being awfully mean today, though you couldn't really blame her. If you had been holed up in your apartment for the last month or so, were really looking forward to getting back on your feet to exercise, and <i>your</i> best friend had failed to wake you up, forcing you to head down to the nurse's office blind and in your pajamas, you didn't really know how you'd feel either. But you'd never heard her yell at you like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you'd never heard her yell <b>period</b>. It was more than a little terrifying to know that you had somehow managed to tick off the usually meek and demure Kate into actually yelling at you through a door; not to mention the aforementioned heartbreaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always so sweet, and so nice... and she smelled so good and gave the best hugs. You really, really didn't want to upset her that much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Becca?\" you whimpered as you knocked on your other female companion's doorstep, \"C-Can I come in? Kate was really snippy... I think she's still pretty upset. Becca?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling came much more naturally to Rebecca Maglen than it did to her more reserved counterpart. It was painless, got the point across, and honestly really did a lot more good than just dancing around the subject with adorable little stutterings like \"N-No, I-I don't think so CJ...\". Cute, but not really effective when she really just wasn't in the mood to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was definitely one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca had actually planned on \"sleeping things off\" when she walked into her flat not but twenty ago (you had taken the stairs for some thinking time, and in hopes of burning some calories). She waddled in, still cradeling her swollen stomach, and plopped herself uselessly on ther couch like it was Nobody's business. And as she lay there, taking up the entire loveseat with her bodaciously bulging body, she couldn't help but feel a little cold. It was Februrary, so why shouldn't she have been in just a t-shirt and some sweats?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since she had missed her bathtime last night, there was only one remedy that would satisfy both the need to be warm and the need to indulge her secret watery passion. So despite her uncomfortably taut middle, Becca decided to heave her flabby self up off of the couch, head into the bathroom, strip, and start running the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slid down into the still-cold porcelain, she couldn't help but notice some extreme difficulty getting settled in. As she sat down, forcing her rather large bottom down to the bottom of the tub, she noted with some desperation that she couldn't quite get back up to resituate herself. Panicking, she twisted and turned from within the tub, only to find that the extra fifteen pounds or so she'd gained over the last few weeks had effectively wedged her into her paradise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water pooled at her feet, thick legs effectively clogging the gateway to the rest of the tub, was when you began knocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than let you catch her in a compromising situation such as the one she currently found herself in, Becca decided to simply play it cool and come off as a total dirty word- if just to get you off of her case for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached over her own bulk for her phone, left by the tub. Unfortunately for her, Becca was well aware that she would soon outgrow her sinful paradise if her butt got any bigger... it really was a small tub. That meant that only one girl on campus had the authority to fix this little problem of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho!!\" first came the haughty laughter, as it was routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came several condescending remarks about how much greater she was than Becca, and how if she had been bathing in <i>her</i> tub at the Mansion, she would have never gotten stuck because \"those with generous wallets and generous girths <i>never</i> must deal with the problems of those with skinny wallets but overgrown posteriors.\" She was getting really good at picking Rebecca's brain. The thesaurus her mother had bought her had really helped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho, just another hobby of Claire Masters; cultivated and groomed like so much the pampered princess she was in every way. Picking on those who should know better than to get in the way of her romance with the oh-so-claimed CJ Dalton had to be punished somehow, and since Becca was certainly more brutish than she, Claire had deemed getting her beautiful face punched in not worth her time of the far-too long day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed as she clicked the pretty pink phone together softly, as if exhausted from the simple act of consorting with the lower class. Becca was always such a bother, having the nerve to call her such rude names <i>and then</i> requiem for her assistance. Of course she would get her help, but Claire would ultimately chalk this up to the scoreboard of the many ways why she was better than Rebecca Maglen- and ultimately the more suitable mate for you between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, if she didn't get her out, the poor girl would starve; and that isn't a fate that Claire would wish on anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abida!\" she hollered from her daybed, reclining lazily and allowing every inch of her accumulatory girth to hang whichever way it pleased, \"Be a lamb and get me the rest of that chocolate cake that Gretchen was making?\" She smirked to herself, popping a nearby chocolate into her mouth as she relished in her own affluence. Life was so good to her, and her body so very well reflected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the girths of Rebecca and Kate, wondering just how such underpriviliged girls had managed to work themselves up to such a high weight upon enrollment. And that Sighsoftly girl, well, woman now she supposed, was just another American. How could they have truly enjoyed a body such as hers? So round, so soft, so much like her warm comfortable bed or a big fluffy cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands traveled downwards, rubbing her big creamy stomach as it jutted from underneath her pajamas. The pale purple ensemble had long failed to accomodate her growing body for quite some time, but she rather liked the fabric. The way her body bulged from it was also quite enjoyable, at least to Claire. It allowed her, or anyone else for that matter, to massage her all the easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, taken aback by her own plush touch as a cold hand dutifully brought her her plate of confectionary chocolate cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHans and Gretel, she believed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This blows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone now, wandering about Lethargis town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow quaint, except it seemed that everyone around you had friends that they were doing something with. And you, throughout these mysterious circumstances, had found yourself alone. Not but an hour ago you at least had Becca to talk to- if only for her to bug you about how fat you were getting....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think, last night everything seemed to perfect...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More unmotivated then lost, you wander about Lethargis town simply because it was better than remaining in your room. The cold bristles that were the winter winds of England had blasted you enough to eventually force you into the warmth of the Crownedge mall, although you had not really planned on purchasing anything today. As you mope your way through the large mall, you\u2019re in a very sour mood and weren\u2019t exactly taking in your surroundings.  In the ultimate act of teenager ennui you go to shove your hands in your pants pockets, except\u2026except they wouldn\u2019t fit. Not checking if it was because your chubby hands would no longer fit the pockets or your bulging stomach had taken what little space was left in the last pair of jeans that fit, you grit your teeth and head into the nearest clothing store, So 21 Clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeandering about the clothing racks a stern frown cemented on your face, you passively glance through a rack of husky sized jeans.  A fire of emotions was burning through your mind and you really didn\u2019t feel like sorting through them all, so to distract yourself, you set yourself on not leaving the store till you have a new pair of pants that fit. Taking a pair off the rack you march yourself into the nearest dressing room, but in your irritated sate you fail to noticed this was the Women\u2019s dressing room section. (Store layouts can be so confusing sometimes.) Into one of the numerous numbered dressing rooms you go, quickly undressing and easing into the new jeans. They fit\u2026okay. You\u2019re at least happy to have a pair of jeans you could actually get the button to button, and your waistline appreciates the relaxed fit the jeans offer, but you decide to take a look into the three sided mirror outside before making your purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave your private room you freeze, not only were the three mirrors currently in use, but they were in use by a girl, and not just any girl but the stunning Delphine Shuzumiya. Apparently she was in need of some new clothes too, well underclothes at least, as she was busily studying her reflection in nothing but a pair of white bra and panties. Her reflection in the full length glass mirrors startled you initially. Was that really her? You gaze entranced, as she did a half turn and thrust her hips towards the unfamiliar reflection. She then ran her hand curiously over her bubble of a tummy, a stomach that could be classified as chubby, but not enough to roll over her panties waistline. In that silent moment your eyes widen to take in the form of the foreign girl amazed that she had somehow kept this warm body hidden from  public view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no coatings of clothing to conceal it, it was easy to tell Delphine\u2019s body had gained a much rounder and softer center.  From the reflection of her front her stomach had started to swell as it had begun taking up some space, and from behind, you could tell her hips had slightly stretched out, almost in anticipating of more weight to come. Not only that, but her bon-bon\u2019s had done some more budding as well. One of the few things Delphine found she could not hide at school, even with a jacket over her school uniform, her body had  decided her boobs weren't big enough already and that it was time for them to start growing again. Now, this wasn't <i>too </i>much of an issue for her, but as her breasts had gotten bigger, her bras had gotten bulkier and more uncomfortable, less stylish and increasingly industrial in design. She looked down at her chest guiltily and softly cupped the bra; thankfully she had now found a pair that didn\u2019t pinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, she was from the puffing up you and Kate had experienced, but she did in fact look a lot heavier as the difference between her thin figure and her new one, magnified the Parisian\u2019s plumping. A marvel of genetics the blonde had the proportional measurements of any model (albeit one with the start of a tummy), and the weight she had gained seemed to only accentuate her womanly hourglass figure.  You\u2019re slightly shocked at the sight as you had assumed that ever positive Parisian\u2019s diet had been going reasonably well but perhaps her weight gain rather than the weather was why she had begun sporting a new line of layered clothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-C.J.?\u201d she suddenly squeaks spotting a familiar shape in the mirrors reflection. Cheeks reddening you pray she hadn\u2019t seen you before you darted back to your dressing room, but her voice speaks to the contrary. \u201c<i>Ca alors</i>!\u201d shouts the calorie crunching Chubbeso student. In your room you can hear a door close as she retreats back into her dressing room. Unbelievably, you had somehow accidentally pissed off someone for the third time today; so you pray that Delphine would hopefully ignore you and leave rather than press charges. There was a shifting of fabric, a zip of a zipper and the sound of a door opening. Your prayers appeared to be answered as she sounded like she was on her way out, but this was not to be the case as she spoke up once again, still sounding confused but a bit more calm.\u201cC..J?\u201d she asks her voice bouncing off the other (fortunately empty) dressing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSorry! I\u2019m sorry! Delphine I-I didn\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019ll just stay in here and\u2026die of embarrassment, while you leave\u2026\u201d you quickly apologize and explain your voice cracking and adding to the awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNon, non it is bien\u201d she insists although her voice sounds strangely a bit sad.  \u201cI am feeling rather culpable myself\u2026shall we have a <i>t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping out into the main dressing room you felt like quite the creep. \u201cHa-ha they really should label these dressing rooms better. I wa-was just trying on some pants and\u2026\u201d You let a hand sweep to your thigh and emphasis the tag on your pants supporting the case that you were honestly here to buy clothes and not to do any spying on girls who were <i>au natural</i> in the dressing room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Delphine had gotten dressed rather quickly, even finding time to tuck her long blonde hair into a stereotypical French red beret letting it cascade out the back like some sort of waterfall made of wheat. Her fashion sense outside of school seemed unaffected by the weight gain and she had dressed herself in the latest in French haute couture. Today she wore a striped tunic that cut just a the swell of her shoulders, and as your eyes traveled lower you take in a low v-cut design the reveals her healthy cleavage and perfect pastel skin. Her top didn\u2019t cling to her breasts as much as they sagged the fabric downward under their immense weight but the rest of the ensemble was baggy; it was loose around her arms, with a flowing and shapeless hem, shapeless apart from for the tented fabric that her stomach stubbornly strained against. In one hand she carried only a blue, heavy looking pea coat which she kept close by in case she needed an extra layer to \u2018hide\u2019 herself in it at a moment\u2019s notice. The sight brings the first smile to your face in hours, as you were happy to know you weren\u2019t the only one whose diet wasn\u2019t going as intended.  (Sure it was schadenfreude but what the heck; you had been in a lousy rut of a mood.) Again it wasn\u2019t that the bit of weight didn\u2019t look good on her either, it was just nice to know that someone was having the same problem that you and Kate were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt seems we are both in need of some support.\u201d She says her tone unaware of her underwear based pun.  She turned her head downwards slightly discouraged before continuing. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. I am eating a lot of chef bunnies\u2019 delicious healthy food, I find time to exercise with mes amis, I am even eating more energy bars and yet..\" She brought her hands to either side of the stomach. \"Oh, I love cooking club so much, but I really hope that it's not why my belly has become quite the <i>brioche</i>\u2026\u201d Then, much like Rebecca did earlier, only on a smaller scale; Delphine pinched the paunch in front of her and gave it the tiniest bit of a shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...actually that\u2019s kinda why I\u2019m here too. I guess I\u2019ve been becoming a bit of a..\u2018cr\u00e8me puff.\u2019\u201d You admit, simply glad that you had someone to talk to and wasn\u2019t mad with you at the moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine giggles at your analogy, instantly brightening her mood and seemingly the entire room. \u201cI see. But a cr\u00e8me puff is better than a \u2018slug\u2019 <i>non</i>? I guess we both just have to have to work a little harder right?\u201d Ever the optimist she ends the last sentence by pounding her fist into her open palm resolutely. Her eyes then dart about you, and were about to blush from the attractive girls attention until she spoke up once more.  \u201cOh \u2026It is not often I see you alone. Where is your clique?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d and you out of nervousness you do a double take behind you. \u201cOh right. It\u2019s\u2026nothing\u2026\u201d you blurt out, the sensitive subject now making things twice as hard to talk to the French fox in front of you. \u201cI, messed up, and now Kate, and Rebecca I guess, are mad at me\u2026So I\u2019m just here\u2026by myself\u2026\u201d you confess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She says dismally at first, then \u201cOh!\u201d in a much brighter tone. \u201cThen this must be fate C.J that we meet like this! If you are not busy, then perhaps now we could finally \u201dhang out\u201d together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d you agree right away, your mood skyrocketing to unbelievable high levels in an incredible turnabout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow exactly do you and Delphine plan to spend the afternoon?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now usually the idea of an afternoon of clothes shopping was towards the bottom on the \u201cThings you enjoyed to do list\u201d but, shopping with Delphine you had no time to be bored.  For one thing, even with all of her new found pounds, Delphine\u2019s long legs and even longer strides meant you were playing catch up with her all across the mall; she\u2019d dart into one store, try on a few clothes, buy what she liked, and be right on her way to the next one, and with you courteously carrying her increasingly heavier bags of clothes, the experience was practically a workout itself.  Not that the exercise was the only thing that had gotten your blood pumping\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSava?\u201d asked Delphine cocking her head to the side as she modeled this latest outfit <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">for you. </span>\u201cS<i>aaa</i>v<i>aaa</i>!\u201d You nod back giving an appreciative thumbs up. You had no problem watching this would be model, try on a wide selection of clothes, and Delphine certainly didn\u2019t mind the stares she was gaining from you. It had become a sort of silent mutual agreement between the two of you, Delphine never explicitly asking you to watch her as she modeled in the dressing room, but never actually barring you from entrance. Of course she never wore anything as risqu\u00e9 as before, but if you were to use a single word to describe her new attire it would be\u2026clingy. Really the Frenchy was a bit of a fashonista seemingly able to pull off a variety of outfits while maintaining a casual precocious air about her. Plainly put, even with her new pounds Delphine really knew how to show off her stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was after either the six or seventh store that your stomach gave a gurgling lurch reminding you of your inadequate breakfast. A second set of gurgling comes immediately after and this one was strong enough to double you over in pain for a brief second. This was enough to draw Delphine\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, you are famished!\u201d she says gliding her way to you.  \u201cAnd here am I without any of those bars\u2026I know! Why don\u2019t we get something to eat? I have just the place\u2026\u201d  Delphine takes you by the hand and, rather than taking the load of the bags from you, she tugs your hand with surprising strength. Forcing yourself to rise to once more keep pace with the fast French female, you barely have the breath to point out she was headed in the wrong direction. \u201cI think the food court is that way\u2026\u201d you say back at even pace with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! I know a place that is<i> tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cial</i>!\u201d  She insists. It was only after you had left the mall that you realized where this motivated mademoiselle was taking you: Shaunty\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Welcome to Shaunty\u2019s\u2026\u201d A certain pink haired chef began cheerily enough, but the cheery look on her face seemed to instantly disappear as she looked at her two latest patrons.  You apparently had returned to her restaurant for lunch\u2026only this time with Delphine practically crawling all over your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllo\u2019 Madame Bunnie. How are you this fine afternoon?\u201d Delphine asks practically skipping to an open table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Pheneie how are you?\u201d Bunnie answers in her usual positive tone. Then in a switch from sweet to sour and barely above a whisper; \u201cand nice to see you again\u2026Romeo\u2026\u201d her words as icy as unthawed leftovers.  Gently you take your seat, now no longer sharing Delphine\u2019s energetic attitude. Mercifully, it appeared Bunnie would not be taking your orders for lunch. Breathing a sigh of relief Delphine chirps up from the other side of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know just what to get.\u201d She says laying a finger directly on one of the specials of the day. \u201cThe Roast beef sandwich with Au Jus sauce on the side.\u201d<br>\r\nYou peer over her finger to better read what she had her finger on. \u201cYou mean the French dip? Isn\u2019t that a foot long?\u201d\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOui\u2026\u201d she says, fully insinuating she could handle the generously proportioned meal on her own. \u201cOr...er...Would you like to split it with me?\u201d Having second thoughts about scarfing an entire sub-sandwich by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Sure!\u201d a hot sandwich really sounded good right now, and it was a lot easier than picking one of the various choices on Shaunty\u2019s large menu. Soon the order was placed and the two of you are left to wait and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Kate and Rebecca they are\u2026not so well?\u201d asks Delphine the slightest of frowns forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I kind of messed something up with Kate...and I guess I must have pissed off Rebecca somehow\u2026\u201d (And you supposed Bunnie too but you didn\u2019t mention that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, too bad\u2026Well, I have some exercises planned for the afternoon, it\u2019s not jogging but I\u2019m sure Chris and Suzu wouldn\u2019t mind if you came.\u201d Delphine\u2019s voice more than hinted that she\u2019d be more than a little happy if you joined her for an exercise excursion. Even if you couldn\u2019t hear how much she\u2019d like you to come in her voice her irresistible pouty lips made sure to get the point across. While the idea of seeing Delphine work herself into a French twist was exciting to say the least, the thought of more working out didn\u2019t really sit with you.\u201cThanks, but no thanks Delphine, I think I\u2019m just going to eat and head home for the rest of the day.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I see\u2026\u201d says Delphine looking a bit downtrodden now that you wouldn\u2019t be joining her.  \u201cWell, maybe I can show you some of what I learned at cooking club sometime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great!\u201d It would be nice to see how much Delphine could have already picked up from Bunnie\u2019s after school cooking club. Speaking of (sand)which. Out from the kitchen rolls a silver cart with a single sterling silver dome resting on top. As it\u2019s wheeled to your table you realize Bunnie is in fact the one wheeling out the steaming hot foot long to your table.  As she rolls closer you can get a better look at this beautifully toasted Roast Beef Sandwich, with its inches of stacked pink roast beef dripping in secret Au Jus sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie began to makes small talk with you as she prepares your plates, \u201cOh, by the way C.J., how are Kate and Rebecca?\u201d she asks in a coy totally nonchalant way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! CJ says that they are feeling\u2026how you say\u2026Not so good for the day.\u201d Delphine explains, blissfully unaware that you had seen Bunnie just a few hours earlier, with a completely healthy looking Rebbecca in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>he did</i>?\u201d Bunnie volleys back, now no longer able to keep up her jolly attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! So it is just us splitting lunch for today.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026How Nice (<b>Kchung</b>)!\u201d says Bunnie bringing an absurdly long knife down to cut the foot long in half. The act is quite loud and yet very swift, almost as if she were reminding you that the as a chef she clearly knew how to handle a knife. Then she casts a heated stare down at you, one that said: \u201cYou just better watch yourself Mister Romeo; I\u2019ve got my eyes on you.\u201d It sent a shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, <i>Bon App\u00e9tit</i> you two\u201d Bunnie says, before squinting her angry eyes  with a large grin. With that she was off, pushing the cart before you could even begin to explain your apparent double date dealings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine meanwhile stared down the six inches of meat and bread before her like it was a sort of challenge. Then, she attacked, neatly enveloping a good portion of the meal with her lips before making a large clean bite. An onset of \u2018MMMs\u2019 begins to issue from somewhere on her side of the table. You too bite into your warm sandwich and it\u2019s exactly what you needed. Good, warm, wholesome food. Soon you were off lost in the flavorful juices of the hot dish\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, like all good things, the sandwich had come to its end, and now you and Delphine both shared a look of satisfaction. One walk to Delphine\u2019s dorm (clothing bags included,) and an au revoir later you arrive back at your room, feeling a bit better than you had earlier. Really, it was nice to know that you had other friends at the Academy, besides your usual group of best buds. And there was some solace in the fact that even if both Becca and Kate (and apparently to a degree Bunnie ) were a little peeved at your for the moment, you still had a few other friends to talk to. The rest of your night is quite uneventful turning into a blas\u00e9 mix of internet, TV, and eventually homework. Nearing midnight you find yourself crawling into your bed, with the only thought on your mind of how you could make up for this morning\u2019s mistake with Kate\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the next morning you awake to the sound of your cell phone buzzing. Bleary eyed you fumble for the phone and see that it\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now please, can I come in? It's freezing in this hallway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay\" you murmur before hanging up. Consciously deciding Becca could stand a few more seconds in the hallway you slowly lumber out of bed and out of your pajamas. Putting on an regular t-shirt and a pair of sweat pants you finally open the door for Rebbecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Rebbecca tilting her head upwards in relief as she entered your well heated flat. Rebbecca seemed to share the same idea as you were wardrobe wise, filling out the confines of her own Chubbeso emblazoned hoodie and sweatpants combo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just woke up huh?\" she said turning accusingly to you. \"Too bad Coach Maglen doesn't take excuses. You asked me for help with your exercising and you're gonna get it. Ooof.\" she grunted as she moved a chair, starting to clear some space in the center of your living room. \"Come on over...grrr...and help me move this table.\" she asks her front fat folding over itself as she slightly squatted. Walking over, you help her lift the long table a few feet, that's when you notice something or specifically someone was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...um where's Kate?\" you ask your mind noting the missing space that was currently not being filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only got her answering machine, so I guess she still a little moody and I really didn't want to bother her\" she says turning her face downcast for just a bit. \"But just for today! Next time I fully expect both of you to be ready for some fitness.\" she says perking herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but why at my place?\" you ask still frazzled from this early morning ruckus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because the gym is closed and my place is...being fumigated.\" sounding to you as if that really wasn't the case at all. It wasn't the case at all. The truth was <i>much </i>more embarrassing. Currently Rebbecca's bathroom (well her special custom bathtub specifically) was having a bit of re-widening done by two members of the Chubbeso's maintenance crew, and that was definitely enough of an excuse for her to show up at your place. Fortunately you didn't seem to be pressing the issue. Instead, you were instinctively heading for your stock pile of Mass-Ex bars ready to devour two or three in place of breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you picked one up and began eying it hungrily a separate hand snatches it right from in front of your smacking lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be taking that.\" Rebbecca says tearing into the bar. \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Mmm</font> blueberry\" she moaned lightly, leaving a blue smudge around her lips. In between mouthfuls she explained her greedy action, \"I know you like these but you've got to think even leaner. *Smack smack gulp* You can have your regular meals, but I'm limiting you to one of these a day, understand? You can have one after a nice long workout, but any other time I catch you with one I'm taking it from you got it mister?\" she finished just as she finished the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first this seemed mighty unfair, but thinking about it you were the one that had asked for an instructor that wasn't so soft. A bar a day seemed like a fair compromise between starving and splurging yourself, and now that you had passed the big 200lb mark you were evermore committed to losing some weight. \"Yes Coach Maglen!\" you say in a militaristic tone straightening your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I want to hear! Now why don't we starts with some stretches?\" she asked  ushering you to the new open space of the living room. Even if she wasn't playing softball Rebbecca had continued taking a couple of yoga classes during her days here at the academy to at least keep her limbs limber. Much like her yoga class instructor, Rebbecca stood on the soft carpet at the front of the room facing you in order to keep an eye on your form, (and to make sure you were hopefully keeping an eye on her form as well.)<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Okay let's start with Sun salutations.\" Carefully Rebbecca slowly began to raise her arms up high over her head, shrugging her shoulders so much so that her tight hoodie began to rise a bit over her stomach. This gave you a full on perfect view of  Rebbeca's round full stomach. She certainly didn't seem to mind that her belly-button had been revealed, so you wisely decided to not to mention it. With a sound of a few joint popping into place you managed to mirror the rejuvenating pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Downward facing dog...\" Rebbeca announced a few more poses later. A killer grin flashed on her face as she slowly bent over into a incline toe-touch. Bending over and giving you a full view of her rotund rump, she knew you were doing more...inspecting than stretching right now, and she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca's portly posterior seemed to be straining the pants to their threadbare, the pose she was holding seemed to be doubling the 3D effect each of her cheeks were already having on the Cubbeso logo.  Watching her stretch, you noticed it was getting harder...er...harder to perform these odd poses. Quickly snapping back to stretching you found it a lot harder to bend over your own belly than you remembered and by the time the last bit of Yoga was over you were already a bit out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebbecca meanwhile was as virile as ever, in fact she was really getting slightly turned on by the sight of watching you sweat. \"Alright now, how about 30 situps?\" she announced standing up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...30?\" is all you can incredulously get out between breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,you heard me.\" she says her voice treading the line of commanding and just plain bossy. She waddled closer to you now, her strong thunder thighs and bountiful booty wobbling all the way, ready to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">lock</span> cuddle you in place as you did some situps. Before you both assumed your positions...you couldn't help but notice a sweet scent that seemed to be quickly masking your own b.o. and deodorant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becca...Do you smell something...Lilac?\" you guess at the mystery scent in between whiffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I-It's probably just from the fumigators. Enough talking, I wanna see you sweat!\" </span></div></div>",

The only source of illumination comes from the high windows, the Sun fades in and out of the foggy English weather. A myriad of special projects litters the room, coming in all shapes and sizes. Paintings, sculptures, some furniture even is scattered in this arena of conflicting creativism. More importantly though, is the lone mannequin covered by an unflattering blue tarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly the door opens, filling the room with the ominous creak of well-worn hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again for doing this for me, Kat.\u201d Came a sincere voice, \u201cI swear I\u2019ll find some way to make it up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA form enters the room belonging to that of Kate Granden, a girl far more suited to the library than this palace of blatant expressionism. She has dressed down in anticipation of this evening, high hopes of gussying up clearly shown by the unusual twinkle in her eyes. The corpulent kuudere may as well have been in her pajamas, stuffed into sweatpants and a plain black tank\u2014her pudgy arms puffing out like stuffed sausages. Her face was round with joy and in shape, a warm smile permanently plastered between her appled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Kate.\u201d A voice trailed from behind her, \u201cYou\u2019ll just owe me one. Worse comes to worst, I\u2019ll just ask you for a tittie transfer one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering immediately after her client was Kat Anderson, fabulous fashionista soon-to-be. She fit in her much better than Kate, owing to her indulged creativity and keen sense of fashion. She dressed with simple flair as well, though only out of necessity. One never wore their best outfit to the Shop, after all\u2026 even if said outfit didn\u2019t exactly \u201cfit\u201d these days. On something of a plaid-kick, her overshirt was buttoned up to her yet-to-blossom breasts and rolled up on her sleeves. Her nails had been taken off and her clothes were a little ratty\u2014this was Kat Anderson on a mission, full-blown designer mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat flipped the switch, the room suddenly came alive with colors of multiple projects of a variety of tastes (mostly clashing). Kate looked around, in much better mood to appreciate rather than analyze the interpretable intricacies of \u201cart.\u201d However as soon as her eyes caught sight of the big blue tarp tucked snugly away in the left corner of the room, everything else faded away. Now was the moment of truth, the ultimate reveal was upon her! Without this dress, there would <i>be</i> no date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo\u2026\u201d Kat whistled wryly as she rolled her eyes over to her corpulent client, \u201cYou wanna see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes!\u201d Kate responded with a fiery passion, her little fists vigorously clenched in front of her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlriiiiight\u2026\u201d Kat slinked over to the big blue thing, \u201cBut don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you when your mind is <b>blown</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Kat grabbed the edges of the protective sheet, pulling it away with all of her might. In a grand flourish the dress was revealed to the room, to Kate, in all of its magnificence. Her eyes widened behind her glasses, her pretty jaw dropping as her knuckles whitened. A slight tremble sounded throughout her entire quivering form, reducing her to an emotional pile of overstimulated bookworm. This. Was. Her. Dress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had lived up to every promise, the dress was every bit the \u201cultra chique\u201d that she had promised her just yesterday. It was only strapless on the left side now, and there was differentiation between the breastline and the rest of the fabric. A matching pattern along the hem of the dress, as well as the strap, were black to go with the thick black belt that went just under her boobies (that MAY be a problem later\u2026) A fake white flower went on the strap, surrounded by two or three of the smaller like, and Kate could clearly see a black jacket on the table next to the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo\u2026 whaddaya think?\u201d Kat asked knowingly before Kate forced all of her great weight upon her in the form of the most titty-tastic embrace that the girl had ever known<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s PERFECT!\u201d Kate squealed, \u201cThank you thank you THANK YOU, Kat!\u201d she nuzzled the skinnier girl lovingly with her round cheeks, \u201cOh I KNEW that I could count on you, you\u2019re so amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop stop, you\u2019re rustling my outfit.\u201d Kat\u2019s responded lovingly, \u201cNow come on, we\u2019ve gotta get you ready for tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right\u2026 oh this is going to be so much fun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor me.\u201d Kat said, taking off Kate\u2019s glasses, \u201cIt\u2019s not every day I get to play Extreme Makeover.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little known fact: Kat Anderson is a little bit more than a clothing designer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes her title as \u201cfashionista\u201d with the utmost severity, utilizing her natural passion for fashion with her knack for forming outifts that \u201cgo together\u201d with a little good taste thrown into the mix. She is, without a doubt, destined for great things in the world of clothing construction and compilation. Tonight if anything only served as a little boost to that admirable accolade she held so closely to her heart. She had made the improbable possible\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate Granden was in a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo frumpy sweats, no too-tight uniforms, Kate was all dolled up and ready to go out on the town\u2014Kat never thought she\u2019d see the day! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the dress (and the battle of getting such a big girl into such a tight dress) was only part of it all. There were a lot of little things that went into a successful outfit that most people wouldn\u2019t even consider, especially not those less \u201cfashionably-fantastic\u201d than Kat. There was a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it in. Hair, makeup, accessorizing\u2026 while Kat was only really an \u201cexpert\u201d in that last one, she was certainly the girl that Kate needed on Operation: \u201cDate Night\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin was her hair. Often only combed, Kate admitted openly that she was never one for teasing and curling and the like. Kat scoffed a little, not quite realizing her own hair was in a simple pony, and told the poor girl to shush as she worked her magic. Kate\u2019s sensible style was transformed into something a little more modern. Less \u201clibrarian\u201d, more \u201cavid reader who\u2019s really really cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026okay, so she wasn\u2019t really good at naming things. Shut up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was parted to the left, actually cut (MUCH to Kate\u2019s shock) to give her very flattering bangs. They swooped down to cover one of her eyebrows, which were plucked to perfection. Over her ears were little ringlets of hair, left loose on purpose so her bun-pony hybrid would look all the more playful. She still had her glasses on, Kat felt that her eyes were a little too beady without them (the poor girl really WAS blind\u2026) but, rather than risk the solidarity of the outfit, Kat used white nail polish to paint the outside rim of her frames\u2014NOW they matched!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails were done, falsied painted and glossy, and even her pudgy little toes were pretty in pink! Kat had given her some shoes to wear with the outfit and a nice little clutch she had made specifically for the occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked into the mirror, hardly able to believe that she was the girl looking back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean <b>CJ</b> is so lucky that a girl like YOU is gonna ask HIM out.\u201d Kat ribbed her busty buddy lightly, \u201cHonestly, with all this on? There\u2019s no way he can resist you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate faltered, her eyes getting a little misty as she went back and forth between her reflection and the girl responsible for it all. She held onto the clutch tightly, her chubby fingers getting white around the knuckle as broken sniffles escaped her. She had never been so\u2026 pretty. Never, in her entire life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thank you, Kat.\u201d Kate sniffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah woah, no tears in my studio!\u201d the taller girl corrected gently, \u201cI spent, like, thirty minutes on your makeup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right!\u201d Kate huffed, \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll just go right out and ask him!\u201d she started getting dangerously red in the face, \u201cT-There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll turn me down\u2026 right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he might turn KATE Granden down\u2026\u201d Kat sauntered over to her client and grabbed her from behind, \u201cBut tonight he\u2019s going to meet KATIE Granden, who\u2019s fun and confident and oh-so-very pretty if you don\u2019t mind me saying so\u2026 Katie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thank you\u2026\u201d Kate whispered, \"I'll do my best but... what if he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't.\" Kat corrected, \"Now go on and show my dress off before I pull it right off those tig ol' bitties of yours.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About a month had passed since your monthly jogging sessions started. Kate, incapacitated by her ankle still showed up whenever you were working out, and would often cheer you on from a seat in the bleachers (keeping plenty of bars on hand for you and always helping herself to two or three while she watched.) Overall, you were pretty happy with the way the workouts were going, although the results hadn\u2019t exactly shown yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure your legs seemed to be the only muscles that had some definition to them, but, man had they had really grown in size. Well, actually all of you had grown in size\u2026but that had to be muscle, right? You did have more of a bouncing jiggle to your walk now, what with your belly skipping along over your waist band. Said belly was actually the main reason you began to suspect something was up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting your measurements on weigh in day, Kat Anderson had begun preparing your new outfit. No more than a week or two from that day had passed when she asked you to stop by her place to model it for her. Truth be told, the way she redesigned your uniform looked awesome. The sleeves, and pant legs were covered in sharp blue stripes, and Kat had even put your initials in gold on each of the buttons. You really wanted to try it on but like a burrito with too much filling stuffed inside, you simply could not get the jacket to fit . Kat muttered as she tried to button the front for you, munching on her own X-S MASS bar that was locked between her teeth as she did so. As you sucked in your stomach, Kat managed to get the first three buttons before you exhaled, sending your stomach forward and launching the buttons from the cloth. This sent Kat into a minor fit of grumbling and curse words deciding that her measurements must have been off. Looking down you knew it wasn\u2019t that the measurements were wrong; it was your stomach that had grown, slowly inching forward into this new full-blown paunch. Embarrassed you hurriedly thanked and apologized to Kat, leaving her to recalculate her designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t the only one who had also experienced a sort of wardrobe malfunction. Kate, had taken to snacking constantly on the fattening bars. Whether if it was when she was studying or just between her already generously portioned meals, Kate made sure to have always have a bar on hand to much on. Soon she found that the rest of her body had thickened and widened, catching up to support her once outrageously oversized breasts. One good thing was that her back aches came a lot less often,  but her stomach had lost its squishiness turning into a much firmer and rounder state. And then there were her breasts too\u2026yeah those\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the bottom three buttons on your outfit were a sign that you were still gaining weight, then Kate\u2019s sign was the top three buttons on her uniform. She just couldn\u2019t seem to get them to stay buttoned. While all traditional Chubbeso uniforms were slightly wider hemmed on the bottom to accompany the heavyset girls that seemed to attend there (Kate\u2019s stomach sill fit snugly underneath hers) the design had no way of accompanying room for a chest like Kate\u2019s. Her boobs were mashed together and had to fight to stay contained inside of a shirt where there was so little room left for them. For a while the uniform could just barely stretch to cover each of her proudly pert sweater puppies, but now the material practically ripped as Kate tried to dress herself.  What was even more frustrating for Kate was that even with their massive size and weight; they still retained most of their roundness and seemed to rebelliously wedge themselves outwards no matter what sort of outfit she wore. Yes, they were real attention getters, but they right smack in front of a girl who wasn\u2019t exactly out for attention. (Well, attention from anyone other than <i>you</i> that is.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before you both took your literally growing complaints to Claire.  \u201cYou have to remember muscle weighs more that fat and\u2026this is uh...a long term program.\u201d she replied lazily as she continued coaching from her (recently expanded) couch.  Claire, frazzled from having to actually (ugh) sweat, decidedly doubled down on her food intake. Soon she was growing more and more towards the exact opposite of the ideal image of a fitness instructor. She was raptly watching her progress bite by delicious bite and was happy to see that you too were also coming along very nicely.  But if there was one thing Claire wanted in her life it was <b>MORE</b>; more flab for herself <i>and</i> for you, and all she had to do was make sure you didn\u2019t link her or the bars to you recent weight gain and things would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the bars had grown too, grown in popularity that is. It\u2019s not like <i>you</i> were going to stop eating those health bars, Claire had said that they were part of your training routine, but the fact they were so darn delicious helped spread their popularity around the school . One would think you could get tired of them after a while but with so many flavors it was hard to. In fact most of the academy seemed to share your sentiment, everywhere  you looked now a days girls were still filling their faces up with bar after (secretly calorie laden) bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning you woke up feeling new and improved, energized even. The previous afternoon you had ran a few laps and like always you were famished afterwards, even a little achy, but after a good night\u2019s sleep on a full stomach you felt wonderful.  So what if you weren\u2019t exactly slimming down yet? You were keeping fit and felt good about it. Yesterday, Kat (who now seemed to have growing a tiny potbelly of her own) had finish your new academy jacket. It fit nicely,  your body appreciating clothes that didn't leave it feeling pinched. Even better, yesterday Kate had said that Dr. Young gave her the o.k. to start jogging again! Today was going to be a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you practically strutted into the academy you here a whistle coming from a group of girls huddled together and checking you out. \u201cWow C.J! You certainly look a lot\u2026healthier.\u201d  This sent the group laughing and another girl called out. \u201cYeah nice buns, stud!\u201d This sent another round of school girls giggling naughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, you might have blushed at such hooting, but today you smiled at the compliments. You felt...different as you made your way down the hall, for some reason working out gave you\u2026confidence. That was is it! With Kate being able to jog with you again, and your new threads and attitude, you felt confident. So confident in fact you actually turned your head to smile and wave back at the girls who were checking you out when\u2026<b>KA-SQUISH</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the gaggle of giggling girls you immediately found yourself plowing into a wall of fleshy fat. Knocked onto your well padded bum, you look up to see who you\u2019ve accidentally ran into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026</span></div></div>",

The walls (rather than your usual setting of brick) had been engraved with fine sculptings of vines and leaves that grew skyward to reach the ceiling, a trio of chandeliers flowering the arrangement with what must have been fifty lit candles in harmony with several other electric lights. Heavy and strong, yet they remained perfectly still as they hung perilously over everyone's heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo carpet, you rather liked carpet, but instead a cold tile of off-white polished to perfection despite chairs, that must have cost a small fortune to provide, placed neatly in rows facing the back wall of the room; more specifically a podium at which the Headmistress was currently speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just weird... so uncomfortable'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Everyone's staring at me...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just cut it out!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a familiarly steady hand grips your shaking knee, \"Easy there, Killer.\" chuckles a friend, \"We'll be graduating before you know it.\" Rebbecca was always there to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning slightly to your right, acknowledging her attempts with a (less than) reassuring nod, you smile slightly at the gesture. She seemed to be having troubles with her own uniform, namely keeping her skirt over her heavy bottom half. Being a bit of a 'Big Girl' as she so described herself when confronted with her weight, she was pretty used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand at your shoulder, \"Yeah CJ... we should all relax, you know?\" another friend meekly points out, \"Getting sweat on that uniform will only shrink it, thus making it tighter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to your left was Kate who, in her own bookish way, was just as good at helping you through these sorts of situations as Becca; even if she had just as terrible luck with her uniform's buttons. Poor girl had a chest the size of the States all to herself. But the scary part was that she had even more brains than she did boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thanks guys...\" you mutter slightly, keeping under the radar of the speaking Headmistress (who appeared to be quite the 'Big Girl' herself), \"I don't know what I'd do without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably get beat up a lot.\" Becca jeered with a light jab at your arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not pass any of your math classes...\" Kate added with a look of matronly concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it!\" you whispered, only to be shushed by a cold-faced Asian women whom of which was of the same generous size as the woman speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Quiet.\"</b> she hushed strictly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the stage, three women had lined up around a podium. One, a large woman of maybe four-fifty, four-seventyfive stood in the center at the podium. Her long blonde hair cascaded downwards as it rested on a lavender suit no doubt tailor-made for an elephant. The podium was quite large, though not large enough to conceal the lardy lady lumps that the Headmistress sported, and took up a good bit of eye view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, out of the spotlight, a young girl who looked remarkably similar to the Headmistress stood with her hands crossed over her tubby tummy as it strained against her Chubbeso uniform. Albeit being smaller in both vertical and horizontal axis, she still looked a great deal like the Headmistress. For some reason, she seemed to be looking at you anxiously... just as all the other girls had since your arrival. Wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the other side was a waify woman of dark complexion. Dressed in black business clothing with only a white undershirt for contrast, the seemingly arabian woman stood at perfect attention by the Headmistress' side. An odd one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ladies, erm, and CJ, I'm sure you're more than ready to get things started.\" the Headmistress began slowly, \"So without further adieu, I present to you the former Valedictorian of the previous graduating class to give you a little insight as to how we live at Chubbeso Academy...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a slight pause as everyone patiently anticipated the arrival of the apparently either absent or invisible valedictorian, confused mumblings as to whether or not the large woman had expected this slight misstep roused the girls present until a loud noised signaled that the proper chain of events had resumed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late!\" said a chipper voice from the back of the room as the doors creaked behind her, \"I just had to grab another mocha frappe from the teacher's lounge, they're just so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll glanced, including yourself, turning to face the largest girl anyone had ever seen! Larger than the mini-mistress up above! Your eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets when you saw the enormous mound of quivering blubber as it slowly made its way towards the aisle, barely able to waddle about in her sorry shape. No doubt feminine, the Mound rather awkwardly jiggled and quivered underneath her suit and dress pants as it heaved its heavy thighs one after the other in a slow steady motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy, pendulous belly sagged and swayed betwixt her swollen thighs, the fabric of her white blouse colliding audibly with the taut pattern of her bottoms, each movement still visible after the next had passed in it's wobbling, gelatinous mass as it surged forward. Her heavy breasts bobbed with the rest of her body as they forced her arms to the side, said arms coated in bingo wings heavy enough to fill out the sleeves and then some of her black jacket. As she waddled uncomfortably through the chairs, you could hear her pants and wheezes as she struggled to simply move about at such a high weight, her cheeks thick with fat and red as tomatoes as she heaved and hoed herself about. Clutched beneath her sausage fingers was aforementioned Mocha Frappe, loaded with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. In fact, it appeared that there was little coffee at all in that cup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd slowly, as she passed, one of her mighty meaty love handles brushed against one of the (then) lighter girls and pushed her to all fours. \"Oops, sorry!\" she puffed as she tottered past, not making an attempt at assisting the poor student as she continued her trek to the podium<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, what a heifer.\" you heard a voice behind you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's really big...\" said another<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a big'un!\" even Becca proclaimed, \"I mean, I know I'm not exactly skinny, but that's just unhealthy- right, CJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes seemed glued to the massive, rising globs of blubber that ran aquifer inside her tight dress pants. As with her top, this valedictorian's bottom half was just as keen on keeping a record of her movements within it's fleshy banks. You weren't <i>interested</i>, per say, in her; however there seemed to be something keeping you from turning away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Right</i> CJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch with a strange fascination in her struggle as she stomped along, being completely out of breath by the time she finally reached the microphone. As Mrs. Masters was the one speaking before her, the podium had already been accommodated to fit one of more \"generously proportioned\" status. However even that in effect, the voluptuous valedictorian still had to take a step back so that her heavy breaths would not be heard in the microphone- Mocha Frappe still steady in hand as she sucked down the creamy, chocolate mix like a drug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>CJ</b>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her! That's totally unhealthy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's unhealthy now?\" you stammer in an unintelligent fashion, being caught off-guard by one of such a... rounded figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her weight! She's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, now... c-come on Becca, that's not cool-\" for some reason you are quick to defend this total(ly huge) stranger even against your dearest of friends, \"she probably has a glandular problem or something. We shouldn't make fun of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well obviously it's contagious judging by our Headmistress and her roly-poly mini-her.\" Becca scoffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait, guys\" the large girl at the stand finally managed after a long pause filled with some wheezing, slurping, and apparent snacking at the front of the crowd, \"There was a line in the teacher's lounge.\" she said, happily glutting herself on her cocoa-centric confections without a second thought, sweating slightly as she sinfully enjoyed herself. Next to her, the Headmistress seemed to be fidgeting uneasily as she watched her double-wide former student slurp and scarf. She beckoned her dark-skinned assistant closer to her, whereupon the larger woman whispered something into her subordinate's ear- dashing off with a quick nod of confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm Ivy Sighsoftly and I was the Valedictorian and President of my graduating class last Summer.\" the speaker said, finally placing her cup down on the podium, \"I know you're all really really excited to start school here at Chubbeso Academy. It's going to be a whole lot of fun!\" her accent (or lack thereof) suggested that, like you, Miss Sighsoftly was American- which instilled you with a great amount of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when I was your age, most of you probably didn't come from England and that's perfectly fine.\" she says, grabbing her cup and lifting the green straw to her plump lips before taking a sip, \"There's nothing wrong with being from another part of Europe, America, Asia, or anywhere else for that matter! Because Chubbeso Academy for Promising Young Girls is a wonderful place once you get used to it. I know that you'll all... phew, excuse me-\" here she had grown winded from the pressures of remaining in a standing position and had to wipe her brow with one thick arm, causing an audible rip in her jacket. Ignoring the soft white bulge of blubber taking up her armpit, Sighsoftly continued unperturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-get to love and know one another and get to be just like sisters! (slurp) I never thought, when I was your age, that I would be where I was my Senior year, or where I am today! But all it took was a little time and effort to reach out of my shell and get reach out to my fellow girls; and soon enough we were all growing closer than real sisters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because you took up the most space, Chubs.\" Becca mumbled under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have to say that it's all worth it, going out and becoming an integral part of your student body. I was Class President from Sophomore year on and I got all sorts of perks- my lunches were free, my dorm room was upgraded, access to the Teachers Lounge... and it was all because I took initiative! (munch) And, let me just say, that (crunch) I've never (slurp) been so happy (munch) in my entire (slurp) life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA modest chorus of applause from her baffled audience fizzled as she took her things from the podium, allowing the Headmistress to return to her stand. Seconds after, the mysterious dark assistant returned to her employer with a Mocha Frappe of identical, though refilled, specifications as was Ivy Sighsoftly's. She took a big sip herself before doing so herself and continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as I'm sure you all know, there are... oh boy this is good... a few things that must be enforced. Namely, the respect of our new... special case... a Mister Charity Jaine Dalton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. They just said your full name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of giggles and confused noises filled the speaking area as Becca nudged you to stand upright. In your uniform, you felt like such an outcast. Being the only boy, sure, but also being the only one to wear this ridiculous penguin suit. The Headmistress, straw between her lips, beckoned you closer to her with one plump finger... you could only do as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on CJ, I won't bite.\" the Headmistress said jokingly, \"And I'm sure Ivy won't either unless you ask her to.\" she crinkles her broad nose at the crass joke. \"Now ladies, it is very important that we make CJ here feel comfortable. As the only red-blooded male in this academy, I'm sure he thinks himself plenty lucky to be surrounded by such young women as yourselves, but rest assured that nothing should happen between <i>anyone</i> while during school.

Your heartbeat grew faster and your cheeks fill with blood as your entire face begins to redden. What was worse there was another part of your body that was also letting you know it was working correctly, but mercifully <i>that</i> went unnoticed by the student body. However, your blushing <i>was</i> quite obvious, and a few small murmurs go up in reaction from the crowd. Most were girlish coos or sounds of small laughs at your embarrassment, but there were other discussions going on too. You weren\u2019t able to hear exactly what they were saying, but Rebecca did pick up on one rumor spreading conversation going on directly behind her, just out of the hearing range of Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a shy one <i> isn\u2019t</i> he?\u201d whispered a sophomore who possessed a thick cockney accent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think he\u2019s cute\u201d said her corpulent compatriot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, blushing after a kiss is one thing, but from <i>\u2018er</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s tubby\u2026Maybe he\u2019s got a thing for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You sayin\u2019 he gets a chubby for the chubbies?\u201d she asked British wit in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, look at him blush. Considering the \u2018size\u2019 of most of the girls here It\u2019s not like having a \u2018thing\u2019 for big girls would hurt him...well maybe a girl her size could\" A quick burst of girlish laughter erupted between the two before Mrs. Masters returned to the podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell thank you again Ivy, I\u2019m sure you <u>all </u>will absolutely love it here!  Oh, and we\u2019ll try to get this back to you before classes start tomorrow CJ.\u201d The mysterious assistant had quickly taken your uniform and promptly disappeared off stage once more. Mrs. Masters\u2019 motions for you to take your seat and you sheepishly step off stage, feeling the mob of eyes that were now focused on you and your still quite red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you all are free to explore the campus here for the rest of the day. Please be sure to check your schedule for a list of special events we are holding today. and finally; Welcome everyone to Chubbeso academy! I know this will be the best school-year ever!\u201d She concludes holding her arms outstretched as if to embrace the entire audience in a big warm hug. There were a few cheers and some applause at the conclusion of the speech, but the majority of the freshmen in the crowd were still a feeling too awkward here in this new high class academy to clap. The three of you began to file out of the elegant auditorium, and started to venture the academy\u2019s labyrinth like hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026what do we do now?\u201d Rebecca asked a little awestruck as she was taking in the luxurious surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the pamphlet says there\u2019s something called The Foreign &amp; Freshman Students Feast going on right now in the cafeteria. I guess we double qualify for that huh?\u201d Kate answered, happy to have something new to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that sounds cool,\" you add, feeling a bit of food would calm the butterflies still in your stomach, even if it was cafeteria food which up to this point in your life you'd always known to be a bit bland.  \"What do you think Rebecca? You hungry?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh-What?\u201d she asks clearly lost in thoughts. Food had actually been what was on her mind, as she was begging to suspect you did have a thing for bigger girls. Though she had known you for practically your whole life, known that you\u2019d always tried to be nice to everyone, you certainly had defended that enormous  Ivy girl quickly, and you had definitely seemed to enjoy that hug she had given you...Maybe she\u2019d ask you about it later\u2026or maybe she could try\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said are you hungry?\u201d you ask again cutting her once more from her weighty contemplations.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure! Uh, where is the cafeteria here anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me check\u2026\u201d you flip your own pamphlet over and open it up revealing the school sizable map. Then you draw a finger from your location just outside the grand auditorium to a large square marked Cafeteria. \u201cOkay, so we should just have to go down this hallway and\u2026\u201d you begin, eyes glued squarely on the map as your legs continued walking forward. Unknowingly, you were about to commit one of the most cliche (and loved?) tropes of the genre, by literally bumping into/stumble upon one of the Academy\u2019s attractive female residents who was just rounding the corner in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Which is strange because the unusual hair color of the young woman should have grabbed your attention.

It was a girl holding a hand fan, but after you got a better look at her it was the very same girl from orientation and the one who accidentally slammed the doors at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there CJ.\u201d The girl said while turning the rest of the lights on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 hi.\u201d You replied awkwardly. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, where are my manners.\u201d The girl said in remembrance. \u201cMy name is Claire Masters, daughter of the head mistress and owner of the academy Jessica Masters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the daughter if the head mistress!\u201d You said in shock. \u201cActually I do have a question that I hope you can answer.\u201d \u201cOn the application form I notice that there wasn\u2019t a rent fee for the apartment that I\u2019m living in why is that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple my mom bought that complex so students don\u2019t have to pay rent.\u201d Claire replied in a confident tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d You said lesser surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, my family is quite wealthy.\" Claire stated with pride. \u201cBut you know CJ you don\u2019t have to live in that apartment building you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d You asked in confusion. \u201cWhere else would I live?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Claire got off the teachers desk and walked (or waddled) slowly towards you and when the edges of belly fat were touching your chest she gave you kiss right on the cheek. You were caught off guard by what had transpired that you lost your balance and fell on the floor which caused Claire to fall right on top of you. Your body was completely covered by Claire\u2019s large body, her large gut engulfed your own, her thick arms and legs were larger than your own and her vast cleavage was resting on your neck. There was no way you were getting up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could live with me.\u201d Claire said in a lustful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d You said in shock and confusion. \u201cI hardly know you and I don\u2019t feel comfortable living in some stranger\u2019s house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know its sudden but trust me, you\u2019ll be treated like a king and love it.\u201d Claire said in an energetic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened and you saw the last two people you wanted to see in the situation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"CJ...Danke\" Hannah says coming in a step closer as she took her room key from you, her chocolate brown eyes welcoming the stares coming from your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danke?\" you echo back, not understanding the strange sounding word was German for \"Thank You.\" Her round cheeks were getting awfully close now, so close you can smell what must be the girls perfume. It's a refreshing mint chocolate scent, like opening up a fresh box of \"Thin Mints\" (<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">product placement sponsored by the Girl Scouts Association. Have you bought your box yet?</font>) And still she stepped in closer, leaning in now to give you-not one, but two sweet kisses one on each of your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er danke?\" you say again rubbing a newly wet cheek. Hannah seemed to really like this because she began to giggle. Leaning in even closer she brought her rosy chocolate laden lips to yours. The kiss came quick but you savored so many of the details, her lips were just so warm and moist...so plump...so sweet tasting. You unconsciously began to kneed her lower lip with your own, and  were thinking about how nice it would be to just lick that bit of chocolate off her lips with your tongue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly realizing what you and the German girl  were doing you move to pull away but she ends up ending the kiss first. \"Goobye C.J.\" she says a mischievous grin spreading across her face. You blink out of your daydream realizing the door in front of you had slowly been closed shut. The lingering taste of chocolate on your lips served as a melty memory of how the kiss had left you wanting, almost as if you'd just gotten a crumb of some extremely delicious dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly moving on, you realized that you had the rest of the afternoon free. Thinking about what you you might do tonight, you turn a corner you feel a hand suddenly grab your arm. Oh no! A member of your fan club had caught you by surprise! There went your afternoon! Now all you had to look forward to was a night of shirt ripping, grabbing, or even worse handcuffs. Taking in your assailants face, it wasn't a would be fan club captor, it was none other than Claire but she did not look happy.You found yourself wishing it had been a member of your fan club now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly was that all about?\" she asks sandwiching you against the wall with her nigh-immovable stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb. Who's the girl you were just kissing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hanna? She's a new student here. And I didn't kiss her she kiss <i>me</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, but I hardly believe you.\" Claire then took a step closer increasing the squeeze her stomach had on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really your mom wanted me to show her around go ask her, her name's Hannah Gretel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire audibly gasped at this reveal, taking a few steps back in surprise and releasing you from her poundage prison  \"D-did you say Hannah <i>Gretel</i>?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to be surprised, as there were few girls around who could shake Claire up like this. She quickly began talking a mile a minute sounding like a squealing fan girl. \"You've <i>got </i> to introduce to me! No wait, I can't meet her dressed in just this....Did she give you any chocolate? No,  first What's she like?\" she finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well...\" Thinking back on it the girl didn't do a lot of talking, you had showed her around with her hugging your arm the entire time, only stopping to help herself to bar after various bar of chocolates. \"She nice, but she's just starting to learn English.\" you finally say, carefully to leave out the whole arm hugging details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire seemed satisfied but her eyes remained peeled as she glared at you. \"Well then, very good...Just, make sure she stays happy. I'd simply <i>die</i>, if the daughter of the best chocolate maker in the whole universe left. Just let her know if she's get <i>too </i>close to you she's going to learn a whole lot of new words in English, and none of it will be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure Claire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Claire says a smile doubling the dimples on her face. \"I can't wait to meet her.\" And keeping this jolly regal nature about her, Claire sauntered off feeling she'd taken care of her business for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to your place the kiss was all you could think about. What had Claire meant by <i>too</i> close? You had just met Hannah.The two kisses on the cheek seemed playful, almost customary for the German girl; but that last one...that had been something...special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial, was not far from the truth. Hannah had been born and raised snacking on her fathers chocolates; chocolates which through chemicals and special tinkering had been created with an extremely high endorphin reactions. Now, as any choclophile can tell you one of the many benefits of Chocolate is that it can cause the brain to release endorphins which are tiny little chemicals that tell your brain when something is really good. Her father's chocolates though amplified this amount so much so that for some customers the chocolate were a pure addiction. That is was why in many countries today Hans&amp;Gretel Chocolates are under strict investigations. This is also why such chocolates are extremely rare to find, but anyways back to Hannah, or more importantly Hannah's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after a lifetime of eating such spiked sweets, Hannah's body had begun to process the chemicals differently. Unbeknownst to everyone, including Hannah herself, the endorphins inside her had simply begun to stockpile. This meant that anyone who received a kiss from the rotund redhead might find themselves feeling a lot happier than they had before. Now that was just for most people, but say for example a certain pubescent boy happened to receive an endorphin laden kiss...well we'll just have to see what happens next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You honestly did not know what was going through her head it\u2019s like kissing you and giving you chocolate is her way of greeting someone (as far as you know anyway).

Hannah had already moved most of her things into her new room and so had her key ready when the finally reached her door. She turned slowly before retiring to her room for the night, a beaming smile on her wide face. \"Thank You~!\" she said suddenly, spouting some of the few English words she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls returned her smile and thanks, and the watched as Hannah entered her dorm room. As the door opened wide all three of the Chubbeso veterans stood frozen....Hannah's room was practically stockpiled with box's of rich chocolates, all adorned with the Hans&amp;Gretel Chocolates logo. Hannah turned around noticing her new buddies hadn't budged. Puzzled at first, Hannah's eyes lit up with understanding, no words were necessary. Hannah raised a finger in a sort of I'll-be-right back motion and waddled into her room, she returned moments later cradling an arm full of the usually very exclusive and very hard to come by chocolate bars. Still without speaking she held a bar or two out to each of the gaping girls, handing them out like it was Halloween. Hannah hummed in delight knowing that now she was able to give a special gift to the three, she was so happy that she was making so many new friends already! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was the first to snap from the momentary shock. \"Gee thanks Hannah! I've never had one of these before...\"  As she opened the wrapper Kate caught a whiff of the dark chocolate's smell, she slowly bit into a corner and was obviously just as delighted by the taste letting out a resounding \"<i><b>Mmmmm</b></i>\" much to Hannah's approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! My grandma use to bring me one of these every year as as special treat.\" said Rebbecca recognizing the bars logo and design. She tore into the wrapper taking biting off a chunk of the chocolate. She too gave a moan of approval nodding to Hannah as she sample the snack's smooth and creamy taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stood still, and still slack jawed. Her greedy eyes scanned Hannah's room once more. There had to be at least 10 boxes in there, and 10 bar in every box meant....100 bars! She could have fainted at the sight. Claire much like her mother, savored any chance a bar happened to get smuggled out of Germany and into her pudgy hands, which was not very often, and even then she'd have to be content with splitting a single bar or two with her mother. Claire was practically drooling as she continued to peer into Hannah's room, almost forgetting about the bars currently in her hand. Almost. Claire instantly tore into her first one, sucking it up as quick as a vacuum cleaner and barely tasting the thing. The second one though she decided to truly savor, letting her lips slowly envelop it before biting. Claire seemed to moan loudest of the three, partly out of reflex and partly to make sure Hannah knew how much more she appreciated the gift than the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Hannah waved goodbye as she politely shut the door to her room, leaving the three alone. Each one of the girls knowing that they would soon become good friends- no- <u>very </u> good friends with the Chocolate maker heiress. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you were very excited about the trip to the snow cross resort. Claire had even arranged for her Mother's personal assistant to pick you up in a private limo (rather than have you ride/torn apart by 20 or so fan girls on the Academy's bus.)

You were a bit surprised to see that the scent of chocolate was enough to wake her up but then again the girls around here tend to have their stomach act like alarm clocks as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood see you up and about Hannah.\u201d Claire said in a happy tone. \u201cI had a feeling the smell of chocolate would wake you up, especially considering that the muffin is made out of the chocolate you gave us so.\u201d \u201cI also have more of them in the fridge want one?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Hannah said in an eager tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hannah reached over for the muffin and some milk while sandwiching you between Hannah\u2019s broad gut and the side of Claire\u2019s cleavage (you had the strange feeling that Claire planned this from the beginning). Then Claire grabbed a muffin for herself and the two girls started two devour the muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Claire how long will it take for us to get to the resort?\u201d You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh we have a long while till we get to the resort.\u201d Claire replied while still eating. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay since I\u2019ve got plenty of snacks to eat as wells as some activities to help pass the time and get closer to each other.\u201d <br>\r\nWith that response in mind you weren\u2019t sure if you should be grateful or nervous given the princess\u2019s nature when you are involved. Either way this trip was going to be interesting.</span></div></div>",

You get there and knock on the door, a little <i>too</i> quickly. You're surprised when there is no answer, you find your answer as a slightly plump lady walks by and tells you \"Ms. Gretel went out to a meeting with Mrs. Masters\". Slightly downtrodden of hoping to meet again with a (possibly) friend, you make your way to the town to get a quick post-breakfast anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stopped on the way as an all-too-familiar limo pulls up next to you. The door opens and you see Claire, dressed in a stunningly casually-formal dress. \"CJ!\" she calls, pulling you into a soft hug, squeezing you between her breasts as she does, \"What are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to see Hannah today\" you replied as you pulled yourself out of her soft embrace, \"But since your mum took her to a meeting I decided to grab some breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take you!\" Claire said while pulling you into the limo, sitting you next to her as you squish into her, her head snuggling itself into you soft shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk for a while, mostly about herself or about how cute and special you are (most of the talking from her), the the limo stops, you pull yourself out and courteously help Claire out, said person giggling seductively as you do. She leads you into Shaunty's Restaurant, where you both are quickly ushered into a high-class private room, where are large table of food, consisting of their specials, is already there. Claire leads you to the table and quickly starts to feed you, much to your annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling better now?\" Claire asked in a light, concerned voice. The table had been emptied, with you (forced) eating just over a quarter. and Claire eating the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" you answer while stifling a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both leave the restaurant, Claire, reluctantly, leaving with a kiss on your cheek. You make your way through town, occupying yourself for most of the day, most of it being you running from <i>your</i> club. You make your way back into your apartment, walking past the Academy's constructors as you do, to find that your room has, well... GROWN a room. You ran into said room to find a new bedroom, most of the room being covered by boxes of Hansel &amp; Gretel's chocolates, you look around and find Hansel sitting on (presumably) her bed, with a smile on her face, sitting next to Mrs. Masters who was sitting on a reinforced-chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Dalton\" Mrs. Masters said with a smile, \"As I'm sure you know, Hannah had a meeting with me today\" you nod in confirmation \"Well we had a meeting about her schooling and living arrangements, as she told me how nice you were and how welcomed you made her feel, I decided to let her live with you, as well as her joining <b>all</b> you classes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bulge out slightly, enticing a giggle from Hannah, who was now eating, from what you could tell, her 10th chocolate bar, you sputter as you try to get your head around this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you feel about this?

You coming into your room one day, finding Mrs. Masters grinning like the cat that caught the canary as she unveiled some new hair-brained scheme for you to take part in (usually one that worked in her favor sooner or later) wasn\u2019t exactly an uncommon occurrence in this crazy campus. But this was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the girls on campus didn\u2019t have roommates, unless they desired it of course. And they were\u2026 well, <i>girls</i> rooming with <i>other girls</i>. Mrs. Masters couldn\u2019t <i>possibly</i> allow this, right? You rooming with a strange new girl who didn\u2019t seem to speak very much English, a pretty cute one at that... why if you were a lesser man, she could be in serious danger! This was either a serious case of negligence on Mrs. Masters\u2019 part as a headmistress\u2026 or her true, inner self turning the cogs of a diabolical scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d the words stumble out of your mouth as you attempt to avoid watching Hannah nom adorably on her chocolate bar, \u201cMrs. Masters, do you think we can have a word?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course, Mr. Dalton.\u201d Mrs. Masters said warmly, crossing her mighty arms over her bloated torso innocently as she deflected your laser-sighted stares, \u201cSeveral, if you would like.\u201d She giggled like a girl many years her junior, not unlike an overgrown version of a certain pampered princess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes travel silently back to Hannah, who seemed unaware of the transgression before her. You look back to your Headmistress, then back to Hannah while raising your eyebrows. She only laughs in response, one so hearty and plentiful that it causes her entire body to shake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh CJ, don\u2019t worry about little Hannah.\u201d She said with a gentle gesture towards the anything-<b>but</b>-little Hannah, \u201cYou remember darling, she doesn\u2019t quite have the grasp on the English language that you and I do. Speak freely love, she probably won\u2019t understand a word of it.\u201d She purred here, \u201cOf course if you\u2019d like some <i>privacy</i> with your Headmistress, I\u2019d be more than happy to oblige\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>TH-This is fine!</i>\u201d you backpedal instinctively, much to the amusement of your somewhat sadistic schoolmarm , \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 well, I\u2019m not entirely sure if I\u2019m\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on Mr. Dalton, do spit it out.\u201d Mrs. Masters said in a huff, \u201cIt\u2019s not polite to dance around the subject, now go on and get to the point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, it\u2019s just\u2026 Hannah\u2019s really nice and all (from what I gather, anyway) but\u2026\u201d you choke, much to the chagrin of your rapidly less-flirtatious headmistress, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to\u2026 room with her. I\u2019ve never had a roommate before. Let alone a <i>girl</i>. A-And\u2026 well, isn\u2019t this a little sudden? I mean, I just met her yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause between the two of you, interrupted only by the sounds of Hannah\u2019s eager munching on her twelve candy bar. She seemed to be watching intently, with wide eyes and wearing her naivet\u00e9 on her sleeves, despite being unable to understand most (if any) of what was going on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, literally, I just met her yesterday.\u201d You reiterate your point, though it may not have been the brightest of ideas at this point judging by the downright sour expression on Mrs. Masters\u2019 doughy countenance, \u201cA-And\u2026 um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ, CJ, CJ\u2026\u201d Mrs. Masters corrected gently, shaking her head slowly from side to side in the act of, \u201cYou\u2019ve spent so much time on your own, but you fail to understand the simplest of working relationships.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorking\u2026 relationships?\u201d you parrot, unsure of the meaning behind this sudden turn of events<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe relationships one forges with their co-workers or business partners. Working Relationships, thus the title.\u201d She says gently, taking your hand in hers, \u201cNow, I\u2019m doing Hannah\u2019s father a <i>large</i> favor by enrolling her into my academy\u2014with you, my daughter, and all your other ragtag friends you keep around for some reason\u2014and in return he has\u2026 <i>allowed</i> me a large cache of his personal chocolates, to which you are privy to as well for that matter.\u201d She pat the top of your hand in a matronly fashion before sitting back up in her reinforced chair, \u201cNow, he has instructed me to do all that is within my power to ensure Hannah has an absolutely lovely time at school. I could only imagine if it was my Claire in the exact same position\u2014I know <i>I</i> would want Mr. Gretel to accommodate my darling daughter as best he could for the duration of her stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d you interject, \u201cwhat does this have to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Masters chuckled into the back of her hand haughtily, \u201cOh my boy, no wonder it\u2019s taken Claire so long to wrestle you over!\u201d she coochy-cooed girlishly, \u201cHannah was <i>very</i> excited after you gave her the grand tour yesterday. I don\u2019t speak <i>much</i> German, but what I could understand pertained very much to \u2018the friendly American boy\u2019, if you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, the memory of Hannah\u2019s juicy pink lips dripping from yours suddenly so very strong in your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-So\u2026 you\u2019re using me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my no, Mr. Dalton!\u201d Mrs. Masters said dramatically, \u201cHannah wants to room with you, I wish to grow closer to her father, her father wants her to be happy, and\u2026 well, I suppose I am. Just a little though.\u201d She winked devilishly, \u201cBut I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-MRS. MASTERS?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, you silly boy!\u201d her encompassing cheeks growing a healthy passionate red after your outburst, \u201cI mean that, should you agree to rooming with Hannah, I\u2019ll be sure to provide you with plenty of \u2018extras\u2019 around the Academy. A few late passes here or there, I\u2019ll renew your sick days at the end of every month, plus all the chocolate that Hannah would be willing to give you\u2014along with access to the supply that I and my dearest daughter will be afforded once a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she placed her hand gently upon yours once more and looked at you dead in the eye. Her gaze was haunting, not malevolent but certainly far from benign. There was no hint of desperation, or any ill intent. Just a certain\u2026 sternness. One that you hadn\u2019t ever seen in the big blue eyes of your seemingly unimposing headmistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, love?\u201d Mrs. Masters said in a surly tone, \u201cDo it for the Academy. For Claire. For me\u2026 Hell, do it for yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes lit up fabulously as her painted lips tucked the corners of her mouth into dimples. She turned to Hannah and muttered something to her quietly, something ending in \u201cbleiben.\u201d At once Hannah began smiling as well, her plump pink lips stretching as wide as her waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s all settled then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mrs. Masters said happily, \u201cCJ be a dear and help up your headmistress.\u201d She stretched out one giant arm, grabbing at the air in a not-so-subtle suggestion that you help pry her from her seat, \u201cI believe that I do have a date with that \u2018lifetime supply\u2019 of chocolates that I was promised\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so that was that, Hannah Gretel was to be your new roommate.

After all, according to her, you were both \u201cvery special guests\u201d and were to be treated with the \u201crequired amount of exclusivity\u201d\u2026whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping Mrs. Masters to her chubby little feet and guiding her out the door, you were to begin the arduous task of helping Hannah unpack. How could you not, with that cute face looking up at you. She seemed so quiet\u2026 probably because she didn\u2019t know any English. But still the way she kicked her feet idly as she watched you walk around the apartment, she seemed very interested in you. She guided you silently through the unpacking process, unable to lift a finger due to her excessive chocolate indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn\u2019t mind a bit\u2026 well, not much of a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanke, CJ!\u201d She giggled at your misfortune, laughing into the wrist of her coat as you plopped down beside her: completely spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing was cut short by all this strenuous work, it having been quite some time since you\u2019d actually done much of anything for yourself since enrolling in this palace of poshness. You had unpacked most of Hannah\u2019s stuff for her by now, and at least moved most of the heavier items into her side of the still-not-entirely-painted wall that separated your \u201croom\u201d from hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026problem\u2026 Hannah\u201d you pant, laying down on her full mattress with your arms stretched out, \u201cJust\u2026 gimme a minute\u2026 \u2018kay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJa, das ist in Ordnung\u201d, Hannah mumbled slightly to herself, conjuring up the right words to fit this particular situation, \u201cZat iz fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale wildly, your stomach rising and falling erratically as your struggle to regain your lost breath is fought in vain. You uniform was already feeling a little tight around the middle, no doubt you\u2019d have to see Kat about a resize soon. Or just splurge on a new one, courtesy of the Masters\u2019 bottomless bank account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that was the <i>tamest</i> of your wild dreams, considering all the good things that were to come for housing Hannah. No more tardies, a <i>lot</i> more sick days, and maybe even a better GPA were in your future! Plus getting to room with someone\u2014ie, someone who could keep an eye out for that pesky fanclub of yours. Score! No more waking up an hour early to sneak to school , Hannah got the window so they couldn\u2019t watch you sleep anymore\u2026 oh man, this was gonna be <b>great!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice snapped you from your daydreams as you looked up over your pot to find her staring at you, \u201cDo you like schokolade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I like whatnow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchokolade.

It looked no bigger than a cigar box, but it apparently held many of the peculiar bars that she was always snacking on. She reached into it and pulled out two\u2014about as wide as your palm and twice as long. The words \u201cHans&amp;Gretel\u201d curly-cued over the wrapper with the image of two chubby children with rosy red cheeks.

Becca\u2019s a pretty big girl too, a bottom-heavy two-fifty but standing a little taller at 5\u20198\u201d. She\u2019s got the usual fanfare with her meal\u2014as much as she claims to hate the Chubbeso lifestyle, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped her from indulging in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably in the infirmary.\u201d She snorts as she takes another bite of her hearty meal, clearly trying to hide her concern for you, \u201cNew semester, same Chickadees following him around and jumping all over him, <i>eating her weight in chocolate right now</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she paused to look at Claire Masters, the largest girl seated at the table. Weighing a bit more than the big three-double-donut, Claire Masters was every ounce her mother\u2019s child. Being a roly-poly princess in her own right, she huffed slightly at the accusation and continued eating her lunch. However it was not the normal cuisine that was served so graciously to the \u201criff-raff\u201d, as she called them. No, not just that. While it <i>was</i> there, more or less the same of what Becca and Kate were eating, it was smaller. And was accompanied by an unhealthy amount of gourmet chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you be quiet.\u201d Claire huffed as she sandwiched her sandwich between two Hans&amp;Gretel chocolate bars, \u201cI\u2019m certainly anything but a Chickadee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rare fourth, to this table anyway, sat a somewhat older member of this clique. As it was her duty to monitor the cafeteria at all times, Bunnie Blake liked to abuse this duty so as to chill with her favorite students. Well, sans you. But that was fine. The Calamity Pink cook was more than willing to have a nice pow-wow with her good friends and favorite customers\u2014both here and at Shaunty\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuuuugh!!\u201d Bunnie whined girlishly, \u201cCJ NEVER misses one of my meals! He needs to get his butt down here right now so I can make him some food!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunnie\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you be, y\u2019know, in the cafeteria?\u201d Kate looked up from her book again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in the cafeteria.\u201d Bunnie answered flatly before taking a sip of her coffee, \u201cI\u2019m getting creative criticism.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you make your entrance. Having quite literally <i>just</i> rolled out of bed and thrown on your uniform, it wasn\u2019t until your walk over here that you realized that it wasn\u2019t time for breakfast. Your hair was tossled, your clothes a little wrinkled, and your fly was down. Obviously you weren\u2019t expecting to come to school this morning. Or afternoon. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCJ?\u201d Becca asked, swinging her big bottom from underneath the table to stand, \u201cWhere have you been? It\u2019s noon! You\u2019ve missed, like, <i>all</i> of your classes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver\u2026slept\u2026\u201d you wheeze, \u201cStayed up all night\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll night?\u201d Kate asked worriedly, \u201cThat\u2019s not very healthy, CJ\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith Hannah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>HANNAH?!</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, your entourage could all at least agree on something. The shock and awe was dripping from every which way, from Becca to Bunnie! It made so much sense now! The lateness, the unkempt appearance, why you were so out of breath\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCee-CJ?\u201d Kate asked, getting all red-faced, \u201cW-Who\u2019s Hannah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy new roommate.\u201d You answer plainly in one puff of air, much to Becca\u2019s chagrin. She grabs you by your uniform\u2019s lapel and proceeds to throttle you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cROOMMATE?!\u201d she parrots back, \u201cYou\u2019re LIVING with some girl that I DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I...\u201d you struggle to breath, \u201cM-Mrs. Masters\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Rebbecca.\u201d Claire daintily taps her mouth with her napkin, sitting elegantly across from her cool as a cucumber, \u201cMy Mother and future husband have made an agreement of sorts.\u201d She says plainly in her delusions of arranged marriage, \u201cHannah is a very important aspect in an\u2026 agreement my Mother has with Hannah\u2019s father. So she will get the very best of treatments\u2026 but since we already gave that room to CJ, they\u2019ll just have to share\u2026 at least, that\u2019s what my Mother told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d Becca drops you like a brick, \u201cFirst I have to put up with this one\u2014\u201chere she points to the still-smug Claire, \u201c\u2014now some other pampered princess?! No dice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cV-Verzeihung bitte\u2026\u201d came Hannah\u2019s voice over the uproar of your crowd, \u201cI-I am Hannah\u2026 und I am zo zorry I keep CJ for so long\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Ceej, nailing a foreigner huh?\u201d Bunnie crinkles her nose, \u201cShe\u2019s cute. German? Kinky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nailing?!\u201d you exclaim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-K-K-Kinky\u2026?\u201d Kate whimpers, falling back into her book with a tomato-red face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were up all night, how you say\u2026 um, eating schockolade.\u201d Hannah answers, completely missing Bunnie\u2019s sexual remarks, \u201cWe made friends, I-I vould like to make friends with you all too\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It honestly didn\u2019t take all that much to make everyone friendly with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was the first one to go, but that really shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. The perfect way to her heart was with food, and food Hannah had in abundance. Once Hannah broke out her backpack full of chocolate bars, Claire already knew that she was going to like this girl. While she wasn\u2019t too keen on her beloved boy toy rooming with another girl, her Mother had assured her that her involvement was crucial in keeping the steady flow of her beloved Hans&amp;Gretel chocolates coming. So sacrifice she would, for the better of herself and her mother\u2026 but mostly for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Hannah actually had a lot in common. Both were two heiresses to very wealthy families, spoiled rotten by their corpulent caregivers. From where they talked, they mostly discussed the hoity-toity business that the rest of you never quite understood. Balls, dances, galas, the works. It seemed blue-bloods could communicate despite the language barrier between them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Bunnie Blake, the big-boobied foodie. Although she admittedly wasn\u2019t much of a big eater, nor a very big fan of sweets, Bunnie audibly exclaimed her immediate love of Hans&amp;Gretel chocolate and went on long spiels at a time regarding just what recipes would go excellently with her new favorite ingredient. Big eater or not, it didn\u2019t stop Bunnie from snacking heartily on the addictive little squares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie liked to talk to Hannah about food, just like she liked to talk about everybody with food. Food was her life, and food was also Hannah\u2019s life. So, in a word, they clicked. Bunnie attempted to limit herself into talking about only German recipes so Hannah would be able to follow the conversation, but when none of them included chocolate Hannah became a little lost. She was very gracious in offering to use the chocolate in recipes for the whole crew, \u201cso long as I get a bite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate fell not too long after, being just as much a chocoholic as Hannah. She found the girl very endearing, and actually did her best to hold up a conversation with her. Something about her being unable to talk to people and Hannah being unable to talk to people (albeit for different reasons: shyness and poor tutelage respectively) just helped coax things along\u2026 in a really, really odd way. No one had ever really seen Kate be sociable before. It was a little off-putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an exchange of friendship, Kate vowed to help Hannah learn English. And in return, Hannah promised Kate German. It was going to be an odd friendship, no one doubted. But it would probably both do them some good. Kate seemed to talk an awful lot about how much she needed a \u201cstudy buddy\u201d these days, so maybe the two of them could hang out together and do that? Yeah, that could work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Becca, poor tsundere that she was, never really quite fell to the charms of Hannah Gretel. There was just\u2026 something about her. Maybe it was the way she looked at you, or how close you two sat, or the way she got all red whenever you talked about her (or for her, you\u2019d gotten quite good at that after your night-bonding over chocolate) but she just didn\u2019t like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that didn\u2019t stop her from eating all that \u201cschokolade.\u201d She just stared daggers at the two of you while she stuffed herself silly. No doubt she and Claire tied for most chocolate eaten. And the way you two seemed so buddy-buddy already\u2026 ooh it steamed her up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, so long as she didn\u2019t try anything and kept up with the nice-nice, what could possibly happen?</span></div></div>",

Your learned sense of worry fired up with thoughts of how late you could be, the limitations of Mrs. Masters\u2019 supposed generosity, and more importantly \u2013 wait, where was Hannah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drowsy delicate hand grasping at your softer middle nearly made you shriek in the most feminine stock horror scream you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had slept in the same bed with a girl you hardly knew. YOU HAVE SLEPT WITH A GIRL IN THE ABSOLUTE MOST DANGERIOUS PLACE FOR THAT SORT OF INFORMATION TO HIT.  The statistical nightmare of what Chaos Theory and your own brand of twisted luck could turn this incident into was enough to kickstart your first heart attack. A benevolent part of your subconscious had the decency to shield you from the thought of more physical involvement in this \u201cworking relationship\u201d. That idea only came several minutes later when you started to admire the view of the husky girl lovingly draped around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it was sort of adorable of how her chocolate stained lips smiled whenever you thought she uttered your name, b-but this was seriously just too much for your still sugar charged teenage mind to rationally compute! You needed to get away, clear your head, and maybe even take a cold shower or five \u2013 just anything to avoid the chance of the entire campus going thermonuclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, a familiar camera flash destroyed any hopes of keeping your nap with the chocolate scion quiet.
