Your sure were lucky that you won that sweepstakes back home. The one that got you this vacation. The sea is a crystal blue, the sun is shining, the fish are jumping, the clouds are thundering.......Wait, Clouds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see some dark clouds on the horizon to the west. You can hear their booming thunder from here. You lay back in your chair, not worrying about it. It'll probably pass right over you, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKATHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning flashes through the sky, as the rain pounds on the ships deck. You were caught unaware by the storm, and try desperately to get to your cabin. You ran across the deck, slipping on the rain soaked surface. You are drenched, it'll take you weeks to get dried again. The storm churns the sea, waves rock the ship back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl across the deck on your belly, trying to get back on your feet. Suddenly, a massive wave rams into the side of the ship, splashing over the deck, sweeping you away with it, across the deck, into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves toss you around through water like a rag doll. You open your mouth to yell for help, but it's filled with salty water. There's no hope for you now. Your vision begins to fade, as you sink below the waves. You stare at the rippling surface of the water as everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can breath again! You open your eyes. You're laying face down on an island beach, you lift your face out of the sand, staring at your surroundings. You have no idea where you could be. You didn't even know if there were any island nearby. On the edge of the beach is thick jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wobbly get up onto your feet and trudge across the beach, still soaking wet. The jungle is lush and humid, with many different animal calls sounding in the distance. You make your way through the jungle, pushing branches and brush aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you step on a pile of palm leaves, you hear a loud cracking sound, as the leaves crumble beneath you, and you fall into a pit. Splintered bamboo and leaves lay all around you as look to the top. The pit is at least ten feet deep, and there is nothing you can use as footholds to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the bottom of the pit for over an hour, hoping someone comes and find you. Then you hear voices. \"Hey! We caught something!\" Staring down at you, is the strangest Creature you've ever seen. It is at least five feet tall, and appears to be a female. It was dressed in a grass skirt, and a leather bra. But the strangest thing, was that it appeared to be a skunk! Or at least, a skunk in a humanoid body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the creatures appeared beside it, this one was a fox. They both carried spears, with golden spearheads. \"What is it?\" The fox asked to the skunk. \"Whatever it is, it is'nt one of us. Therefore, we should take it to our ruler, and let her decide what to with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tie a think vine around wrists, and pull you along with them. You forcefully follow them through the jungle, dreading what might become of you. Suddenly, the jungle breaks, opening a Aztec-like city. They continue to drag you through the city streets, which are populated by more of these furry beings, who stare at you, like they're never seen a human before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bring you to the steps of an enormous, grand palace, big enough to be a city on it's own. They drag you inside, to an elaborate throne room. They force you onto knees, facing the floor. \"My empress.\" Says the skunk. \"We captured this man in the jungle. What shall we do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him to me.\" You hear another voice say. You are forcefully shoved towards the throne. You stumbled as gaze up at the empress. It's another furry, at least five feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what furry is it.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You really didn't like how she had said \"severely punished\" as easily as she had, so you knew that at least for now it would be best to go along with what she wanted, you were far from home, and outnumbered, so as humbly as you could you slid down onto one knee and said \"of course, my lady it would be an honour to serve you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila looked quite pleased with herself as she slowly stood up, \"yes it is quite an honour to serve me\" she says a small smile playing on her lips. She held her hand down to you, \"you may kiss your mistress' hand to show your loyalty\" she says. You take her hand and slightly lift your head so you can kiss it, having to stop yourself from trying to spit due to her fur. You saw Sheila's tail start to slowly sway behind her almost like it was a dog's as she reached down to caress your cheek. \"very good, you will make a fine servant\" she says. She lifts her head up and addresses the rest of the room \"I am going to \"test\" how loyal my new servant is, I want absolute privacy, and am not to be disturbed\" she says before gently tapping you on the shoulder, a sign for you to rise. She starts leaving the room giving no order for you to follow, you do so anyways, as you walked behind her you couldn't help but be entranced by her slender legs, her wide hips and her beautiful tail, all moving from side to side in perfect harmony. While your attention was focused on her well backside, you didn't see her take a glance backwards and smile slightly as she saw you were so enamoured by her body. After a minute of walking she pushes open a large mahogany door, taking a second to beckon you inside which you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room before you was obviously Shela's bedroom, most of the wall opposite the door was taken up by a large 4-poster bed big enough for 3 people, as well as a small nightstand and a small bedside table. One wall was taken up by a dresser and a desk which flanked a small doorway leading out to an open balcony, the final door had a single mahogany door set in the exact middle \"that is my personal bathroom, you and I will be spending a lot of \"alone\" time there as well as my bedroom\" she says without you asking a question. She slowly and seductively walks over to the bed, her hips and tail swinging in that same perfect unison and this time she openly giggled as you gazed. You quickly stopped staring as it was obvious now that she knew you were staring, and you didn't want to be punished, but when you look at her she smiles slightly and waves one hand dismissively. \"I don't mind if you stare\" she states simply \"in fact i'd be quite insulted if you didn't\" she says. She sits down on the bed and pats a spot right next to her \"come sit with me\" she says, you slowly walk over and sit down next to her, nearly jumping out of your skin as you feel her body rest on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady?\" you say a bit confused as to what she wanted you to do. Instead of asking you felt her simply hug herself closer to you, she gave off a small sigh as her weight gently pushed you back onto the bed, and seeing no reason not to, you moved a bit so the both of you were laying fully on the bed. \"My lady, are you alright?\" you say again, really confused as to what she wanted, she had isolated the two of you, made herself vulnerable, you weren't the biggest guy ever but you were bigger than her 5 foot frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Sheila speaks up \"do you like me?\" she asks. The question catches you completely off guard, and you look away for a few seconds, she sounds a little annoyed as she continues speaking \"I said do you like me?\" she repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you are a very beautiful vixen, my lady\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am, do you enjoy watching my cute butt and my luxurious tail sway side to side\" she says, starting to run one clawed finger up and down your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady\" you reply starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about my figure, is it appealing?\" she asks sitting up on your chest giving you a full view of her body. You weren't sure that your voice wouldn't betray you so you nod instead and she smiles reaching down to softly caress your cheek again. \"I am most pleased that you're being so honest with me, and you're so obedient as well, if you keep this up you will be greatly rewarded\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sit up a bit \"my lady, is there anything you need?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila smiles \"not at the moment, all I wish for is your company\" she says. You nod slowly quite content with how things were working out at the moment, it wasn't like she was asking you to do anything difficult, all she was asking was for you to be near her. \"I should inform you of a few things now, so you don't make any mistakes later\" she says lightly stepping off you and sitting down so she was staring at you mostly eye-to-eye. \"First, when you are bathing me, you always go with the flow of my fur, so from head to foot, this applies for when you are cleaning me, and brushing me. Second when you are drying me, you shall dry me as lightly as possible and again it shall be with the flow of my fur, I hate it when my fur gets all poofy. You will accompany me everywhere, and when I say everywhere I mean everywhere, if I am to deliver a speech you will be sitting next to my feet, if I must go to the bathroom you will be right outside waiting for me, do you understand so far?\" she says. You nod , you didn't exactly like getting ordered around but you were appreciative she was telling you this now rather than expecting you to magically know it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not think that just because you are my slave you will be treated poorly, you will have a special place next to me at the dinner table, and since you will always be in my company you will be privy to many of the island's most closely guarded secrets, however if you betray any of these responsibilities, you will not be severely punished, you will lose your head. Do I make myself clear\" she says suddenly becoming very serious. You nod enthusiastically for some reason only in that moment did you understand how much trust she was putting in you. Sheila smiled \"good, now for the special rules between you and me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between me and you, my lady?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila smiles \"yes rules for just when it is the two of us. Rule #1 when it is just us, you will call me Sheila, not my lady\" she says. You nod your understanding, \"rule #2, when I allow you to pet me, you may do so at your leisure as long as I enjoy it, although if you mess up my fur, I will expect you to put it back in place, your are also allowed to...explore me, although only for the purpose of finding where I enjoy being petted most\" she says, and you nod again although you felt a little flustered. She looks around almost like she expected someone to be listening before continuing, \"finally, as a woman, I have certain needs, at times I will ask you to fulfill these needs, at these times, your one objective is my pleasure, I shall not ask you to do anything disgusting but if I ask you to do something such as squeeze my breasts, you shall do so without hesitation, if I say harder you will do so, if I say faster you will go faster, do I make myself clear\" she says. You nod slowly a little dumbfounded about what she had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...Sheila, you'd wish for me to, lay with you?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila nods \"I still have needs, and as my servant you will be expected to fulfill those needs, however as queen I must keep up airs, so on pain of death you will tell no one of this\" she says. You nod slowly telling her you understand her most important instruction before</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The empress vixen hummed and then, to every guard and servant's surprise, she rose from her throne and began to walk towards you. Immediately the skunk who held you started to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady! You don't need to come forward to this weird creature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen closed her eyes and sighed, waving off her loyalist's concerns. \"Now now...this being is something new to this island. It appears to be male and humanoid too...except without fur. Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen was now just feet from you. Although you were unsure of what was going to happen, you remained firm. Seeing her up close, you got a <i>big</i> idea of how big breasts were. She was unbelievably slim and stacked! Her breasts must be at least the size of her head...or even more. What was even crazier was that this empress was about six feet tall which brought your head about to her chest in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe express circled around you before she hummed and put a finger to her lips. She stared at you with narrowed eyes, almost as if trying to investigate him personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not that muscular, aren't you? Tell me, what are you?\" she questioned with curiosity brimming in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow. \"I'm...um...human, maam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a jab to your side. You gasped and fell to one knee. The skunk behind you seemingly hit you without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call the empress before you correctly, scum!\" she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress narrowed her eyes at the skunk. \"Now Mei, I would prefer if you not damage him. It did not seem he meant badly of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk widened her eyes before leaned back and bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my lady,\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took note of the skunk's name. She was definitely quite the feisty one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe the best thing we can do is give this person a home. You came afar, haven't you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly rose, recovering from the skunk's jab. You didn't want to look back but you could practically feel the skunk glaring at you, clearing not trusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did...my lady. My boat crashed while I was on vacation,\" you answered, this time addressing properly for fear by getting hit by the skunk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen chuckled. \"I see. I do not know what you mean by 'vacation'. Regardless, you do not have to force yourself to address me properly. As the empress of this island, some of my loyalist can be a little over-protective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can see that,\" you answered, not daring to look at the skunk behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, for someone unique as you. I feel it isn't proper to not welcome you warmly to our island. We take you in as a part of the anthro life that inhabits this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes. While you were happy to see that you weren't going to be in any danger, you knew that you couldn't stay on this island. Despite the humanoid animals with their fit and beautiful figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...while I'm thankful. I would prefer to leave this island and go back home,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila paused for a moment before her eyes softened and she gave a sad smile. \"I'm afraid I cannot let you go. Even if you traveled her by accident, you're the first being we've seen that is humanoid and different from the rest. Do not be alarmed when I say that you've become a rather prized possession of this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to be polite but inside, you felt rather scared. Prized possession? Was he an item to them all?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen continued. \"You will have to get used to your life here as there is no other options. We would prefer you not to decline as that would result in rather unfortunate events...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered and you could've sworn you heard some venom in her voice. You shakily nodded not wanting to seem disobedient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen smiled once again, happy that you agreed. \"Excellent! Now I know the perfect place you can start settling in which is...\"</span></div></div>",

The look on your new mate's face would be one of exasperation as she slowly closes her eyes; somewhere in her own thoughts she would be trying to come up with a solution. As her eyes open she would be smiling, likely having devised a solution in the short silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the chef get it checked out, and tell the prep staff to put together appetizers. The back-up chef should be here before the people are done with those and it will be like nothing happened...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The throne itself was beautiful: a tall-backed golden creation with flowing scenes of a humanoid animal bestowing a crown upon another such creature in a repeating tale of the divine right of kings. Seated on the throne, conversing with a kangaroo, was a horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mare, with a rich mane of black in ringlets to bolster the chestnut-colored coat, which glistened in the daylight. Her snout ended with a powdering of white, which her humanoid hands and hoof-style feet shared. On the feminine side, her breasts (a full C-cup, you were sure) were kept behind a veil of yellow semi-sheer cloth, giving you a bit of a peep; she also wore a matching double-strap thong, accentuating her hips. Despite the situation, you couldn't help but become aroused by her practically-exposed pussy; her thong was all but molded to her lower lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of man did you catch this time?\" she asked distractedly, still analyzing a sheet of parchment the kangaroo-woman was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>human</i> man, my lady,\" the vixen replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare finally waved off her attendant and rose, and you realized she was as tall as you, an even six feet. She descended from the throne, hooves gently clapping against the polished marble that comprised the small set of stairs in front of the golden seat of power. Her hips swayed as she moved, and you felt yourself grow harder; you were like a submissive about to be disciplined by his dominant mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching you, she stopped and began to visually examine you, paying close attention to your flat abs and moderately-muscular arms. After a moment of thinking, she began to circle you, the fox and skunk stepping back to give her enough room; you noticed her tail was done up into three separate braids, with small emeralds tying off each end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not muscular enough to do any of the hard labor, and not fragile enough to assign clerical work,\" she commented. \"I suppose we <i>could</i> be playful and give him to Atriala to service out in her brothel---\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the skunk-woman lick her lips, eyes glinting with anticipation that her empress will give that very order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"---But he isn't as athletically-refined as the last two we gave her, and she'll complain about having to get him into shape before letting any buyers have their way with him.\" She sighed, and then addressed you. \"What skills do you possess, male?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really rankles you that she refers to you by your sex, not even bothering to ask your name, but you answer her anyway, rattling off some of the finer points of your education. You leave out things like cars and electricity, naturally, since these people clearly don't have any.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress raised an eyebrow when you mentioned your degree in architecture. \"We can use that,\" she said with a nod. \"Joran mentioned just last week that she needs a competent aide to assist with the construction papers, for that new temple, since her last helper almost lost them once and nearly destroyed them another time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her after that first time to take better precautions,\" the vixen muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress waved the remark away. \"It doesn't matter. Wash the male up, dress him properly, and make sure he has a guard when he's escorted to Joran in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Empress Calysta,\" your captors respond, bowing their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now may we please remove these stupid grass skirts?\" the skunk requested angrily. \"I look like such an idiot with it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalysta cocked an eyebrow at her. \"Why are you wearing them to begin with? You don't need camouflage to patrol your own jungle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the fur on her face, you could tell the skunk was blushing furiously. \"Captain Sulla told us to put these on! She said we could better blend into the tall grass if we threw them over ourselves!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalysta rolled her eyes. \"I will speak with the captain about this idiocy, then. Take the male and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you blurted out. \"I wash up after some freak storm on an island with animal-people, who take me hostage and bicker whether to whore me out as a sex toy or work me to death filing papers, with no idea where I am or who the hell any of you are, and you don't even have the decency to ask my name or give me a say in any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot for you to say that: Calysta's voluptuous and scantily-clad body and your previous arousal made it hard for you to keep your voice even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the women stared at you, and then the skunk's face twisted in anger and the fox shifted her spear for a thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalysta, though, merely snorted.  \"You're a male,\" she said disdainfully. \"Your kind has caused enough harm to the world. Females are in charge now, and will remain so until time itself ends.\" She waved her hand. \"Take him away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other two grabbed you by the arms and dragged you away, you caught a glimpse of the ceiling high above and the detailed map painted on it, and realized with a chill that none of the landmasses were the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't just been water-tossed, but space-tossed as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on another goddamn planet.</span></div></div>",

Val asked.

You tried not to worry about the sarcastic tone in her voice, as a group of green robed figures appear soon where you were just at.  It\u2019s defiantly the same group that you escape from, but it seem that they are them.  Most are smaller than the first group, but you see a couple of tall, large figure that just tower over everyone else.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite the party,\u201d Val whistled.  \u201cIf you want to get away, now would be the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her like she crazy, maybe she is. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I am, I was lost\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d Val teased again.  \u201cI could take you up the tree and lose them there, but that a lot of work, I want a good payment.  Or,,, there some pigs to the north of here that have a good hideout.  They haven\u2019t been caught, and I could convince them to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek through the bushes and realized that your hiding spot won\u2019t last much longer.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her body has curves that would leave any porn start with a feeling of inadequacy, with breasts easily twice the size of your head, a slim, toned waist, and hips wider than your torso, with only an extremely form-fitting wine-red robe that honestly looks more like a sling bikini keeping her decent. Emerald green scales cover every inch of the woman's body, with stripes as black as obsidian going down her back. Her legs long and smooth looking, with three toes on each foot equipped with sharp curved talons, and a long, sinuous serpentine tail extends from her rear and coils around the base of her throne.

She uncoils herself from her throne and slithers towards you; as she draws nearer, you realize that she towers over you, your head just barely the same level as her massive tits. \"I will ensure that your sssstay here is a pleassssant one. Scribes!\" She barks to a pair of official-looking fox women wielding scrolls and quills. \"Write down the following proclamation: I, Empressss Jasmin of Anthronia, hereby place the hu-man known as...\" She looks to you expectantly.<br>\r\n\"Um, Jeremy, ma'am.\" You reply.<br>\r\n\"Known as Jeremy under my persssonal protection.

The wolf lady smiles at you warmly, 'Hello there strange human, do you have a name?' You give her your name and she chuckles, 'You look so frightened, you have nothing to be afraid of human, we do not wish to harm you. In fact, it's a blessing that you've come here. You see this island used to be populated by humans and anthros many centuries ago, but one day humanity broke away, claiming to be the dominant species of the planet and left to explore and dominate the rest of the world, little did we and they now, while we all lounged peacefully on this island humanity had already taken a powerful grab at most of the worlds land. So we stayed on this island but the problem was it was customary for the empress' by the way that's me' to marry a human, it was like a trust bond between humans and anthros. The well has run dry so to speak but we have found way of grabbing humans males of interest such as crashing planes in what you humans call the Bermuda triangle.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in shock, 'Wait so we're in'' The wolfess giggles, 'Yep, we are in the exact center of the Bermuda triangle, you've heard of Amelia Earhart right?' You nod your head, 'Of course.' The wolfess continued, 'She was a close friend of my mother. Back then only male humans could fly aircrafts, she thought it would be the perfect opportunity to grab a mate and a king to rule beside, instead she got a lifelong friend' and she crashed the plane of our last king a few weeks afterwards.' This was all amazing to you, 'Wait but how do you crash the planes?' The wolf giggled, 'Magic of course, you humans never did like using magic, always relying on technology, in a way it's a different form of magic, our magic stems a little bit closer to nature than science, facts and data, but they both comes from the same source if you think about it.' She then held out a paw for you to shake, you take her paw, 'I'm Livia by the way' and your new wife.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and pull away, 'What?' Her ears flatten, 'What's wrong, you don't think I'm pretty.' You try to catch yourself, 'No it's not that at all, it's just, I mean' I just got here and' you're a wolf, I'm a human'' She puts a claw up to your lips and hushes you, 'It's ok I understand, humans tend to be a jumpy bunch and this is probably very shocking to you, but I will say this, you WILL be my mate, if you do not so choose then I will have to eat you alive, do you understand. Magic isn't easy to perform and we are not letting you leave this island to threaten our society, nor are we going to let you just live on the island as some kind of guest. You were brought here to serve a purpose and you will serve it.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quiver a bit, for the first time you are noticing the general size difference between you two, Livia being almost seven feet tall. She notices this and her stern expression softens, 'Oh I'm sorry little guy, I didn't mean to scare you, it's just we're kind of afraid of other humans finding us and I need you. I need you as my mate, it's tradition and if I don't have you, who will rule the island?' You're a bit more comforted now even though she also left the part out of you becoming wolf chow if you don't become her husband. You nod your head, 'I'd love to be your husband Livia.' The wolfess chuckles, 'That's empress Livia, but I'll let it slide King (your name).' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, you're kind of glad that you just became king of an island of anthropomorphic animals, even though that sounds kind of freaky. You are snapped out of your thoughts at Livia grabs you and holds you in her furry arms, licking you affectionately, 'My cute little human king. We must begin the ceremony.' You ask her, 'What ceremony?' She grins, 'It's the ceremony that will make you king my dear.' How does the ceremony go?</span></div></div>",

Let us go to the arena, my people are waiting for us.\" She takes you by the hand and leads you deeper into the jungle. On the way there, you start to wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I just arrived, how do your people already know about the fight?\" She chuckles at your question. <br>\r\n\"Simple, I told them that today was the day I took a mate from a wreck and that they should await us in the arena.\" That made sense. \"We're here.\" She says, pointing to a large coliseum like the one in Rome. She leads you through a back door guarded by 2 anthro lionesses, to a hallway intersection. She stops and turns to you. \"This is where we must part for now. You go down the left path to your dressing room, there will be attendants there if you need anything. They will tell you when it's time. I will see you soon my love.\" With that, she walks down the right path, presumably to her own room. You do as you are told and follow the left side to your room. Inside were 2 cougar girls wearing nothing more than golden bikinis. They walk towards you with sway in their hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my sister, looks like our queen sunk her fangs into a cute one.\" The first says with a purr in her voice. \"Indeed sister, now then mister...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name)\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name), it is our duty to help strip you and provide to any need you have until the fight starts.\" At that, she begins to pull at the belt of your pants while her sister works on your shirt. Before you could even comprehend what they were doing, they had already stripped you to as naked as the day you were born. The cougars looked at what was between your legs and began to lick their lips. \"A cute one <i>with</i> a nice package to boot? Queen Livia got quite the catch.\" You blush at the compliment. \"Is there anything else you require?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I should be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. You should make your way to the starting door. We will inform the queen that you are ready.\" They leave the room while you walk towards what you can only assume is the right way. You see a doorway leading somewhere, looking outside you see a stadium full of anthro girls cheering, waiting for the event to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the field, you see Livia walking out, just as naked as you were, her hips swaying and breasts bouncing with every step. She stops and looks to clear her throat. \"Ladies, as you are all aware, today is the day I have chosen my mate and your king. As is tradition, my new husband and I will battle before you to celebrate our newfound unity. Here he is now, your new king, (Your name).\" You tak that as your cue and walk out to the hoots and whistling of the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the fight play out?</span></div></div>",

However, you find that your efforts are in vain as not only is she still standing, she is completely unmoved from when the match started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was her turn to attack. Removing her arm from your grip, she wraps it and it's partner around you, pinning your arms to your sides and squeezing you in a tight bear hug and forcing your face into her breasts. She then starts leaning her body forward, giving you bedroom eyes while she does so. This forces you to lean back in turn. Eventually, your legs give out from the strain and you fall on your back with her landing on top of you, the impact of which knocks the air out of your lings for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you now on the ground, she releases her grip on you and sits up on your chest. She wraps her legs around your head and puts you in a scissor-lock, forcing your head up against her dripping snatch. Meanwhile, the audience was loving watching their queen turn you into her punching bag slash sex toy. You look into the audience and even see some getting themselves off on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia decides it's time to end it. She let's go of your head and repositions herself around your left arm. Uh oh. You don't know much a wrestling, but you know what's coming next. She pulls your arm straight, putting you in an armbar. The pain was immense, but judging by the loving look in her eyes you assume that she is holding back to not cause any permanent damage. Meanwhile, she pushes her padded paw in your face. The paws themselves seemed clean based on the smell and the pads were soft, but it was still humiliating to be in this position. Coupled with the pain of the armbar, you decide to tap out with your free arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and the crowd cheers again. Livia releases your arm and begins to stand up. You start to do the same, but Livia pushes you back down and sits on your chest. All around you you hear the crowd chant. \"Submit. Submit. Submit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Livia, what's going on here?\" You ask to end your confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, when the fight is over, the loser must commit a display of public submission to the winner. Upon completion, we will be officially mates. The act is chosen by the winner every time. For us, I choose...\"</span></div></div>",

You start by kissing your way around her inner thighs. This makes her let out a moan of satisfaction as her legs tighten around your head. You move things along before she starts to crush your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her outer lips a lick all the way up, making her shudder in pleasure. You kiss and lick your way up and down her lips until you decide it's time for the big part. Taking a deep breath, you dive in and pierce her pussy with your tongue. She lets out a moan that echoes throughout the arena. You rub your tongue all around her inner walls, all the while her moaning is all you hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd must be taking a liking to the show. What was previously just a handful of women masterbating turned into a lesbian orgy. The anthros in the audience were masterbating, eating each other out, 69ing, full-on lesbian sex. Perhaps as queen Livia gave off some sort of aphrodisiac pheromone when she was aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a question for later. You saw your final target, her clit. You reposition yourself and begin to suckle on it like a child feeding from his mother. That did it. With one last deafening shriek, Livia came into your mouth. The crowd joined in as they were all climaxing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, she got off you and pulled you to your feet. She grabbed your hand and raised it up like a champion. \"Ladies, your new king.\" With a final cheer from the crowd, Livia leads you to her dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, wasn't it?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apart from the fact that I'm still sore from that armbar, it was a blast.\" You joke. She gives you a look of both lust and concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, did my new mate get hurt? We can always go back to my privileged chambers and I can look at it. Or, I could send you to the royal masseuse. She can<i>take care</i> of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't I your mate now? Doesn't that mean me and my... parts are for your use only?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. You see, males are rare on this island. While we have mating rituals like these, they are mostly to determine priority. You can fuck my whole village until none of them can walk straight, but when I say 'Fuck me', I expect you as my mate to answer the call without hesitation.\" That all made sense you guess. \"So, who will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

As you pass, the anthros around you stop what they are doing and cheer their queen and her new king. You see several of them sizing you up, licking their lips at the sight of you. It was only then that you realized that you were both still naked from the fight. You blush and try to cover yourself, making the women around you start to giggle at your modesty. \"Do not worry,\" Livia starts, \"we are a clothing optional society. You will not be judged for roaming in public nude. <i>Besides, with what you're packing,you certainly have little to be ashamed of.</i>\" She whispers in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally brings you to your destination, a massive palace on the other side of the village. The walk here was by no means uneventful.

You explained your story to her, wondering what would happened when you were finished.  \"Let me fill you in.\" the bear said \"You are on the island of Furonia.  I am their ruler, Pirene.  We have been living here for many years, hidden from your kind.  We intend to keep it that way, so I'm afraid you won't be leaving.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaimed, but Pirene ignore you.

As she came closer, you could see she was a foot taller than you were, bringing your head up to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in toward you, examining you.  \"Excuse me, maam.\" you said nervously \"But would you mind telling me where I am?\".

I am the ruler Conjota.\".  \"It's nice to meet you.\" you replied.  \"How exactly did you come upon my island?\" Conjota asked.  \"I was accidently swept onto the shore during a storm.\" you said.  \"So your not from here.\" Conjota said \"Then it wouldn't be fitting to take you in as part of the anthro life that inhabits this island.\".  You were surprised to hear this.  \"I am thankful, but I'd much rather leave the island and go back home.\".  Conjota's eyes softened as she gave a sad smile.  \"I'm afraid that won't be possible.\" she said gently \"It would be extremely difficult to find your way back.\".  Your face fell at this, but Conjota caressed your chin and smiled.  \"Trust me, I'm sure you'll enjoy life her much more than before.\". she said.  You smiled, knowing you would be given a home.  Conjota then walked up to the skunk and fox that had brought you here.  \"So what do you plan to do with him, your highness.\" the skunk asked, looking at you suspiciously.

Rishina walked up to the edge of the bed and gestured for you to sit down.  You sat down, surprised at how soft the bed was.  You looked at Rishina, who was smiling at you.  You smiled slightly before you looked down and sighed deeply.  \"Is something wrong, my dear?\" Rishina asked.  You sighed a second time and looked at the female raccoon.  \"I guess I'm just a little overwhelmed by everything that's happened so far.\" you replied \"One minute, I'm thrown into the sea.  Next thing I know, I'm taken in by a group of animal women living on an unknown island and they make me their leader.\".  Rishina giggled and replied \"You have no need to worry, my love.  I assure you you'll do just fine.\".  You smiled and looked into her bright green eyes.  Rishina then rose from the bed and pulled you toward her.  \"Come, my dear.\" she said, smiling \"There's something I'd like to show you.\".

The pool was completely filled with water and was apparently heated, judging by the steam rising off of the waters surface, creating a thick mist that filled the room.  There were also several small cabinets next to the tub.  \"This is my private hot tub.\" the female raccoon said \"Would you care to join me?\".  You shrugged, blushing slightly.  \"There's no need for you to worry.\" Rishina said, smiling and caressing your chin \"I assure you it'll be very relaxing.\".  You nodded in agreement.  You could use some time to relax after everything you'd been through so far.  You watched as Rishina slipped out of her pink silk dress, revealing more of her shapely figure.  You watched as she stepped into the tub.  She then gestured for you to come in as well.  You slowly stepped into the tub, the water coming just up to your waist.

She lifted it up, revealing a hole just big enough for you to slip through.  \"You go first.\" Rishina whispered.  You nodded and slid your feet into the hole's opening.  You then dropped into the hole and fell for several seconds before you landed with a soft thump.  You looked around at the room you were in.  There were several lit torches, allowing just enough light to see.  You could see that there were several tunnels that branched off from this room.  You heard a soft clatter from above, followed by Rishina landing next to you.  \"Are you OK, dear?\" Rishina said as she rose to her feet.  \"I'm fine.\" you replied \"But where are we?\".  \"This room connects to various underground passageways that lead all over the island.\" Rishina said, grabbing one of the torches.  \"Are you the only one that knows about this?\" you asked as Rishina led you into one of the tunnels.  \"Yes.\" Rishina replied \"My mother, who was empress before me, knew about them as well.  She often used them as shortcuts to reach the areas of the island where we find food.\".  You nodded in response as you followed the female raccoon through the narrow tunnel.  Several minutes later, you reached the end of the passage.  Rishina pushed on a rock covering the exit hole above you.  You both climbed out and looked around you.

Your mouth drops open in shock; you kind of expected something like this, but not so fast. Nevertheless, despite the fact that this is a cow that's putting the moves on you, you begin to feel a distinct shifting in the downstairs region of your body - given your position crushed against her immense chest, Victoria feels it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks to me like you're raring to go, little man.\" She croons, extracting you from between her immense breasts and taking your hand, leading you into a doorway located behind your throne. \"Come; the night is young, is it not? Let's not waste it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly able to believe that you aren't in some crazy dream, you quicken your steps to keep up with the massive cow-woman, your dick straining to escape the confines of your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria leads you down a wide hallway lined with plush carpeting and with torches set in the walls; as you walk, you take the opportunity to get a good look at the empress - your mate, you realize with no small amount of giddiness. The first thing you notice about her is the height - you're a tall man, around six and a half feet tall, but Victoria is towering over you by at least two feet. Her thick figure, easily visible through the thin fabric of her robe, resembles that of an ancient fertility goddess come to life - wide hips with an ass that you could cover more than your hips if she sat down on you, a small soft belly, waist not thin or fat, thighs thicker around half your torso. Finally, your eyes drift higher up to her breasts - seems that you saved the best part for last. Sticking out in front of her like a great doughy shelf, they display none of the stiffness associated with breast implants, instead proudly jiggling and bouncing with her every step like great bags of Jell-O three times the size of your head. Her nipples are proudly standing up underneath the black cloth, each one almost as wide around as your thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes away from your wife's immense tits (You still can hardly believe that you got this lucky), you let your eyes roam up and down the rest of the empress' body. Her figure is thick, yes, with considerable padding around her arms, legs, back, and, well, her everywhere, but you can still see quite a bit of muscle underneath those juicy curves. In terms of other features, it's pretty obvious that Victoria isn't human: her body is covered in relatively thin, smooth fur, dark orangey brown on the back and milky white on her front, her thick legs end in cloven hooves instead of feet, and each hand ends in three thick fingers and a thumb, each tipped with a large dull hoof-like nail. Her head is unmistakably that of a cow, complete with a pair of foot-long upwards-curving horns, but her facial features are still somewhat human - emerald green forewards-facing eyes, somewhat higher forehead, etc. - and a full head of long, rich dark brown hair tumbles down to a little past her shoulders.<br>\r\nYou can tell that the empress knows you're staring - as she walks, she starts swaying her hips with every step, causing her immense behind to jiggle slightly, causing a fresh bout of straining from your little 'volunteer' to escape the oppressive bonds of your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach a large, round room, most of which is taken up by an immense round bed, piled high with pillows and blankets. It looks incredibly comfortable, but something tells you that sleep isn't in your immediate future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little man, let's begin.\" Victoria coos into your ear as she enters, giving your butt a light squeeze as she walks by. You hurriedly cast off your shirt and pull off your pants, letting your cock spring out fully erect. The empress smiles and licks her lips seductively at the sight of your proudly erect penis, a lusty chuckle escaping her as you quickly toss your shoes and socks to the floor. \"My turn now,\" She lows, reaching for the first button on her robe.<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, she peels the black fabric from her body, letting it fall to the floor behind her as she stands before you in all her naked glory, causing more than a little bit of pre to dribble out from your cock. Looking down at her nethers, you can see that her vagina is already leaking quite a bit - she's just as excited for this as you are.<br>\r\n\"Come, my little king.\" Victoria orders seductively, sitting down upon her mammoth bed and beckoning with one finger. \"It's time for your... <i>coronation</i>.\"<br>\r\nYou dash over to the bed as fast as you can, your dick raring to sink itself into the cow's juicy pussy. But how to start your royal 'coronation'?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lounging on the throne in front of you is a massive blend of woman and crocodilian. Dark green scutes and scales cover her back like armor, with dirty yellow scutes protecting her front, which sports a truly huge pair of breasts nearly twice the size of your head. Partially see-through silvery robes hug the woman's body closely, barely concealing her curvy, muscular body. A long crocodilian tail extends from just above her wide hips and ample rear end, and four sharp claws sprout from each of her feet. Similar sharp talons adorn the tips of the crocodile-woman's fingers, and she clutches a simple wooden staff carved to look like a rearing cobra on the top, its inset ruby eyes seemingly boring into yours. Her head is crown with a golden tiara studded with lapis and jade, and sports an elongated snout bristling with razor-sharp teeth. Above all, though, two piercing slit-pupiled yellow eyes gaze down at you, burning like twin pits of molten gold in the absolute best poker face you have ever seen. You can't help but feel intimidated by the reptilian woman's gaze, like a mouse staring down a tiger. Even if the skunk-woman hadn't said that this was the empress of wherever it was you've gotten stuck in, you would easily be able to figure it out - the crocodile-woman practically <i>oozes</i> royalty from every cell of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo mystified are you by the empress' gaze that you don't hear the skunk woman talking until she jabs you in the side with the butt of her spear.<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" You protest.<br>\r\n\"Snap out of it, stranger.\" The warrior snaps, glaring down at you as if you just insulted her mother. \"I asked you a question. What. Are. You?\"<br>\r\n\"Not someone who takes orders from you, Captain Hardass,\" You snap back. \"How does that stick up your ass feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-you insolent cur!\" The skunk shouts, drawing her spear. \"I should gut you like a fish for your rudeness!\" You start to go into a sweat; you have a habit of mouthing off when your scared, and your big fat mouth just might have won you a free impaling<br>\r\n\"Stand down, Captain Silora.\" The crocodile woman interjects; despite her bestial appearance, her voice is as clear and smooth as a running stream. <br>\r\nImmediately, your captor snaps to attention, her head cast downwards. \"Yes, Empress Sebekali,\" She replies, clearly ashamed with herself at being rebuked by her monarch. Huh. So she actually was a captain - probably of the guard or something, given the spear.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" The queen replies, rising from her throne and slowly walking towards you - as she does so, you suddenly notice just how tall this 'Sebekali' really is: she easily towers over you by at least a couple of feet, and you're not exactly short. The empress leans down to get a better look at you, giving you a very nice view of her cleavage that you desperately try not to look at.<br>\r\n\"You are a strange one, no doubt about that.\" She muses, cupping your chin and looking you over with what you could swear is a gleam of amusement in her yellow eyes. \"But you are an interesting one nonetheless.\"<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" You manage to say, mentally slapping yourself even as the words leave your mouth. Idiot! Could you have <i>possibly</i> sounded even more boring?!<br>\r\n\"You are very welcome.\" Sebekali replies. She reaches behind your back; with a flick of her claws, your bonds are cut through, and the crocodile-woman offers you a hand to pull you up. <br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, ma'am-uh, Your Highness.\" You hesitantly reply, accepting the extended hand and standing back up. Now that you're upright again, you can definitely confirm it: yep, she is <i>definitely</i> taller than you by at least a couple of feet, your eyes coming up just below her massive mammaries. You file away the question of how a reptile can even have those for another day and tear your eyes away from the empress' breasts to look up at her face - shockingly, she actually <i>smiles</i> a little bit at your slight blush. <br>\r\n\"You are welcome, stranger.\" The crocodile woman replies. \"Now, I believe that a more... proper introduction is in order. I am Empress Sebekali Aruwa, Thirty-sixth imperial ruler of the kingdom of Anthroparis. What is your name, strange one, and what manner of being are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, I-I'm... I'm John. John Harris, Jr.\" You manage to stammer out. \"I'm a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebekali's eyebrows (Or, well, the ridges where her eyebrows would be) raise at this. \"Really?\" She asks, her curiosity piqued. \"A human? And... where did you come from, if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n\"From the sea, Your Highness.\" You reply truthfully - you don't think that lying is going to go over well with this woman, especially considering all those teeth of hers. \"I was out sailing, and a storm blew me here, wrecking my ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, Silona lets out a gasp, her spear clattering to the floor in shock. \"Y-you mean...?\" She asks.<br>\r\nThe empress nods sagely. \"So it seems. It is as the prophecy foretold: In the dawn of the thirty-sixth empress' reign, the son of Harris shall come from the sea and...\"</span></div></div>",
