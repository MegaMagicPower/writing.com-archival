However unlike most Quarians whom could finish their pilgrimage by just buying a new shuttle, some spare ship parts, among any other number of things, that would be of use to the fleet. She had to stick to a higher standard, for she was not only one of the brightest Quarians to ever live, but also the daughter of one of the admirals, therefore in order to end her pilgrimage she would have to bring back something big, something life changing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working for 2 years in different ships as a mechanic, tali was finally able to save enough money to buy a small busted up ship, that should be in a junkyard, however thanks to her expertise, she was able to patch it up enough to make it space worthy, which was enough for what she needed it. during her pilgrimage Tali started to research possible ways to increase the efficiency and power of mass effect powered FTL, that if successful would allow the ships of the quarian fleet to travel using only a small fraction of their fuel, not to mention that it will also allow them to go explore further regions without having to use the mass relays. so after running simulations and designing  an engine that increases the potency of Ezo along with boosting its effects, she made the proper adjustments to her ship and was ready to try it out. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo here she is now in her ship, ready to try out her experimental engine. After making sure all her systems were ok she fired up her FTL engines. at first everything seemed to be working just fine, and according to the ships computer, the adjustments she made to the ships engines were working just as she had hoped. Tali was elated that her hard work had, 'as the humans say \"Bore fruits\". she was cheering and jumping on her sit, happy as can be, until her ship Shook violently, almost throwing her off the sit. she managed to recompose herself and immediately checked her ships computer. what she saw made her turn pale. apparently a sun along the route she had set had released a massive concentrated solar flare as her ship was speeding by. the radiation expelled from the flare in turn, short circuited some of the engines systems and caused an anomaly withing the Ezo core, that was in turn making the engines leak an unknown type of radiation throughout the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tali could get out of her sit and head for engineering, the ship started shaking violently. Tali looked up at her computer screen and saw that the radiation was making her ship go far faster than ever recorded and the anomaly in the Ezo core was encompassing the entire ship now. from the readings her computer were giving her, she could infer that whatever was happening to her ship, it was giving off the same energy readings of a wormhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Tali was about to try to get up again, her ship became engulfed by a bright light unlike anything she has ever seen. next thing she knows her ship came out of FTL right above the orbit of a garden planet. Tali tried to sit upright but then her engine exploded and shook the ship so violently, that Tali's sit buckle came undone and she ended hitting her head hard against the ceiling of the cockpit. her vision started blackening. there was nothing she could except watch as everything was been encompassed in darkness. But just before the darkness swallowed everything, she could see the garden world getting bigger....at that moment her only thought was*Keelah... I knew I should have bought a newer ship instead of this piece of  bosh'tet'. a second later she knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They did not run, nobody moved a muscle, every man woman and child did nothing but stare up in awe at the goddess that  descended from the stars. Suddenly the ground beneath everbodies feet jumped up, and the whole city shook from a disasterious earthquake, to some it was the greatest earthquake they had ever felt.  Concrete And building walls started to crack and break open and every glass window in the whole city broke. Nobody knew that this all happened simply because the giantess Ahsoka was getting on her knees. To every bodies horror the giant face got even more gigantic as Ahsoka  brought her face even closer. To everyone\u2019s surprise they saw the giantess lips start to move, to pucker. By the time everyone knew what was happening it was to late. Raging winds started the overwhelm the whole city, winds stronger than any class 5 hurrican, buildings started to tumble and fall, and people who where exposed on the street where sent flying 100\u2019s if not 1000\u2019s of feet in the air, many died on impact with the ground, the extremely lucky ones would not ever move again, for their nerves were damaged without hope of ever recovering. <br>\r\nAhsoka saw that the small shiny object barley even the size of a inch to her started to tumble and fall. Black fumes started to ascend up to her face, fumes coming from the tiny object. Ahsoka knew these fumes well from her days fighting on the front lines. It was \u201csmoke!\u201d Ahsoka said with a surprised voice. All of a sudden Ahsoka put her hand on her head, as if she was having a headache. \u201cA disturbance in the force.\u201d Ahsoka said confused. At that moment Ahsoka new something was wrong, someone, no a lot of people died just recently, but where? Ahsoka looked at the tiny object. \u201cNo it couldn\u2019t be\u201d. Ahsoka said with doubt, but she had to be sure. Ahsoka calming herself down and breathing  concentrated on the force and reached out toward the small object with her feeling. She saw it, buldings on fire, the ground ripped apart, men women and children on the ground laying dead or crippled. She heard it, the screams of thousand of people as they ran in fear, or the screams of people trapped in the fallen buildings, and the cries of thousands of people, crying over their lost loved ones. Ahsoka opens her eyes in shock. \u201cOh no what have I done.\u201d Ahsoka said, but before she could do anything she sees something coming towards her, something flying towards her face, something, tiner than a Grain of sand. Little did she know that this was a helicopter and inside was the president of the United States.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Earth had been under the rule of the Incurseans for quite some time now. With the raw power of the titanic mutated To'kustars under the control of the Incursean empire, they had seized control of the earth in a matter of hours. But this was about to change. Our hero, the young Benjamin Tennyson, had returned from hiding to wrest control of his home planet back from the slimy Incursean emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur hero had been fighting the mutant To'kustars (or \"waybads\" as he nicknamed them) for some time now. currently, he was fighting one-on-one with a female waybad. This was the first one he had seen back when the invasion of the incursions started. Ben hated to admit it, but she was putting up one hell of a fight. Ben was the better fighter but a combination of his fatigue and her wild strength meant they were on almost even footing. The evenness of the brawl lasted until Ben finally landed a good hit on the waybad. She blocked with her arm, but the hit was so strong that it caused her to fall backward. When the hit landed, an audible crunch sound was heard, not the sound of a broken bone, but more like hitting a cell phone with a hammer. Ben had neither the time to notice or care, he pressed his advantage and kept up the fight with his adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his grounded warship, Lord Emperor Milleous was watching the fight unfold. With every hit Ben landed his patience grew thinner. \"That's enough!\" the Incersean commander bellowed. \"Psychobos, I thought you said the To'kustars were under your control! Why haven't you sent any more at him?\" Dr. Psychobos hesitated, knowing that his Employer would not like his answer. \"Well, you see, every To'kustar in the immediate vicinity, aside from the one fighting, is incapacitated. Bu-\" \"Incapacitated? You said yourself that these mutants would be more than enough power to keep control of earth! I don't enjoy being lied to, Psychobos.\" The alien scientist knew that with how well Ben was fighting and how mad Milleous was getting that it was time to use his last resort plan. \"Well, Lord Emperor Milleous, there is a weapon in our arsenal that we can use to permanently destroy that hero, and I use the term loosely.\" \"Well, why haven't you used it yet?\" \"You see, to power it, we must take all the energy from the mutant To'kustars using a device I planted on each and every one of them. So, powering the weapon will render every To'kustar... useless afterward.\" \"Then do it! Anything that'll get rid of that annoying Tennyson kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had his opponent on the ropes, despite the fact that she was fighting with the fury of a wild bull. Ben prepared to finish his opponent when his attention was stolen by mysterious purple wisps floating through the air. The To'kustar stopped to look as well. It didn't take either of them long to realize that the wisps were coming out of the mouths of the fallen To'kustars, and all heading in the same direction. The waybad saw this as something threatening her kin, so her instincts directed her to follow the odd purple wisps. \"Hey, we weren't done here!\" Ben shouted after her. The waybad ignored him and kept her attention on the wisps. Ben decided to follow them too. There was no one left to fight, and something was clearly going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them arrived at the Incursean warship, seeing the wisps travel into some sort of glass-like sphere filled with purple energy on the outside of the ship, which was clearly connected to a worryingly large gun. The Incursean emperor and mad scientist inside grinned ear to ear noticing that Ben walked right to them just as the weapon was almost charged. Not only that, but one of the waybads was with him, and she could hold him in place for an easy shot. But...wait. she was walking towards the ship. To the capacitor, in fact. Dr. Psychobos pounded on the manual controls, but she wasn't stopping. She attacked the glass orb with all of her might, truly believing that she could free her kin by doing so. Ben saw her swinging at the ship and decided not to question her abrupt change of heart. Ben joined in on the pummeling of the warship, focusing more on the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dozens and dozens of strikes, the capacitor was almost broken. The incursions tried to send fighter ships to bring down the two to'kustars, but it proved ineffective. Ben just swatted them away, and the waybad carried on as if nothing was happening. Suddenly, with one last well-placed strike, the glass sphere burst open. A large hole was left in the ship, and Ben was knocked onto his back. However, the one who took the blast directly was the waybad, but it did not harm her. She had mistaken the wisps as the souls of the other To'kustars. They were actually the energy and power of the To'kustars focused into a small area. She had just been hit with the raw power of all the mutant To'kustars on the planet, and she absorbed every last drop. The sudden energy caused her to almost instantly blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few short minutes, the To'kustar woke up. Her head felt a bit fuzzy, but she managed to sit up. She looked at her surroundings and noticed they were... different in some way. The reason it looked different was that she had grown to impossibly huge proportions due to absorbing the combined power of all the To'kustars on earth. All of this energy made her grow to a staggering size of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waybad rubbed her eyes and looked at her surroundings. Everything was really flat save for a few small bumps. The ground was covered by what she thought was grass that was cut very low to the ground. Upon closer inspection, she could see grey patches and lines here and there. Waybad stood up to get a better look. She saw the land turn to water some ways away to the left and right, but up and down went on long enough that she could only see land. It was an odd place, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ground, Ben had also recovered from the blast. He stared up to the sky in disbelief, the waybad which once matched his height stretched far up into the sky. Just looking up at her made him dizzy. A familiar beeping sound played and Ben transformed from waybig back to his normal human form. He looked up again, now significantly shorter. \"Wow, that didn't even make a difference. Just how big did she get?\" \"Ben!\" A familiar shout came from behind him. The voice belonged to his grandfather, Max Tennyson. \"We need to get back to the plumber's base. We can't fight that thing right now, not even with waybig.\" \"You don't have to tell me twice.\" Ben retreated with his grandfather, hoping to find some way to deal with this new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaybad decided to investigate one of these small grey patches on the ground, getting on her hands and knees to get a closer look. They weren't just grey parts of the landscape, there were rectangular bits rising up from the ground, and many of them were grey. Were they odd rock formations? No, these were too geometric. They looked like the buildings from the city she was in before. Then it clicked for her. That WAS the city she was in before. It had the same layout, the same structures, the only thing that was different was... well, the size of it. Waybad was confused about how it happened, but she now knew she must be absolutely massive...and she kinda liked it. She relished in the power she got from being the size of a building, but now the buildings were the size of bugs. How small would the humans be to her now, she wondered. Her eyes fell to a large green object at the edge of the city. After a moment, she recognized it. It was the warship of the incurseans, the army that had forcefully conscripted and mutated her and her people, then stole their spirits to charge some weapon. She simply could not let such an awful structure stand. Waybad stood up to her full height and slipped her right foot out of its boot. She cautiously lowered it onto the green warship, taking care not to step on anything else, she was only after the ship... for now. Every Incursean on the ship was still recovering from the blast, which damaged a portion of the ship. That would soon become the least of their worries as a massive toe descended from the sky and crushed the ship completely flat without even being slowed down by the largest war vehicle built by the incursean empire. She smirked at her handiwork and returned her foot to her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paced back and forth trying to come up with something, anything that he could do to fight the super-sized waybad. \"it's a wonder that she hasn't just destroyed everything. The waybads seemed to love that pastime.\" His grandfather offered his thoughts. \"Well, our guys monitoring the situation said that she did destroy the incursean warship, which was that tremor from earlier, but she seemed to be careful not to touch anything else.\" \"So, what? You think she doesn't want to destroy everything?\" \"It's possible. If she can target something specific instead of just wildly destroying things then she might have mentally returned to a point before her mutation when she was capable of higher thought. If so, maybe we can reason with her.\" \"How can we reason with her when she's that big? There's no way she could hear us.\" Max thought for a moment. \"We do have one option. A while ago, the plumbers got their hands on the prototype of a large ship meant for advertising at space stations and repurposed it so it could be used as a city-wide warning system. It's got a screen that's almost as wide as a mile and speakers so loud a whole city could hear it. We should be able to use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaybad was lounging around, lying on her back. she didn't crush any cities, but she was certainly blocking many highways. The humans on the ground that were on said highways saw an impossibly high wall of grey flesh if they were lucky, and got crushed under that wall if they weren't. Waybad was thinking of what she should do now that she was even bigger than before. She had already destroyed the incurseans, now she was thinking about taking a dip in the ocean. She was chuckling to herself thinking about walking in and the water only being as deep as a wading pool. Her attention was taken by a quiet voice to her right, she turned her head and saw a small object in the air. It was a spaceship with a screen facing towards her displaying an old human in a red shirt with a flower pattern. The man spoke to her. \"My name is Magister Maxwell Tennyson of the plumbers.  on behalf of the earth, I would ask what your intentions are here. Waybad smirked. \"Now, why would I need to tell a bug what my intentions are, hm?\" An additional voice came from the ship's speakers, but they were off-screen. \"Woah, woah. Not cool.\" \"Who was that. Hey, you. Guy who just spoke. Show yourself.\" Ben stepped into frame confidently, feeling a lot braver now that the screen made her look closer to his size. \"Oh, hey. You were that guy I was fighting earlier today. Ben 10, the famous protector of earth. Hey, we never did finish our fight. Want I rematch? I bet you I'd win.\" Ben knew she would, so he changed the subject to something that would hurt his ego less. \"Just tell us what you want, c'mon.\" \"What I want? That's simple. I want...</span></div></div>",

So I want you to come out here and let me toy with you a bit.\" \"Yeah, that's not gonna happen.\" \"oh, that's too bad. I guess I'll just have to stomp on that little city of yours to entertain myself. instead\" Ben hesitated \"you can't be serious. You'd destroy an entire city just for amusement?\" \"Well, when you're this big most things become inconsequential and boring. Things need to be on a grand scale to amuse me even a little given how tiny they all are. But you're special, Ben. You amuse me without being a life-ending disaster. So let me play with you, and I'll leave the city be.\" Ben thought for a moment, trying to come up with an alternative of some sort. But there was none. The waybad had him in checkmate, so he made the only heroic decision he could. \"Fine, I'll do what you want.\" \"Excellent. Come to the east end of that little city of yours and make sure you turn into waybig. Otherwise, you might just be too small to see.\" Waybad giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had arrived where Waybad had asked him to go, about as ready as he could ever be for something like this. \"Well, here we go, I suppose.\" He said scrolling through the options on the omnitrix. He stopped when he reached waybig and pressed the button. Ben was now as large as he could get, and he waited for Waybad to arrive. After only a short amount of time, he heard a booming noise and felt the ground shake beneath him. The tremors were rhythmic, and he could tell they were Waybad's footsteps. A shadow was cast over him. He knew what he'd see when he looked up, but he knew he had to. When he craned his head up to the sky, his vision was almost completely filled by the face of the Waybad, grinning ear to ear. \"glad you could make it, little hero. Here, climb up on my finger and we can have some fun.\" Waybad lowered her hand to the ground, it was the size of a small city by itself. her pinky finger was extended and it was clear what she wanted Ben to do. Though it was her smallest finger laid flat on the ground, it was still significantly larger than Ben. He still thought he could get to the top. He got a small running start and used all the strength that came with his To'kustar form to leap as high as he could. He managed to grab the upper part of her pinky finger, though he still had to pull himself up. It took him a while, but he managed to get up to the top. The whole time this was happening, Waybad was watching. She was amused at how much effort it took Ben to climb to the top of one of the smallest points of her body. She found it adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ben was safe atop her finger she slowly rose it up to her face. \"Wow, you're so tiny. It makes you like cute, Ben. Ooh! Hey, why don't you turn back to your human form and I'll see if you're still visible?\" Ben reluctantly complied and turned back to his normal form. After his transformation back to a human Waybad lost track of him. She squinted and brought her hand closer to her face, making Ben feel quite insignificant. \"Now where did you go, little guy?\" She said as she scanned her multi-mile wide hand for her new toy. Her eyes finally landed on a small speck, something she would've never seen if she hadn't been looking for it. \"Oh, I think I found you. You look like a little dot on my hand. Now, what to do with you?\" She thinks for a moment before settling on...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Ben feels the ground underneath him tilt as Waybad turns her hand forward. Ben plummeted downward at great speeds. Instinctively, he reached for his omnitrix, figuring he could dial in jetray or something before he hit the ground since Waybad was holding him up and he was, therefore, dozens of miles in the air. He didn't have enough time to select anything, as he soon landed in a big, soft area that surrounded him on all sides. He was dropped between Waybad's breasts. Waybad, giggling happily, layed back down on the same spot she lounged at before. All of the highways she laid on were closed off at this point, her very presence causing great disruptions to millions of commuters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wriggled his way out of his squishy prison to the point where he could poke his head out of the Waybad's cleavage. His respite was short-lived, as Waybad quickly began squeezing her sizeable bosoms together. Ben resisted at first but eventually couldn't resist the amazing full-body massage he was getting. He was beginning to warm up to the idea of this \"toy\" thing. \"Haha. Are you enjoying yourself, Ben?\" She didn't wait for a reply, she just kept mashing her multi-mile diameter breasts together. Ben was so small that she couldn't even feel him, but she knew he was there, which excited her greatly. The greatest hero in the universe was trapped between her massive funbags, and she could do whatever she wanted to the microscopic hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an amazing few minutes of breast hugging, waybad thought of a couple of ways to spice things up. She stopped her squishing for a moment and pulled her cleavage open a bit. Though he was too tiny to be seen, Ben was right between the two large orbs of flesh, in the greatest state of euphoria he had ever felt. \"Hey, Ben. I want to have a talk with you. Can you transform to get up to my ear and talk, or something?\" \"Ben heard her loud and clear, and he had a better idea than that. He still had access to the advertisement ship. He could access it with his omnitrix the same way he talked to other plumber communicators. The large ship flew next to the massive To'kustar's face. \"Hey, Waybad! Over here!\" Waybad turned her head, she saw the face of her new cute toy on the screen of that ship from before. \"Oh, Ben! Good idea! Hey, while you're here. How were my tits? Amazing, right?\" \"Yeah, absolutely\" Ben blurted out. This made Waybad giggle. \"Well, since you loved them so much, I was thinking of some ways to take it further, and I wanted to give you the option of which you would prefer.\" \"Oh, nice. Well, what did you have in mind?\" \"Hmmm... How about...</span></div></div>",

That all change when a massive ship, bigger than anything the civilization can comprehend, lands on the world. Before anyone could do anything, earthquake began to rumble as something was coming out. As the door opens, out came a giantess alien woman, so large that her height goes above the clouds. What does this woman want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou basically play either someone in the planet or the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario:<br>\r\n1) for science: the alien woman is here to examine the land and its inhabitants, however, only sees nothing but strange gray moss beneath her feet. She still decides to take some samples and examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Need a new home: that Alien is here to build a new home, either for herself or her people. Despite the sheer size difference of her being larger than the land, she takes alot of the land to make her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Conquer or Savior or Destroyer?: The alien appears to be holding a strange banter. Is she here to take this planet for a kingdom? Is she here to save the planet from a much greater threat? Or is she here to destroy the world, viva on purpose or by accident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)custom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliens woman:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Tali (mass effect)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Ahsoka (star wars)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Cosmo (sonic x)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)any other fictional character<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)OC (please be descriptive when making your original character)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize: 100 miles or bigger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: no scat or pee or anything disgusting, no futa, and no male giants.
