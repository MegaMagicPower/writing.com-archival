Setting the shoes down by the bed, Helen pulled down a skirt and blouse from their respective hangers.

No, later.\" She hung up, tossing the phone over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around in his arms, Helen smiled lazily, saying, \"Jake, we really don't have time for this - Eep! Jake! You bad boy, goosing me like that. grrrrl What brought this on? Not that I mind,\" she asked with a sensual smile on tugging at her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing,\" he replied airily. \"I just can't get enough of my beautiful wife, who seems to grow more beautiful every year, and who is looking, and feeling, particularly wonderful this morning\" he said flatteringly, as he massaged her full, fulsome, ass - the real reason his motor was running hot this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, honey, I think Eric can do with out you for a few minutes - or longer,\" he said with a suggestive leer, drawing Helen back towards the bed. Caressing her ass, which he found this morning to be particularly full, ripe, round, and shapely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very enjoyable half hour later, after having thoroughly mussed the bed, each other, and the sensibilities of their two daughters down the hall with their noisy antics, a very sated Helen pulls away from her husband's caress to her rear end to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd\" she thought to herself. \"I know Jakey has always loved my ass, but he seemed to pay more attention to it this morning than he has in a long time,\" she continued, walking between the full-length mirror on her closet door and the vanity mirror over the sinks in the bathroom. \"I wonder what that was all about...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Personally, I'd like to try to avoid stuff that's too illegal or gory or pedophilic, and at least try to pretend everything that happens is consensual. Beyond that, I personally lean towards stories that have at least a passing nod towards realism and literary merit, and I reserve the right edit a chapter if I think it really needs help, but I will do my utmost best to avoid stepping on any toes of anyone who does contribute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin those guidelines though, it's wide open. I have no problem with swearing, violence, sexual orientation, kinks, politics, graphic scenes, or other so-called questionable or controversial content, as long as such things are not completely gratuitous and over top, and have at least some relation to developing the story. And even then, I'm inclined to be generous if the writing is decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo just have fun, and try not to mess up other people's story lines too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a note: I am assuming that most of the people who actualy find this story, much less contribute, will have a certain minimum level of familiarity with the show and the characters, but I realize that will not be true of everyone.
