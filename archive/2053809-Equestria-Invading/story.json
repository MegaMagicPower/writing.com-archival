On a long table near them was globe and a spread out map of a world the bearers had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six looked at the princesses questioningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia, are you absolutely sure about this?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know invading a world is not  normally something we would even consider partaking in, but that world is at a pivotal point in it's development. While they lack magic, they are resourceful and skilled with technology beyond almost all other lifeforms, and in the last two centuries technological development has increased exponentially. With guidance, humanity could reach a golden age, but left to their own devices their war mongering could make them a danger to each other, or lifeforms all over the universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would not even consider such a thing if their was another way or we thought these humans were best left to their own devices. But they have been crafting instruments of war for a millennia, and have already created weapons capable of devastating entire countries, and only continue to develop more. We cannot allow this to continue unchecked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight frowned, and most of the bearers looked uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia knew they needed more convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mentally humanity is quite similar to us in many ways, with a spark on ingenuity even we have to admire. But they are a far more belligerent species and when it comes to behaving towards their fellows, humanity has a lot to learn. Many are capable of a casual cruelty or disregard for other's lives that you would not think possible, and the planet lives in terrible inequality, with some humans having far beyond their needs while many more are left to starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not coming to enslave them, merely to show them a better way. And we will do all we can to avoid or at the very least minimize casualties. When we are done, we shall leave their planet in a better place than it was before..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearers and Princesses talked and debated a while longer, before they felt ready to do this. It was decided that each pony would be entrusted with a group of humans, though we will all help each other and confer, to decide on the best way to rule, and they were to regard each and every life other their care as precious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the invasion, the Princesses had prepared many spells, for they knew humanities weapons were not designed to overcome magic. Every pony would appear at a gigantic scale, be nigh invulnerable to anything that could be thrown at them, and cause minimal damage to the area around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they felt ready they departed for the strange land.....</span></div></div>",

PIPE DOWN!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel's hands were clamped around the steering wheel in a vise like grip, despite the fact there wasn't a human for miles as he and Jake blazed through the open countryside at breakneck speeds. He thrust the wheel to the left to swerve around an upturned car laying on the side of the road, rocking the two riders around in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything yet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake unbuckled so he could stand over his chair and look out the back window. \"Not yet! Should be coming over the hill any minute, now!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, how long till we're in the tunnel!??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! We're halfway across Grettsberg, and we're arriving near the red bridge soon, so I'd say about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET BACK DOWN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late for Jake to be warned as Mikel swerved around an unmanned semi with its truck half-destroyed and sitting along the road. The car passed by unscathed, but Jake's legs hit Mikel's face and caused him to turn the wheel again, sending the car over the edge of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then there was chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car drove through a thick grove of grass and lurched against the oncoming barrage, sending the entire vehicle over its side and rolling across the ground. Mikel was rocking back and forth in his seat as Jake was flung into the backseat, with a whirlwind of glass, dirt, and everything that happened to be in the car swirling around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car landed on both wheels at the end of its roll, but teetered onto the edge of its wheels until it finally tipped and landed on its side, with the passenger door pointing up. For a long while the car was completely silent, as though both occupants hadn't survived the crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until the door shot open fast enough that it fell of its hinge and clattered onto the ground, with a pair of dirtied hands inside grabbing the opening and pulling himself out. Mikel dizzily managed to climb out of the car and sat onto the edge, miraculously without any injury, and peered inside in search of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jake? You there?\" There was no response. \"...oh god, <i>PLEASE</i> tell me he fell out of the car...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ggh...Mikel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel gasped at the voice and looked over the backseat to see his friend laying on the grounded window, who like him wasn't hurt, but still shaken from the rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm fine!\" Jake grabbed the seat belt to brace himself as he stood back up, clutching his head as the blood started pumping in. \"...dude, how are we still alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel didn't answer. He was looking outside, at a spot in the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mikel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel's face barely twitched at Jake's voice as he gazed into the horizon, at a spot of motion miles away from them. It was a colored, moving blob that stood out like some stain on his sight, but as his eyes adjusted over the distance, they were filled with a look of pure dread as he could see...</span></div></div>",

It? Caught sight of them and galloped after them, hear steps rocking the ground but somehow not causing the calamitous level of destruction they would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature carried a net in her mouth, swing it every so often and scooping humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's capturing us?

She descended from the sky, hanging just above the building and scooped up the two of them in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got 'em!\" She triumphantly yelled.. to herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel and Jake found themselves crammed into the net with a whole whole group of other humans, each as confused and frightened as one would expect. They nearly hurled as they were flung around the net, as thought they were on an out of control jet flying through turbulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash!\" Another one of the titans called, this one sounding smarter. \"I told you to be careful with them!\"</span></div></div>",

She spent several hours and preparing and when she was finally she unleashed her magic, disappearing with a much brighter flash than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was eager to see where she landed, but her expression of delight turned to something else,  she looked around and found herself somewhere strange. She  was standing on a patch of green, but appeared to be in a city, for the designs of the building reminded her of images of Manehatten, but something was definitely different. The colours of the buildings and the landscape were duller,  almost muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I? I must have teleported really far.\u201d Twilight wondered aloud. Her voice a mix of worry and curiosity. \u201cSome kind of model city?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started surveying her surroundings, only to hear panicked yelling at her hooves. Small, bipedal creatures, roughly the size of breezies, though lacking wings were near her.

She spun and twisted it in the air, repairing it to the best of her ability,  then placing it back into the ground. She looked back and smiled, hoping to have eased the inhabitants feared, but instead many had gasped in shock and others were visibly frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-uh I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve never seen anything like that before?

Dook!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the first thing I'd think anytime the door was knocked since I'd placed the order, but now, it was the honest truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailman was just taking off when I'd opened the door, driving down the street with nothing for me to sign or check out. But sure enough, a small white box sat on the welcome mat, safely perched far enough from the door that it wouldn't get hit when it was swung open. Instantly I could tell what it was, either by giddy instinct or the telltale airholes punched into the sides. \"Friggin' <i>Finally!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as happy as I was, it took a great amount of willpower to resist snatching the box and running up to his room in a mad frenzy, instead opting to slowly crouch down and carefully lift it off the ground. Ducking back inside, I took great care not to shake the box around too much as I lurched up the steps toward my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially with the small, whispered movements that I could feel from the box' contents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my office, I gently set the box on the desk and slid out a pair of scissors from my pen cup. Sitting down, focusing all my clear gaze on the tape sealing the flap, I hit the peak of my finger-sensitive care and opened the scissor's by a tiny peck, worming the tips into the tape and snipping a bit of the way through. A few more snips and I made it halfway, but the anticipation finally got the best of me and I pried the flap apart, tearing the tape the rest of the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't immediately look into the box. It went silent once it was opened, and for a moment I feared I'd hurt whatever was inside, but too my surprise and relief, with a small rustle, the box managed to tip on its own and fell onto its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny, grey leg shyly stepped out of the box' mouth first, and the rest of the creature shuffled out when it felt the warmth of the room. Its tiny footsteps on the wood were accompanied by a cute, meager <i>clip clop</i>, fitting looked the part of some sort of really tiny equine with light gray fur and a pastel yellow mane, save for a pair of feathery wings folded against its sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just took a few moments to walk around, getting a feeling from the circle on the desk that was lit by the reading lamp. I didn't do anything, instead completely amazed by merely watching her move about, curiously interacting with the little trinkets on my desk, like she were seeing them for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon enough she finally noticed me looking down at her, and she stopped dead in her tracks, a hoof still raised in the air. Now I could see her eyes, which were bright gold and adorably wonked away from one another in opposite directions. Neither of them met me in the eye for a single moment, but she nonetheless turned around and sat down on her haunches, smiling obediently at me, like she could see me anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, god...</i> I took my hand off my lap and brought it over her back, gently stroking her soft, smooth fur along the back of her neck and down her back. She didn't shy away, and actually seemed to enjoy being petted, but my heart wasn't the least bit prepared for when she hugged my fingers as tight as she could with her front legs, lovingly scratching her cheek across my palm, and immediately melted away in my chest. <i>OH MY GOD!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the falter in my petting rhythm, the new kitten-sized pegasus lowered down and sprung back up, flapping her wings so she fluttered through the air and buzzed up onto my shoulder, clinging to my shirt as she hung over my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna call you?\" I mulled aloud. \"...hmm...would 'Derpy' be to cruel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, or should I say, <i>Derpy</i> didn't refuse. She actually smiled, like she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about some lunch, Derpy?\" I offered, getting up and heading for the door. Derpy stayed clung to my shoulder the entire trip to the kitchen, but it was only just when I'd entered that I realized I had no idea what she could eat. \"...huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe some fruit would do the trick.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I opened the door to te fridge, Derpy suddenly went completely stiff when she peered inside, her eyes going wide and pointing straight inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy leapt over my shoulder and, with Olympic-level finesse dove through the air and into a muffin on a plate with her mouth open wide. In just a few seconds Derpy tore through the entire muffin, eradicating it off the face of the Earth and sitting alone on the plate, victoriously rubbing her ballooned belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...woah.\" I whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that should just about do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI''d arranged a cardboard box on my desk with a large section of one wall cut out, allowing Derpy to see my bed from inside. I'd laid out a pillow for her to sleep on, which she immediately took an enjoyment for bouncing around on, along with a bowl of water taped to one wall and a plastic dish sitting outside next to a hole cut out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, Derpy!\" I beckoned, petting her on the head. Turning off the light, I managed to find my bed in the dark and slid under the cover, shutting my eyes and awaiting the embrace of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but I hadn't yet fallen asleep when I felt a small creature jump onto the mattress and pronk up to my pillow, four tiny  hooves stepping onto my face and curling up on top of my forehead, a tail gently laying over my eyes...</span></div></div>",

Honestly, it was getting kind of pointless, seeing as she was always standing guard at the door, ready to welcome me with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past few days had been a lot of fun for me and Derpy. I knew she was a real animal, but it was still fascinating to see her flying around the house, exploring the various appliancesl. She was actually pretty strong and rubbery, which was a big plus for her, given a few clumsy flights and landings that she'd always walk away from without a scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another thing that caught my curiosity, on a more discerning note, was her appetite. How <i>couldn't</i> it, with how much she'd eaten? She'd eat cakes, veggies, fruits, eggs, bread, potato chips, candy, just about anything remotely edible she'd eagerly chow down. <i>Especially</i> muffins, for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes I'd come home to find her in the midst of eating the last rinds of a sandwich I never recalled making, or she'd leave around opened bags of chips and microwaved popcorn that were left with nothing but grease and butter. Strange, considering she completely lacked the hands needed to do so, but at least she was easy to care for, I'd assumed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she started getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay by day, it was only a subtle concern itching on my back, but now it was crystal clear that Derpy was growing, and in numerous ways, thanks to her hunger. Now Derpy was the size of a cat. A very fat cat, with a pretty tubby belly that hung low to her knees, noticeably curving out from either side of her, amongst a pudgy layer of paunch forming on her once trim legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, and a bit off-putting, but it still an easy price to pay as Derpy eagerly hugged me by my leg, nuzzling me affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, hi, Derpy!\" I bent down to hoist her up, cradling her in her arms as I brought the two of us into the living room, but not without cutting through the kitchen. It was actually kind of cute how heavy she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering onto the couch, I laid Derpy on my lap, flipping the TV on with the remote. I screwed open a bag of chips and laid it on the next cushion, taking out a handful, but Derpy looked up and grabbed the ends of the bag, yanking it over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few, Der...\" But it was already too late. I pulled the bag away, which was now empty, as Derpy gulped down the last of the chips, licking her lips with her cheeks covered in cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh.\" Disappointing, to say the least. But still, with Derpy laying on her back, the urge was irresistible to scratch the front of her belly, making her curl her legs up and hum in delight.</span></div></div>",

Now, to set first orders first, I think that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was interrupted by a loud, sick-sounding rumble churning around in the lower depths of her bowels, and the confidence in her face melted into a retched grimace, hunching forward with her hands clutched around her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ghh</i>...I...\" Her mind was flooded with regret, along with the taste of the sriracha smothering the pad thai she'd consumed days before. \"I feel...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nausea traversed beyond the last inches of her body and made itself known to the world through a long, constant parade of gas slipping past her buttocks that, by infinite monkeys on typewriters, managed to sustain a smokey drawl perfectly in tune to the voice of academy award-winning actor Morgan Freeman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your feet on the gas, man, they're gaining on us!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tires skidded along the road with a burning screech as Steve spun the wheel to the left, his foot slamming on the gas to send the car rocketing down the street. The two other men huddled in the back rocked back and forth from the frantic chase, and the load they sat around didn't help as their unwilling guest fought against the sleeping bag she was tied within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a good kick, Frank's head slammed back into the window, snapping a sharp crack in the glass. \"<i>Fuck</i>, she kicked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOULD YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN?! I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE HERE!!!\" Steve snarled back at them, but turning back met him with the swarm of pegasus soldiers swooping around the corner to keep flying to them, all of them screaming a mess of threats at the van. \"SWEET <i>JESUS!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve kicked his door open and swung his gun out, firing a few rounds at the oncoming horde. A few caught a shot and tumbled out of the air, but that entire mass showed no relent in swarming down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andre, cover me!\" He tossed the gun to his friend, who hung out the window and rapid-fired upon their pursuers. Steve's eyes returned to the road just in time for him to swerve past an island the van was veering towards, throwing Frank onto the bag, only to get punched into the ceiling. \"ARE WE THERE YET?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, baby we're so close!!!</i> He could see the garage where the bunker laid beneath just a few blocks away. Its door was wide open, waiting for them to drive in and into its warm, safe arms, but the ponies were inching closer on their blinding speeds, all of them readying their hands to grab and/or tear the roof off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve, they're gaining on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve pulled down the garage switch and hit the brake with such speed that the car and its occupants were all spun around, with swirls of steaming black branded into the road. The roof scraped against the bottom of the lowering door, shattering the overhead, but they cleared through with enough momentum to smash into and crack the concrete wall at the very end. The door'd completely closed just a few seconds from the pegasi arms reaching to get inside, only for a symphony of bodies slamming into metal to rain on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hurry and take her to the basement!\" Steve and the other rebels scurried out of the car and met at the back to slide out their feisty hostage, who kept wrenching around in an attempt to free herself as they carried her up on their shoulders and down a set of steps leading underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the way down they passed a thick metal door hanging wide open, which Steve slammed shut and latched together with three reinforced steel locks, bulky metal chains binding them close together, and a steel shudder that he pulled over from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did the same for the next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the next one, save for a finishing touch of three metal dumpsters that he and the others worked together to push in the way as a final barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried under fifty feet of concrete, and lit by long fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling, the three finally gave themselves to take a breath, which dissolved back into nervous laughter. At one corner of their bunker there was a small living spot with a couch, TV, and a movie shelf, the only cozy part of the wide and empty chambers they'd scrounged up. Even the bedroom consisted of just three beds, without anything else to make the dirty walls more bright and cheery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged the reluctant sleeping bag towards a barred-off alcove in the wall, which had its gate laid open for them to enter. Steve pulled out a pocket knife and sawed at the ropes tied around the pink arms left exposed. He only barely managed to dodge a good punch in the face once the princess was unbound, but Andre grabbed and slammed her arm into the wall to be shackled by Frank. He hesitated to grab the other flailing arm, but managed to catch it on the height of its arc and chain it down much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while seated on the tiny room's cot, Cadance was their height. She jolted in surprise when her captors unzipped and removed the bag, but dissolved into a nasty scowl when she saw the company she was with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there's actually something to be admired for doing the <i>dumbest thing </i>any human could ever do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that depends on what end of the spectrum you're on!\" Steve spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched her eyes shut and tried to charge up her horn, but the ring on her head fizzled the energy away into a few harmless sparks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys got the message to Celestia, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The feed say's she's online right now!\" Frank confirmed, reading off his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We're through the rough of it, guys, but not all the way. Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three abandoned Cadance to her dungeon, ignoring her chains' rattling on their way to the computer. Steve sat in the desk and logged on, clicking through a few passwords links until he made it to a black video feed, with a chat request hanging in the box that read \"PRINCESS BITCHBUTT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked the request, and the black flashed into an almost entirely white feed, most of it from Celestia's fur. The camera stood in a position that much of her huge, saggy cheeks and several of her many blobby chins were cut off, but they could still the the pure, unadulterated anger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've spared yourself any form of mercy, humans!\" </i>She fumed. <i>\"Surrender now, and we might consider pondering the legality for</i> life in solitary confinement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll consider releasing Cadance as long as our requests are followed!\" Steve spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do you three even know where you are, right now? You are part of the few humans left in the world not under the supreme control of Equestria!  What could you all possibly demand right now?! What could you </i>do <i> right now?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A far deal, your highness. And since we've moved up to kidnapping, I suggest you be more polite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia paused, then leaned back. <i>\"Go ahead. Entice me.\"</i> She challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We demand the release of the other members of the Righteous Plight, which I assume you've found in the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tia, hold on a moment!\"</i> A mute symbol blipped in the corner of the monitor, and Celestia looked to something offscreen. A blue pony that looked to be as fat as Celestia stepped into frame and began whispering something in her ear, something that caught her interest. Her lips gently mouthed out whatever was being spoken to her, but then she covered her mouth with her wing in a mischievous giggle, thumbing up the pony that was speaking to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're totally up to something! They've got a plan!\" Andre argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, what could they be planning with us all the way down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gently shooed the blue pony away with her wing, then looked back at the camera, trying to bring back her steely gaze. The mute symbol flicked off. <i>\"Very well, then. We have a deal.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"A...a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We'll take matters to return to you the members of your brigade, as long as Cadance is unharmed.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't listen t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andre, shut up!\" Steve snapped over his shoulder, but smiled back at Celestia. \"Thank you, Princess. I'm glad you could see things our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...but on one condition!\" </i>Celestia demanded. <i>\"Cadance will be put on a live feed for me until we've got everything set. If any more than a full second goes by where her needs aren't met, we'll pursue you with the fullest extent of our power!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be disappointed. Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, put her on, then!\"</i> The screen flicked back to the company signal, but the camera light was still on. She could still see us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her, boys! Put the webcam in Cadance's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw her in the video! She's got tricks up her sleeves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we also got her to say 'yes, we'll follow your commands', which is a hell of a lot more than anybody else could do! Now come on, we've got a desk to move around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Steve took either end of the desk and lifted it off the ground, shuffling to Cadance's room with Andre following behind, mumbling angry. Cadance was thrashing against the chains, as per how they'd left her, but her screams were filled with demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, princess, we've got your auntie on the line for you!\" Frank jabbed, he and Steve lowering the desk to face her.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrk...LET ME GO!!!\" She yelled at her kidnappers.</span></div></div>",

I stepped up in front of Cadance and tenderly hovered my hands towards either side of her midsection, letting my fingertips graze along her fur very gently. She winced at the contact and hummed softly at the sensation, but there was still discomfort stuck in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't do it! Harder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I pressed my palms in, allowing me to feel the tightness in the pregnant bulge within her stomach. With much more vigor and force in my hands, Cadance's eyes rolled back lustfully and she let her nose point up, letting out a long, blissful moan, tensing the muscles in her legs and buckling her knees in. I faltered from my rhythm, but she immediately shot me down with an angry glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep doing it! I'm still full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when are you gonna <i>stop</i> being full?\" Andre snapped. Frank fearfully backed out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna depend on how much he's rubbing! Keep at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say anything, but kept rubbing her gut. The chains on her arms clattered as she clenched her fists, smiling with an ecstatic hum loud enough that I could feel the air vibrate off her throat.  A faint murmur churned in her stomach, which ran up her throat in a loud belch. When the rumbling in her stomach kept going after I'd stopped stroking her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started in her breasts. A few crinkles in her shirt melted away as her already sizeable bosom swelled out a few more cup sizes, causing a button at the frontlines of her chest top pop off, giving a dimmed sliver to show the pink, furry orbs beneath. Her stomach only shrunk a slight amount as the protein bars she'd eaten were magically digested into nothing within seconds, but the rest of her limbs mildly thickened out with hearty layer of paunch, along with a heavy fullness hanging in her face and cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't see Celestia's face when Cadance's gaining session had ended, and all three of us were looking at the expanded unicorn in a mesh of amazement and fear, but I could easily bet she was smiling. The cot Cadance was sitting on bent underneath the weight of her widened flanks, the rounded shape of which was more defined under the smooth surface of her skinny jeans, while her arms above had plumped up to the point were the shackles gripped waists into their meaty weight. Her gut was large enough that it covered anything almost halfway the length of her calves, but we could tell it was still empty when a hungry gurgle from within shook Cadance out of her daze with a soft burp.</span></div></div>",

And then had your mental health called into question. That's what happened, though, and no amount of explaining how stupid or unlikely it all was will ever change that. One day, everything fucked up - everything. Animals temporarily mutated, personalities flipped and in-flipped at random, and the sky turned into a vomit-worthy mishmash of colours. Then it all stopped, and they came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir portal ripped open, and they started to come through. Fucking ponies. If contact was peaceful, I wouldn't have given much of a shit about them, but it was anything but peaceful. Their leader, some real big one of itch wings and a horn, started talking when people arrived and trained cameras on her, saying that our entire planet was tainted by Chaos and that for our 'safety', they were going to remove this taint. No matter what we said or did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrist, reminds me of that old Warhammer game. Chaos and inquisitions and all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I mention what the ponies looked like? Take a horse, cross it with a human, and then pick a random colour to paint it. There were different types, too - unicorns and pegasi and whatnot. Oh, and they're all massive. A good seven feet tall at the largest, and not a single one shorter than six foot four. Not helping things were the... generous curves they all had. Would <i>you</i> want to shoot a sexy alien amazon that could probably lift your entire body with a single hand? Didn't think so, which is why it's a good thing you're not me. Someone's gotta keep fighting them after our governments fucked off and gave them control - I still reckon they can mind control people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, they say they're good. They act like they're good. But if they were actually good, why'd that annex us? Why's we get no choice in the matter? All answers I've gotta beat out of them, one at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic was nice. Wings were nice. But gold armour? I don't think so. My battleship beats that anyday, and you can't even fight what you can't see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubble-choked streets, another abandoned city. Slowly being ripped apart while trying to find the source of the taint. Knight fucking Templars, every one of them. They were all poking through the rubble, trying to find something useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew they wouldn't find it. Not because there wasn't anything of use there, but because I was about to start another battle. Laid low for too long, about time Ingot to crack some pony skulls again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would I do this? Well:<br>\r\nFirst, my suit. Took it with me when I abandoned the military. One of their new stealth suits. Solar powered - not much use here with out weather - and can turn you pretty much invisible if you don't move too fast. <br>\r\nSecond, my gun. Nice little thing - an SMG. Slower than others but more reliable. Accurate, as well. I had to keep track of how much ammo I used during resistance missions but I had enough for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA one man rebellion. Heh. I like the sound of that. Just me, my suit, and my gun. And several large canisters that I'd only touch on the edge of death. <br>\r\nViolator of pony law, old UN law... and probably a good many moral codes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolator. I like the sound of that...</span></div></div>",

Throughout all the streets and alleys and avenues and boulevards, patrols of golden-armored ponies march, armed with swords and spears and all manner of magic I'd rather not think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as humans flee before them, the patrols make their way form building to building, residence to residence, smashing open doors and conducting on the spot inspections of the people and things inside. Even from the sidewalk, I can hear all the noise coming from within the inspected buildings; yelling voices, furniture breaking, tables being thrown over, people being injured and thrown about. Eventually, the ponies come out; sometimes alone, other times accompanied by humans in manacles, who are lead to iron airships and taken....well, I'm not so sure. As humans flee out of their way, the ponies look upon them with disdain and suspicion, no doubt looking for any faces that the Crown has put a warrant on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their wake, I see crowds of humans gather outside their ransacked homes and stores and restaurants and workplaces, looking like the mother of all tornadoes just flew through town. Many are injured. Many more are crying. Many more simply look like they've been emptied out y whatever happened to them. Many more, disturbingly enough, look genuinely content, as if the ponies went and sucked all the bad emotions out of them....which, I do suppose, is pretty close to the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this won't stand. Not any longer.</span></div></div>",

Oh I've missed you so much! I have to know what have you been up to?\" She asked excitedly her voice weak probably from age<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-listen lady, you've got me confused with somebody else.\" I said as I tried to ease her down, it crushed me to be the bearer of bad news to somebody so old<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head \"Impossible! You're my Theodore! Look!\" She reached under the neck of her dress and I looked away, looking at her figure strangely it was pretty fit, but I was drawn back up by a yellow stone she had with an engraving that looked like my face, I was unnerved by the accuracy but more over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was on the crown of king Gortog! I cut off his arm and that night you made this for me!\" She said she grabbed hold of me \"Of course the years must have done a number to your mind. I'm just so happy to have you back!\" She cheered happily hugging me, she must have been crouched because now her head was resting on my shoulder, looking at her I saw her hooves firmly on the ground, and I saw her rainbow mane lighten up a bit <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss, okay my name is Ted but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it!\" She pulled away to smile into my eyes, as I saw her eyes again the crows feet all but vanished, her skin seemed to tighten against her body, and against all logic I felt her chest pressing against mine as it was creating four inches between the two of us and she was at lip height with me, she hugged me again and shockingly she lifted me off the ground  as she seemed to grow! tucking my head on her shoulder and nuzzling against my head, I saw her mane seem to thicken and shine even more as I could only stare in wonder \"Granted the empire fell apart after I lost you,,, I just wasn't the same ever again!\" As she spoke each time her voice grew more lively and energetic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-empire?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! The solar empire!\" She said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" I said completely lost<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously you can tell I haven't had the spirit to keep up my diet.And well without you there I was... alone. Luna and Cadence insisting that I \"Release the world from my tyranny!\" bah!\" She said at this point she looked like she was in her early thirties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" I was even more lost but looking down her sizable chest became two giant watermelons, looking down I saw her hips widen as the dress once at her ankles was just bellow her waist by inches as I saw her near perfect hourglass waist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed happily and carried me in her arms, she must have been eight feet tall, of course the average pony was six foot four this was absolutely insane! Looking back her mane rippled against a wind I didn't feel in the slightest she smiled down at me \"I look at you and every time it feels like none of this is real!\" She said cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same...\" all signs of that old lady vanished, but in they're place was an amazon in her prime carrying me off to who knows where!</span></div></div>",

Not a single word of this is hyperbole or exaggeration. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ah, er....\" the waiter said, staring at the sack of gold. \"That...that may be somewhat difficult to manage....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare pulled out a second sack of gold, even bigger than the first. \"If anyone complains or walks out or makes trouble, I'll pay back double whatever losses you take as a result. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded as rapidly as he could. \"Right this way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading us into a ornate dining room that could have seated at least thirty or forty people at least, the waiter placed us at the center table. \"Would there be any sort of.....order you would like to receive your dishes in?\" the waiter said, clearly still at a loss about what was going on. \"We have a very wide selection, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go in order of whatever's quickest to make.\" the mare said, smiling like nobody's business. \"I have no intention of leaving this room for quite some time, so there's no hurry at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" With that, the waiter ran off to the kitchens (yelling as he went to get the manager's attention), leaving me and my....former lover (?) all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh,\" I said, looking at this mystery mare. \"Uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia.\" she said. \"Formerly Queen Celestia, but that will soon be rectified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" I said. \"....Now, look....Celestia, I know that you're excited to see me and that....well,you do seem to be onto something about me being the reincarnation or whatever of your Theodore, but.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?' she said, looking genuinely worried. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going a little bit...extreme about all of this?\" I said, looking around. Breaking the bank on enormous quantities of food and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Theo.\" she said, giggling a bit. \"Don't worry, everything will come to make sense soon enough. This is, believe it or not, an important part of the process. Restoring my magical reserves and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ah, s--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first waiter, in addition to a dozen or so other waiters and waitresses and cooks and bus boys and whatnot ran int the room, all carrying heavy trays packed high with desserts and soups and various appetizers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All...all right, then.\" the waiter said, as the last of the stuff was placed around. \"It shouldn't be that much longer before the first of the entrees arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Celestia said, nodding to them all. \"Your speed and efficiency will be rewarded quite thoroughly. Now, um, would you mind leaving us be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the various waiters and whatnot ran out of the room, I watched as Celestia began to examine the various puddings and cakes and ice creams and other delights with a careful eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, bread pudding.\" she said, grabbing ahold of one one such dessert and carefully eating it with a spoon. \"It's been a while since I've had it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished off the bread pudding, placing the empty dish aside, she grabbed ahold of a half-finished chocolate cake and tore away a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're going to have such fun together.\" Celestia said, taking massive bites out of the rich dessert. \"It'll take a bit of work to get going at first, but I can promise you that, before you'll know it, the Celestial Empire will be up and running again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" I said, watching as she finished off the piece of cake, and started in on a second slice. \"How are we going to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing at a time, Theodore.\" she said. \"Once we've taken care of this, everything will become quite clear. Now, ten, I really should get serious about this, shouldn't I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she tossed the rest of the second piece of the cake into her mouth...and then, with the voraciousness of a hungry football team, proceeded to devour more or less every last dessert or other form of food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving utterly lost any interest into figuring out she was talking about at that point, I watched as Celestia went about devouring everything within arms reach with a few quick bites, engulfing entire cakes and pies and other delicacies in mere moments, all without spilling even a few crumbs onto herself or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not to say, mind you, that she was somehow doing this by making the desserts and soups and whatnot disappear or vanish by any means; on the contrary, each and every thing she ate, soon I began to see, was slowly causing her body to go from sleek and amazonian to, ah......well, just plain massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Although the transformation I had seen her undergo before was quite impressive in itself, watching Celestia grow and swell was a far more startling sight to see. Her chest as the first thing to grow, her breasts growing from the size of melons to the size of ripe pumpkins, just barely held within the confines of her chest. Her stomach went from taut and flat to round and soft, growing into a massive stomach that began to overflow out onto the table. Her rear end grew massive enough that it actually caused Celestia to be lifted at least a good half foot or so off of her chair, and her hips and thighs grew thick and wide enough to almost beak the chair in half. Her arms grew fat enough to almost grow Although Celestia said almost nothing amidst all of this, the look in her face was one of immense enjoyment and glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" the waiter said, running into the room with another heavy tray \"The entrees will be here soon.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just place the trays wherever you can find space.\" Celestia said smiling to the man. \"Take your time, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter took a moment to collect himself, and then placed the tray down on the table. \"As you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wonderful.\" Celestia said. \"Send my compliments to the chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....It was much later into the day that the flow of food had finally stopped, a good seven or so hours after we had began. Against all odds, Celestia had managed to devour every last bit of food in the house...and in doing so, had managed to go from svelte and curvy....to, ah, well.....round. Very round. Very, very round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was good.\" Celestia said, sitting on the floor after hr chair had broken about two hours or so. \"Did you enjoy yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, wonderful.\" Celestia said, her round face turning into a cheery smile. \"I hope that they won't mind the mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably won't, considering the sort of tip you're leaving them.\" I said. \"What now, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're probably still surprised about how I treated that guy.\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah a bit...\" I said fearfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I know I used to scar people by focusing the sun's rays on them but I think having legions of deformed slaves speaks poorly on myself as the god queen of this world.\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...\" I could barely form thoughts at this point <i>I've got to find a way out of this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia!\" Looking to the voice we saw a blue pony wearing a darker blue business suit standing at about nine feet tall sporting a physique near Celestia's shape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.

From everything I've seen, you clearly don't seem to possess any memories of being Celestia's lover, and don't seem to feel any sort of connection to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ah....I'm afraid that I don't have any memories of Celestia, no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's him!\" Celestia said, pulling free her locket and sending it over to Luna and Cadence. \"Are you really going to tell me that isn't my Theo standing right there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It.....it's impossible to not notice a certain resemblance,\" Luna admitted. \"but that means nothing on its own. In all likelihood, Theo is just a long-lost descendant of the man you knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be passed down as well.\" Cadence pointed out. \"Celestia, I am sorry, but....well, I honestly cannot say that this is your Theodore at all. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's face went still. \"Believe that as you may, I know for a fact that this is my Theo, the one I loved so long ago. Nothing can change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we are at an impasse, then.\" Luna said, taking a few steps closer. \"And even if this man is the one you loved, that still doesn't justify these sudden dreams of conquer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room went silence as the grave as the three mares stared at one another. Although I knew nothing of magic (and certainly not the sort of magic these three seemed to possess), I could all but feel the sheer amount of energy in the air now going between these three ponies. If I didn't do something quickly--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them looked to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia, Luna, Cadence.....\" I said. \"I don't want a fight to go down. I don't want to see any of you hurt, but I also don't want to see the world conquered, or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Because of that,\" so I went on to say. \"I want us all to compromise. Because we all clearly feel very strongly about this.....how about we all take a day or so to think things over, so that we can negotiate things in a calm and controlled manner. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....He's right.\" Luna said. \"Nothing will be accomplished if we remain at odds like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Celestia said. \"If you're willing to be civil about this, so can I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" I said. \"Just great.\" I looked around the room. \"So, um......what should we do about getting back to the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" Celestia said. \"How about we spend the night here in our old living quarters? Everything should be just as we left them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Cadence said. \"I know a great hotel where we could all go and get some great suites for a really good price. We--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Celestia said. \"If we're going to discuss the future of my empire and of my lover, I would like to discuss them in the appropriate setting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna and Cadence both grumbled, bu nodded after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another bout of painful lights, I found myself along with the three ponies in a long hallway, filled with great wooden doors leading into ornate bedrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you two know where your rooms are, yes?\" Celestia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do.\" Luna said, gesturing towards a set of doors with various cycles of the room engraved on the front. \"We lived in this place for thousands of years, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be ready to talk sensibly about all this.\" Cadence said, starting to go down the hall. \"And be ready to actually have to make compromises for once in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mares soon vanished behind their respective doors, and I found myself alone with Celestia, who was now smiling gently upon me. \"Well, then, Theo.\" she said. \"Ready for bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes-yes I'm fine. Listen I've had a change of residence.

Most of the other customers (and some of the employees) had filtered out of the place quietly and quickly over the course of our presence here, and the few people remaining were clearly doing their best to try and ignore us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this mare, anyway?' I said. \"You said she was your student or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\" Celestia said, taking a dainty bite out of a blueberry muffin. \"Even since I, ah, retired from my previous position, I've been filling my free time with a number of hobbies, and one of the most noticeable one has been tutoring unicorns and other magic users. Twilight, I must admit, has been my single best student by pure leaps and bounds; she could do things with her magic that even my old court magicians couldn't have topped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" I said. \"Does she, ah....know anything about--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" A flash of light came into view, and a large portly purple unicorn in a purple sweater and blue jeans popped into view, carrying an armful of various heavy looking tomes. \"I apologize if I'm wasn't early enough; I was distracted at home, by--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Twilight.\" said Celestia, smiling rather mischievously at her. \"Thank you for meeting me at such short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Twilight said, shaking her head and wiping away her look of bafflement. \"It was the least I could after everything you taught me....but, um, ah, why do you suddenly look so--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Celestia said. \"Chubby? Portly? Fat?\" She giggled a little bit. \" Of course I am, but--well, take a look at who it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned to head to me, scrutinizing me rather closely. \"Is....is that Theo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and the same.\" Celestia said. \"He doesn't have his memories of our time together, but it's most certainly him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he was dead, though.\" Twilight said, looking at me rather skeptically. \"Is he....a reincarnation of some sort, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....oh, goodness.\" Twilight said, her pupils swelling until they all but overflowed her eyes. \"That's incredible! Why, with the right spells, I could quite easily cause the former memories to reappear in him. It would take some time to design them, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down ,Twilight.\" Celestia said, waving her hand at Twilight. \"Please, sit down. We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Twilight took a few conspicuously long minutes to grab a coffee and a scone, the three of us were now seated around the little table, all eyes glancing at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Twilight.\" Celestia said. \"As much as I've enjoyed our tutoring sessions together, i think it's time that we took things in a more hands-on direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Twilight said. \"What were you thinking, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple.\" Celestia said. \"I'm reforming the Celestial Empire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't even miss a beat. \"Really....\" she said. \"But I didn't even think it would be possible. I mean, it's been so long since you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" I said. \"You knew that she was the head of the Celestial Empire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't?\" Twilight said. \"....Anyway, how do you thin kit could be possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple, of course.\" Celestia said. \"During my retirement, I've been working on a number of spells--spells that I could tech you, of course--that would go a mighty long way towards reforming the empire. A couple of mind control spells, a couple spells for creating magical automatons and other constructs, a few doomsday spells, things like that. If the both of us were to work together, I imagine that it would be very much possible for us to create the Celestial Empire again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes grew bigger. \"Are...are you saying...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, Twilight.\" Celestia said. \"Queen Twilight Sparkle. How does it sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could....could I get my own library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could turn all of Canada into your own personal library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my own personal research laboratory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use the United States for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And....um, my own crown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh.\" Celestia said. \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, Celestia!\" Twilight said, leaping to her feet. \"Oh, it's going to be so much fun, and--um, well, yeah....\" She stopped speaking mid-entrance, as everyone else in the coffee shop began to stare at her. \"What do we do first, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go back to my palace.\" Celestia said, using her magic to pull herself to her feet. \"I need you to teach you the necessary spells right away, you're ging to need to get some more appropriate garb, and....well, you're going to need to put some meat on your bones before we set off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those final words, Celestia used her magic, the world dissolved into bright light--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A queen in the Celestial empire!\" Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right? A Queen.\" She sounded curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Velvet! Surely you must know the importance of learning!\" Luna said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Knowledge is the most important thing in this world.

All this panic over a house wife! I don't know what I've fallen into...</i> I thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Velvet Cadence and Luna were worried, Celestia countered each and every point they brought up and Velvet seemed to be considering this the best course of action in Twilight's curriculum</span></div></div>",

Celestia went on passing gas and I kept taking in the delightful aroma.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stomach groan was heard but it came from Luna.  Luna asked her sister if they could swap places.  Celestia agreed and got off my face.  She then sat  down on my legs while Luna gave me an evil grin, turned around, swayed her hips, and planted her blue moonass on my face.

It was hardly noticeable, really, but...well, it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right?\" she asked, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing.\" I said, handing her the glass of soda. \"Just getting used to your presence, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be like that!\" she said. \"We're going to have lots and lots of fun together, just you wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the first few days of Twilight's presence  in my home were a bit awkward at first and required a bit more trouble than I had anticipated (most notably, purchasing a bed that was long enough for Twilight to sleep in), but we soon settled into a normal routine. I would go to work on weekdays while she did her own thing, typically either doing research on the Internet (everything from the history of humanity to how hot dogs were made) or going out to any nearby bookstores and libraries in search of new things to read (which apparently roused no attention at any of those places, despite her being a bio-mechanical anthropomorphic pony). Whenever I was at home or had time off from work, we would end up hanging out together; no matter what, she was always happy to see me, and always eager to do whatever with me, whether reading books, playing computer games, watching movies, or what have you. Pleasant times, very pleasant times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...On the other had, however, there was one thing that got my attention and slightly concerned me. Although it never became a concern whatsoever, it became apparent after a time that Twilight was, slowly but surely, growing in both height and weight. Although the height was a much more subtle thing, only growing an inch or two within the first couple months, her weight gain was noticeably much more pronounced. Her stomach began to swell from somewhat pudgy to a noticeably round belly. Her breasts grew a few cup sizes, large and round on her chest. Her thighs went from slim and elegant to round and squishy. Her arms grew soft and somewhat flabby, and her face became chubby, her cheeks now round and cheery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, for what it's worth, I attempted to cut back on the junk food present in the house, and instead attempted to serve healthier foods, it quickly became apparent that Twilight was less than pleased with this turn of events. She never said anything, no, but the looks she gave whenever I served whole wheat pasta or sandwiches or something like that said it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Time passes without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: John and Twilight have a conversation about her recent gains.</span></div></div>",

The first one was somewhat slimmer than my Twilight, the second one was about the same weight but with a pear-shaped body, and the third one was...considerably fatter than my Twilight, enough so that she just barely fit in the doorway....and, for some odd reason, wore a pair of spectacles on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there!\" the first Twilight said. \"May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I said. \"It's my pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three Twilights made their way into my home, my Twilight came up to them and hugged them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you.\" my Twilight said. \"It's nice, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice!\" the first Twilight sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely!\" the second Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a wonderful home, John!\" the third Twilight said, smiling at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four Twilight Sparkles began to talk amongst themselves, I simply stood there and watched them converse. It was, to say the least, an eerie sight, watching as the four near identical ponies converse about all manner of odd topics, using the same speech patterns and making the same facial expressions at one another. Kinda creepy, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, when they were done talking, the five of us made our way into the kitchen, where the four pizzas I ordered were already waiting for us, and the four Twilights unceremoniously began to eat through three of them, clearing the first one by the time I had eaten half a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on quite peacefully after that, with the four Twilights talking about various things until late at night, at which point the three other Twilights finally left, leaving me along with my Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, wasn't enough?\" Twilight (my Twilight said), her shirt just a little tighter in the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes it was.\" I said, unable to think of anything more to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The other three Twilights come back to dinner on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The other three Twilights come back whenever John isn't at home.</span></div></div>",

Hic. Second... we had nothing to do while we waited for you jerks! So we part taken in the delectable wine you guys made... it's pretty great. Hic.\" She said \"I'm by the way Luna. In cause you forgot to ask, rude!\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The challenge is forfeit!\" Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!

I shoulda had some salad.\" She said as me and two other Sentries charged her, as we swung for her middle, she fell on her back... completely dodging our strikes, she kicked the middle sentry down and grabbed me and the sentry to my right by the wrist slamming us against each other breaking our helmets, she picked up our swords holding two in each hand facing infront and behind herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentry she slapped came back at her swinging fiercely, she dropped her swords and dodged his swings and thrusts, she caught his blade in her fingers, burped then head butted him, knocking him down and taking his sword away, she took the five swords and threw them, embedding them in a wall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come at me... bro...\" She said as she shakily held up her fists in a fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got back up, taking knives out as we prepared to fight her, even now she stilled had an advantage standing at eight feet tall, she had a larger reach then us but we would use our numbers against her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we came at her she leaped above us, she dropped her legs on me and another sentry pining us to the ground under her surprising weight for her lithe form, she grabbed the sentry behind her throwing him in front of her then holding him to her body using his armor to block the incoming knives in front of her before pushing the three down on they're backs with a hic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said fight!\" She got back on her feet lifting me up by my chest piece \"How many of these guys are there? I think I'm seeing doubles cause I see five...\" She said before dropping me and falling on me using me as a pillow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night...\" She said as she started snoring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was helplessly trapped under an adversary... a drunken adversary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colosseum was silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years passed, defeat by five enemies of skill would have been acceptable, defeat by a masterful would bring shame, being pounded by a single drunk without even hitting her was more than any man could bare, after the battle the ponies came to asking what happened, any hope of trying to brush passed that were crushed as they offered a rematch which we declined and unfortunately accepted them as the rulers with no other choice. In the two years the ponies had ruled they dismantled our military, putting us to work on growing and preparing food and wine for the ponies, in that time the size gap between human and pony only grew as the ponies ate near constantly, it didn't take long for me to lose my place as a sentry and becoming a slave to a pony, but I was quickly found to be better than most, getting hand picked for the new Princess of rome's student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servant! I need more food!\" Twilight called and I came over to give her more snacks as she sat and read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you um...\" Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ajax!\" I said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's expression changed to surprise to see my outburst, I glared up at her, as she stood at twelve feet tall, on top of a mountain of lard, but I didn't care I was pissed \"Before you came I was a revered sentry for the emperor!\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well things change.\" Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are cruel. Your champion should have killed me that day in the arena.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why's that?\" Twilight asked inquisitively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have died, with some honor.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's dying honorable?\" Twilight asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To die in battle is better than living in servitude.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Isn't that the same as giving up? You'd give up and never improve. That doesn't sound honorable that sounds like taking the easy way out.\" Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quiet for a moment... she made sense and despite hating everything about her I felt she had wisdom on some level as she scarfed down a tub of popcorn I brought to her</span></div></div>",

I'd been sitting around for a few hours, and saw all kinds of people going in and out, but never once did any body come in through the red doors, nor out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm. Right this way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ducked back through the doors, and I got up and followed after. The two of us crossed through into a long corridor of featureless white walls, aside from a metal sliding door in the far end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tornado of emotions was storming around inside of me as we walked down the long hallway. I was nervous, sure, considering all the crap that was about to happen to me, on another end I felt excited about all the things I'd see and experience after being melted. But most of all, I felt a heavy feeling of finalization weighing down on my body. After all the heartbreak, packing, briefing, studying, and excitement building up to everything I was about to go through, the spring that kept winding up was finally about to be let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the door, it slid aside on its own and let loose a cold mist of air from a pure white examination room, with walls, cabinets, equipment, and even full-body uniformed doctors that looked like they were completely bleached, aside from me, once the nurse stepped out and left me as the only splotch of color in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, mister...\" One of the doctors recited from his clipboard. \"...Moenks. You're with the Gateway to the Future program, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, that's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just get dressed in this gown...\" A doctor wheeled a rack with a patient's gown clean and ready. \"...then get laid out on this platform, and we'll have you prepped up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd been through a crapton of physicals to make sure whatever could happen wouldn't kill me. This time around it was just basic warm up, something i'd gone through even more rehearsals for. The doctors scurried around me like they were prepping a turkey on a platter; I didn't wince as they prodded me with needled hooked up to IVs, but this time around I could feel a warmth from the coolants as the liquid traveled through my bloodstream. Even after being told how it'd feel so many times before, I still felt squirmish at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept walking around the table for about an hour, where by that point I was getting too antsy to hold down for long, and I was eager to sit back up after they cleared away. In front of the table, the carting doctor now had a full-body suit made up of thick rubber, but with white shaped and lines designed in that made it resemble a tuxedo. There were even fins on the legs to make them look baggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> is your suit to the grand gala of the future...\" The scientist didn't sound remotely interested as he mumbled the slogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and in the pedestal of the stasis chamber, you'll find what's called a survival pack!\" A different scientist instructed with several others following behind as we speed-walked down the home stretch. \"The device's freeze maintenance are designed to immediately thaw your body in the event of malfunction or early release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point in the dark hallway we passed a wide window allowing a pale light in. I glanced to my side and saw a quick view of huge shelves spanning hundreds of feet from the wall, completely covered with pods. I couldn't help but shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be safe till I'm released, right?\" Probably not the best place for second thoughts, I'll admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I can assure you that our company has some of the most advanced and toughest security of any organization in the nation.\" She said with confidence. \"Once you're frozen, it'll feel like <i>no</i> time once your out. Probably like ten minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm...\" Was all that my jumbled thoughts could let me speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could almost sense the incoming wall as we reached the end, which automatically swung open as if by no command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white, oval-shaped pod sat perched in the center of a small room. Its door was wide open, and I was almost starting to see it as some kind of coffin waiting for me to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words you'll leave in history?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to think of some kind of snarky or cute thing to leave them with, but all I could say was \"...potato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook off an awkward nod with a ponderous look, then gently placed her hand on my back and coaxed me toward the freezer. The metal felt cold through the rubber on my back as I stepped into the pod and laid back against its surface, trying to channel the guy on the men's bathroom side as I let my limbs hang slack against my body as straight as I ever tried to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey surrounded the pod with expectant looks, their hands eager to pull the nonexistent lever, but only willing to go on my mark. Part of me wanted to think of my childhood akin to my life flashing before my eyes, but I pushed it aside, considering how far I'd come. So I just laid there, letting the confirming silence of the room seep in until I finally gave a small nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud whirring noise hummed from the winch as the window lowered and completely closed off the capsule. A red display lit up from above and started counting down from ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just closed my eyes and let my muscles relax, trying to get as comfortable as I could while I listened to the seconds beep away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>KSSSSHT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>...huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this is it?

What happened to sentient humans?\" I looked furious \"Did you eat them!?\" I yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! And I don't think I like how jump to eating, just because we're hefty does not mean we're uncontrollable eating machines.\" The blue one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Celestia, and this is my sister, Luna. And I'm sorry to say it but your kind has devolved quite rampantly. An epidemic of synthetic food additives eroded the human genome beyond repair, generations upon generations simple become savage and beyond reason.\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where the heck do you giants come into play?\" I asked Celestia as Luna opened her palm letting me sit in her open palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually about a decade or so after you were put on ice we Equestrians, a race of genetically modified ponies were integrated into the public, and because of our gene structure we were not only immune to the chemicals mind hampering effects but even thrived off it.\" Celestia said before popping open a can of soda and took a sip and her body pressed gently against her clothes \"As you can see my body is taking in the chemicals rather nicely, because of our anatomy we can actually have children in numbers up to thirty to forty like it's nothing.\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so where do I come in to all this?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a truly unique situation. You're the last human, you could be considered quite the sight to everypony around here. I'm definitely curious what an uncorrupted human's genes look like, and I have a student who'd be very interested as well, if you'd like you can return to my lab and we could work together, with your permission of course. I wouldn't conduct an experiment without your consent. However if you're sick of laboratories I'm sure we can find a home for you with some ponies that will understand you're not a vermin and treat you right.\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...</span></div></div>",

Kinda creepy, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded solemnly. \"As you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Celestia and Luna left the room for a time to discuss things quietly, Celestia called for me, and I left the room as best I could on unsteady feet. Bidding me to follow them down the darkened and broken down hallway leaving the facility, I caught a few glimpses of other ponies ransacking the other rooms inside the facility, male and female alike, some with wings, some with horns, all of them substantially taller and bigger than me (albeit none to the extent of Celestia and Luna).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, I found myself in the main lobby of the cyrotech lab, where a large group of ponies had gathered around Celestia and Luna, who were presently talking to them about their recent discovery, i.e. me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--a waste of such an invaluable discovery, though?\" I overheard one blue pegasus say, her round face puffed up with frustration. \"There's so much we could learn form this human, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True as that may be.\" Celestia said, gently interrupting her. \"We must respect his wishes and allow him the chance to live his life as we see fit. He is just as intelligent and free-spirited as the rest of us, and---ah, here he is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single set of eyes turned to me, and I instantly heard a few dozen gasps of shock and wonder and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really is real.\" one pony said. \"I.....I'd never thought I'd see the day that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't have been possible.\" another one whispered. \"The odds that a single human could have survived, even preserved using cryonics, it's.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it happened.\" I said. \"For better or worse, it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Look,\" I said, taking a moment to compose myself and figure ut what I could say. \"I'll be more than willing to submit myself to a few tests here and there, and answer some question and so on....but I just want to be able to live at least somewhat normally. The odds are against me, I know, that I'll ever be able to make that happen, but I just.....wanna be happy. You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the ponies nodded. \"Where do you intend to go, then?\" one of them asked. \"Where do you intend to live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia said that she would be able to find some ponies that I could live with as I settle in and stuff.\" I replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Celestia said. \"But there is the question, of course, of where you should actually be sent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would probably want to avoid Manehatten and Canterlot, of course.\" Luna said, after mulling it over. \"You'd simply get lost in the former and immediately noticed by the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your word for that.\" I said. \"What other cities or towns or whatever can I go to, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand shot up from among the crowd. \"I have a cousin,\" said a gray unicorn. \"who lives in this one town called Ponyville. It's small, it's quiet, it's rustic as all hell, and the residents are all a bunch of weirdos. You could probably march into town naked juggling fireworks and they wouldn't bat an eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll....I'll keep that in mind.\" I said. \"Any other suggestions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's Appleoosa.\" another pony said. \"It's a frontier town in the middle of nowhere. Not much going for it in terms of an active night life or anything, but it's pretty nice and friendly from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then.\" Celestia said. \"Do any of these particular towns seems interesting to you?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The deathly void was flooded by a heavenly white light that washed clean through my being, seeping into my nerves and reanimating the solid feeling of my body. A freezing cold mixture dripped off my tender skin as my sensed eased back into reality, and I couldn't shut my eyes from the blinding glare that banished every sliver of darkness away, screening over some pastel-colored splotches of the new world outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor of the pod was too smooth and moist to step out of without slipping, and my first step into the future slid out under my feet and sent me nose-first into a furnished-smelling wooden floor. After being stiffened up for so long, all of my muscles ached under even the slightest movement, and my vocal cords were too dry to say anything other than a long, pained groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever I now was, it wasn't one of those impenetrable fortresses the place went on and on about. In fact, as my eyes adjusted to the harsh, vomit inducingly bright colors of the new world, the room looked like it was someone's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" My head seethed in pain. I pressed my head back into the floor clamped my hands over my eyes, relishing in the absence of all the grueling light, only to open them again and completely refreshed to a soft, bright purple wall standing only inches from my face. \"...the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though my muscles barely remembered how to move, I pushed off the ground and lurched onto my feet, looking up, up, up, and up at whatever the round mass before me was, but standing up straight I couldn't make anything out aside from two luscious globes hanging on top by a layer of blue cloth. I stumbled back, peering above the two mounds at two pointed ears rising above the body until I fell back into the pod, and could finally see a face somewhere far, <i>far</i> behind her balloon belly with huge, yet tired eyes perched above a petite snout sticking out from between two engorged cheeks, wearing a set of thick, round-framed eyeglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for some...<i>thing</i> looking down at an alien creature that'd just stumbled into her home, she didn't muster any care to even blink at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Her voice was quiet and low, as if speaking up'd be too much of a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes scanned around the room, taking in that the two of us were alone. \"...are you with Cyrotech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we took you from there a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...took me? Why'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a discount. That, and I kinda prefer short ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short ones? What're you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first bit of physical activity I'd seen from my new host, she raised an eyebrow. \"Weren't you downloaded with all the procedures you needed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I really don't...\" But glancing around, I gave up on talking and ran to a window nearby, gazing down at the streets of a modest village in some mountainous region, absent of any of the space age technology that'd sent me off. Walking the streets were much of the same (albeit colorful) creatures, all dragging around the same balloon-bellies flaunted by shirts, dresses, and suits cut with windows or high arches in the front that let them hang out in full to the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, standing between their globular forms were what I guessed were the males, all much shorter than skinner. They were even joined by an occasional human in staying flanked around the ladies to grovel or massage their midsections, begging to them with utter praise, much to their delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...<i>No!</i>\" I wailed, punched in the gut by all the eons of evolution, progress, and society smothered out by the pastel-vomit dystopia outside. \"'What happened? <i>What've you done?!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed. \"I've paid <i>specifically</i> for a massage/feeder extension, that's what!\"</span></div></div>",

Landing her butt square on me! \"My!\" She raised her butt only to drop it again \"Name!\" Once again dropped her butt on me \"Is!\" I was greeted with another butt slam \"Twilight Sparkle!\" That time she grinded her butt against me as hard as she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hurt all over but nothing was broken Twilight turned around and glared at me \"Got that!\" She snapped at me as I laid there reeling from the butt beating I just received \"Now get up!\" She commanded as she continued walking, the chain dragged me along with her, I struggled to get back on my feet as I had no easy time with her dragging me but I managed to get up, I would have asked her to slow down, but after that butt beat down it was clear she wasn't one for favors<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way to what looked to be a kitchen, in the center was a padded seat that looked big enough to be a stage, Twilight sat down on it, the chair was low enough that her belly sat on the ground, as she did I saw other guys scramble over, some with food some with empty hands, the ones with food had stairs on wheels chained to they're waists that they stopped when they reached Twilight, they carried the tray of food up the stairs to Twilight's waiting disinterested mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four, those pancakes better not be burned, I won't accept another mistake.\" Twilight said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man holding pancakes nodded fearfully and started feeding them to Twilight who ate them contentedly \"You're quite rapacious today, Princess.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight only barely smiled \"Of course.

She never spoke throughout those tedious whole seven minutes, but the defeated faces of the other humans sanded the quiet with a tense edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was someone knocking the door that she'd broken out of her trance, angered that something was delaying her next bite. \"Who is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Twilight, it's me! I'm coming in!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood lightened at the voice, but the already broken faces of the slaves were stabbed even deeper by fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith perfect symmetry, the doors were pushed open by two humans and two stallions shuffling in, holding the corners of a blanket that ran along the ground and under a white, domed wall standing outside. It shifted forward, its blubbery nature practically siphoning its way into the room as it was crammed through pinhole of space provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire lilac-smelling abomination was wrapped up in a sheet of cloth that glistened with a snowy sheen, a long slit cut in the front cut for a generous peep along owner's belly, painting the picture for what looked like a gigantic white eyeball trapped inside with a pupil composed of a large blue gem wedged in the naval. Some distance behind the front lines, a bosom above dragged in along the roof of the passageway, bobbing loose into two gigantic, bulbous mounds standing on top of the pearly mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was scrunched harder against the ground as the visitor's head wormed its way through the door, carrying with her a jewel-like indigo mane that unfurled around the side of her head in a ribbon-thin curl and overflowed down along her back in a dense forest of curls, the tips just teasing the bristles of the carpet. Once she'd finally freed herself form the door and stood inside, she rose to her full height, on par with Twilight in how she towered over me, but with a belly underneath that swelled out the <i>tiniest</i> bit further, crowding up underneath her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Twilight! How are you, today?\" The polite sounding behemoth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing just fine, Rarity. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, as brilliant, as always! I was just coming here to discuss those dress designs you'd been talking to me about.\" She reached right into her mane and pulled out a long scroll that'd been tangled inside. \"Am I at a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're fine! I was just having lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Anyways, I was thinking...\" Rarity held the scroll up and let it free, unrolling a diagram that subtly resembled Twilight in some giant frilly dress, but she never got a word out about the design when she looked my way, eyeing me in curiosity. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My new human. Just had him unfrozen twenty minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Looks like a nice one, too.\" Rarity pleasantly smiled down at me, letting the face hold. The more she watched me stand there, however, the more her face fell in confusion, an eyebrow perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you doing anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Psst!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Twilight's humans nudged me, gesturing his head towards Rarity's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Praise her!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh...\" I took a few steps closer to Rarity and craned myself down onto my knees, hesitating before I carefully guided my hand up and towards her gut's exposed fur. \"...you've got a wonderful stomach, miss-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the very millisecond my fingers touched her, Rarity let out a horrified gasp, shuffling away from me like I'd whipped out a knife and stabbed her. Twilight herself sucked in a breath as her humans murmured to one another in shock, mixed with the hand of that one human slapping over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>DARE</i> you?!!\" Rarity snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What'd I do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't give her a chance to answer. A beam of magic struck my spine, coursing a fluttery feeling along my skin that tugged my hands and feet away from one another along the hardwood floor. When the stream was cut off, and I got back up on my feet, Rarity's enraged face hung even higher over my head, as did her belly button's gem, by a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd barely thought the word \"shrunk\" before Twilight's magic grabbed me off the ground and threw me up against her face, eyes even angrier than Rarity's, and scarier by the size her face had against my more so puny frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me.\" Her voice was calm, but was singed by the fire burning in her eyes. \"I don't know how things on this planet went when your species ruled the planet, but quite frankly, I don't care. <i>We</i> run things now, simple as that, and soon we'll rule a lot more when we weed out anything that'd been hiding from us. As such, you do as we say, when we ask for it, and without messing things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and by the way? I don't know a growing spell. So, if I ever have to shrink you down so much that you're too tiny to do anything I want, then I'll have to find some <i>alternate usages</i> to make my money's worth. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I do!\" I blurted, answering the anger more than the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Twilight guided me back to the ground with her magic, making sure I landed on my feet, but kept glaring me down with a glare better than anything a longer warning speech could do. \"I'm really sorry, Rarity. I think he's a degenerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see.\" Rarity nodded, calmed down enough to speak evenly. \"It's not your fault.\"</span></div></div>",

Their little torture session finally got me to scream as I was sent flying a circle over the pole, but hit a stop so quick you'd think my leg would've been torn off, hanging me only inches from smashing into the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling upside down, my eyes laid on the capsized visage of another pony standing shoulders above Twilight and Rarity, covered with a bubblegum pink coat that fittingly gave her belly the look of a gigantic, perky bubble being lifted a crude foot above the ground by ten so humans and a single yellow stallion fighting a dying cause. It only got harder as she rose one leg to scuff up the dirt, eyeing the belly ball pole with a competitive smirk. I looked down (up?) at the blue hand clamped around my ankle, then down the rest of the arm, which tapered off of the bulging bicep of a rainbow-haired mare dressed in a more sportsy getup than the others' outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, even with a round body on par with the other mares, she had more of an athletic robustness in her shape by mines of muscle inside that pushed the tracts of flab packed onto her body out even further, tightening her gut into a more firm ball shape. All of this, tied up around her matching the pink one's sneer on me, somehow made the most colorful of the bunch the scariest I'd seen yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raise the pole, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's magic jiggled the pole a few more feet out of the ground, adding some slack to the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even counting the game down, bluey stepped back her arm's length away from me,lobbing me up before charging right in with what may well have been the force of a runaway train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a second to catch a breath from the impact, as I was flung straight into a rapid barrage of bellies pummeling every part of my body in every direction, only soft enough that I still had an intact skeleton with each strike. My line of gravity was thrown to shit as I was swung over and around every angle in reach of the pole, with the knot around my angle being battered onto its knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHEN...DOES...THIS...GAME...END?!!?\" I screamed through my tiny windows of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Till...\" Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...\" Pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rope...\" Blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rarity won. The rope snapped clean away from the end of the pole, and I soared up into the air without the closest thing to a safety harness I had, shrieking even louder as I spun up and above the street, coming back down when I was dozens of feet in the air...</span></div></div>",

This time, as Twilight looked around the store from above the shelves, she finally seemed interested in the front doors and trudged her way out of the aisle. I followed just a few feet on her tail as she navigated around the tables and desks along the way for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were back near the front desk, the clerk pony was switched out for a scared-looking human who whimpered and shrunk behind the desk as we made ourselves known.

All the shops' doors were getting closed up, only kept lit for a few stallions or humans left to sweep up, but Twilight still didn't try to keep her head from turning about to look and browse through the windows. Her speed kept drooping, sometimes even hitting a total stop to peer into some random perfume shop, almost daring me to ram right into her or let her book hoard fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never made any more eye contact with her on the walk to know for sure, but just from behind, I could sense an air of smugness puffing up her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Suppertime!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Twilight's slaves were spared any hellos as she kicked the library's door open with her magic but none of them ran to the dining room.

But as the weeks passed, Celestia indirectly stepped down as Equestria's ruler in place of a new name: Stop n' Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was in the additives, maybe the secret sauce, but nobody knew for sure. It got to a point where humans were too scared to reach for fries over the counter at the risk of getting a hand chomped off, but the ponies happily leapt into the empty seats, fattening up faster and larger than any satire against America could ever match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just four more minutes...just four more minutes... </i>The dwindling voice buried deep into the last free regions of his mind whimpered.

The messy chomping in the entire shop hit a dead halt as everypony's noses and eyes were pulled towards the tasty, dismembered spuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan swiped away the tray off somepony's table so he could step onto the seat and stand on top. \"Attention, everypony, I'm sorry to say that this establishment shall be closed in three...\" He glanced at his watch. \"Now two, going on one minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few murmered disappointment; everypony was still eyeing the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But should you still need your Stop n' Burger fix, our other spot in Bloomingdale has just announced a half off special on our new teriyaki ranch potato chips, but only if you arrive in the next half hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a second of silence until the entire crowd exploded into cheers of joy, throwing their hands to the air in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, this bag's free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pitcher's hand he tossed the bag out the door, and in a mad frenzy everypony dove out of their seats in a huddled, yet frantic stampede through the glass double-doors outside. Every patron formed dense a mob around where the bag of chips landed, leaving the place empty and the flustered staff alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tense silence hung over the tables, which were left in complete disarray. Some were tossed onto their floor from the stampede, to join the assorted burger wrappers, crushed soda cups, and flattened ketchup packets littering the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the place up!\" Ian hollered. Elissa and Dan desperately ran out of the kitchen to lock the doors inside, even sliding a broomhandle into the handles in the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm tears streamed from Horace's eyes, and he threw his arms around his coworker, sobbing into his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...Ian...\" He whimpered deliriously. \"I...I love you, man, you're...you're a great guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, muchacha, we've still got cleanup to do.\" He gently pushed his friend aside, handing him a mop from a bucket standing nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're gone...they're all gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace's hand jerked away from the stinging heat of the fryer's grease pipe, shaking the heat off his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there, Horace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" He spoke, observing his unburnt finger. \"Still better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Ian snickered. \"Almost done with the fryer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, just about.\" He announced, sliding the cover on to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how about you handle the drive-thru section and call it a day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Horace threw off his hot gloves and wheeled the mop bucket up to the alcove overlooking the street. The window looked like a glossy black sheet against the night outside, with only a small circle of road lit from the lamp above. The trash can was filled to the very tip, with a few crumpled receipts littering the desktop area, which-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BLAM!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GYAH!!!\" Horace shrieked, leaping several feet away from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <i>hell</i> is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something outside just hit the window! Loo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they could see outside was a blue, globular mass standing a few feet away from the window, jutting out of their line of sight, but a white blouse buttoned around two husky mounds sitting on top stuck a dagger of fear into the hearts of the staff. Seeing as her gut billowed out too far for her to step closer, the pony took two long, reaching steps back, scratching the underside of her gut along the pavement before she heaved her chest forward with all her might, rolling so her head burst through the window, lodged within the frame by her blobby neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE DEMANDS TO BE LET IN!!!\" The pony bellowed. \"SHE NEEDS HER BI-DAILY ORDER OF EXTRA-LARGE HAY CHILI FRIES!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!?\" Ian yelled, his workplace demeanor vanishing. \"Get the hell out of our window!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't!

I know that there are more fries in your freezer, and as of now <i>THEY ALL BELONG TO <b>ME!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elissa, call the police!\" Ian called to the seats outside. There was no answer. \"Elissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa stood stiff and straight in the center of the room, her hand frozen open with the mop it'd been holding now laying on the floor. Her eyes were frozen wide, staring with an unwaveringly straight gaze of steely fear at the outsideworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace and the other workers were watching them from the door, and joined Ian in approaching the windows, cupping their eyes against the glass. All they could see was black. But as their eyes adjusted to the nighttime outside, they could make amongst the black of dozens of large, round figures lumbering towards Stop n' Burger, each a sharp color when they cleared past the parking lot's street lights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: All of the workers escape, but the ponies pursue them in a massive manhunt from the scent of the restaurant on their bodies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The workers can't escape, and are thus forced to barricade the doors and fend off the ponies until either side surrenders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Alternate scenario.</span></div></div>",

Come on--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us in, we know you still--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--An extra large order--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--two hay teriyaki supremes--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Come on, don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd only grew angrier and more frantic with each passing moment, pushing against the doors with greater and greater force. The doors--no, the entire wall was beginning to make increasingly loud noises from the sheer mass being forced upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace and the others backed away form the doors, watching in silent panic as the doors began to buckle in their hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for it, wait for it...\" Horace said, watching as the mob grew bigger and louder and meaner. \"Wait for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the doors finally gave, and a lot of things happened at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mob forced its way trough the doors and windows, Horace found himself running through the back doors of the place, trailing just behind his fellow coworkers and what appeared to be a few hundred ponies forced themselves into the Stop N' Burger, and the air suddenly rang with the sound of broken metal and voracious chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It was only some time later that Horace, Elissa, and Ian stopped running, taking refuge outside an old gas station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I never really thought that our food was never that good.\" I an said. \"Not to warrant.....that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Ellissa said. \"It's insane! Nuts! It's--who on earth would invade a fast food restaurant in order to eat frozen hay-fries and hayburgers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all know all too well that they really did like our food.\" Horace said, wiping his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not to this extent!\" Alissa said. \"Something's wrong. Something's horribly, horribly wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various fast food workers looked at each other in uncomfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do, then?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait it out.\" Horace said, after a moment or two of thought. \"Just--just wait to hear back from our manager, the cops, the government, whatever--and just stay low until someone figures out what's been going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the best idea you've got, Horace?\" Ian said. \"Lay low? Oh, come--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that something like this could happen without getting attention from someone higher up. You can't just overlook something like this, and something will have to be done about...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" Alissa said. \"I wouldn't mind being able to go to work without having to worry about having my hands bitten off by some fat pony---OH GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alissa said thee final words (and then ran off as quickly as she could), Horace and Ian tuned their heads just at the right time to see, rather distressingly, a few dozen pony blobs running at them, all looking hungry and all headed straight at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you got hayburgers!\" one earth pony said. \"Hand 'em over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We smell it on you!\" one pegasus mare said. \"We know you got them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" said Horace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The various workers attempt to simply outrun their pursuers,and lose them in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The workers attempt to find somewhere to hide where the ponies can't get to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He screamed when a meaty hand managed to clasp around one of his feet, but only yanked off his shoe, allowing him to lunge onto the roof. Ian reacted a split second before being flattened and barged into the gas station, running in a straight mad dash towards any back entry he could make, even if he needed to smash a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies all bunched up at the front in a thriving, blobby pile, fighting to go either up or down till they all disbanded to run around the sides. Horace's step stumbled at the roof's arch, and he rolled the rest of the way down the slope before tumbling over the gutter, slamming into the cement ground just in time for Ian to tear the back screen door off its hinges and yank Horace up to his feet by his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace's foot throbbed from the fall, but that and thanking Ian were far from his mind;s reach as adrenaline pumped panic-filled motion into his legs, as though they were puppeteering their movements to keep them as far from the oncoming horde as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe etnire ordeal lasted only ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell are we gonna go?!\" Ian screamed as the two dove around a street corner, but the mob dove through just as easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but we're sure as hell on the way there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich came remarkably early for them in the form of a car zooming against their path across their intersection, the passenger doors opening towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in!\" A familiar voice in the driver's seat spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alissa? Where'd you get this car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hot-wired it! Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know how to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING IT?! JUST GET IN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fumbled into their seats, unable to buckle in or even close the door before Alissa hit the gas, yanking them all into their seats by the car's speed as they rocketed off. A pony's hand smacked the windshield during takeoff, but as long as their legs were, their colossal weights weighed them down so they couldn't keep up with the car's speed, and its three occupants managed to leave them in the dust, traveling onto the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...yet they kept on chasing. Horace watched over his seat's head at the ponies, who kept running after them even as though their lives depended on it until a few turns of the highway around the buildings snuffed out their image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace turned back forward and sunk into his seat, letting out a relieved sigh. Alissa was hunched over the wheel, eyeing the freeway in front of her like a hawk, while Ian sat stiff in a battered daze, staring straight into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" He spoke weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's...\" Alissa paused, then reached over to the radio and switched the dial to ON. \"...let's see if anything's come up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Citizens are now urged to stay in their homes until further notified!\"</i> A professional, yet shaky voice instructed over the speaker the instant it turned on. <i>\"As of 7:00 PM this night, an emergency signal is in effect for the entire city!

The three sat frozen in terror, so deep that Alissa nearly swerved into the guardrail, veering away by nearly a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Ian flipped open the glove compartment and browsed through the cd cases inside, slipping one out. \"...anyone wanna listen to some ABBA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: But as if out of nowhere, a mob of ponies runs down the highway toward them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: They manage to make it out of the city, and drive all night without any rude awakenings...until morning.</span></div></div>",

Despite their fatigue, Horace and the others drove on and on, pumped up on adrenaline and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cassette finally broke from over-exertion, Ian put on the radio and turned it to another news station (the first one having gone silent). The news was, somewhat unsurprisingly, entirely focused on what had been named the \"Stop N' Burger Riots\", even thought it was readily apparent that what was going on was much, much more than just a bit of civil unrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the news reports were erratic and somewhat confused at times, it quickly became clear that what had happened to the workers the previous day was now occurring all across the world (wherever Stop N' Burgers were present, to be exact), and that the ponies were being driven to further and further heights of hunger-driven desperation. Stop N' Burgers were being raided and ransacked, the workers driven away and the contents, cooked or uncooked, devoured on the spot. Trucks hijacked and crashed. Warehouses broken into. Office buildings, libraries, construction sites, court houses, parks, zoos, malls, suburbs, farms, and so on--wherever the products of Stop N' Burger could be found, the ponies were there, stealing whatever food they could and destroying everything in their way to acquire it. Although it was made abundantly clear that the police and other groups were attempting to put a stop to it all, the desperation on the voices of the news anchors undermined whatever comfort was to be made in their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, crap.\" Ian said, looking out the window. \"We're going to have to become hermits, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so melodramatic.\" Alissa said. \"We just need to take a shower--or two, find some new clothing, an we should be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can do we do any of that without getting too close to the ponies, then?\" said Horace, biting his lip. \"They could smell the aroma on us from at least half a mile away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we find someplace isolated. Somewhere off the beaten path. Somewhere without a single pony around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, somewhere where hermits congregate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Ian!\" Horace said. \"Now....look. There are plenty of towns out there where there aren't any Stop N' Burgers, and so we can readily assume there aren't any ponies. We just need to find one, buy a few sets of clean clothes, clean up in a hotel or something, and then we should be good. Easy as pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Ian said. \"Considering how determined those fatass ponies are to get their fix, I wouldn't be surprised to see them searching out of the way towns for any misplaced sandwiches--the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight up ahead, as could be faintly seen in what little light was provided by the lights along the highway, was what appeared to be a massive traffic jam, the lanes of the highway suddenly jammed to the brim with cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did these cars come from?\" Alissa said. \"Why is there a--oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" said Horace, looking at the traffic jam. \"It was going to happen sooner or later....oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three drove up closer to the mass of stalled cars cluttering the highway, it quickly became apparent that this traffic jam was anything but ordinary; not only were the cars in question entirely empty of any passengers (and, oddly enough, many of them actually looked to be brand new), but were also, even more strangely, placed on the road in an eerily neat and orderly manner, placed in such a way to completely block all the lanes except for a single path that zigzagged in between all the cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of that suddenly became irrelevant when the three saw who was waiting for them amidst the makeshift  barricade; two dozen or so earth ponies, all standing guard amidst the open path...and staring straight in the direction of Horace and the others. Even more alarmingly than that, these particular earth ponies were, although certainly enormously fat, were noticeably more athletic looking than the vast majority of the counterpoints, with unmistakable layers of muscle underneath all the flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They set up a barricade.\" Ian said, looking forward with a look of utter despair on his face. \"They set up a barricade to frisk people for their food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....that's something else.\" Horace said, sheer shock inhibiting his ability to think concisely. \"They must've spent the whole night setting these cars up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're starting to notice us.\" Alissa said. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Simply drive through the open path as quickly as possible, and hope the ponies are still sane enough not to play chicken with a speeding car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Drive off-road and get around the barricade all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So it seemed, these particular ponies were still sensible enough to recognize imminent danger, and the car was soon able to clear most of the barricade without trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there....\" Alissa said, teeth gritted and fingers bone white. \"Almost there.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, right out of nowhere, the car stalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not quite. There, right behind them, a red stallion with an orange mane had somehow been able to grab hold of the speeding car and hold it still, even as the car's tires continued to turn as quickly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ain't a fight you're gonna win.\" the stallion said, looking at the car's occupants with an utterly stoic expression. \"Just stop, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell we are!\" Horace said. \"Make this car go as quickly as you can, Alissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: The stallion loses the battle, and the car is able to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The car isn't able to get away, and the three are left at the mercy of the ponies, who are still hungry as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Horace watched through the rear window, the red stallion was slowly, oh so slowly, losing his grip on the car. One finger, tow fingers, three....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just like that, the other earth ponies were on them, grabbing the car by all sides and putting it to a complete stop. The doors were torn out of their hinges, and, before they could even react, Horace, Ian, and Alissa found themselves pulled out of the car and hoisted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the red stallion, yellow stallion, and blue mare in the tattered jogging suit began to search the car (that is, tear it down to the very frame with their bare hands), the three coworkers found themselves hung upside down and shaken by their legs, causing their pockets to empty out onto the ground, the three mares doing the search looking over them with expressions of barely concealed frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They got nothing.\" the mare holding Horace said, letting him slowly fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not possible.\" the red stallion said. \"You can smell it on them as ell as Ah do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any god damn burgers!\" Ian said, grabbing his wallet and cell phone off the ground. \"Did you really think that we would be....I don't know, smuggling burgers through your little barrier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could smell it on you.\" said the mare who had been holding Alissa, her chubby cheeks tuning red with anger. \"And you are employees of Stop N' Burger, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace nodded. \"Doesn't mean a thing, though. We're just work the counter, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right.\" the yellow stallion said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Horace and the others pulled themselves to their feet, the earth ponies surrounded them on all sides, close enough that there was maybe a few inches of space between them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, then?\" Alissa said. \"What in the hell could we possibly offer you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood in the center of the circle, feeling the gaze of so many stallions and mares upon him, Horace began to feel his spine grow cold. Although he had long grown comfortable with the fact that ponies were, on average, noticeably taller than humans were (and wider, once Stop N' Burger started leaving its mark), it was at that particular moment that it really struck him just how big they were. They were massive, really, each and every one taller and broader than any of the three, the sheer amounts of fat on them only making them that much oversized. Even though they might have looked more comical than anything else in some other scenario, with their massive bellies, enormous chests and flanks, their puffy faces, and soft looking arms and legs, it was right then and there that Horace began to truly, utterly, begin to fear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stallion learned forward until his head was level with theirs, the white shirt he wore creaking and the blue overalls he wore beginning to slowly tear. Although his face was just as plump as any other face present, the expression on his face was absolutely stark, his eyes all but boring into the three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must know where we can get some grub, can't you?\" he said, turning to each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't help you.\" Horace said after a moment or two of indecision. \"The only grub we know of--that you're interested in, I mean--is at our original restaurant, and that was emptied out last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not lying to us, then?\" the mare in the tattered jogging suit. \"Not a single lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't going to do you any favors to lie.\" the red stallion said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stallion stood back up again, his enormous belly sliding back into place as he did so. \"If that's the case, then, I suppose that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wearily, he brought the phone away from his face, but his thumb was just about to end the call when a long, tired sigh crackled from the other end. \"Chris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E 10, Brewer Shipley,\" came Chris' answer, mellowed by defeat. \"There's a warehouse down that way where we'd gotten all our stock shipped from. If you guys get on the main interstate, just go North, then turn right on the sign when it appears. Keep driving, and you won't miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Chris, we nee-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone clicked into the dial tone, and Horace's arm drooped limp from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'heard him,\" the red stallion's hand appeared in Horace's gaze, his fingers wrapping around his shoulder. \"Now, take us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave us...what, two directions? What're we supposed to do about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best of it. Now,\" the other hand appeared, pointing to a truck standing ajar along the end of the barricade. \"Go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout losing his grip, the stallion stepped forward. Without any fault in the army to make a break for in sight, it was with a heavy heart that Horace gave in and followed his command, made all the more heavier when he heard his coworkers' get clamped down by some ponies themselves, fighting and demanding to be let go, but the mob didn't have any issue with pushing them along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir fears were pushed even further when they got a closer look at the gold and red label along the semi's trailer, its wording faded by numerous scratches and dents bored down on the metal. The back doors were torn apart all the way down to the hinges, leaving behind only shredded edges, and not a single trace of Stop N' Burger's scent was left unlicked from the inside. Ian and Alissa's captors diverged from the parade to stow them into the trailer, with everypony else disbanding into their own cars hidden along the grid, but Horace was lead to the very front of the herd where the stallion yanked the semi's door open, finally letting go of to push him up along the cab's stairway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace slid into the passenger's side. As the stallion crammed himself into the driver's seat, his body made a perfect plug for the doorway, with his legs and stomach swallowing any pocket of air there could've been left under the dashboard. The steering wheel'd actually been tinkered with to sit up drastically higher, leaving it free from being crushed. With some thrashing, the stallion wedged himself into as comfortable a position he could get in the seat, or as comfortable as he could be his head pressed against the ceiling. His pudgy fingers pinched into his shirt pocket and pulled out the keys, inserting them into the ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few wrenches of the key and some sputtering of the motor, but the engine soon ground its way into a steady roar, and the stallion eased the truck over the rough terrain to drive his way onto the interstate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. That's gotta be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't even realize his hoof went down on the gas pedal till they'd hit a sudden burst of speed, but the stallion was only containing himself enough to not veer off the road and drive straight through the grass. It was in that very moment since they'd crossed paths that the stallion showed emotion, and plenty of it, too. When the logo for Stop N' Burger was clear enough on the warehouse's side for them to see from the road, his eyes went wide, crowding up with a heaven struck glimmer that let his jaw hang agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore along the parking lot at full speed, only slamming down on the breaks when the truck was halfway from smashing right through the building's brick walls. Horace barely acknowledged he'd clamped his hands over his face and clenched every muscle in his body till their tires screeched to a complete stop, and peeked through his fingers to see they were only a few paces from the warehouse's metal shutter. Filled with adrenaline, the stallion kicked the door clean from the truck and dove out onto the ground, popping loose instantly. All the other ponies skidding into the parking lot amassed in a desperate stampede for the shut gate, piling up to whale all their might down on shut metal gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattered, but overjoyed by silence, Horace just sat and enjoyed the stillness of the truck. From the rearview mirror, he could see Ian and Alissa climbing out of the trailer, but all he cared about was the utter relief of not having some pony weighing down on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, It took a deal of time for all the ponies to decide on grabbing at the lower lip and pulling up. With all their strengths working together, they destroyed the motors of the lift gate and opened up a permanent entrance into the warehouse, allowing the sunlight to pour in and shine on...</span></div></div>",

It was slow going, an unfortunate side effect of the rather erratic stops most of them had made, as it took a little while for the three to saunter over and under and around the cars as they searched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no...no....no...no....\" Horace said, looking from car to car to car. \"No....no...no...no...n--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERE WE GO!\" Alissa said, pointing towards a rather homely mini-van towards the rear of the mass of cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace and Ian ran as rapidly as they could through the cars towards the van, and soon found themselves wedged in back as Alissa gunned the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter  a few odd stops as the van maneuvered through the rows of cars around it, the van took off onto the open road and began to speed away from the road, going faster and faster with each moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" said Ian. \"We just need to drive as quickly as possible. Just go forward as far as we can go, find somewhere to hide, lay low until it's all--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole car suddenly let out a tremendous noise as the car came to a complete and total stop, the three occupants slamming forward in their seats as the car came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their vision cleared after the first moment or two of confusion, the three turned their heads to see what could have possibly been the matter--and saw none other than the red stallion standing outside their car, a single hand keeping the car stuck in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" the red stallion said, looking at the three of them with a gentle smile on his face. Even as startling as it was to see that on the otherwise utterly stoic stallion, it was even more so to see how drastically he had changed in the past few minutes, his already massive body having grown in leaps and bounds, his already tight clothing that much closer to ripping into shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No where in particular.\" Ian said. \"We, ah....we just figured that you....didn't need us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stallion began to pull on the mini-van with his one lone and single hand, even as Alissa still continued to try and make the thing zoom away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need us, though?\" Horace said, speaking to the red stallion through the open window. \"You got all the fast food crap you could hope for, didn't you? There's enough in there for--you didn't eat all of it already, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.' the red stallion said, and that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rather uncomfortable minutes, the three found themselves dragged inside of the warehouse, where the army of ponies (all of whom looked significantly fatter than before), a massive pile of torn and shredded cardboard and plastic...and, perhaps most astonishingly of all, a considerably large number of boxes that had not yet been touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to escape again.\" the red stallion said, tearing off one of the door and letting the three of them out. \"Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't even know how I'm supposed to find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me teach you.\" Luna reached both hands behind her back and, despite having no pockets, brought out a smooth, shining blue gem tied to a black cord that hung by her right hand's finger, in her left a vial filled with a purple, transparent liquid. \"This gem will help you find Discord.\" She held the loop open and gently draped it around his neck. \"It contains part of his natural essence. If you hold it perfectly still by the string, it'll point to his location, and glow brighter the closer he is. Once you find him, you'll then have him drink this...\" She took and opened Horace's hand for him, placing the vial in his palm. \"...To give him back his Equestrian form, and any power it contains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace looked at the gem in his fingers, turning around its smooth shape, then to the thin liquid in the vial. It still felt like a dream. Not now, but the entirety of the past few days, and he would soon wake up in his bed safe and sound. But at the back of his mind, there was still a twinge of fear that he couldn't ignore. \"Find discord, give him the vial, and bingo, we're done. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more thing!\" Luna's voice instantly went deathly serious. \"<i>Do not let Discord eat any Stop N' Burger!</i> If he goes, all hope is lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Luna? Are you awake?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's head shot towards the voice. \"Oh, no, it's Celestia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We can't have you dreaming now, we have much to plan for!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go, now! Take heed of what I'd said!\" Luna's body began to fade away, starting from her feet to the rest of her body. \"Good luck, and best wishes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Luna, I need you're help! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she'd fully disappeared, Luna's body was shattered by a beam of blinding, white light swelling into existence behind her, burning away any tangibility to the dreamscape...</span></div></div>",

One hand held onto the steering wheel while another gently stroked the fur on his tender stomach, his eyes teetering sleepily with a food-drunken smile plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was even better than <i>pie...</i>\" He mumbled dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for another bucket of fries from the pile cluttered on his love handle against the door, but a meager rattle coming from within dashed his hopes. A twinge of panic sparked within him and he hopefully battered the cups around for any sign of weight, but there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Devastated, he reached into the cup and plucked out the last fry of his bounty, the sole surviving pillar of his feasting. He took a long, savoring look at the chipotle-covered potato skin before popping it into his mouth, relishing the sweet, yet spicy essence of the fry as long as he could before its crunchy texture was chewed away into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing of interest or excitement could be seen through the window in front of him. The only thing he could see was the truck driving next to his, where the side doors were torn away so that the yellow flanks of its driver could freely hang out. In the window he could see Spitfire, whose breasts had swollen up so much over the past few weeks that the window in front of her actually bulged up, which could barely attest to the gut he'd seen her heave around nowadays. He could see her toss a french fry into her mouth, along with few full bags on the other side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also saw a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!!\" Soarin' channeled his former daredevil lifestyle and swerved his truck against Spitfire's, reaching through her window to grab the fry-holding wrist. \"THOSE ARE MINE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HAY ARE YOU DOING?!!?\" She screamed over the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ORDERED THE BARBECUE RANCH FRIES!!! YOU SAID YOU HATED THOSE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FAT CHANCE!!! BUZZ OFF!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wrestled with one another seven feet over the speeding highway, the sound of metallic shredding grinding behind them as their trailers scraped against one another. The two danced around the road in long, erratic swerves, but the motion shaking them around was barely on their mind as the fries went left or right in their trucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Spitfire felt headlights shining into her eyes. <i>\"CAR!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two jarred apart just in time to avoid a head-on collision, at the expense of the other drivers' hatchback's mirrors disintegrating into a shower of sparks when they slid through the narrow gap supplied. Soarin' barely paid heed, overjoyed that the fries were in his grasp, but was alarmed by three more cars gliding past either side of them, flicking the fry out of the window to be flattened under Spitfire's wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hay was <i>that?</i> Are we driving on the...\" But Soarin caught and sniffed at a faint, yet infinitely alluring aroma speeding away on the hatchback's heels. \"Stop N' Burger...Stop N' Burger! <i>I SMELL STOP IN BURGER!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Spitfire's lurched around and spun the other way, the back wheels grinding against the dirt outside the road till she was lined up and sped away.

Despite the fact that, in a sane and rational world, their sheer masses would have rendered the trucks incapable of movement, they were nonetheless speeding on...and getting closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're actually catching up.\" Ian said, his mouth quivering as he spoke. \"They're getting closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa still said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the highway became a blur around them, all sight and sound distorted and warped, Horace and Ian watched as the occupants of the two trucks began to say...something to them. What it was, it was impossible to tell, but Horace could only assume that they were either taunting them or demanding hayburgers. Both probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trucks, at long last, came just behind the hatchback, the two occupants now grinning at them and licking their lips. Alissa, with nothing to do other than go froward and hope for the best, simply crossed her fingers and prayed for something to happen to change the odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, exactly as she hoped, the odds did change....that is, when the hatchback's engine suddenly failed and the car came to a slow, screeching halt, and the two trucks overtook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the hayburgers, you buckers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pegasi loomed over Horace and company as they stood on the side of the highway, looking down at them with expressions of complete and utter rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We. Don't. Have. Any.\" Horace said, nursing a row of bruises on his arm. \"The last ones we saw were from days and days ago. When other ponies ate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must know where some are!\" Spitfire said, her teeth gritted and her eyes slitted. \"If you don't tell us where they are--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE. DON'T. KNOW!\" Horace said. \"And yelling at us isn't going to change a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin looked to his counterpart. \"This is just a waste of time. They don't know anything! They're useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to him!\" Alissa said. \"We really, really don't know a thing about any more hayburgers or anyth--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Spitfire said. \"I might not be as fit as I used to be, but if if you don't stop lying I'm going to flatten you!\" Her body tilted forward, just a little bit, and Alissa took a few steps backward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Unless I get some answers now, I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few unsteady steps that made the earth shook, Soarin wobbled over to Spitfire, grabbed her by the shoulders, and began to whisper into her ear. As the three coworkers watched, already quite certain that whatever they were going to say was going to be nothing but trouble, Spitfire and Soarin suddenly began to grin again, a smirk on either fat face that promised all manner of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Spitfire said, looking down at the three coworkers. \"After discussing this...little problem with my associate, we have decided.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, the red stallion's car was right behind theirs, and Alissa could see him in the rear view window, his face now smiling gently at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no....\" Alissa said, pushing the petal harder and harder. \"Not yet, not yet, not yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pickup truck drove just alongside the three's car, with the red stallion right alongside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn over!\" the red stallion yelled. \"Come on, then, you don't want to be in a wreck, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa looked over at the red stallion, who was smiling at her so gently, so calmly, that it looked like the most utterly smug expression a face could make. Which, much to the surprise of everyone there (included Alissa herself), caused her to swear at the red stallion a few times, flip him off--and the proceed to slam her car into the side of the pickup truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this final indignation placed upon it, the pickup truck finally succumbed to the laws of physics, the frame coming in on itself and breaking down. As the red stallion proceeded to try to escape form inside it (which was, to say the least impossible), the pickup truck proceeded to come to a complete stop in the middle of the highway, reduced to a crumbled pile of junk--just in time, in fact, for the two other vehicles to run straight into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wreckage behind them fell into the distance (and the ponies located within attempted to free themselves, locate their comrades, an maybe find a new way of getting their hands on hayburgers), the three former fast food workers looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the headquarters, then?\" Horace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the headquarters.\" said Alissa. \"Can you check the glovebox to see what tunes they have?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although, of course, there were still reports of looting and stealing and burglary throughout the world, it seemed that the vast majority of unrest had finally ceased, the ponies having finally accepted that there was no more Stop N' Burger products to be found. As reassuring as this may have sounded, the news also noted that various state governments were actually approaching Stop N' Burger about the possibility of expanding their supply, and were actually offering to \"subside Stop N' Burger's expansion and development, in order to allow for the needs of both Earth and Equestria to be met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're handing over control, then.\" Ian said, looking out the window. \"They handing over everything to those guys, just so that they can keep the ponies happy and keep them from getting pissed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does sound rather...bad, yeah.\" Alissa said. \"It....well, it makes sense.

Horace and Ian couldn't do anything, forced to watch as the ponies stampeded towards them with a crazed heat in their eyes, their hands ready and reaching to tear the car apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the ponies finally met the implications of their body shapes and stumbled around against the slope of earth off the road, uselessly tumbling down onto the ground to be piled on by other rotund equines rolling head over heels, making for an effective barrier from outside the highway. Horace actually snickered, the first real laugh he remembered having over the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, I think we're gonna make it!\" Alissa said excitedly. She actually started turning back towards the road, still with plenty of space between them and their aggressors. The wheels quaked against the stone bed as she veered back onto the clear highway, but with a mighty bump that would've sent everybody inside into the roof, the car came to an immediate halt, its back wheels spinning uselessly inches above the ground. \"What the fuck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shit!!!\" </i>Ian yelped. Once again they were trapped to the mod, who were quickly lucid to the downed van. Alissa furiously wrenched at the key, the wheels, the brakes, the drive shift,<i> anything</i> that could get them running away from the incoming mob, but nothing could free them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even a shrug, Ian leaned forward and threw back all his weight onto the seat, going back and forth, either wigging out with panic or trying to help the dying cause. Whatever the case, Horace joined in, making for a cacaphony grating at the back of Alissa's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOULD YOU GUYS CUT THAT SHIT O-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the car rocketed off with such speed that they nearly soared off the other end of the road, pouring great distance between them and the mob that was only seconds from turning them over.

Although the makeshift barricade was more than a little ramshackle and bare, the sheer amount of stuff in the way, if nothing else, at least looked like it would make trouble for anyone trying to break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nuts.\" Ian said, panting away. \"Why would any of these lunatics try to break in over fast food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really going to take that chance?\" Horace said. \"How many times did you almost loose a finger or two because some unicorn wanted his burger faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ian was about to make some snippy remark (and then stopped when he realized that what Horace had said was entirely true), the three suddenly became aware of the many eyes on them. No matter where they looked now, the ponies were crowded all around the building, crammed into each and every visible spot along the door and windows, all looking particularly intent on getting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET US IN!\" one earth pony said, slamming  a meaty fist into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're closed.\" Horace said, raising his voice as to be heard through the glass. \"And even if we weren't, we wouldn't have anything to give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON!\" a unicorn said, her face locked in a grimace of pain and anger. \"WE KNOW YOU'RE HOLDING BACK ON US!

Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of making some empty promise or some demand that they be let in, Octavia then did something that left Horace and the others speechless for a time; namely, hold up a large bag filled with gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true that humans highly value gold, yes?\" Octavia said, opening the bag enough just to let the coins within appear in view. \"Here is my proposal, then; if you agree to sell us your wares, we will not only do with the utmost care and consideration, we will also repair all damages to the restaurant and.....tip well. Interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, ponies in the crowd  began to pull out satchels and bags and purses filled with gold bits, and soon there were dozens of hands in the air, holding up vast, vast handfuls of coins in the air. As could be told with only a moment at a glance, there was enough gold on display to make the three of them....well, if not quite rich, at least very, very well off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace glanced back at the other two, both of whom looked, despite their mutual exhaustion and fear....rather excited. \"Agree, man!

No yelling. No pushing. No grabbing. No anything, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were, for Horace and the others, among the strangest they would ever experience. In an almost perverse parody of what their ordinary days had been like, the three went about taking the orders the ponies gave (which were, more often than not, somehow considerably bigger then they had been before), preparing them as quickly as before, and handing them over, as the ponies thanked them profusely for their service...and, most significantly, handed over fistfuls of coins, until the counter was literally overflowing with gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough none of them would ever, ever admit it (after all, they were getting enough money in a single night to set them up for life), all three humans were on edge, not because of what had happened earlier, but simply by how nicely the ponies were acting. Gone was the screaming, the yelling, the frantic demands and commands and complaints and whatnot, and the ponies were utterly, perfectly civil, maintaining absolute calm and politeness, even as the restaurant became so crowded that more and more ponies were being forced to stand, and the tables and chairs they had been using began to collapse under the sheer number of ponies gathered so closely. And, although Horace was the only one to really notice this (being the one working the counter), there was an unmistakable tension underneath all the niceties on display; the ponies, for all their efforts to conceal it, were quite clearly straining against their desire to simply lash out and take what they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" said Octavia, returning from her latest order, her gut now bulging out even more so than before. \"A half dozen hayburgers, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\" Horace said. \"I trust that this deal has been to your liking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it has!\" Octavia said, nodding gently. \"I can only hope that we've been able to sufficiently reward you for your efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace didn't even bother to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alissa, however, had the obvious advantage of a skinnier build, and saw the pony charge with enough time to spin her arm back to shoot it out in a fist, her timing so perfect that the unicorn didn't even charge a spell before she was punched squarely in the face, going down with all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be the last of them!\" She called to the other two. \"So, where do you guys think we should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Alissa turned back to discuss a plan, the two didn't even look like they remembered the melee they'd just won as they shoveled off as much as they could of the overflowing pile of the gold coins on the counter, using their uniform shirts as pouches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...are you guys <i>crazy</i>?\" She spat incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd be crazy <i>not</i> doing this!\" Ian snapped back as he pulled in his last armful, finally managing to hobble away from the pile as Horace scooped himself a few more. \"Alright, <i>now</i> we're set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Horace waddled out the door before Alissa, but she didn't dare let them take their time and pushed them out by their backs, not caring about any of the few gold coins that fell out of their shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, beating the crap out of an angry mob and looting them of their cash.

With her mind focused on the street names, Alissa used her vague memory of the Stop N' Burger's location map to find as far a place from a chain as they could go, while also far from any houses or suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you listen to yourself?!

So go ahead and drop all that gold you've got, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't hear Horace say anything else, nor the splash of all the gold he was holding splash all over the street, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and my phone's dead.\" Alissa remembered. \"What about you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, I left mine in my pants...back there.\" Horace replied. Alissa looked back at Ian, and he answered the same with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at the very least, the police station's a block or two away, so we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Horace and Ian stopped in place, surprised as Alissa came to a halt, her head darting left and right. \"You guys hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\" Horace asked. Everything sounded quite, safe for a coin jingling here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" Alissa hushed, raising an arm back at them. She leaned to her right, intently staring down the turn of the road, her eyes narrowed for a few seconds before they went wide. \"Oh, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as possible, Alissa power-tiptoed between the two of them and pinched at the arms of their shirts, pulling them to the sidewalk with a frantic look.<i> \"Hurry, just follow me!\"</i> She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alissa, what's going on?\" Horace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's another pony! C'mon, under that bench!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorace and Ian's face went blank, and they quickly stealth-walked after her, tightening their shirts around their coins to keep them from rattling. Alissa got on her knees and crawled under a bus stop's metal bench, but the boys had to get on their sides and awkwardly kick their way in to fit inside while holding onto their gold babies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where are they?\"</i> Horace whispered, squinting as he looked around the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Down the street ahead of us, just a building away, or...oh...oh, no...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs some large, indescribably shaped shadow trundled around in the darkness around a streetlight down the road, Horace and Ian both shrunk back a few inches as they say the very front of some round, white mass come into the light. Even as the first to see it, Alissa gave a squeak as the pony came out in the open, struck by how large it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least with all the other ponies, their obesity always had some form of a resemblance to that of any other human's, but when the unicorn'd fully waddled his way underneath the streetlamp's light, the three couldn't see anything aside from some giant, pink wrecking ball that just happened to be a fat-faced stallion's belly, somehow wobbling with each as his bulging legs scraped along its back, with its underside rubbing along several feet of the road ahead of his feet. The blue jeans he wore looked like they were rubber stretched as thin as paper around the indomitable thickness of his legs, and his shirt was only occupied by the two enormous mounds of his chest and a very small sliver down his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, as he stomped past a street sign that didn't even come close to his shoulder, the three shrunk back. They hadn't seen a pony who wasn't a foot taller than them, but this one had to be over nine, probably just a few notches under ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho...ly...christ...\" Horace loudly mouthed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" The stallion groaned, his face taught in discomfort between his round, blobby cheeks. His arms massaged whatever they could reach down his stomach, which, as it gave a cavernous rumble, must've been just a gigantic sphere of pain hanging off of him. \"Food...need...<i>food...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan and Horace weren't even talking, but Alissa's hands clamped over their mouths, almost hoping she had a third for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when the unicorn was halfway across the intersection, he stopped. The pain in his face turned to surprise, his ears perking, and he gave the air a small sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face fell in anticipation, turning towards the bench, and he said something. The three couldn't hear what it was from where they were, but could make out four syllables, one of them just a single letter...</span></div></div>",

Help me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan took Alissa's side and helped her push while Horace yanked on the other end, but the legs of the heavy appliance screeched along the floor only a few inches with each precious second. Outside the kitchen, a brown stallion in a trench coat managed to tumble over the window ledge and roll onto the linoleum floor, and with a huff he wobbled onto his feet, stomping towards the kitchen while sliding aside anything in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURRY IT UP, GUYS!!!\" Horace yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP PULLING AND WE'LL GET THERE!!!\" Alissa screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore ponies tumbled into the room, but the determined earth pony shuffled in sideways and still ended up plugging the passageway with his belly, which puffed out a few feet too many to easily squeeze through the double doors. The three huddled closer to the wall, but the refrigerator's stubs only had a few inches to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you louts, stop wasting our time!\" He demanded with a british accent. His free arm waved around to grab at the cowering employees, but his fingers were only a foot of space too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We're </i>the ones wasting <i>your</i> time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pony's eyes widened as something pounded him on the other side, jutting him a bit of the way through. With the most seething extent of their muscles' stamina the three kept pushing, until the rubber stoppers finally slipped over the door's hinges, and in a flash the three leaped onto the door and arm wrestled to clasp the handle, pulling open the panel into the dark passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even a second after Horace pulled down the door and threw down the lock that a clamor of pounding on the door mixed with numerous vicious hollers sang from the other side, but thankfully the door didn't budge in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Horace finally spoke. \"...who the <i>hell </i>put the refridgerator on the storm cellar's door?\"</span></div></div>",

Mares and stallions alike began to grab and tear at the three frantically, screaming and yelling all the while, and the three responded appropriately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three began to assault the surrounding ponies as best they could, their hands and feet landing against the massive equines with all the strength they could muster, slamming into chests and stomachs and arms and legs and faces. Soon enough, the ponies surrounding them were beginning to yell out in pain and fall over, and, much to the surprise of the three workers...they were actually holding their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder any other circumstances, this feat might have been impossible; the ponies too many and too strong to be withstood. These ponies, however, were fat and sluggish, their bodies weighing them down and getting in their way, more often than not blocking each other and slowing them down too much to be maneuverable. More than one pony was taken out of the fight when they were knocked over (either by the humans or by one of their would-be comrades) and unable to get up under their massive weights, or were simply stuck in whatever door or window or whatever they attempted to pull through. It helped, one supposed, that the ponies were actively trying to not hurt the three workers, and that they weren't exactly in the most sensible or reasonable mindset at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first few minutes of the brawl, he kitchen was suddenly filled with fallen ponies,  trying their best and failing miserably to get up again, the ones behind them still struggling to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Horace said, noticing that the back door actually looked to be somewhat sparsely populated. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did, tripping and stumbling over te ponies lying on the ground. The way did indeed seem clear, and it looked as if a clean get-away was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fans crammed inside didn't even care that they couldn't see each other, or even that they'd spent hours standing around in total darkness, as they were all too overcome to think straight by the urge to cheer, pump their fists, or even throw a chair at a random spot in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the ponies who'd get hit would care. It was Slamquestria, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lights above the wrestling were switched on, however, everything that'd come before might as well have been silence when the ponies chanting exploded into a deafening uproar like a plague, with everypony desperately jumping out of rhythm to get a glimpse of the action. The sound couldn't of gotten any louder, but the mobbing hit its biggest intensity around a path leading from the penthouse of the stadium to the ring itself, at a set of doors that unleashed a large gout of steam as they slid apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony who came out towered high over every head in the stadium, relishing in the glory raining down on her as she strutted towards the ring. Slamlestia's voluptuous frame was blackened out by a dark business suit and tie, eyes covered by a pair of mirrored sunglasses, but she gladly broke out of her professional attire to yuck it up with fans lucky enough to have tickets for seats along the path, taking plenty of time to give handshakes, high fives, noogies, join in on selfies, or even kiss babies on her way to ground zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA microphone rose from the center of her stage when she made it to the steps, and with a great flourish she snatched it off the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>CITIZENS OF SLAMQUESTRIA,<b> ARE YOU ALL READY FOR SOME SLAMMING?!</b></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lone \"yes\" to be heard in the uproar, but the sheer excitement setting the stadium ablaze spoke enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>THAT'S NOT A YEAR'S WORTH OF WAITING, I SAID <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><i>ARE YOU READY FOR SOME SLAMMING?!</i></font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and at that, the volume of the mob hit the highest volume it'd ever reach, enough to melt the earbuds of anybody who hadn't immunized themselves after getting tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Well, I guess I'll make it worth your while, then! I'm here, you're all here, everypony watching at home is here, our Slam Roulette<sup>TM</sup> is here, and of course our Slam Queen III is one year ready for some slamming! So, without further ado, let's give a Slamquestria to our Slam Queen VI, the one, the ONLY, <i>THE SMASHDANCE!!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door at the other end of the stadium opened, this one much wider and taller than Slamlestia's entrance. Once again, the audience went nuts, but unlike with the Slam President, she didn't spare them a glance as the light of the stadium poured through the opening doorway. She only stood still, waiting for the motors to swing them open all the way before making her first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several paces for her to push her stomach from the office's darkness alone, and just a few more for her to lead her barn-sized shoulders out into the stadium's cool air. Slamlestia may have been a big pony, but Smashdance was big enough to swallow a dozen Slamlestias whole, not just for standing twenty feet in height, but lugging around a behemoth of a belly that'd overflowed in a round mass that perpetually sagged onto the ground, but the superpowered muscles buried inside her body smoothed out its form enough that it jutted in the shape of a near perfect ball. A few feet of impenetrable-looking lard bulked up her legs and arms enough that her thighs kept swishing around one another with her steps, but her strength puffed them up into an even tighter seal, her arms bulging intimidatingly with the slightest movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vast amount of her bright pink fur was left nude, clothed only by a set of streamlined leg armor and a spiked metal bikini that binded around a pair of breasts each weighing in at several tons, sitting on her stomach in what'd be a large armful for her. Whatever expression her face could've been giving was shielded from the world by a metal mask with two large, black lens in lace for the eyes, and a vent at the tip of the muzzle, with only her horn, ears, and a head of toffee colored waterful of hair to poke free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny purple dragon in a black and white referee uniform scampered a few feet behind, with a gray pegasus in a blue uniform trying to keep a heavy camera trained on the monumental alicorn. She didn't give them a visible glance, nor said anything on her trek through the thundering applause and to her home on the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Mares and gentlestallions, tonight marks Smashdance's third year anniversary during her unmatched slam conquest along the universe, and tonight marks the beginning for what shall hopefully be a fourth! Slam Queen VI, <i>are you ready?</i>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>Yes, my slam president.</b></span>\" What would've normally been a soothing, harmonious voice was filtered by her mask's speaker, leaving it cold and mechanical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not wait any longer! Let's ready the Slam Roulette<sup>TM</sup>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed her mic to the ceiling, and through the fluorescent cage keeping the stadium lit, a tank with hundreds of plastic capsules inside was lowered on chains that didn't try and stop the device from swaying around. The movement rattled around the balls inside, shuffling them around on top of the mechanisms and passageways built within the base until one managed to worm its way down and into the main drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one final wave of anticipation before the fireworks began, the audience watched in glee as a single bulb rolled down the clear tube coiled around the tank's body. Reaching an arm over her head, Slamlestia's timing was perfect to hold a hand open under the tube's mouth when the tank hit its chain, the capsule plopping into her palm after a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Alright everypony! Grab your snacks, grab your drinks, 'cause now it's time!\"</b> She unscrewed the lid, taking out a folded up sheet of paper.<b> \"The next spot in Smashdance's slam quest shall be...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\"...citizens of Earth.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a long, foul sweep that emanated across the entire planet, a wave of darkness muted the thousands of frequencies flying through Earth's skies. For a few seconds, all of humankind's televisions, phones, screens, monitors, and displays went dead, disintegrating into static, and all the conflicts and trivial bickering that gripped the planet hit a pause as all turned to stare back at the masked being hijacking their feeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\"My name is Smashdance, Slam Queen VI of planet Slamquestria.

But no matter what, anyone says, there is no doubt that this was a controversial topic they were listining to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We humans raped, murdered, and deported millions of people as we invaded Canterlot. This is what happens in modern warfare. Everything is affected because the scale of the conflict is not limited to just fields. It\u2019s entire cities, economic zones, population centers. Because the Pony's did not surrender, the outcome of the war came through bloodshed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millions more died, us Humans claimed land for ourselves, and Equestria was divided.\" said Jack Boss as he glanced down at his papers set on the podium. His professor had assigned the class to make a presentation on a controversial topic. He, of course, chose the one that no one elce dared to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Equstrian Invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war is finally over. It has been over for ten years now. The ponies have lost. Their plan to enslave humanity has failed. Hundreds of thousands of ponies are dead. Hundreds of millions humans dead. Homes destroyed. Their nation was shattered and near annihilation. All because they underestimated humanity and our refusal to lose the very thing thing that makes us human: Freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rebuilding of Equestria was relatively quick, and the country has become close allies with nations such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The formerly Isolationist Empire Is now one of the largest economies In the world, and a first world, democratic nation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Jack Boss's presentation went on to criticize Humanity's treatment on ponies during the war, shoving them in cramped interturnment camps, the fascist movements that sprung up after the war that were downright racist towards ponies, and what would have happened if Celestia had just surrendered to avoid all the extra conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally done the lights brightened followed by applause from the audience and the professor. The lights revealed his peers, a relatively small but still substansial amount of humans mixed with ponies. When the war ended, Princess Twilight Sparkle negotiated with the United Nations that they would help restore there cities and homes, but in return human refugees would get to live in equestria, or vice versa. Some live in racial only settlements, others share with each other. Think of it as a long-term plan to get the two races to coexist with each other. Having human children grow up with pony foals might help ease tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even Twilight knew that the power of friendship and magic would not be enough to heal the wounds between ponies and humans. It would take generations for it to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Boss returned to his seat on the bleacher like chairs in the lecture hall. Along the way he almost tripped and fell to the floor thanks to certain pony's leg obscuring his path at the last moment. Jack gave the pony a look, but she just turned her head and scoffed, as if interacting with him was beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years after the ponies came to Earth and Jack still had a hard time adjusting to seeing them evreywhere he went.  Sometimes they were brilliant, sometimes they were ruthless, and their seemingly erratic behavior scared him, especially when he was a kid. Their average height was 9' 7'', making them tower over humans in evrey sence of the word, with anything under 7 ft being considered short. Human infrastructure had to be remodled due to the ponies presence, and older buildings that couldent be facelifted were dubbed 'inhospitable' by the ponies standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also really, really fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them, wheather or not they're male or female, are huge, giant masses of fat. Jack found himself on average evrey pony he meets, his head only reaches where the belly meets the breasts and or moobs. More immediately though were their stomachs. It was completley normal for a pony's belly to be stretched three feet in front of them and almost down to their feet. They were 6 ft wide from hip to hip, almost as wide as Jack was tall, with legs like tree trunks. The typical pony chest were usually flabby breasts that covered another roll over their stomach. Their faces had cheeks two inches out from the rest of their face, and beneath their chins was a roll of fat that connected their head to their body. When you put a human and a pony next to each other, there is no doubt that one is lithe, and the other was giant, fat dripping from every inch of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't care though, and neighter did the ponies. It didn't affect them In anyway, and well, as long as they were still healthy, who cared? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Jack took out his notebook to take notes on the next speaker's presentation. Something about Nuclear Weapons and America. Jack did not care though, all that much. The same topic was talked about twice before he got to go up. When it comes to controversial topics people sure like to get uncreative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack yawned and stretched his arms above his head. He already had the notes to the thing down, so he figured he could afford to sit this one out. Leaning back, however, his body was met with...</span></div></div>",

Whoever it was shifted around in acknowledgement, but didn't pull back any further. \"Hey, buddy, you're right on my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jack barely had to turn his head before he could recognize the bright blue fur along the blob of exposed flesh trying to swallow his seat, and know to hold his tongue and keep his head low. The munch from a hoagie was enough of a clue to tell whoever it was that sat behind him, the face fresh in his mind of one of the sorest losers of the Great Equestrian war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow ignored the glare from the professor as she ate her lunch in class, focusing her eyes on the next student to give her presentation, but Jack didn't even have to face her to tell it wasn't getting absorbed. Just the fact that they were in the same room together, let alone making physical contact, was proof enough of that, the pegasus' attention never diverting from whatever human may have been a stretched arm away, always focused on whatever new, creative ways she had in mind to sit on, wrestle, attack, or just about anything to make the poor bastard scared to leave his room the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever her choice was for the day, she was clearly taking her time in pulling through. Probably to let him stew in his thoughts, he could tell, the seconds going by each mounting a new idea of whatever pain he'd be in store for when the lecture was over, but he was so submerged in his own dread that he didn't notice the space around him shrinking until two pastel colored rolls of fat poured over either side of his chair, forcing him to pull his arms in tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of expensive perfume was enough to tell him who was seated at his right, an arm falling on his leg that was crammed tightly into a blazer jacket's sleeve. Rarity may have been one of the more easygoing mares on campus, never being really vocal against humanity or the spot the war left ponykind in, but still took the time to scoff whenever in the presence of a human. With her ass swallowing the chairs for six seats over and her stomach crammed tightly against the ones in the next row, any route of escape past her was rendered totally impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe telltale crunch of a taco came from the other side, and he looked to his left to see Sonata Dusk, not nearly as expensively dressed as Rarity, having chosen an orange and purple-striped top that greatly left the pale blue fur on her immense gut open to the air, her ass compressed in a pair of stretchy black shorts, but was equally as massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" No sooner could Jack ask what was going on before a certain wall of grey sidestepped into what little he could see up ahead and sat down, both his knees getting wedged underneath one of the roll's of Derpy's back fat. As often as ponies came and went, the dimwitted pegasus was an absolute mammoth even by their kind, her mass sprawling so far out in every direction that he could hear the angered grunts and groans of several students sitting up ahead, her all-encompassing leviathan of a gut presumably flattening the seats for several rows down in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Jack whimpered nervously. \"W-What the hell are you guys doing? Back off!\"</span></div></div>",

In an instant, the back of Jack\u2019s chair broke off in a loud snap as Rainbow Dash\u2019s sky blue blubbery belly leaned in on him, pressing his frame into Derpy\u2019s flabby backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jack, the loud sound of wood crunching and buckling was muffled out by Rarity and Sonata\u2019s thighs as they scooted effortlessly against poor Jack, plugging in the rest of the space that wasn't overtaken by Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing feeling of dread slowly overtook Jack as his was unmercifully squished by four of the most infamous ponies on campus. He couldn't move, immobilized by the heavy pudge that surrounded him. The soft, warm flab could only buffer out so much weight as his body contorted itself inwards. He could barely even open his mouth to breath, let alone cry for help. He was completely at the whim of the four that had him boxed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do with him?\u201d Rarity whispered quiet enough that the Professor couldn't hear her, eyes on the human girl at the front of the class to give the impression that she actually cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep him right there.\u201d Rainbow Dash said as she took another bite out of her hoagie. The faintest ghost of a smile graced her lips as she felt the human squirm under her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he can get away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you believe the nerve of that pathetic little ape?\u201d Sonata said as she put more pressure on her right thigh, filling Jack\u2019s world with stretchy black fabric and light blue. \u201cThat all of what happened could have been avoided if we had just dropped down on our knees and beg for their forgiveness? Ponies do not surrender. Ever.\u201d Her voice almost broke out into a shout as she struggled to keep her voice down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor eyed the four ponies suspiciously, almost sure that they were sitting somewhere else when the class began. But It didn\u2019t matter. They didn't seem to be doing anything. As long as one of them wasn't sitting on another human than everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy giggled softly as he felt Jack\u2019s head get stuck in another one of her back rolls. Rarity playfully shushed her to keep quiet.. The professor eyes the four again, but thought nothing of it. He might have to talk to Rainbow and Sonata about eating in class again, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow, Rarity, Sonata, and Derpy kept Jack boxed in for another hour before the last of the presenters finished up. With a reluctant sigh, Dash eased off the pressure she was putting on her stomach and leaned back, revealing Jack back to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a heavy intake of air as he struggled to keep it in his lungs, deflated and compressed much more than it was an hour ago. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a grunt she hefted up her bulk and stood up, signalling for the other three to ease up on the squishing as well. Sweet relief coursed through Jack\u2019s body as it no longer had to go under such stress, but he was still having a hard time breathing right to enjoy it much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow. Your. Place.\u201d Rainbow whispered. She started to walk down the stairs of the lecture hall, her weight making the wood cry out in discomfort under her. Sonata didn't even give Jack a look back as she followed after Dash. Derpy used her wings, which were somehow still able to carry her weight, to fly down to the bottom of the hall, accidentally bumping some heads with her belly on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, however, stayed back for a moment, only a moment, to cast Jack an almost sympathetic look. There was no doubt in her mind that the little punk deserved what he got, speaking about her race as if he was the expert. But maybe they went a bit...overboard with the punishment. Sometimes she forgets how the very same race that beat back Equestria in the war was the same one she was, reluctantly, living with. Fragile and easy to bruise, yet at the same time the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and stood up, adjusting her skin type blazer, and walked down the Aisle to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Boss slowly trudged out of the lecture hall, walking with a heavy limp. He made a mental note to chose a seat at the very front, as to never have to go through that torture again. The room was completely empty, aside from him, bathing the hall in silence. It took him twenty minutes to regain his strength again, for his lungs to return back to their default shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, last class was the final subject of the day, so it wasn't that he was late for anything. Except maybe for collapsing into his bed back at his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Boss lived his entire childhood in Ireland, within a predominantly human society. He was twelve years old when the war with Equestria broke out. Thankfully, Ireland was far, far away from the battlefield, so his country's only contribution to the effort was zealous volunteers and ammunition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of his childhood, Jack had actually doubted they had existed. He had only seen them on Television interviews and from tourists who recounted their tales about them, never seeing one in person. It was until Jack was eighteen, however, when he'd finally met one in person. He was in Dublin, applying for college, when he was world was suddenly filled with pastel yellow flab as a pony cut him off in line. She was...nice enough. It was obvious she didn't like humans that much, but he assumed living for ten years with them has helped take the edge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, Jack always has been fascinated by them. Particularly, their history. He always found it curious how there was no recorded history before the first Hearth's Warming. But whatever he would try to ask about it, he would always get the same answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a time of war and death, why would we focus on such a painful past?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then , Jack knew what he was going to major in at college. Equestrian History. But unfortunately, it turns out ponies don\u2019t like humans who try to know more about Equestria than themselves. The squishing that Jack still was feeling, was not the first time that had happened. It was it's the first time four of them had ganged up on him, and was the most painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was quick to move on, and was soon outside the steps to his dormitory. It was formerly gender orientated, but the arrival of the ponies had caused some changes to the campus, mainly, unisex dorms. Princess Twilight said that Ponies and humans should not be separated in any capacity, in an effort to try and ease more tension between the two races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, construction had been going on all over the outface of the building to make larger rooms that could accommodate ponies. Jack ducked his head under the wooden planks that construction workers were walking on and headed onto the entrance of the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonies were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave a somewhat despaired groan at the sight of the brightly colored blobs. They were relaxing in the foyer and partially blocking the staircase to get to the upper floors. Of course, his door was on the highest one. With effort, he strained himself over the side of the railing, realizing it would be proba;y pointless to ask the currently engrossed pony to move out of the way. Panting, he treked his way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highest floor of the dormitory was the last to be exclusively human, mainly because the construction crew hasn't bothered to renovate it yet. At first, that gave Jack some relief when he heard the news. But than it was revealed that the administration was going to put ponies in their anyway, because they had, and you're not going to believe this, over-accepted more ponies than they have rooms for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then Jack heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive clip-clop of hooves on linoleum. Every muscle in Jack\u2019s body tensed up. He really didn't want to have to deal with more typical pony antics today. But it looks like he just might.

He didn't give the risk of it being anybody else a chance and shot the stink eye right over his shoulder, hitting his mark dead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you...\" Rarity started, but stopped herself before she could ask what'd be an obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you expect? I live here!\" Jack spat at her, slotting his keys in the lock. \"You know, humans lived in these dorms <i>before</i> you guys'd shown up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Rarity's jaw hung open in surprise, head pulling back, but she furrowed her brow in anger and held her breath. \"<i>Well!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what, you think <i>you</i> guys are the only ones who couldn't keep every single scrap of what they cared about in the war?\" He continued, running on a second wind. \"I think <i>I'm</i> just as entitled as a pony can be to talk about a war we partook in to defend ourselves from slavery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rarity shrunk back at that claim, he nodded triumphantly and turned back to his room, grabbing at the door handle, but let go in surprise when he felt the tip of her tail strike him in the back of the neck. Shooting another glare over his shoulder, he locked eyes with Rarity as she gave him one of her own, the two standing in a silent stare down before they both shuffled back into their rooms, their locks clicking almost simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And 1...2...3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flourish, Jack swished his finger around in the air before tapping it down on the 'enter' key, relishing in the absolute final step for whatever work was left for the weekend. When the confirmation appeared on his laptop in bright green, he took it as permission to finally lay back in bed, resting his neck on his hands and softening his chest with a long, content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince for what felt like forever, he finally felt free of the school, having cleared past his oral report so smoothly and having submitted all his other work a few days in advance. Top it off with the fact that his mom and dad were out of town, negating any reason he had to leave his room, and all he had to be concerned about for the next three days were eating, breathing, and not drowning in the shower. Weekends like that were a rare gem to uncover in college, and he had every intent to cherish every second to tick by before school came back on Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the memory of what happened this morning was totally gone, but Jack was finally making himself keep it from bothering him, his only regret being a few brilliant comebacks he'd since thought up that he could've snapped at Rarity when the two were dueling one another outside. Still, while not daring enough to walk around campus at night, he realized he was in the mood for nachos and pushed himself up, his feet hitting the floor. He wrecked the heels of his shoes even more by stuffing his feet right in, hands open around the knob to twist it open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...when a polite little string of knock struck at the door, stopping him before he could leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hello?\" He called through the door. When nobody answered, he peered through the peephole, only seeing black. Confused, he pushed the handle down and pulled the door open, only to flinch back when he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to crane her neck past her cleavage to see him, and even then his form was obstructed by her belly slightly plugging up his doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was visibly surprised to see Rarity in all her massiveness in front of his dorm. The young-adult Human cringed slightly as her belly flab came very close to touching him, even though she assent even in the doorway, technically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Jack replied curtly. He was expecting the same typical treatment that all ponies gave him. He was expecting that she personally took time out of her busy schedule to ridicule him at an obscure hour. He expected a hard belly bump to the ground and a scowl. He expected her to maybe even stuff him in a burlap sack and take him away somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What Jack did NOT expect, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come inside and talk to you?\" Rarity spoke in a now definite apologetic tone, catching Jack even more off guard then before. \"Please?\" She added sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jack's mind trying to come to grasps with the situation at hand, he made an impromptu decision on its behalf. \"Uhhh.. sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could take back what he said, his world was abruptly filled with show white furred blubber as Rarity squeezed her bulk into his doorway. Jack stepped back a couple feet to get out of the way, and in no time to spare, the doorframe and a large portion of the surrounding wall exploded outwards as soft fat bulldozed through it like a hot knife through butter, offering no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity brushed specks of drywall off of her blazer and shifted awkwardly. It was very clear that she was too big for Jack's living space. Her head bumped the ceiling and her heavy hips brushed along the sides of the adjourning walls. The one semi-spacious room had now become downright cramped, much to Jack's irritation. Her dominating body enveloped Jack in a shroud of darkness as she cast a shadow on to him, blocking out the rooms only source of light from the ceiling lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds of uncomfortable silence passed before it was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, okay!\" Rarity shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze in place as the word 'sorry' came out of Rarity's mouth, his right eye gave an involuntary twitch as he stared up at the behomoth pony. \"...say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!...about...squishing you earlier...\" Rarity replied sadly. \"It wasn't...right.\" With a sigh, Rarity brought a bloated arm to her head and leaned her face into it, clearly exhausted. From what, however, Jack could only guess. Was it the mental training to lower herself to human standards and actuall apologized to one? Or was it...something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Rarity shifted her bulk around Jack's room, making the whole thing shake as the floorboards cried out for sweet mercy, until her posterior was positioned towards his bed. In a fell swoop, the tubby plot came crashing down onto the piece of furniture. The springs tried their best to absorb the pressure of the Goliath pony, but when they failed, the job was passed down to the wooden frame, which had even less victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed frame came crashing to the floor in less then a second, barley making a crunch sound as it was muffled under several pounds of butt, the expensive piece of furniture quickly becoming wood mulch. Rarity did not seem to feel any remouse for this, most likely because she didn't even realize that she did it. It wouldn't have been the first time she broke something by just sitting on it. Jack however, had a more visible reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, Sonata, Derpy, they're my best friends. We would do anything for each other. We all lost something special to us during the war, which only made our friendships even stronger. So...when they tell me they want to...\" Rarity paused for a moment, \"...want me to partake in a...a...'serving of justice', she continued, finally finding the right words to make 'gang-squash a human' sound ladylike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not in a position to say no to them.\" She fumbled her fingers together, unsure of how to proceed. This was not something she does often. Correction, she has literally never done this. She's wonder up to her mistakes before, always eager to put things behind others and make amends. But that was with ponies. This was with a Human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I don't want to be the Pony streotype that humans have made for us!\" Her voice risen a few notches, not out of anger, but clearly emotion. \"I don't want you to think I'm just a snobby princess who thinks she's better than everyone she meets! I want you to know that I don't...I don't hate humans! I just...I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Rarity could continue...</span></div></div>",

Jack himself couldn't immediately speak after interrupting her; he'd silenced a pony who was actually <i>apologizing</i> to a human, something he'd immediately put at the bottom of his list of all the things he'd be prepared for when he vowed to hunt down the truth on Equestria's history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertain that Rarity was going to listen, he breathed out, eyes closing as he scratched at his brow. \"The point is, you're just apologizing for what happened this morning. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, I suppose...\" Rarity answered uncomfortably, uneased by the situation herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, if that's the case, I forgive you.\" He continued, only a little bit more comfortable with her. \"In fact, I'm sorry, too, for snapping at you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, too, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all said and done, the two just sat across from one another the room, the only sound being the footsteps or laughter from students wasting time in their own rooms. Jack only stood straight and still, while Rarity eventually looked to the ceiling, patting her hands along her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll see myself out.\" Rarity announced, the fragments of Jack's bed peeling off and falling from her behind as she pushed herself back up, face furrowed up from the stress as she slowly came straight up before letting out a held breath, cheeks puffing out. Only then did she seem to realize the property damage she'd committed and glanced behind her in panic, only able to see a tiny fragment of the bed frame over her burgeoning tush. \"Oh, no! I'm so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine, alright?\" Jack answered curtly, but not out of anger. Just desperation to be alone again. \"I'll sleep on the futon tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked just as eager to leave and hurried out, the floorboards screeching even louder as she scurried through the room  faster than when she'd entered. She only hesitated before stepping through the gaping hole hollowed out of where the doorframe once stood, sparing one last panicked look at everything she'd destroyed and sidestepped through, her pronounced gut wedging her in the gap before she clenched her face and gave one more mighty push, popping loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after Rarity'd disappeared from the hole, Jack ran over and leaned over the torn edge, watching as Rarity hurried down to her own room, desperate not to be seen. After Rarity was gone for good, he pulled himself back in and leaned against the wall, rubbing his eyes with the base of his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I knew I should've studied in Griffonstone.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day on the campus. A bright, cold day in April. The butterflies fluttering, the grass being mowed, and Jack Boss, with his chin nuzzled into his rest in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of the Campus Library, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance hallway smelt of dust and old paper, like any proper repository of books should. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted a red cross, St. Patrick\u2019s Saltire, over a half green half blue background with a golden wreath emblazoned as it\u2019s crest. It was the flag of the United Republic of Ireland, which came into existence shortly after the war with Equestria had ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. t was part of the economy drive in preparation for the new renovated dormitories that now fit Humans and Ponies alike. The Campus Library was seven flights up, and it just so happened Jack was looking for was on that flight, and he went slowly up the stairs, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the flag of Jack\u2019s country was adjourned. \u2018Saol T\u00e1 Iarracht\u2019, the caption beneath it ran, which translated into english reads \u2018Life Is Effort\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese posters were set up all over the city as of late, in an effort by the government, as well as Princess Twilight Sparkle, to help ponies adapt to their adopted home. Twilight actually requested all of the countries in the U.N to take this stance, but as far as Jack knew, his country was the only one to do so for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the Library on the seventh flight, a fruity voice could be heard. A sweet, pleasant to hear feminine voice, reading out a list of figures, which from Jack could tell had something to do with the production Zap Apples. Jack turned a corner, and found that the voice came from a somewhat familiar Miss Cheerilee, his Professor of Equestrian History. Like all ponies, she was nine feet tall and grazed the ceiling with her ears, had filled up practically the entire room with her enormity alone. The Campus Library had not yet been renovated for her size, but that did not seem to faze her. Her moderately purple colored fur coat bounced happily on her fat frame, as each roll of lard and blubber jiggled from the slightest provocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Professor Cherilee.\u201d Jack said quietly, yet politely as he noticed her presence. Out of all the Ponies on campus, Miss Cheerilee was the one of the only (or quite possibly the only) that did not seem to have a problem with humans at all. She treats everyone in her class equally, which makes Jack\u2019s life easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cheerilee looked up from her book and turned around to face her speaker, causing her whole body, including her face, to wobble along with the action. \u201cOh, Jack\u201d she began in a kind, patient sort of voice, \u201cI thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at the bottom shelf for me? I would do it myself, but--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to her stomach for emphasis, which was preventing her from bending down to. Her fat gut giggled and shook with the simplest movements such as breathing, her chest and stomach rising high and low with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...sure, why not?\u201d Jack answers sincerely. His book can wait for a little bit, and he liked Ms. Cheerilee, even if she was a bit strict and disciplinary. Besides, reaching down to grab a book was hardly a strenuous task. Miss Cheerilee backed up a tad, allowing for Jack to have enough space to have access to the lowest shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings you to the Library, dear?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a book.\u201d Jack responded. He thought that the belly flab would touch him at one point, it was so close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d said Miss Cherilee, in a somewhat less fruity voice than before, a layer of sternness creeping up into it. \u201cWhat kind of book?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA history book.\u201d Jack answered. He bent down to the ground and inspected the low shelf. Even though he was small compared to a Pony, he was still tall enough for his legs to hurt when he crouches. \u201cWhich book were you looking for by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Jack.\u201d His professor sighed. \u201cAre you trying to find a book on Equestrian History?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze up. His heart stopped for a moment before pumping again as he registered the comment. In vain, he tried to ignore the question. \u201cW-was it \u2018The theory and practise of Virology\u2019 you were looking for?\u201d He said as he read from the first book he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack.\u201d Miss Cheerilee said in a more patient tone. \u201cI told you not to follow this path, remember? The textbooks I gave to you all has all the answers you need. I honestly don\u2019t--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell how much of it is lies!?\u201d Jack said through gritted teeth as he clenched his fists together. He did not want to show anger towards his favorite teacher, but he also didn't want to hear another speech on how the textbook she gave him, \u2018The Complete History of Equestria\u2019, was anything but not complete. \u201cIt\u2019s full of...of filler! Like a bad television episode it milks the content for all it\u2019s worth when it wasn't even that much of value in the first place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I beg your pardon?\u201d Cherille was taken slightly aback. \u201cIf you think you have such a basis for Equestrian History young man, why not tell me instead of shouting at me in a Library.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. His voice had raised as a little bit of anger did in fact surface. Internally, Jack apologized, took a couple deep, exhaling breaths, and asked his Professor a question that he could not find in the class textbook. It was a question he had been asking for a long time, and so far he had not gotten results other than vague defences and/or a variant of \u2018White Man\u2019s Burden\u2019, but with ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did Equestria go to war with Humanity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Miss Cherilee remained silent. Her face was full of dread and apprehension. It was not a question she was prepared to answer. Not a question she thought she would have to answer. Finally, after a great interval of time, she responded with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He screamed against the floor, but quickly realized there wasn't any air left to suck in. The blackness surrounding him seemed to get a little bit darker, if possible, as Jack felt his starving blood vessels go numb, the pain crushing upon on his chest ebbing into nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...up until whatever it was lifted itself away, letting Jack refill his lungs with air, but he couldn't say anything aside from a pained coughing fit, his limbs still adhered to the floor like a recently squashed bug's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh dear...how do I do this, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jack could recognize the voice as a panicked Cheerilee's, but he could only peel his arm from the floor before she squashed him down under her belly once again, this time making sure to rub it around against the floor, smearing Jack around, but still failing to totally knock him out before she pulled her gut up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you waiting for?\" Came a younger voice, one Jack didn't recognize. \"Just put him out, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying! I'm just scared I'll hurt him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled onto his back, but let out a squeak upon looking straight above, frozen in fear beneath a sky composed of a parachute-sized pair of khaki shorts pulled along a behind way too big not to be a pony's, so wide that they enveloped his entire head and chest when their owner let its fall, even covering his arms when they were laid stretched along the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only pleasure as he <i>really</i> started to lose consciousness was that the smell wasn't too bad, the strength to flail his legs dying out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, moments after waking up, Jack felt his restraints when he tried to groan in pain, only to be muffled by a strip of duct tape wrapped several timed around his head. Once again, all was dark, but not from some great weight sitting upon this time around. He could still move, albeit at the mercy of length of rope that kept his arms and legs tied tightly together as he squirmed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrr...mmr-hmm!\" He whimpered, stretching his legs out, only for his head and feet to hit the walls at either end of the confined space, something he deduced as a closet, as far as his aching and panicked brain could deduce. He rolled over onto his butt and scooted back against the wall, wrestling with the bindings on his wrists, but found that his hands were also coated in duck tape mitts that kept his fingers fused together, making it impossible to find any knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, Jack, just keep it cool...</i> He told himself, scrounging his mind for what little instructions he'd ever come across for getting kidnapped. <i>Keep calm, don't anger them, but don't make yourself an easy target, either. Just...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jack's train of thought was thrown off course by a few voices murmuring to themselves, his mind too jumbled to understand what they were saying, followed by footsteps that particularly shook the ground more than any other pony's would, as if he had to guess which species was holding him captive. The doorknob clicked, the door swinging open, but his captor barely let any light pour into the closet as they stepped up and effectively plugged the door with their stomach, their head blotting out the glow of a ceiling light hanging in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't let out a peep, looking up and down at the massive figure that was vaguely identifiable outside of the light. Even compared to a pony off the streets, even <i>Derpy,</i> whoever it was was an absolute behemoth in size, their shoulders several times as wide as the door, let alone everything from the chest down. Their stomach actually managed to fully sag over their waistband to the point where it formidable stood on the ground in front of them, bulging so far from its host that they were forced too much more than a pony's arm length to touch the wall outside, like some sort of furry wrecking ball bulged out in front of them that could've easily obliterated his holding cell if they gave charge or just spun around hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swallowed a pool of saliva building up in his mouth, losing any will and purpose to seem remotely formidable against his opponent...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello, little human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack craned his head up to attempt to make eye contact with the behemoth pony looming over him. However, he simply could not see anything. The room was too dark and no light could be shined through into it, thanks to the ponies impressive girth. Thankfully, the figure took a step back, making the floor beneath it creak and groan. Light poured through. And out of all the ponies on the surface of the planet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Of course, it was Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Jack noticed was just how absolutely FAT she was, even by average Pony standards. A massive, sagging, plush, roll covered belly, wobbling like a vat of jelly at the slightest movement, pooling like partially melted ice cream. Jutting out behind her, her titanic, juicy, cellulite dimpled rump grazed the ground, plush as a bag of fluffy marshmallows, with matching bubbly thighs, threatens to swallow up her puny swollen feet. Her back would become so laden with blubber, her wings being sunk into the his supple, squishy flesh, expansive folds drowning the appendages in so much blubber so Finally, her face curvy and plump as blubber collecting there had swollen her cheeks into sagging rugby ball sized blobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat there in shock. His eyes flicked backwards and forwards, as if not believing his own two eyes. Luna, Princess Luna, the mare who declared war on the entirety of the human race with her sister and set several cities ablaze, was here? At his college? And on top of that, with him being literally two feet away from her?  In all his years, Jack was genuinely flabbergasted at such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, nothing could prepare you for what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you all so nervous about?\u201d asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack realized that he was cowering on the opposite side of the small room, with his back up against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don't worry! I'm not going to bite!\u201d The Moon Princess bent down, letting her belly rest on the floor, and lifted her hand, gently stroking under Jack's chin, as if he were a pet. Hesitantly, he relaxed a slight bit at her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, girls,\u201d she said to the unknown other ponies behind her, wriggling her toes as she started to unwrap the rope binding him. \"I can't thank you enough for bringing me along here to this delightful little Island. I feel so embarrassed about trying to stay home back at Canterlot\u2026 I've gotten to meet so many amazing new Humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cocked his head involuntarily out of confusion. To the best of his knowledge about the War, Luna was supposed to HATE humans with a zealous passion, not fawn over them. She never spoke on her opinion of humans in any recorded documents, but it was clear that she lead many attacks on major population centers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain coursed through Jack's body as the duct tape that was covering his mouth was ripped off quickly, leaving your lips being able to move again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls told me that you were investigating the silly old war from a decade ago. You know that is not your place to ask questions. Were going to have to correct that. But in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? Any message? Any question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought. There did not seem to be any question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with Luna or the other ponies possibly holding him hostage, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room in the dormitory, and the bed that Rarity had accidentally broken, and the sobbing and guilt she expressed for squishing him yesterday. Almost at random he said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have said something comprehensible, but instead he coughed up blood and some yellowish, thick substance that pooled at his knees. It was at this time that he realized how heavy he chest felt. It was full of liquid. His lungs had collapsed when he was squashed into unconsciousness earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Princess Luna. She looked down at him with a face that screamed pity. If Jack could see better, he would have seen water glossing over eyes. \"...Rainbow...\" She said in an icy tone that shivers down Jacks back. \"...did you forget to cast a healing spell on our little guest?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack heard another pony talk, presumably Rainbow's, but he couldn't hear the voice audible enough to make out the words. He was too preoccupied with the slow return of the pain that he experienced when he was squished by Cherilee. His bones were broken, A lot of them were. He looked down at his chest and saw a bump jut out from his rib cage. He pressed down on it, and too his horror he didn't feel any pain.That must have been the wound that punctured his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up to see that Luna had stepped away from the door, still viable, but now the other ponies behind her were as well. Her voice was fading in and out. She was pointing at jack angrily and shouting at someone. \"Bllaaugh!\" You vomited up more bodily fluid, this time more violently. It splatted onto his clothes, staining them beyond repair with crimson red and dark yellow. He looked up again, this time focusing on the ponies beside Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow, Sonata, Derpy, Rarity and Cherilee were there, looking at Jack directly. Most of them were trying to avoid making direct eye contact with him, turning their heads to the side a little bit. Cherilee was on the verge of tears, however, and Rarity...looked mortified. She was looking at him as if he was a stranger that was in her home. Jack wondered what he looked like to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Jack could register in his mind before he blacked out again was how the blood and the thick fluid would not mix together, like oil and water. And then, there was darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Specifically, blankets that were tightened around his body.  Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. Princess Luna was standing at his side, looking down at him intently, and yet sympathetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when Miss Cherilee and some other pony squashed him at the library, he had not seen darkness or daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not know where he was. Presumably he was still on the college campus, but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench wide enough to support the average pony to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull aching in his belly. He was hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, probably never would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are afraid \"said Luna, watching his face, 'that in another moment something is going to break. I told you, I'm not going to bite, remember?\" </span></div></div>",

He breathed in, and out, in, and out, utterly relieved that it was just air coming out of his lungs, and not the bloody pulp from before. Luna watched patiently as he undid his shirt to examine his chest as well, assuring himself that all his ribs were snapped back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'M hungry.\" He slurred, briefly having to relearn how to talk. \"Food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna turned her gaze to the door and nodded to a royal guardpony leaning in on the conversation, who nodded back and ducked out of view. \"I take it that some answers are next on your list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll have those while I wait.\" He panted, the small sentence enough of a workout that his chest started aching again. Luna noticed him wince and gently cradled his neck and chest, lowering him back against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, now, just because your healed doesn't mean you're ready for any major shock to your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you just get on with it, already?!\" Jack snapped at her. \"I'm not waiting until I'm all healed up for you to tell me everything, Princess! I don't care about whatever bullshit you're all going to throw at me because you think I'm 'not ready,' or too stupid to understand what's going on. I didn't just puke up blood just so  I could watch you guys keep dancing around and spoon feed me more crap. Tell. Me. NOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was a mixture of blood and spinal flui-\"  Luna was cut off by Jack shooting up from the bed, piercing her a glare that she returned with a sheepish grin. \"Just joking! That was a joke, I apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> in the mood for jokes right now, <i>your majesty.</i>\" He growled, lowering back against the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you aren't. I'm sorry.\" She sighed, her smile loosening out. \"Where would you like me to begin, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginning sounds like a nice place to start off.\" He said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna raised a brow. \"The beginning? Such as the very, <i>very </i>beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever gets the damn story going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me and Celestia's birthdays, then? From ten billion years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten billion...\" Jack repeated. \"Aren't you guys supposed to be, like, six zeroes younger than that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the truest thing our history books had ever taught is that my sister and I are immortal, Jack,\" Luna explained. \"Sometimes I wonder if Celestia and I even <i>are</i> sisters, or that we both just happen to be the last or first of some rare, rare breed in the universe, lost in their search for purpose. With only one another there to understand one another, not an eon has passed where we were apart, venturing the universe together.\" She reached down and grabbed hold of her belly, hoisting it up a foot or so from the floor. \"I was but a hundredth of an atom's width when I realized I was alive and able to think. There may be animals on this planet, still, that are far larger than I am at this moment, but a thousand more of your kind's years from now, I may be larger than a skyscraper, or big enough to be my own planet, or even be a million times heavier than the nearest superstar, and me and Celestia may still be lurking on another planet as we are now, going through the same cycle we'd been venturing since our births.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack uncomfortably sank into the mattress. \"So...what, are the two of you gods, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To many that have come before, we may have seemed. As we'd grown, as did our power, and it was when we were both a nanometer or so when we decided we were powerful enough to try our hand at creating life.\" Luna tilted her head back, smiling fondly. \"Ponykind was among one of our favorite species that we'd ever dreamed up, a familiar face large enough to talk with in person, but small enough to watch from above as they lived their own lives, free and happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Jack nervously began. \"Does that mean you guys...I mean, is...<i>humanity</i> one of your guys'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna giggled. \"No, somebody came up with your kind first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what does any of this have to do with your guys' beef with humanity, or whatever?\" Jack snapped, anger rising again. \"You're not stalling again, are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Luna retorted, blowing off a little steam of her own, then sank back into place, trying to calm herself. \"I've mentioned before that my sister and I are immortal, Jack, but we're not invincible. A thousand years may seem like a great sweep in your kind's history, maybe <i>two</i> thousand, but for us two, it's but a single step in a perpetual loop we'd been forced to trek along to stay alive, passing through the births, lives, and deaths of countless galaxies for sustenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...from what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gazed up at the ceiling, eyes focusing on a random spot as though she could see something outside of the room's walls. \"The sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the sun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could see that shimmer return Luna's eyes, with sorrow flowing down her face. \"<i>Any</i> star, specifically whatever one had the age and size to give us both the power to stay alive. Through the deaths of the stars we'd leeched off came the deaths of so many civilizations we'd birthed that couldn't survive the leap whenever Celestia and I had to find a new host. Earth was one of those rare perfect spots, close enough to the sun that we could reap the sun's energy without scorching under its heat, and with plenty of fertile herbs and land for us to cultivate, marking the tenth stop within a generation of Equestrias that were thankfully able to survive those leaps...but not the longest-lived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A land dispute, then. That's what the Equestrian war was.\"Jack noted, almost emotionless. There it was. Something <i>light years</i> taller than whatever answer he might have guessed or estimated before this day, but it was there, a truth he'd spent a life he'd never truly realized was so <i>short</i> searching for. \"...and you supported her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Luna countered, if a little defensively, but softened up when she saw Jack flinch back. She took an extra breath, calming herself, then came closer and towered over him with what was more of a compassionate smile. \"As brief as it can sometimes seem, I find all life to be truly beautiful, and equally deserving to flourish and prosper to its own merits as I am right now, to think that something so rare and unlikely can exist even beyond our control,\" but then her expression darkened. \"Celestia, on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...unpredictable, is what could only describe her. Many generations, I'd seen her be more kind and gentle to an alien species than any of them would be to their own, other times, she's the warmongering dictator you and your kind know her the best as. I'd seen her command attacks on so-called 'enemies' but moments after drinking tea or chatting happily with her students, even going so far as to banish any of our creations who dared question her with 'their' morals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and humanity's one of those little episodes, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Luna nodded. \"The fact that there is such rampant hatred for humanity amongst ponykind is enough to quell her attitude for so long, hence why I may come off as more...well, <i>outspoken</i> in my speeches. I may be powerful, but Celestial is twice so, if not more, and I fear I could not control her if she had reason to suspect me of any treason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared ahead, taking in each word only a few seconds at a time. It was all so much, <i>too</i> much for his feeble mortal brain to take in one day, something Luna could easily notice. She turned to her side, the closest she could get to his bed with her mammoth belly sitting in front of her, but still stretched to reach past her hip and gently taking his hand, looking down on him with all the warmth a goddess could share for her underling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you have to understand all that's at stake if a word of this truth escapes. Despite what it may seem like, what you live in today may be the most peaceful point in which human and pony may exist, and for Celestia to sense any disturbance to that balance may come <i>another</i> war, one even worse than the one before...and that's wishing for the <i>best.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what now?\" Jack asked, disturbed by the thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not a word about any of this can leak out to anyone's ears. I need to know if i can trust you with this knowledge before i can let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\" Jack said, frustration on the tip of his voice. \"You mean...you're not letting me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You should be thankful. The alternative was to keep you here forever. And as fun as that sounds, I don't want to have to go through the trouble of risking people noticing your absence. You need to prove yourself to me that you can keep your moth shut about all this before i even think about letting you leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was the royal guard pony from before came back in carrying his food. A metal bowl of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milk less Coffee, water served in a handless china mug, and one sugar tablet. The guard set the tray of food down on a nearby metal top table. Jack recoiled at the sight of the so called dish. The stew was a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jack said as he collected his nerve. \"I guess i should be thankful I won't stay here forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took up his mug of coffee, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how exactly are you going to know that I won't tell anyone about this?\" Jack asked Luna through the spoonfuls. He personally did not intend to tell anyone about the circumstances of the war, but he figured through his college educated mind that telling her that won't improve his chances of persuading her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes bugged out for a bit as he chocked down more of the vile coffee. There was a sly manner to which that last word was broadcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, tonight you will begin what will be a week long testing and education period. Also, please do not feel scared of me, I have no intention of hurting anyone, especial you. You may speak freely, or ask any question you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, Jack began to work up the nerve to finally ask something. \"What kind of test is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna half chuckled. \"This is a personality test of sorts. We want to make sure you are the kind of person who can keep a secret, especially a very important one. he test will hardly be physical in nature, though it will take its toll on your body.\" Luna had floated off at some point in their conversation, but Jack was hardly in a position to notice such small details as a being roughly the size of a car disappearing from his vision. Luna stopped at the foot of the bed, her belly accidentally smooshing his feet and raised up her hand a bit. \"I will be psychically testing your mind. The exact nature of the process cannot be revealed to you until after the test is finished. Most humans will feel exhausted afterword. Most get cold sweats and begin to tremble, some even develop fevers.&gt; Jack's heart rate spiked at that description. \"Though you will be well taken care of. You will be taken to your quarters after the test, or during if it is too much of a toll on you, and we will provide all of your food and drink for your stay. And don't worry, no harm will come to you. I'm very careful about your kind. Do you have more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finally closed his mouth, and took a deep breath. The aching feeling in his stomach had faded away. \"No more questions. I want to take the test.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You will lose consciousness during the test, but I assure you, Jack, you will be fine.\"  Luna's came to a rest over over the center of his face. He felt a tingling in the back of his brain, then a warmth over his head, and then darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane came to on what he could tell was a bed, and with a Pony hovering above him. It was not Luna, but it was still a pony. The Princess's warning that he would feel terrible did come to pass. His head pounded with the force of a migraine he had never before experienced, both his hands were trembling, and his clothes were all soaked with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, our princess teleported you down here after your test. I have been instructed to tell you that we will be giving you the rest of the course, and tomorrow you will be meeting more of our fold.\" The Pony waddled away, and he fell to sleep almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the morning, Luna introduced him to all of the other ponies in her little band of rebels, or whatever it was. They were all a little scared of him, as most of them hadn't been introduced to a human before. \"Most ponies have never ventured outside of Equestria.\" Luna explained to him. They were standing in one of the larger underground rooms that was lit by some sort of ball of energy at the top of the room, almost like an immaterial light bulb. Vegetation was growing everywhere, to make the interior space almost look like it was outside, save for the lack of a sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies themselves were quite the sight. Including Rainbow, Sonata, Derpy, Rarity, and Miss Cherilee, they were at least seven more ponies that he had yet to see on campus that were in the room. Several of them backed away from Shane, sharp contrasts to the titanically powerful beings he had met up to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any rate, during your stay here, I have arranged for...'supervisor', if you will, to look after you. I know that you might think that your a grown man and shouldn't have his hand held, do remember that you broke your lungs by getting sat on.\" That last note was spoken with great authority at Rainbow, a tip, or a warning from a motherly figure that could split her in half with a sideways glance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna motioned for one of the ponies to come up to her side, the one that would be his so called 'supervisor'. It was one of the ponies that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"...eerilee, listen, you're not exactly in the best state of mind right now!\"</i> Came a voice from outside, Luna gazing back at the source in discontent. Jack, however, shot up in bed. He couldn't recognize the voice, not yet, he could tell, but some itch at the stem of his brain told him to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please, it <b>has</b> to be me!\" </i>Wailed Cheerilee's voice, prompting Jack to scramble backwards into the corner. <i>\"<b>I'm </b>the reason he's like this! I...I...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, please, you have nothing to worry about! As far as...\" Luna tried to reason with him, but topped talking when a certain grey-hued blob wedged itself halfway through the wide doorway, the owner nonetheless having to paddle her legs to wriggle her copious behind free of the 'narrow' entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pressed his back harder against the wall, shoulder blades aching as he tried to compact himself into the small space. Seeing Derpy stand next to Luna was a sight that startled, scared, and confused him all at the same time; the supposedly moronic pegasus stood just a few inches below the near eleven-foot princess, but her stomach practically exploded out off her torso and poured onto the floor in a large, spheric mass with a large crease drooping around the naval, surpassing Luna's belly by a few extra feet in width and size whilst awkwardly skewing her doughy arms upwards against the added width along her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Supposedly' being the key word, of course, by the way Derpy looked at him. It didn't look like the usual dimwitted guffaw she carried about whenever she was tripping over things or rolling over people by accident, but rather that she was staring right at him despite having one eye pointed at the ceiling and one at the ground, her thoroughly rounded face locked in a gaze of sympathy no different from Rarity's when she was visiting the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" She spoke firmly, but Jack's sweat soaked into the blanket, having recognized her voice; it was the second pony's, the one next to Cheerilee during her attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hi?\" Jack squeaked, scared to act against her in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because of certain...well, careless errors <b><i>I'd</i></b> made on my part when incapacitating you at the library, leading to a majority of the injuries you'd sustained afterwards.\" She explained, holding her hands behind her back, but Jack barely paid any attention to what she was describing. All that was on his mind was that Derpy was <i>speaking, </i>and not like some dopey comic relief; she enunciated every syllable in with total eloquence and clarity, and in a voice fit to command authority while also possessing an incredibly soothing and graceful quality, but only enough to relax Jack so he merely felt lost and confused, rather than taken hostage. \"As such, I'm hereby appointed under Luna's command to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in!\" Commanded Cheerilee, Luna and Jack having been to distracted to realize she was forcing her way in. Derpy opened her mouth to interject, but was pushed aside as Cheerilee came loose with an audible pop, with Derpy's mass getting the better of her and knocking her down, a resounding boom rattling the walls that made all the pony's builds slosh about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Cheerilee didn't look away from Jack, hands cupped over her mouth as she observed the terrified human with teary eyes. \"Jack...I...I'm <i>so sorry!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get away from me!\" Jack squirmed against the walls, vainly trying to distance himself from her again, but Cheerilee wilted back with a hurt expression. \"<i>Get back!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, please!\" She begged, the tears budding enough to roll down her cheeks. \"I-I promise, I <i>never</i> meant to hurt you! I only...just...I'm so, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheerilee, <i>please!</i>\" Derpy pleaded from the floor, busy rocking around to right herself up. \"Let me handle this! It's only best if Jack doesn't see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>I need to do this!</i></b>\" Cheerilee yelled back, tears flinging off of her face. Even Luna herself was startled by the outburst, but Cheerilee only followed by a weak sniffle, then fell to her knees, openly sobbing. \"D-Derpy did everything right! It was <i>me</i> that did all that, the broken bones, the blood, the...the...oh, I'm <i><b>so sorry!</b></i>\"</span></div></div>",

It was more then just feeling bad for hurting someone, it was like she hurt a family member or loved one. Before all of this, Jack thought that his and Cheerilee's relationship was strictly...professional. Teacher and student, nothing more. Sure, she was his favorite teacher, and he was the best in the class, but looking back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always seem to brighten up when he asked for after school help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she would get royally pissed if someone had even cast a displeasing glance at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm such an idiot' Jack mentally groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cheerilee did not respond to Jack's question. At least, verbally. She merely nodded her head in affirmation, a few more droplets of water flying off her face. There was a steady stream of water tricking down her heavy cheeks, dripping down onto the floor forming a puddle. \"...I'm so sorry...\" She peeped a little above a whisper, just loud enough for Jack to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, it alright, see?\" Jack lifted up his shirt to reveal his torso. \"Everything is okay now. I'm fine. You're gonna be fine.\" True, there was not a scratch anywhere on his body to be seen. What Jack knew though was that the pain he felt was more then skin deep. The magic that Luna casted on him was taking a slow time to heal him, and although it did not hurt as much as before, it still did. A lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing without a shadow of doubt that he had her attention, back breathed out and put a hand on Ms. Cherilee's shoulder, catching her by surprise a bit. \"Look, whatever happened at the Library, whatever you or Derpy did, I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what?\" Cheerilee asked, wiping a few tears from her face. \"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything that you did\" Jack continued. \"Everything that you have done...I forgive you. It doesn't help to stay mad at people forever, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, there was silence. Then, a slight smile started to creep up on Cheerilee's face. \"...Thank you, Jack.\" But before Jack could respond, she got up to her feet and bolted out of the room as fast as she came in, stifling another sob along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! No, Ms. Cheerilee, I-...Dammit!\" Jack swore at himself. \"I didn't mean...to drive her away...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack\" Princess Luna injected after being so silent for so long Jack almost forgot she was even in the room. \"You have NO idea how much you just helped her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jack said, slowly getting up back on his feet. His back ached as he used the wall to support himself up. \"I said i forgave her and she ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* During the War...\" Derpy said, still struggling to roll back off of the floor. her belly was proving to be a formidable adversary, as the grey mass of fur and fat was obstructing her from getting up. \"...Cheerilee was one of the 'effective' soldiers in the Royal Equestrian Army. She went on Scorched Earth missions in South America. She was in charge of 'removing' the Favelas from Rio De Janerio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh my god. That was her?\" Jack gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy, after a few more failed attempts, finally rolled over with a grunt, her massive, billowing gut sloshing with enough forward momentum. She took a deep breath to compose herself, and continued. \"She never forgave herself for what she did all those years ago. She says that she still has nightmares from that...regrettable night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she be alright?\" Jack asked, concerned for his history teacher. \"I mean...right now, at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she'll be fine. She just needs some time to herself. Now, if there will not be any more interruptions, i shall leave the two of you alone to better acquaint yourselves.\" Luna piped in, shuffling away to the exit. \"...I'll check in on Cheerilee, don't worry about her. We will arrange for you to start taking the test in a few hours.\" And with that, she was gone, closing the door behind her shut, leaving Jack alone with Derpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Soooo.\" Derpy awkwardly said after a prolonged silence. The both of them were unsure of what to do. They didn't really know each other very well, and what few interaction they had was...rather physical. Thinking through her list of Ice breakers, Derpy chose a simple and safe question ask jack. \"Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came from a small farming town called Warning. I lived with my mom and dad on small dairy ranch. I guess if you wanted a reference, it loos a lot like Ponyville, if Ponyville was cold, rainy, and less colorful.\" Jack answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I can't imagine Ponyville anything then colorful and bouncy.\" Derpy offered. \"I've always been fascinated by Human Civilization, ever since we discovered your world. Everything is so different then what i'm used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's kinda like with me too.\" Jack leaned back on his bed, feeling slightly more comfortable with Derpy being in the room with him. \"Ever since i was a little kid i wanted to see what a pony looks like. Although none of the stories could have prepared me for my first encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the first three words that came into your head was 'Pastel Colored Blob'?\" Derpy asked with an almost sly tone. Jack looked up and saw that she was indeed smirking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah...\" Jack relented. \"My parents always said that you would look more...not intimidating but, scary looking. Instead i got ponies who use their fat as lethal weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't use our fat as weapons Jack.\" Derpy crossed her arms over he saggy breasts. \"Their a natural protective shielding for us against weapons such as swords and spheres.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not bullets?\" Jack lied back on the bed, looking up at the roof of the room aimlessly. He closed his eyes and tried to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy grimaced as the word 'bullet' exited Jack's mouth. \"No...human firearms were a new one for us. Most of them have no affect, but...that reminds me, I still have a hard time how you all got the essence of the sun without magic and put it into a bomb. I mean, seriously, Celestia couldn't even do that, ans she is the princess of the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'is'\" Jack opened one eye. \"You mean 'was', right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in a way, she still is alive, and she has rather large number of ponies following her, so yes, she technically is still the princess...just not ours.\" Derpy uncrossed her arms and walked over to Jack's bed, the whole room shaking as she did so. You still did not answer my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the question confused the human, why would he know how to build a nuke? \"I can't actually. Most humans can't. You have to go to school for years to be able to build a bomb like that, and really, most computers are built by teams of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Derpy asked in a shocked voice. \"...what about cars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. Most cars are built by machines. Why is it you think I can make cars. I'm not an engineer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I thought all humans built stuff!\" the grey pony said in a confused voice. \"We kept seeing pictures of human cities and all the machines you use. I though that humans made their own machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, only certain humans build machines. Some people design them. Most people aren't involved in manufacturing at all. My whole country's economy is still based around agriculture\" It was odd, being typecast as a computer engineer by a pony. He didn't know what he was expecting to find at the secret underground bunker of Princess Luna's...whatever it was, but he knew it wasn't this. He was expecting contempt and suspicion, not fascination and an assumption that he built machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually studying at the University on how to make a computer. I've been enamored with them since we got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jack asked. He could not picture Derpy g anything but...Derpy. A computer engineer was well suited for a serious, focused individual who could see straight. Of course, he just found out that Derpy can form syllables with no trouble at all, so maybe he was wrong.</span></div></div>",
