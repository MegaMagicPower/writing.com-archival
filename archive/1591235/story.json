            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long day of work, John kicked off his shoes as soon as he got into home. Exhausted, he dragged his tired body couch and flopped himself onto it. He used the remote to turn on the T.V. and started to flip through the channels. Flipping past countless sitcoms, reality shows, and commercials until one caught his interest. Shining from the T.V. screen in a bright, white light, a humongous man, who was bursting at the seams in his black suit, begun to speak to those viewers that were watching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you tired of paying too much money for small portions? Disgusted with the amount of skinny waiters who cast judging looks when you ask for larger portions of food? Worried if restaurant chairs will be able to fit and hold your wide bottom? Annoyed with the looks that patrons of the same establishment that you\u2019re attending throw your way? At Belly Busters, that\u2019s NOT a problem! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt this establishment, when we say all that you can eat, said the host in the commercial as he raised his meaty hand, \u201cWe mean ALL (SMACK!)-YOU (SMACK)-CAN (SMACK)-EAT (SMACK).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn in by the size and authority of the man, John sat in anticipation as he listened to every word of this giant of a man. He nodded his head at every sentence, and whispered yeah in a low voice. He flinched every time the man\u2019s right hand came into contact with his hefty gut. Entranced by the wobbling of the jiggling rolls, he missed the address of this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought back to his senses when an assortment of food came onto the screen. An abundance of food, which would be able to feed an army, attacked the television.  A new one appeared each time John\u2019s eyes blinked. This continued until a series of words emerged. John\u2019s eyes grew as big as dinner plates as he watched the address of the restaurant materialized. He slowly raised the T.V. remote until he was parallel from the ground with it. Pausing the commercial, he stared at it in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself any more, he jumped from his seat and grabbed his keys, coat, and shoes as he ran to the door. It slowly opened as he ran towards it. Behind it was John\u2019s roommate, Mark, but that didn\u2019t register in John\u2019s mind as he pushed Mark out of the way.<br>\r\nUpset by the sudden action of his usually quiet friend, Mark shouted astonished, \u201cWhat the hell, man? Where the hell are you going in a rush?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn\u2019t answer Mark because his mind was so focused on getting to Belly Busters that the words hadn\u2019t even entered his mind. Once the key was in the ignition, John drove like a mad man until he reached his destination. He stepped out of his car and walked into the place that he broke many driving laws for. Greeted by a portly host in the usual waiter attire, he was asked by the man, \u201cWelcome to Belly Busters! My name is Hank. How many people will be in your party today, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUh- it\u2019s just me today,\u201d responded John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.K. Follow me then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank rose from his seat and began to tower over the shorter John. Surprised by the man\u2019s girth, especially since it seemed like he was taller than him at first, John walked behind Hank. In the dark setting that he was in, it was hard for John to follow the host in the darkly lit place. He was about to ask Hank why the place was so poorly lighted until he bumped himself into something hard. As he fell to the ground, darkness filled his eyes and head. When he woke up he was welcomed by <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked around at his surrounding, but something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! This isn\u2019t Belly Busters,\u201d stated John to no one in particular. \u201cWhere the heck am I? What the \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of canned foods fell to the ground as a big body collided into shelf full of them.  Whipping his head frantically in the direction of the noise, John was surprised to see a familiar face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be at home? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, low chuckle escaped from his roommate. \u201cMan, you must have hit your head harder than they said. Heh, heh! You really don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Mark? I think that I would be able to remember who my roommate is. We have been living together for the past three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh! Man, I thought you would have been able to know who I am from my voice, but I guess I\u2019m going to jog your memory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy steps from the mysterious man created a loud thud, which filled John with feelings of anxiety and curiosity. He felt as his heart was going to burst out of his chest as he waited for the man to reveal his true identity. Trying to calm himself down, John tried to take in a deep breath. He held it in as the footsteps came into the light that was in front of him. His eyes grew as large as dinner plates as the other man in the room exposed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANTHONY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was shocked to see Mark\u2019s younger brother standing in front of him. Rubbing his right hand against his temple as he tried to compose himself, he said, \u201cI thought that you left to Japan a couple of months ago. What are you doing in a place like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings didn\u2019t go too well with the relatives. Umm.. You see- Wait, a minute! Let\u2019s not focus on myself for a minute. How about we do something about getting you home first? I bet my brother\u2019s all worried about you, especially since you never leave the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I am a grown ass man! I can do whatever I feel like, and I feel like getting me something to eat! Now, how do I get out of this basement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe closed about an hour ago, but I think that our chef can whip you something to eat. I don\u2019t think that the owner would mind, especially since a customer of his got injured in his restaurant.  Just follow me, and we will get some food in that belly of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rose from the counter that he was lying on. He followed the sound of Anthony\u2019s footsteps out of the dark storage area. Concerned with getting some food in his growling belly, he disregarded the questions about his roommate\u2019s appearance in this food joint. He told himself that asking Anthony why and how did he ended working at this place instead of pursuing his dream in Japan was not as important as eating that delicious food that he saw on the T.V. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had reached the top of the stairs, Anthony directed John to a booth to sit at. John was about say something to him when Anthony begun to walk away from.  Stunned by this sudden action, John was unsure what to do. He thought that he was finally going to taste the food that Belly Busters had to offer. Depressed and disappointed, John slipped into a slump as he dropped himself into a seat. He was relieved when Anthony came back with a pitcher of beer and a bowl of hot wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, man. I got you some leftovers from today, but there hasn\u2019t been that much food lately. I asked the chef, Big Billy, to whip something up, and he said that he bring it over in a couple of minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalivating, John grabbed the chicken wings and started to eat possibly the biggest chicken wings he has ever eaten. John was so focused on devouring what might have been the best wings in his life he didn\u2019t  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anthony smirked at his friend\u2019s obviousness, as the wheels in his mind began to work up a sneaky plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You really like the food here, John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mouth full of meat, John nodded quickly. He swallowed with the same amount of speed as he had devoured the chicken wings. Without any more food to distract him from conversation with John, he replied, \u201cMan, this is the best food that I have ever eaten. Hell, it\u2019s even better than anything that my Mom made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere at Belly Busters, we only serve food that we, the workers, would like to eat ourselves. Our chef, Big Billy, makes us try out his new recipes at least once a week. I could get you in on these foodie feasts, but that means that I have to get you a job here. Would you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that? I would love that! Hell, I love you for doing this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony\u2019s eyes narrowed as he took a closer glance at John as. A sly grin gradually crept on his chubby face as his took a closer look at his brother\u2019s roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not literally. I just appreciate that you are doing all of this for me. Lately, I\u2019ve been having the worse luck, especially with losing my job and getting out of a relationship recently. Now, with you doing all this for me, it looks like things are looking up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back as he stretch his mountain-sized body to his full size and scratched his bulky gut, Anthony said, \u201cI do what I can man, but I need you to do me a favor, if I am going to do this for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of his focus stuck on the amount of belly peeking out of Anthony\u2019s massive shirt, John nodded while his jaw was hanging dangerously close to the table. Noticing how enamored John was in front of him, Anthony took advantage of the situation. He moved himself closer to John as he spoke in a voice that was lower and deeper than his usual one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the boss to get you a position here, but you can\u2019t tell my brother that I came back from Japan yet. Can I trust you to keep this secret between just us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stared at the round, full face that was looking intently into his eyes.  He grew red in the face from embarrassment, and looked down at his hands. He folded his hands and twiddled his thumbs as he thought about how to react to Anthony\u2019s advances. John noticed his watch, and jumped up when he noticed what time it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s that late already! I got to go. Thank you for everything tonight, but if I stay any later, Mark is gonna get really freaked out by how long I\u2019ve been gone. See ya soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by John\u2019s sudden exit, Anthony jumped up to stop him. However, in doing so, he broke the table in the booth. As he tried to regain his composure, John had already left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit! Now, I\u2019m going to have to pay for this from my paycheck,\u201d said Anthony. \"All that work and he didn't even give me his response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a deep sigh. While he was bending over to pick up the broken table, John came back into the place, and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t tell Matt about your return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony smiled as he watched John return to his car and drive off in the dark. With the broken table under his arm, he walked backed into the kitchen as he set out to begin his plan. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a good thing that the roads were so empty since John drove even worse than he had when he left his home earlier that day. He gave a deep sigh and tapped his fingers as he thought about the events that took place at Belly Busters. Anthony had left his dreams in Japan to somehow get a position at this new restaurant. After all this time that Mark and him thought that Anthony was half way across the world, he was only 20 minutes away from where they lived. How was he gonna \u2013 SCREECH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black mini-cooper made an illegal turn and almost collided with John\u2019s car. The driver of the red corvette shouted, \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going asshole!\u201d With his emotions mixed up from the afternoon, John reacted out the only way that seemed to fit this moment: he stuck his arm out the car and gave the guy the finger. He kept it there until he parked in his driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John walked into his home, the only light that shined through was that from the moon. He slowly crept from the back door, which led into the kitchen, into the hallway in order to avoid waking up Anthony. Too bad that John hadn\u2019t notice all the weight that he gained from earlier. If had, it would have been easier to avoid the box of cereal on the counter. But with a couple of inches around the waist, the Fruity Pebbles didn\u2019t stand a chance.  <br>\r\nDown the sugary breakfast went, and it followed with a loud crash on the floor. With each tiny, flake on the ground, John rushed to clean them up, but as soon as he took a couple steps, noises consisting of *SNAP* AND *POP* filled the air. Scared of waking up his roommate, John bent over trying to pick up the mess he had caused. Sadly, he didn\u2019t take into account that his bigger and wider butt would come into contact with the bowl on the counter. Bumping into it was enough for the bowl to meet its doom on the kitchen floor, and cause a loud enough noise to awaken Mark. His bigger roommate came rushing out his room with a baseball bat screaming, \u201cWhose there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the position that led to this situation, John responded, \u201cIt\u2019s me, John. Sorry about waking you up. Just go back to sleep.\u201d <br>\r\nAs he put down the bat, Mark said, \u201cWhat the hell have you been doing in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust me being clumsily. I made a mess, but I\u2019m cleaning it up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you see anything in the dark? Let me turn on the light for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s plea fell on death ears as Mark flicked on the lights. His roommate stared at him with his eyes wide open. Surprised by Mark\u2019s reaction, John asked, \u201cWhat? Is there food on my face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo! \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he got rid of the itch, a strange look came on John\u2019s face as he noticed that his butt was bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!, shouted John. He jumped out of bed and moved himself into the restroom to check himself out in the mirror. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let Mark. Please don\u2019t let Mark be right. Please don\u2019t \u2013 goddamnit!

Clothed in his stripe pjs, he thought that maybe his clothes were just creating an illusion of being bigger than he really was. \u201cYeah, that has to be it because this,\u201d John said as he grabbed his stomach and shook in front of the mirror, \u201cdoesn\u2019t look that much bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking out his sizeable paunch, he started to pick it up and let it fall. He continued to do to for a couple as he also viewed it from different angles. For a guy that had a size 44 waist, John\u2019s belly wasn\u2019t really that big for a guy who weighed about 226. What John didn\u2019t know was that his weight had increased from the last time he weighed himself. After last night dinner at Belly Busters, his weight had increased to 240. However, the fourteen pound gain had distributed majority of the weight to butt, while leaving a couple of pounds in his chest and stomach. With a deep sigh, John decided that enough time had been spent in front of the mirror and began to get ready for his first day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, John had two outfits laid out for himself: a causal outfit with a button-fly jean and a t-shirt or a suit. He thought about the decision for a couple of minutes before deciding on..<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Even though he knew that the clothes were a couple of size smaller than his regular clothes, he disregarded this fact as he picked up the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in only a pair of white underwear, where the fabric was stretch to the very max across John\u2019s brown butt checks. They managed to stay intact as John\u2019s butt shook with every step that he took. Wobbling from side to side, his clothed butt disappeared as a black dress pants slide up over them. Sucking in as much air as he could, John zipped the zipper with hardly any effort. Holding in his breath, he quickly put on his dress shirt and buttoned each button at rapid speed. Careful to not release a single ounce of air, John threw on a dark black vest over his chest his clothes. After a hard battle to close up the vest, John managed a victory against the stubborn vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving himself very carefully in front of the mirror, John checked out his 240 pound frame. The clothes looked to be very snug, but John thought that he looked very professional. A smile crept onto his face as John saw how sharp he looked. Silently, in his head, John thought, \u201cThere is no way that I\u2019ve gained any way because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to fit into this outfit. Hah! Looks like Mark was wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final sentence completed, John released the air that he had been holding in. Without all of his gut being held in, his belly brought out from his clothing prison. First, the buttons on the vest shot out in the air. Like bullets from a machine gun, each of the black buttons flew across the room. With the same force of a baseball being thrown in the air, the buttons collide in mirror and the wall, and left indentations in the places that they landed in. Cracks started to at such an astonishing speed that John panicked and stated to run out the bathroom and back into his room. Unfortunately, since John didn\u2019t realize the weight that he had gained in his lower half of his body, rips at the seams emerged with each time that John moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his clothes in ruin, John stood in his room with a half naked body. Taking a few breathes as he tried to gain he composure, his stomach popped out, and his chest fought for freedom from the remains of the dress shirt and the vest. Bending his head to gain a look of himself in shambles, John snapped his head upright as quickly as he brought it down. As he started to remove the remainder of his clothing, he said, \u201cMaybe it would be better if I \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you started your car and drove down to Belly Busters for your first day of work, your worries about your clothes took a turn for the worse as starting remembering the bad luck streak that you been suffering from recently. Instead of dealing with it with depressing emotions, you disregard all of that with a single thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at Belly Busters, you are greeted by Anthony. You\u2019re about to ask him about whether you look alright for work, but your stomach beats you to the punch. A loud grumble comes out as a look of embarrassment appears on your face.

As a person with a talent for knowing how much a person weighed with a single glance, he could definitely tell that his friend had gained weight since when he had saw him earlier. From all the time that they had spent together, Mark had been fortunate to receive a front row seat to all of the weight that John had put on over the years. He knew better than anybody that whenever John gained weight, it always went to his butt first before it distributed anywhere else. And from the looks of it, it looks like he gained a lot of weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he cleaned up the mess that laid on the kitchen floor, he thought back to the conversation that he just had. He thought to himself, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have mentioned how big his butt looked.\u201d Before he time to think, the sentence had already left his mind and made its exit out of mouth. He knew that John\u2019s always felt so self-conscious about the size of his bottom, but he couldn\u2019t understand why. Mark knew a lot of people who kill to for their butt to be even the size of John\u2019s left butt cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his foot to push open the trash bin, he dumped the last of the Fruity Pebbles in there. As he watched it fall, he caught a glimpse of his own fat. Using both of his hands to get a better idea of how big it was, Mark was surprised to find out that he couldn\u2019t even touch his fingers from the positions that they were at. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have given John so much grief about his weight gain when he seemed to make his 6 ft 4 body look like it was a couple of months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned about his size increase, Mark walked into the restroom to see how much he had gained from the last time he had weighed himself. He thought about this as he undressed himself to get a better estimated amount from the scale. With his body free from his clothes, he looked in the mirror to see the difference in his body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd never even heard of such a thing.  Still, he thought as he reached beyond the cushion of soft fat that had overtaken his abs and began to stroke his member with one hand while the other stroked and squeezed the plump flesh of his chest and stomach, he couldn't very well deny the arousal that he felt right now.  Mark wasn't one to question something that felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's gut hung over the band of his jeans as he walked into the diner.  Even with the button unfastened, the pants were still uncomfortably tight around his waist.  He knew his flab spilled out from under his old, outgrown shirt, but at least it rolled over far enough to hide the fast that he couldn't do up his button.  Oh well, he thought with a shrug, he was too hungry to go back and find something that fit better.<br>\r\nLeaning back in his recliner, Mark let out an earsplitting belch.  He rubbed his hands over the fat gut that hung out of his tiny wifebeater.  The shirt covered his soft chest, but most of his belly was completely bare.  He rocked back and forth a bit, gathering momentum to raise himself out of his chair.  With a grunt he made it to his feet and lumbered into the kitchen.<br>\r\nMark stood bent over the fridge, looking for something to eat.  Dinner had been almost two hours ago and his stomach was roaring for a snack.  Finally finding something suitable to eat, he heaved himself upright and began waddling back to his recliner.  Carefully, he lowered himself into the chair, he'd broken the last one by dropping into it, and wiped his sweaty forehead with his arm as he caught his breath after the brief exertion.  <br>\r\nMark slowly lumbered down the hallway towards the kitchen, fat chest heaving as he puffed his way along.  Even the short walk to his kitchen was getting to be a lot of work for him these days.  With an additional effort he reached around his extra-wide waist and yanked up the boxers that were slipping down his huge ass.  Even righted, they weren't big enough to cover his rear end completely, but Mark had gotten used to clothes that couldn't contain him several pounds ago.  Finally, he made it to the kitchen and leaned heavily on the counter, feeling his enormous gut press heavily against it, and struggled to catch his breath.  Man, he thought with a strange mixture of awe and pride, I've gotten so damn fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally woke up the next morning, it was with a huge smile on his face.  So much for sleep clearing things up, he thought.  He had thought it was strange to be aroused by his real,, slightly flabbier physique last night, but his dream of being an overweight, out of shape blob of a man had left him so horny it almost hurt!  \"What am I supposed to think about this?\"<br>\r\nThe question promptly fled his mind as he once again gave into the urge and began pleasuring himself, picturing himself in various states of fatness.  <br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" he panted after he had finished.  He could hardly remember such a powerful reaction, and it was all after imagining his own fatness. <br>\r\nWell, it sure felt pretty damn good, Mark thought.  Maybe I should....</span></div></div>",

He'd always loved the feeling of power that came with easily lifting weights that a lot of other guys could hardly budge, and all the attention that his bulky, manly body earned him from women and men alike certainly helped to stroke his ego.  It had always been those things that had kept him going to the gym rather than any sort of commitment to health and fitness.  To tell the truth, the last few months he'd spent slacking on his workouts and being lazy had been pretty great.<br>\r\nStill, Mark had always thought that he'd eventually start getting out of shape and force himself to go back to the gym.  The thought of actually getting fat had never so much as crossed his mind before, but now, after last night's odd dream, he couldn't get the idea out of his head that day.  Everything seemed to remind him of it; struggling to button his tightening work pants, feeling the flab on his belly bounce as he ran to make it to the bus in time, even grabbing a second donut during his midmorning snack break all brought his mind back to his dream of obesity and made him start to get hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it was a struggle for Mark to make it through his shift, but he was too preoccupied to be bored this time.  He'd even broken down and sneaked into the bathroom to relieve some 'tension' halfway through his shift.  By the time he was done that evening, Mark had made a decision.  As weird as it was, thinking about getting fat was making him more horny that he could ever remember being.  He didn't really understand it, but he knew it made him feel good.  What else really mattered?<br>\r\nWith that decided, Mark left work and made his way down to the nearest fast food place he could find.  Even when he was at peak fitness, Mark had always had a fondness for that type of crappy, low quality food.  He knew as well as anyone else how unhealthy it was, but he was a simple man with simple tastes and he didn't argue when something tasted good, no matter how greasy and fattening it might be.  With his new decision to give this gaining thing a shot, Mark was excited to give into his appetite and glut himself on as much junk food as he could eat.</span></div></div>",

A fleeting ounce of guilt ran through his mind, but it was driven out almost immediately by the a wave of contentment and satisfaction.  He rubbed a big hand across his full, slightly hairy belly and let out a resounding burp.

He hadn't tried to pass him off as a nine-to-fiver when he applied, and they obviously didn't expect too much of him.  </span></div></div>",

There wasn't much good to be said about working in a glorified 7-Eleven, but one good thing was the free reign he had over their supply of baked goods.  None of the managers wanted to be stuck behind that counter any more than he did, so he was usually left to his own devices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's why this shirt's feeling more tight these days, he thought as he glanced at the stress lines forming around the shirt buttons.

The wooden table might have seemed heavy to the average man, but Anthony was a unique being. While most would consider those who stood at 6\u20191 tall, Anthony towered over those men by six inches. At his weight, regular people be close to immobilization. However, Anthony carried his weight well (as well as any 635 pound man could that is!). His height allowed for his weight to be distributed throughout his body. Certain body parts still managed to stand out, especially his forearms and the lower half of his body. Most guys would be a little self conscious about having thighs as big as tree trunks and a booty that swung left every time that he moved right, or vice versa, but not this giant of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony carried his weight confidence and ease. He worked out at the gym, before he came to work, kept the fat on his body firm, and allowed for the muscles to continue to grow. He worked out his body so much that customers were able to see his biceps pressing tightly against his already taut thin clothes. He was the only worker that did this, and Anthony did it to his advantage, because he knew that diners enjoyed the 635 pound piece of eye candy that brought them their food. Just like John did tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheels in head started to turn as he walked himself into the kitchen. The chef, Big Billy, was packing away the last of the food when Anthony had entered. After setting down the broken table against the stove, Anthony asked Big Billy, \u201cHey, man. You got any food left around here? I\u2019m feeling like munching on something right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I gave the last of the food from tonight earlier.\u201d Chuckling as he took off his apron, he turned to face his co-worker before he continued talking. \u201cWho was so important that I had to stay later than usual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA! What the hell happened to that table?\u201d interrupted Big Billy as he pointed wooden table against the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this. It\u2019s not a big deal. I just got out of the seats too quickly and I guess that this place can\u2019t really handle man of my size. Heh. Heh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony stared down at his tonnage that was his belly. He gripped it with both hands and started to caress it. He went into a deep trance as he became focused on his girth. A smile of ecstasy came on his face as one of his beefy arms rose to chest and started to play with it. If it wasn\u2019t for his giant gut reaching close to his knees, it would have been obvious that his manhood was in need of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Billy broke Anthony out his dream by clearing his throat loudly. After spooking the man in front of him, he said to Anthony, \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to report the boss about this incident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout right now, I\u2019m sorry about that. It\u2019s just that all this weight is so intoxicating, I just can\u2019t control my<br>\r\nself sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was talking about the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust go down the hall, and see what the consequences will be for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony said nothing as he walked towards the office of the owner of Belly Busters. He swung his drum sized legs and made his way toward his punishment. He passed by Big Belly and bumped him with his meaty man ass.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony dropped into his seat with a loud thump that caused the room to vibrate. He struggle to keep his jaw clenched as he watched Dixon walk around the desk. Just a couple days ago, Anthony was in the room being lectured for snapping at a family for demanding for more ketchup. When he took a seat, he broke the sides in order to fit in his wide hips, and ending up crushing it with extreme weight. When he left the office, his boss had ended the conversation with a handshake, Anthony was able to enjoy the sense of superiority that held over his upper management with his larger height and weight. He smiled his trademark toothy grin that revealed that he enjoyed the body that he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that Dixon always threw him looks that hungered for his body. He used to his advantage and would steal his smaller coworkers\u2019 uniforms to flaunt off his rolls and curves. Despite the customer service that came with walking around the restaurant, Anthony did it because he knew that Dixon would be watching him with jaw wide open. A couple times when he had been called in, Anthony had put on a show by struggling to enter into Dixon door entrance. He pretended not to notice his boss licking his lips. This was the reason that Anthony was able to get away with so much at the place, and why the rest of the employees disliked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it looked that from the last time that Anthony had been in the room Dixon had managed to gain enough weight to topple his 625+ pound frame. Now that Dixon held the upper hand with being heavier, Anthony knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to use his body to manipulate his boss anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting up the deep concentration that Anthony had placed himself in, Dixon looked down at the now smaller man and with smile that was similar to Anthony\u2019s grin, he said, \u201cWhat did you come in here to ask me about, Anthony?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He told himself that his was because all the weight must have went straight in his bottom. With that, he managed to gain his cockiness back as he bluntly shouted, \u201cThis is NOT possible! I was bigger than you less than a couple days ago. I know that I been gone for a couple days, but there is no way that you managed to get bigger than me since then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his face red from rage, Anthony took deep breaths as he tried to gain his composure.

He shouted, \u201cAnswer me, damnit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon put his glasses down on the desk before he rose to his full height. As he straighten up his back, the color in Anthony face changed to a pale white as he realized that weight was not the only advantage that he loss over his boss. When Dixon was at his full stature, he stood a full head over his employee. He said to Anthony in an eerily cheerful voice, \u201cWhy don\u2019t take a seat, and I will explain it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI rather stand.

He would have kept his gaze to the ground if he had not been shocked by the booming vibrations that shook the room. He looked around the room in a panic, but saw that his boss was the result of the mini earthquake from dropping his impressive frame into the chair.

His clothes were starting to get tight and he was in a constant haze of being full, but tried to stay with it enough to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon, though, ignored any low performance during this particular week.  He could tell Anthony was barely able to keep up and all Dixon really wanted was to overpower the man for once.  He hadn't really decided to eat Anthony, but it was a good threat.  Though Dixon had been eating people.  Of course the magic that helped him do so also allowed him to send those men on their way with about 200 less pounds safe and sound, but he wasn't going to let Anthony know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with Anthony eating like crazy and Dixon munching his way through several pounds of food himself, the end of the week arrived.

And how do you feel?\" Dixon asked, almost unable to keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's face scrunched as he ripped an enormous, low fart that Dixon could feel through his fat feet and thick chest.  The smell wafted into the room and Anthony let out a low growl as he finally finished.  His cheeks were red and sweat was beading up on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Dixon smiles.  \"Now my next plan for you...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead he had Anthony work half shifts and the other half was spent in Dixon's office eating food from the new Belly Busters corporate office.  The food was laced with heavy weight gaining formula, extra fat, and was more delicious than anything else they served.  The sizes of the meals were even bigger than before too, but day by day Anthony could pack in more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis weight had shot up as well.  He had gone from 675 to 700 by the end of the following week.  By the end of the month he was 790.  The clothes Dixon got him were no longer capable of containing him and he had to resort to sweats and t-shirts.  Though at that point Dixon decided to let Anthony stay home, but under the condition that he eat the Belly Busters meals sent to his house everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Dixon had gone to check in on Anthony.

Could it all have been just a ruse to get me to gain weight?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting out his theory, Anthony smacked his gut with his right hand.

Dixon tried to move away from being under his heaviest employee, but it seemed that Anthony had just recently stuffed himself as his gargantuan gut didn\u2019t wobble a single roll. Not giving up hope, Dixon pushed Anthony\u2019s face away, and managed to lean forward a couple of inches. Dixon tried to scurry away, but his escape was thwarted by Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelly Buster\u2019s biggest employee had actually let Dixon move around enough to let him think that he could escape. Anthony knew that at his current size that he easily outweighed his boss by at least 250 pounds. Even though he gained a significant amount of weight recently, like his boss, Anthony had always been one of the heftiest guy that most people laid their eyes on, unlike his boss, so all of this new weight was something that Anthony was used to. The 6\u20197 giant watched his boss try to scamper away because it was actually amusing to see a man, who could make a Volkswagen look tiny, try to maneuver himself out from under him. After about a couple feet, Anthony ended his bosses escape by standing up, moving over to tower above Dixon, and dropping his entire weight on him as hard as he could as he sat on him. Anthony\u2019s rock hard tummy managed to cover majority of Dixon\u2019s body, except for a couple of inches of Dixon\u2019s head that peeked out from under the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Enjoying the domination that he had over his boss, Anthony decided to pick his gut up and let it smash back into Dixon\u2019s face. His boss let out a grunt, which Anthony responded with, \u201cOh, you like that? How does it feel to have a big man like me on top of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dixon was able to give a response, Anthony dropped his belly on top of him. He then proceeded to smash his belly against his boss\u2019s face. After continuing this domination of having his gigantic body on top of Dixon, Anthony lifted up his belly so that they both could hear each other speak. \u201cSo here\u2019s what gonna happen from now on, little man. Since I\u2019m bigger than you, it\u2019s obvious that I should be in charge. I\u2019ll forget about the little arrangement that tried to force on me because it looks your only full of hot air.

Anthony just chuckled and stomped back to his couch and sat down as Dixon's belly wobbled from the force of the fart.  He sat on the couch rubbing his belly and groaning happily, looking at his boss on the floor.  Dixon groaned from defeat and rolled over to push himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I... mmmph... have to do...?\" grunted Dixon as he got back onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony just looked at him with a grin, \"Well you know, Dixon...

Delivery from restaurants, multiple bags from the grocery store, Anthony had thought of everything.  The guy was a beast who seemed to be willing to become even more gigantic and it was all Dixon's fault.

His arms were tired from stretching over his former employee\u2019s enormous gut to feed him. He was hoping that Anthony was full from eating the Colonel\u2019s food because he ate enough to feed an army.  It was doubtful as over the past month, Anthony had added on an additional 25 pounds onto his mighty girth through Dixon slaving over satisfying the giant man\u2019s seemingly bottomless pit. No matter how much food Dixon brought Anthony from Belly Busters during this time, the bigger man always seem to crave more. That\u2019s why Dixon was surprised when Anthony followed up with window-shattering burp with a \u201cDamn, I\u2019m Full!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d questioned Dixon surprisingly as he was surprised to hear these words for the first time since he was forced to be Anthony\u2019s encourager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Anthony said as he stretched out his body. \u201cNot feeling too hungry right, but I\u2019m really in need of a good belly rub. Time for you to take care of this bloated feeling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon watched Anthony\u2019s sausage fingers tap his skin-tight belly as the bigger man waited impatiently for his rub down. As he waddled closer, Anthony let his huge body lean back against the sofa. All the fatty mass encompassed the furniture, and left no room for Dixon to sit next to Anthony. Letting out a sigh of annoyance, Dixon started to strain his knees by bending down his jumbo load to get the stomach massage done. Before Dixon body touched the ground, Anthony wrapped his arms against him and pulled him real close to himself. \u201cI want you nice and close for this belly rub,\u201d Anthony said with fat face inches away from Dixon\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I supposed to use my hands?\u201d Dixon shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said anything about using your hands?\u201d Anthony said as he moved Dixon around his bloated body like he was a wet sponge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tight grip that Anthony had against him, it was impossible for Dixon to push himself away from the giant man. Dixon knew that it was useless to resist, and after a few moments of trying to make himself more comfortable under strong grasp, he surrendered himself to Anthony\u2019s control. His resistance against all of Anthony\u2019s demands had lessened over the past month. Even though he constantly thought to himself how much he despised his former employee for black-mailing him into this enslaved existence, he secretly enjoyed all Anthony\u2019s torment towards him as he was finally able to pleasure the body that he used to watch from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I was thinking about?\u201d murmured Anthony as moved the smaller man around his body. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, Dixon\u2019s body felt squashed as he had stuck his entire body to fit into his vehicle. He completely disregarded the uncomfortable painfulness of the lack space as his mind seemed to be drawn back to the time that he had spent with Anthony. Each bump that he drove over in the road made his fat jiggle, which only brought images of the fat behemoth. Almost close to his home, Dixon thought, \u201cThe hell with what he wants! I\u2019m going to go see that man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a sharp u-turn, Dixon drove down the streets at amazingly high speeds as rush to get to Anthony\u2019s home.

With a speed that only a police car blaring its sirens could match, Dixon\u2019s Mini Cooper shot through the streets till he finally arrived in Anthony\u2019s driveway. Driven by the passion that he felt for the man, Dixon rushed to burst through the door, but once he reached it, he was surprised to see that it was open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time that Dixon had spent with Anthony at work and his home, there were never any visitors. Only people that every came around were food delivery people, and they never went beyond the front door. Conflicting emotions arose heavily in Dixon\u2019s chest as he stepped through the door and down the hallway to the living room where he had spent majority of the last 30 days. On the ground, a couple of feet away from him, Anthony was laying on the ground with his naked body exposed. His stomach was on the ground as his naked but was in the air. The enormous behind was gigantic compared to the guy was riding the jiggling mounds of fatty flesh. The two men were completely unaware of Dixon, whose anger was close to reaching an exploding point for him as he watched the scene unfold before his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony and his buddy were letting out moans of pleasures as they enjoyed each other bodies. As Anthony rocked his booty back and forth, the stranger laughed as he experienced the fleshy wave. Then Anthony let out a fart that caused the smaller man, who was named James, to fly backwards onto his back. He let out a deep, hearty laugh as he felt James flail around on his massive behind. Moving around on the ample flesh, James had his eyes closed as imagination went into overdrive the ecstasy of the moment. When he finally opened them, a furious Dixon was staring down at his Belly Buster bus boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone had a chance to say a word, Dixon grabbed James by the sides of his arms. He opened his mouth real wide and stuffed 5\u20197 man into his mouth. Any cries or protests that James had made were silenced as soon as his head entering Dixon\u2019s gapping mouth. Anger fueled the Belly Buster owner\u2019s appetite as he worked to get rid of the man who was his competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony felt the weight of James disappear, and turned to see where he was. He gasped as he saw that Dixon had his mouth wrapped around James\u2019 waist and was working on shoving the rest the men down his throat. \u201cDamn!\u201d Anthony whispered to himself. \u201cI guess he wasn\u2019t lying about being able to eat me.\u201d *gulp*<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The image that Anthony always had of Dixon was instantly shattered as he watched James sink deeper into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a small distance away from Dixon\u2019s bloated belly, Anthony\u2019s arm slowly rose to touch it. As his arm went higher, Dixon\u2019s head started to lower as he had finished his meal of James. With Anthony distracted from watching the jiggling belly, Dixon took advantage of the situation. He wrapped his arms around Anthony as he pulled him close to his swollen middle. Dixon stared straight into Anthony\u2019s anxious eyes. He broke his gaze as he moved his lips against Anthony\u2019s lips. Feeling the shivers that Anthony experienced, Dixon moved the man closer as he whispered into his left ear, \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to do things my way\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hot breath breezed against his ear, Anthony nodded as he responded with a stunned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the stress of living up to his boss\u2019 expectations had taken a negative toll on Anthony, and now, for the first time, he could enjoy the additional weight on gigantic body. What made the experience even better was that James was there to contribute with his extra pair of hands. Once James and Anthony finally became exhausted, the both re-energized with as much bacon and eggs that James was able to feed the bigger man. When the meal was done, they finally went on with their day as they both left to go to their individual jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Belly Busters, Anthony contributed to his work with a renewed vigor, which he never showed before. With his boss\u2019s threats not hanging over his head and a new man in his life, Anthony shined with an optimistic attitude. All his co-workers were responded to Anthony\u2019s happy attitude with big smiles and hard-working cooperation. Everything seemed to be going smooth until Anthony felt vibrations throughout his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man gripped his body as he felt the shakes take over his body every few seconds. Each shake on his body seemed to grow stronger by the passing second. Anthony started to take deep breath in an effort to stabilize himself, but he soon succumbed and fell down. Luckily, he managed to break his fall by landing near the counter. As he struggled to lift his heavy body from the ground, Anthony looked at the pot of soup that was near him. A closer glanced revealed to him that the vibrations were being caused from inside, but that they were coming from outside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Anthony had a chance to question his co-workers what was going on, the roof of Belly Busters was ripped off. As the debris fell down, customers and workers alike covered their faces with their arms for protection. Anthony would\u2019ve done the same if he hadn\u2019t caught a glimpse at the cause of the buffet\u2019s destruction; Dixon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up the giant man, Anthony backed up in horror as he watched the man, he thought he had digested the night before, munch down on the roof he held in log-sized fingers. In a booming voice, \u201cWhat a nice, little appetizer, but I\u2019m ready for some real grub,\u201d Dixon said as he smacked his wide, imposing belly. The noised echoed throughout the restaurant as all the people inside held their breath as the waited to hear what this giant monster was ready to feast on. \u201cANTHONY! Where\u2019re you hiding at?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in a state of shock, Anthony moved forward toward the commanding voice. He stared straight into the sky as he tried to get a logical explanation into how the man he ate the night before was sitting giant-sized before him. Anthony was broke out his trance as Dixon voiced bellowed out an ear-piercing laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m real do, ya, little man? Does this feel real to ya?\u201d Dixon asked as he reached forwarded and lifted little the nearly half-ton man with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dixon held the man in his tight grip, he started to squeeze him as looked down at him with a menacing grin. The giant strength that his boss had in his grip made Anthony experience a pressure and pain that he never experience before. He would have screamed, but Dixon\u2019s hold was so tight that it was starting to squeeze the air out of him. He was starting to lose consciousness, and wasn\u2019t able to focus on what Dixon was shouting at him. If Anthony had, he would\u2019ve noticed that his boss was getting his revenge on him by raising his hand closer to his mouth. Once the gaping hole was opened to max capacity, Dixon flung Anthony down his throat down like he was M&amp;M. As Anthony fell down the throat, he screamed with all his might in a vain effort that a miracle might happen\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He needed to know if Dixon\u2019s terror over his life was completely over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony moved his hand to grab the underside of his belly. Once he had a grip, Anthony immediately noticed that his belly was rock hard. He slowly moved his hand around his belly. As he explored his mountainous mass, he didn\u2019t feel any movements. He gripped it belly with both hands, and shook it as hard as he could. Other than rising movement from his crotch, Anthony felt nothing. A smile of elation and relief formed on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning! Looks like you\u2019re finally awake,\u201d stated James. \u201cHope you\u2019re hungry. I made you a big breakfast of all your favorites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames brought wide assortments of breakfast delectable. Anthony reached for a muffin as James started to talk about what happen last night. Taking a bite, Anthony let out a moan as he tasted the delicious treat. James continued to ramble on, but Anthony didn\u2019t focus on a word he said. All he could think about as he watched the food grow smaller was that none of it was filling him up. Even though he ate an amount that would feed a family of 5, none of it even made a dent in his curbing his appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! I can\u2019t believe you managed to finish all that food that quickly,\u201d James interjected. \u201cI\u2019ll clean this up. You better get ready for work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames struggled to dress into his work uniform, but with time quickly dwindling, he left a few buttons on his vest and cardigan unbuttons as the material refused to move past his wide belly. Noticing the time, he quickly rushed to get out the house and to work. James managed to intercept him before he left and surprised the big man with a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their lips met, Anthony\u2019s hunger demanded to be satisfied. As Anthony continued to explore James\u2019 mouth passionately with his tongue, Anthony felt something that he never felt before when kissing James; flavor. So focused as to understand why this experience was happening, Anthony wrapped his arms around James and moved him closer to his body. Unable to gain the answer he searched for, Anthony gave into his instincts as he continued make out with his lover. Lust quickly took over, and directed Anthony\u2019s actions. However, for the first time, it was Anthony\u2019s hunger that controlled his body. It demanded to be fed, and James was on the menu.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he passed out the milkshakes, he sincerely delivered apologies for the backup they were experiencing. All the customers happily accepted what Anthony served them, especially the milkshake, expect for one twig of a man. This man, named Matt, knocked the milkshake out of Anthony\u2019s hand when he went to give it to him. Matt ranted loudly to insure that everyone heard his complaints, \u201cWhy should I have to wait this long when I paid good money for some damn food?! Why the hell are you guys taking so long? I bet a fat-ass like you has been eating all the food back there!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant grew quiet as they waited to see what Anthony would respond. A bright smile grew on Anthony\u2019s face as said, \u201cSorry to hear that, sir. How about I get you some buns?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt leaned back, feeling important that he put this server in his place. With a wave of his hand, Matt dismissively said, \u201cWell, get to it, fatty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned to talk with the people around him, Matt did not notice that Anthony had turned around and was moving down on him. It was too late for Matt to do anything when he finally saw darkness fall over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony felt the rude guy move around from underneath him, but with a few butt clenches, he managed to suppress any future movement. As squirmed in the chair to make his seating more comfortable, Anthony asked the people seated near him, \u201cIs there anything else that I can help with? Would you guys like some buns, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brave man that was about the size as Anthony\u2019s belly said, \u201cI would some more of this delicious milkshake, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, sir.\u201d As Anthony rose up to his full height, he said from above, \u201cI will be back with in just one moment. I just need to take care of one thing first.\u201d With a twitch of left cheek, Matt was released from the grips of Anthony\u2019s dominating backside. As he stomped away, Anthony said to the gasping man on the floor, \u201cHoped you liked the buns, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The poor boy was sweating from how many cups he had to fill as the cries for more were heard from inside the restaurant.  The machine was making a slurping sound as it was running low on shake but the poor waiter was still trying to fill up big milkshake cups.  Anthony just chuckled and picked up two trays of shake, bringing them away from Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're outta shake, huh?\" Anthony asked with the two trays in his big mitts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are...

Every person worked together to get all the dishes perfectly cooked and delivered it to them as soon as possible. Everyone seemed to be in perfect sync of each other, and progress seemed to be made in relieving the hungry customers. Even with the effect of pills building the hunger in the milkshake consumer, the Belly Buster\u2019s staff managed to be able to deliver food to them quickly and efficiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone focused on the goal of eating, making, or delivering food, no noticed the slight*thump* noise that seemed to growing. The customers were focused on eating and filling the demanding hunger that nothing was gonna break their focus. The staff was occupied in the kitchen as they prepared the food, and the waiters went back to refilling the milkshake machine, under Anthony\u2019s guidance. As their attention was occupied elsewhere, nobody saw that the man who the entrance was expanded for was making his way inside Belly Buster. As Dixon, the former owner who would usually shower him with attention, was gone, the giant man was annoyed that no one was giving him the admiration that he was used to whenever he walked in the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way through Belly Buster, the 6\u20197 man waddled through the restaurant. Gabe, his name, pushed each massive thigh forward as he moved to his typical seating. As he waddled heavily down the aisle, he grabbed food from people\u2019s table with his massively, bloated hand and shoved it messily into his mouth. Only when Gabe had stolen a person\u2019s food, people looked up and saw the biggest butt cheeks barely contained in black fabric swaying away. Everyone was shocked once they saw the Volkswagens sized behind, but not as much as Matt, as he was seating in the usual seat that held this behemoth man. He never got a chance to ever scream as an immense amount of weight fell upon him again that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe scowled at every man that dared to openly stare at him. In his mind, he felt it a form of disrespect. His bloated ego would never have allowed him to even guess that it was because he was squashing a man underneath his ass. In order to gain the respect of those around him, he decided to show his dominance by eating all the food that was nearby him. Hastily, Gabe snatched plates and food with his bare hands and emptied into his mouth. Through a mouthful of mac and cheese, he shouted, \u201cMORE FOOD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric peered back behind Anthony\u2019s huge cheeks, and stated, \u201cLooks like we got an hungry one here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little man,\u201d Anthony said has picked up a milkshake, \u201cI handle him.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man was 800 pounds now which easily rivaled his own size and that did not make Gabe feel good.  He wanted to be the biggest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep the food coming!\" Gabe rumbled as he started to eat and chug back the shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Gabe,\" Anthony grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to the kitchen while Gabe ate and ate, chugging shake as he went along.  Anthony just kept replacing his shakes with more and brought out bigger and heavier dishes on the biggest platters they had.  Some men had to stop eating, shockingly, to watch Gabe eat.  The man never slowed down!  He just kept stuffing his face messily and noisily, grunting and slurping away while Matt tried to flail to get his attention.  Though Gabe was just too heavy and...  was getting heavier.  As he ate he grew!  The amount of shake going into him was probably an overdose of the pills so he was now growing right then and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt was riding up as his tight shorts grew even tighter.  Matt's cries were muffled completely as the giant ass moulded around him.  Gabe paused eating and gripped his giant gut which worried everyone.  Then Gabe's mouth opened wide as he let out a huge, deep, booming burp that thundered across the room and shook the tables.  It was bigger than Anthony's burp!  But that wasn't all.  He grunted and flexed a bit, his belly pulling inward as he let out a sudden fart that rumbled like a bomb going off.  Then he smiled stupidly and went right back to eating.</span></div></div>",

They watched in awe the growing fat man demolish burgers with just 2 bites. Every dozen of burgers, he paused from eating to chug down a milkshake that Anthony would bring him. Soon, all the customers watched in silence as Gabe continued to feast. The only noise that could be heard from Belly Busters was the grunts of pleasure that escaped Gabe\u2019s mouth, and grunts of displeasure from Matt, who was slowly being crushed under Gabe\u2019s swelling ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony watched the spectacle from afar in the safety of the kitchen. As he watched the pounds pour onto Gabe\u2019s thick body, Anthony started to understand why his old boss was so interesting in growing him. There was just something so special about encouraging another man with enough food to make his belly jut out proudly. \u201cToo bad he turned out to be an obsessive, clingy sociopath,\u201d Anthony thought to himself. \u201cOh, well. I hope he delivers me some real big gains in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his stomach, which was tightly stuffed with his ex-boyfriend, James, Anthony\u2019s mind wandered as he thought about where the new gains his old boss was gonna goes towards. He thought about the possibility of it only going towards his stomach, and all the different ways he could use it to dominate against Chris. Maybe the new weight would go towards his expansive ass. It was nice have James\u2019s smaller body bounce against cheek to cheek. Maybe that's where his contributions could go now. It could go towards some inches in height. \u201cHow tall would it make me then?\u201d Anthony pondered silently in his head. \u201cWait a minute! How tall am I now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had a chance to contemplate that idea, Anthony felt a slight tug on his left love handle. Because the rolls in the back of his head made it impossible to turn his head, Anthony turned his entire body instead. The small man who had tugged on Anthony\u2019s love handle, named Ryan, would have turned with Anthony if it wasn\u2019t for the small space in the kitchen that forced him to be held pinned against Anthony\u2019s monstrous gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony stared down at the 5\u20194 man, and chuckled, which caused his gut to move Ryan up and down along with it. With a sly grin on his face, Anthony asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan struggled against the giant ball of fat. He gripped hard against round gut, but unfortunate for him, the rough touch sent shivers down his giant captive\u2019s back, which caused more movement of his gut against him. Once Anthony had finally calm down, Ryan composed him to squeak out, \u201cThat hungry customer ran out of food a few minutes ago, and he has been angrily shouting for more. Chef Billy needs you to bring him these two platters of food now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony maneuvered himself to see the two huge trays. As he turned to look, he moved Ryan along and unknowingly set him free. \u201cAlright then, boys. We got a customer to feed. Let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d Anthony shouted at the kitchen crew, who had been staring at him dominate against his smaller co-worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony easily lifted the trays of chicken fingers and double cheeseburgers. He easily carried them out the kitchen as his new size allowed him to. Once he moved outside the kitchen area, he saw that customers were screaming and fleeing Belly Busters. Once he saw what was causing fear in the customers, he carelessly dropped the trays onto the nearest table. Under normal circumstances, he would have never treated food carelessly, but when you see stuffed roly-poly trying shove a man\u2019s head into his mouth, it isn\u2019t a normal circumstance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony quickly shouted at his crew and customers to leave immediately. As he ripped off his sleeves, he knew he was the only one capable to stop this eating behemoth </span></div></div>",

He fought against the sausage fingers that gripped the back of his head and pushed him towards the impossibly wide open mouth. Sam couldn\u2019t believe that only a few minutes ago this salivating mouth that he hoped to fill with burgers was now going to try to fill itself with him. Being one of the scrawniest customers who regularly attended Belly Busters at 121 pounds and 6\u20192, Sam had no chance of escaping the biggest customer who chowed down at the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony ran as fast as his 7\u20198 body would go. Before Dixon had his influence over growing his body, Anthony had no problem being able to run. It might not have been that quick, but near a couple hundred pounds on his body, including the additional weight of 250 pounds of James in his belly, it was now a feat that would be impossible. The best that Anthony could manage was slow waddle that caused his entire belly to shake like an earthquake struck it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the heavy footstep that the giant made, it went completely unnoticed by Gabe as he was too concerned on filling his hunger with the meal he captured in his hands. Gabe managed to move the screaming Sam headfirst into his mouth. A simple lick of Sam\u2019s face sent shivers of ecstasy down Gabe\u2019s flab covered back. To the captured men held by Gabe\u2019s tonnage, Matt and Sam, it felt like jackhammer was attacking them all over. Entranced by the moment, Gabe soaked it up by releasing his grip from Sam and enjoying the explosion of flavors in his mouth was experiencing. Anthony took advantage of the moment, and in swift move, pulled Sam out of Gabe\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger that his stomach had been denied a meal, Gabe immediately stood up. In rash actions didn\u2019t take into account his newly developed body as it destroyed the metal bar that held the table down. It flipped into the air, and bounced off a pair of buttocks, which were barely smaller than the stuffed and bloated gut of Gabe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony had been speaking to Gabe to apologize and escape immediately, but had been interrupted by what had been a sharp tap against his gigantic ass cheeks. He rose to full height and glared at the man who had foolish strike his precious behind. Gabe slowly backed away as realized his mistake. All the courage that he before in gulping down Sam has disappeared as the stomach that approached him was bigger than him. In a low, menacing voice, Anthony slowly spoke to Gabe, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re a big, tough guy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony pushed his belly into Gabe, and forced him to fall back a few feet. As chairs and tables were carelessly knocked over, Gabe feared what this behemoth was capable of doing to him. Gabe panicked, and tried to make a run for it. But, with his stumpy legs carrying his bloated self, he was barely able to move a few inches. It was all in vain as Anthony tackled the smaller man to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision of flab created a loud smacking noise that made the Belly Buster crew hiding outside run even further away from the restaurant. Luckily for Matt, the nearly 2,000 pound crash, forced his release from Gabe\u2019s ass. He was even luckier that Anthony didn\u2019t land on him as he had done to Gabe. Shocked by the image that was before him, Matt was too stunned to move. He stared at what was before with an open mouth as he it was only something had only ever fantasized about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony gripped the unconscious Gabe with a bear hug, and picked him up. After positioning him into a fireman lift, he stared down at the annoying customer that was Matt. He sneered at him and said, \u201cYou better leave a bigger tip next time\u201d. Too scared to say anything, Matt ran out the ruined restaurant. He didn\u2019t see that Anthony had lumbered off into the privacy of his old boss\u2019s office. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since the incident, no one had seen or heard of Gabe. Even with the disappearance of Belly Buster\u2019s biggest customer, the restaurant had managed to recover its profits with the incident generating word of mouth all over the state. Big boned people had traveled to the place where they heard the milkshakes could help build their appetites to devour huge amounts of food that they never been able to before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony loved the huge response that Belly Busters had been getting. All the new customers from all over the place brought a treat to the eye with the different sizes that grew during their stay there. While the rest of the crew enjoyed the new business as it gave them a bigger paycheck, Anthony took a different pleasure as the out-of-state customers became meals to him. He was able to enjoy these meals as no one ever really knew who they were during their temporary stays. As a result, Anthony had edged closer to the 8\u2019 ft mark as it was barely an inch below it. All of the girth on his body became even bigger as nearly 85 pounds had been added to it. For Anthony, it just meant bigger limbs to move around on, except his wider ass, which he knew was thanks to John. For the rest of the Belly Buster, it meant less space in the restaurant, and more chances of being squashed, like Ryan had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Anthony used his impressive size and height to bully the rest of the crew to never question his authority. They took everything that he had to tell him as truth. For example, when Anthony told them that their boss, Dixon, wanted to work in his office undisturbed, they knew never to enter into his office whenever they brought a cart of food as his meals. They never had an ounce of curiosity to behind the door to see what made those loud growling and thumping noises. Each of the crew members came to respect Anthony\u2019s orders has they heard from Matt the incredible strength that Anthony used to take down Gabe. If he was able to take down the behemoth with ease, each man was afraid to see what that herculean strength was capable of doing against their various cub-sized bodies. <br>\r\nIf any of the crew members had gained the courage to see behind the door, they would have been shocked to see the size of the man covered barely by a red jockstrap. If they hadn\u2019t run screaming at that point and crept closer to the man\u2019s face, they would have recognized that man as Gabe. But none of them did, so they never knew that the carts of food that they brought 4 times out of the day lead the impressive growth that Gabe had reached. At this point, Gabe had finally the size of old Belly Buster owner, and that was perfect for Anthony.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With his former boss gone, he needed someone to act as his replacement. However, this person needed to come into the restaurant without any questions being raised about Dixon\u2019s disappearance. Luckily, the answer came to him quickly, and Anthony realized that he had the answer in his hands. So, Anthony released the unconscious Gabe out of his mouth and set him down on the floor in Dixon\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped him softly on the face to wake the fat man out of his unconsciousness. Gabe tried to move away, but opened his eyes quickly as he saw that he pinned down by his own bloated belly. He stared at with awe as the memories hit about what he had down for the past 4 hours. He was so focused on the size of his belly, he jerked back a few inches once Anthony\u2019s grinning face appeared past the top of it. They both stood in awkward silence as they both stared into each other\u2019s faces. Similar to how a predator stares at their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony broke the silence by saying, \u201cSo, you messed up my restaurant, fat man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe tried to point out that it wasn\u2019t Anthony\u2019s, but the giant stopped him by placing his huge booted foot on top of glorious gut. As Gabe moaned in pain from the added weight on his bloated self, Anthony leaned his chin on his knee as he continued on. \u201cHere\u2019s how I plan on getting to pay me back. Lately, we been having leftovers go to waste because of the lack of big numbers that we\u2019re used to. After today\u2019s fiasco, I\u2019m guessing it is not going to get better. Because you\u2019re the cause of today, you\u2019re gonna fix this problem by eating all the food that goes uneaten. You\u2019re gonna stay here for the next couple months till I decide that things have become settled between us. Once that happens, I\u2019ll escort you out myself. How does that sound?\u201d Anthony asked as he grinded his boot against Gabe\u2019s gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled down at the man as he watched him sputter out, \u201cO-o-o-ok\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony left the engorged man on the floor to rub his belly in peace. As he closed the door, a sinister smile on his face as his stomach growled out loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                             *A couple months later\u2026*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony had finally made Gabe as big as his old boss, Dixon, and today was the day he was gonna eat him. After months of curbing his appetite with out-of-towners, who had come as the result of restaurant\u2019s new reputation, Anthony could not hold himself back any longer. He was starving for a real meal that could challenge him, and Gabe was the perfect sized man to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Anthony left to go fill himself up, he decided it was best to get a replacement for Gabe. He found the perfect man, named Josh, who came from Kansas. At 6\u20190, he barely tipped the scale at 165, but the way he attacked his plates showed that he had real potential to become a porker. Anthony served him milkshake after milkshake to build an insatiable hunger in the man. It would create enough of a distraction for Anthony to enjoy his meal in peace. After nearly 2 gallons of that stuff inside Josh, the crew and customers set the attention on Josh. When Anthony heard the man bellow out, \u201cBURGERS, NOW!!!\u201d, he used the opportunity to sneak into Dixon\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe was exhausted from devouring the tray that was brought to him a few hours ago. Feeding himself had become a chore as his arms were weighed down by hundreds of pounds of fat. Yet, Gabe could not deny his stomach food when it was only a few feet away from him. He lunged himself onto his belly and dragged across the floor as moved closer to the giant plates of food. He didn\u2019t even bother with hands as he just drove his head into the plates and attacked with mouth. Once he finished, he rolled away, and rubbed his food covered chest and belly. Gabe slipped into a food coma as he didn\u2019t even hear Anthony open the door, and thump his way into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony had been waiting for this moment for months. He would no longer deny himself this meal, but choose to savor every second of it. He squatted down closer to Gabe, and picked up by his shoulders. With a strong grip on the flabby things, he lifted the man to his mouth. Anthony shoved Gabe inside and closed his mouth over the last of his fifth chin. Unable to contain himself any longer, Anthony shoved more of Gabe into his mouth till he was inches away from the man\u2019s belly button. With a deep inhale, he managed to get more of Gabe into his mouth and down his throat. Once Anthony had got that entire belly inside his own belly, he licked at the juicy rump that Gabe had. It didn\u2019t compare to most men\u2019s butts, but it was still big enough that Anthony enjoyed it before he quickly swallowed more of Gabe\u2019s legs. With one last inhale, Gabe fell heavily Anthony that it caused the giant of a man to fall on his own ass, which caused an earthquake feeling thought Belly Buster. Anthony enjoyed the private moment of his bloated belly, but it was shortly interrupted when he heard someone shout from deep in the eating area, \u201cHE\u2019S EATING HIM. HELP! THIS GUY IS TRYING TO EAT MATT!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinister grin on his face, Anthony picked himself up and waddled out of Dixon\u2019s office.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That day Anthony managed to gobble up Josh... as well as a few other customers who had gotten in his way as he did so.  Every day he ate whoever gave him a look when he was in a bad mood or who had gotten lost while looking for the bathroom and saw him eating someone.  It was getting harder and harder to keep his deal a secret too.  The more people saw him the more he ate.  The more he ate the bigger he got.  His body was widening and fattening at such a rapid pace that it was impossible for him to button his shirt or pants now.  Everything he wore was skin tight around his giant gut that was well over 7 feet around now.  His pants were plastered to his massively thick, strong legs and extra wide ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Friday he was sitting in the manager's office, grunting and groaning after eating two of the patrons of the restaurant.  He rubbed his huge gut in big, wide circles and belched so thunderously that the walls shook in the office and tables rattled in the dining room.  So far the only people who had seen him were patrons and the staff just thought he was on some weird steroids or eating way too much.  Though today was the day the speculation would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony, finally feeling better after digesting the two guys he ate, lumbered his way to the kitchen.  His huge boots stomped the floor as he waddled down the hall, sides brushing heavily against the walls.  He passed the kitchen when he heard something that worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's eating the customers.  Have you seen him?!\" laughed one of the waiters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's fuckin' fat now.  I bet he could eat a guy,\" chuckled a chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they felt the ground shake and a sound like an angry bull behind them.  They slowly turned around and saw Anthony's huge form outside the door, filling it completely.  He was scowling and bearing his teeth as they stared in awe, totally scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" he grumbled in a voice so deep they could feel it in their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... n-nothing, Anthony...\" said the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone.  Outside.  NOW!\" boomed Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unblocked the door and everyone hurried outside.  They all lined up in the back of the restaurant that was hidden from the street and fenced in.  Anthony looked down at them all and rubbed his giant, hairy, exposed gut as he did.  Everyone was trembling and with good reason.  They could see the saliva build up in the corners of his mouth and knew that couldn't be a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've all become too much of a risk.  I can't have that.  So you all get to go on a nice trip,\" Anthony said calmly.  \"A trip into my gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one each of them was grabbed and shoved into Anthony's mouth where he swallowed them easily.  They tried to run but the door in was behind Anthony and the fence was locked.  They tried to yell for help but it was no use.  Each one that yelled was grabbed and swallowed.  Once they were all inside of Anthony he groaned and clutched his gut.  They were still squirming and had made his gut swell out huge, making it uncomfortable.  He groaned and fell back on his ass and leaned against the wall of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ough, fuck.  So full... Must sleep...\" he groaned before closing his eyes and drifting off.</span></div></div>",

He certainly felt heavier but something else was off.  He felt funny... Not bad though, just funny.  Anthony furrowed his brow and opened his eyes, seeing that he could now view the street on the other side of the fence.  His mouth dropped open as he looked down and saw his giant gut sticking out to his knees and the hands that were palming it were as big as the dumpster.  He was... a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" he said softly but even his whisper was a rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony grunted as he pushed himself up, hearing what was left of his clothes rip and tear off of him.  Cloth fluttered to the ground and he realized now that he was naked since nothing he wore had grown with him.  His cheeks flushed red and he looked around, glad that he was out back by a service road.  He went to go back inside when he realized that he was as tall as the building.  The door was now probably too small to fit his arm through.  His poor belly rumbled hungrily and he realized that he must have digested everything already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I can't get in trouble for this,\" he said, balling up his fist and smashing it into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall cracked and shattered, rubble falling into the hallway and what was once an office.  The big hole was big enough for him to smash his fist in again so he could get into the kitchen and rip the door off of the fridge.  He rummaged around and pulled some of the food out, gobbling it down whole before realizing he could hear screams.  The restaurant had been full when he fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stomped his way around the building and came out to the front.  Cars driving by suddenly swerved and hit each other as people saw a naked behemoth come around the buffet.  At first he was embarrassed but he saw all the fat customers waddling out of the restaurant and his hunger hit him again.  He grabbed them as they tried to get to their cars in the parking lot and tossed them into his mouth.  He swallowed them whole one by one, grunting in pleasure.</span></div></div>",

He gulped him down quickly and rubbed at his vast sides, bringing up a burp so big and deep that windows started to crack and car alarms started to go off.  The giant just smirk cockily and smacked his side.  He went to take a step to move on but felt his belly bubble and rumble.  It wasn't hunger though.  No, this was like when he had woken up in a way... Just stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what i-\" he was cut off as he felt himself lurch upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as he realized the ground was getting even further away.  His hands started to move further apart too as his belly blimped bigger and wider.  Anthony started to panic but suddenly realized that this felt pretty good.  His arms and legs were surging with strength and fat, his chest widening and softening, his ass growing into two huge hot air balloons of fat.  Anthony was becoming something he never dreamed he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep growl came from his plump lips as his eyes darted around the street.  A group of people had started running and Anthony wasn't going to let them get away.  Anthony started to waddle after them, his growing feet making deep <b>THUD</b> sounds and caused the ground to shake.  The pavement cracked and fractured from the huge weight and the people started to stumble as the giant started to bear down on them.  Not to mention the swarthy, manly musk he was giving off was getting too much for their puny noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony grabbed the group and started to pop them into his mouth like candy.  Each one went in with ease and slid down his throat like butter.  Then he picked one out of the group and saw that it was Matt who used to come to the restaurant.  He was quivering in fear but Anthony didn't care.  He was hungry.  Matt soon found himself flying up into the sky as Anthony threw him upward.  He prayed to make it out of this alive and something, somewhere must have heard him.  He missed Anthony's mouth and fell straight down onto his belly.  But since he was falling so quickly and the fat was so soft he ended up going flying right off of Anthony's body and sailed out across the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Guess I need to find something else,\" Anthony rumbled.</span></div></div>",

With the last \"T\" crossed, he shuffled the papers and put them in an enveloped to be shipped off to headquarters. Abe had been managing this Belly Busters for the past decade, and was happy to finally put his art degree to use for once. What had once started as a simple job to pay off the school loans that were growing morphed into a career that Abe enjoyed. His ever-growing body was testament to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Abe opened up his desk drawer, he glanced down at the package that the neighboring BB owner had shipped him recently. Supervising the new crew had distracted Abe from opening up the package, but looking at in its pristine white box, the manager gave in to his curiosity. Moving his baseball glove sized hand to the lid, Abe opened the box. Unfortunately, Abe used too much strength, and crushed the lid. Shrugging it off, Abe tossed the lid behind him. He looked inside and saw that there were a bunch of different colored candies in there. Unable to tell what they were, Abe scooped a bunch of the pills and shoved them in his mouth. As he chewed on them, Abe decided that they must have been some new candy from Asia. Kinda sugary, but they did pack flavor. He wasn't sure, so he continued to pop more candies into his mouth as he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to state out loud what the flavor was, Abe's hand reached into the box to find no more candies. Disappointed, he picked up the box and turned it upside down. In a vain attempt to find just one more, he patted the box a few times, but no candies came out. Frustrated, Abe crumbled up the box, and was about to throw it away. That's when he noticed a white, blank card that was on his desk. Abe picked up the card with two thick fingers and held it close for a better examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was only a few inches away from his nose, different scents of food attacked his nose. Confounded with these different smells of his favorite food, Abe's stomach let out a deafening roar. The 6'7 behemoth jumped up from his chair, and knocked over his desk with big, round belly back a few feet. All this went unnoticed to the 500 pound man as he was only concerned with taking advantage of all the food that kitchen held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually sly about snacking on foods while managing his staff, Abe stuffed his face with abandon with an attempt to please his growing hunger. In a matter of minutes, Abe had managed to demolish an entire tray of desserts by himself, but the 120,000 calorie feast felt like air, which immediately escaped him from a blasting burp. Unable to control himself any longer, Abe screamed at his staff, \"MORE! I NEED MORE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew scrambled to feed the normally lovable boss in attempt to return him to normal. They proceeded to make plenty of food and feed it to him in an effort to calm that demanding hunger of his, but 8 months later, the only to change was the size of their boss.....</span></div></div>",

Watching all those puny people try to scramble caused the big guy to give a slight chuckle. To all those tiny specimens below, it sounded like a slow deafening boom that cause them all stop in their tracks . They watched as Anthony's giant stomach bounce up and down on his massive junk. All that friction caused Anthony's dick to thicken and rise. The growth that caused Anthony to become supersized had affected not only his appetite and height, but also his boys' downstairs. In fact, the people of the city watched Anthony's dick to grow to a schocking length as it picked Anthony's belly and revealed it full- sized self for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Anthony was never one to be ashamed of being naked, having his big round belly bounce on his lil' Anthony was too much pain for even the giant man to handle. Unable to handle the pain/pleasure even longer, the Mexican gargantuan searched around the city desperately looking for anything to contain his booty. Cars were crushed, people were snacked on, and buildings were uprooted till Anthony passed by a Time Square sized window display of a couple underwear-wearing mannequins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with excitement, Anthony broke through the windows and a couple of the garments. He tossed aside broken plastic parts and tried on pair of purple briefs. Stretched to the absolute limit, the briefs managed to contain all of the mile-wide man. People, who were hidden behind the giant, stared at the massive fat ass, and hoped that, if the giant decided to sit down, they would be lucky enough to be safe under that bus-size crack of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony decided to take an extra pair of yellow briefs with him. Not for him, but for a special man, he knew would be growing big enough to need these. Anthony thought about how his special man used to always be sly about wanting to get extra plates of food as he squatted down to pick up the fallen briefs. He hoped the pills he sent Abe would give the extra push he needed to unleash his inner fat man. He couldn't wait to see how much rounder that belly, ass, face, cheeks, arms, thighs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big RIIIIIIIIIIIP noise brought the behemoth back to reality. Turning his face as far as his chins would allow him to, Anthony saw that his ass forced these purple briefs to become a jockstrap. Fine with the breeze that following back there, Anthony continued to waddle towards the nearest Belly Busters he hadn't demolished yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was supposed to be spent cleaning with bleach and sponges had turned into the crew cleaning out all the cabinet and fridges of all food, which was chopped and cooked to feed their boss. Even as Abe waited for the food to be prepared, the waiters had been sent out to neighboring resturants to gather as much as their twinky, little arms could carry. Once the smell of the food hit Abe's nose, his appetite roared from hunger as if he had never felt the experience of being full in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe currently 8' ft man sat his his half-ton self on 6 chairs, 3 for each cheek. Impatient to finally feel satisfied, Abe stretched out his arms around as much food as he could, and shoved it all in his mouth. The crew watched in fear as they saw their boss open his mouth to impossible heights and swallow the amount of food that it would take to feed an entire rush hour for lunch. A few crouched to  make themselves appear as small as possible in hopes to shrink. A few others stepped away as they watched in horror as their boss seemed to grow larger right before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the chairs couldn't handle the weight of this massive ass as they crumbled beneath him. Abe didn't even noticed as the sudden drop just made it easier for the food to descend inside his mouth. Swallowing and chewing as fast as he could, Abe didn't even notice when he had even managed to demolish the table as well. A loud BUUUUURRRRRPPP eruptted from Abe has used his beefy arms to push himself off the ground. All that food that he ate felt like a grape inside him, and needed more now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe waddled towards the kitchen as fast as his body could handle. Licking his lips in anticpation of stuffing his with all that delicious food, Abe's large tonuge made a loud smacking noise that sent shudders down ever member's back. Wider than 4 men combined, all of the crew who stood in Abe's path were pushed into kitchen with him. Filling out the entrance with just his ass alone, Abe went to work at shoving mouth with the first thing he saw. With his huge hands, a tray filled with eclairs, and held by the pastry Chef, Pierre, were all shoved  into Abe's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the eclairs were just sweet, but there was an extra flavor that burst in his mouth. He didn't understand what that new component was, but once he heard the voice of the pastry chief's voice, he realized that was a man sliding down his throat. He would've panicked, but Pierre tasted better than anything he ever had before. He quickly swallowed the meal as Abe needed to taste even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew latched onto Pierre's feet to try to release their fellow chef. Screaming for help, the crew who were outside pushed at the fleshy ass cheeks that hung outside the door. As all the food ingested earlier became digested, it forced the growing effect to happen right as nearly the entire crew was near Abe. They were too focused on stopping their fat-ass boss, not a single one noticed that Abe's fleshy body had bursted out of their confining clothes. The guys behind Abe's soon slipped inside his ass cheeks, which he gleefully tighten his grips on. Slurpped inside, as each one was vored by his ass, Abe continued to grow at accelerated rate. Soon everything in that restaurant was devoured into Abe's belly. Feeling full for the first time in months, Abe fell onto the resturant floor and cracked it under his tremendous weight. As he rubbed his growing belly, Abe drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

As he snored his belly pushed over tables and chairs while his ass crashed through walls and buffet stations.  He just kept snoring like a bear as his head inched toward the ceiling as he grew taller as well.  Belly Busters was starting to collapse and crumble underneath thousands of pounds of fat man without Abe even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople outside could see the walls and windows start to bow outward.  They tried to look into the windows but they were blocked by something inside.  It was too hard to see so they left and continued on their way, figuring it had to be nothing.  Then, suddenly, the whole front of the restaurant cracked and crumbled, falling to pieces into the street.  People gasped in shock as the restaurant fell away and was replaced by two big mounds that jiggled.  No one knew what it was... no one could even guess.  Then another cracking sound was heard as the roof blew out and something rose from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Abe's huge head, snoring away atop two broad, fat shoulders that loomed out over the crumbling building.  More pieces fell away until people saw that Belly Busters had been replaced by a giant, fat man.  Those two mounds that had broken from the front were in fact the biggest ass anyone had ever seen.  Everyone started to run as Abe woke up, grunting and rubbing his eyes with his huge mitts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wha...\" he said in a deep, rumbling voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw his body was even fatter than before and smiled.  But that wasn't it.  The restaurant lay in pieces around him.  Everything looked tiny.  He wasn't just fat, he was a giant!  Abe grunted and rolled his huge body up onto his fat feet.  He took a few steps to try out his size, feeling the ground shake and crack underneath him.  A wide smile crept onto his face as he realized how immense he was and how powerful he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe then saw in the mirrored windows of the tall buildings around him something that shocked even him.  His ass.  It was huge!  Each cheek was a big, round, fat, wobbling orb of blubber that were wide and plump.  His ass was so huge that he could easily crush a semi-truck and have plenty of room.  Hell, he probably wouldn't feel it!  Abe could feel his rod stiffen at that thought and then as he started to grope his huge butt.  His moans all but deafened those around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at the buildings again.  With a grin, he stomped toward them and slammed his big booty into one of them, feeling it crack and shatter as he did so.  The building dented and cracked in half due to the huge impact but Abe just felt even happier.  He did it to the building next to it and laughed deeply at the rubble that lay at his feet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back when Abe had just become a member of Belly Busters crew, it was embarrassed by his growing size. He always wore baggy clothes to hide his big belly and ass, but overtime, he always managed to grow into them. When Abe was promoted to manager, he accepted that he was a big guy, and that was never gonna change. He promised himself that he would never go overboard on eating, especially in front of the crew, and it was time to upgrade the workouts, so the waddling was kept to a minimum. That biggercity mentality went straight out the window, just like Abe\u2019s ass checks bursting out and capturing a couple of Muscle Marys who passed by a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReveling in the width and size that all his new growth just granted, Abe took pleasure in having to sway from side to side in order to move forward. It felt great to feel his magnificent belly and ass swing to along with him as maneuver himself through the city. It didn\u2019t matter that he could barely see past the front of his pushed-chest as everything smaller was puny, and thus, insignificant. Who in this world could challenge a man of his size when with each waddle buildings became dented and pushed off to the side? Just like his gut before him, Abe\u2019s ego was swelling by the minute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Abe was stopping his terror over the town momentarily to fully appreciate his size by looking at his reflection in a building tall enough to showcase him, Abe felt a rumble. At first, Abe thought it was his stomach, so he squat down to grab a bus to munch on. Bending down low, Abe\u2019s ass spread out even wider, which were forced the nearby buildings on the street to be pushed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anthony couldn\u2019t believe what he saw right before him. That shy, manager, who was always being sneaky about getting extra food, was squatting right before him with the biggest ass that a human being could ever have. Anthony knew that Abe had potential, so he was glad that he was one of the couple people that he sent that pill bottle to. But, now, wasn\u2019t the time that discuss his plan with the man. With an opportunity to play with a man of that size, Anthony was not gonna waste it just staring. Moving his thick, bloated hand, Anthony smack the fat ass that he thought begged to be fucked by him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe was not a person you ever wanted to be interrupted while he was eating, snacking, or demolishing food. His old crew learned that the hard way, especially since they all ended up in his stomach as a result. Furious, Abe thrust his booty back and pushed back whatever small thing dared to touch him. From that point, Abe rose to his full height. He belly bumped his attacker, and continued to push on him till the guy fell to the ground. Once, Abe was on top of Anthony, his anger had finally calmed down. Not driven by rage-fueled adrenaline, Abe was surprised to Anthony, but more so when Anthony moved up and stuck his tongue down\u2019s Abe\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though softly to the rest fo the city was a deep boom that echoed over the rubble of where Abe had crushed buildings.  He looked into Anthony's big brown eyes and kissed him softly again.

The two lay there rubbing and groping at each other's big bodies, starting to make out while people fled for their lives from the two fat giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I gave you the pills to grow this big and only I know how to get more, I think you're mine, babe,\" Anthony grinned, pushing Abe off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe's huge body rolled off of Anthony's and crushed a shopping center and parking lot.  Anthony grunted and rose to his full height and then helped Abe up, smacking him on the ass again as he did so.  His huge hands just couldn't get enough of Abe's body now.

Being a man who was born with wide, lower body, Abe had always been forced to deal with hands \u201caccidentally\u201d brushing his ass. Narrow aisles and spaces at restaurants and bars made others interact with in unusual ways. His wide booty tended to squash people that he never seen behind him. Back at his smaller size, Abe used to just hold his tongue as he felt fingers linger longer than they should have, but now that Abe had become a giant, he refused to put up with any kind of sexual harassment any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this stranger moved his arm to put him around him, Abe slammed his belly forward. With all the tonnage that Abe was currently at, he felt like as if 10 wrecking balls had struck Anthony. It sent him flying across the city. He knocked down buildings as he struck them down with heavy belly. Before Anthony had a chance to get up, his view had turned dark. His gasp of surprise became muffled as this huge fleshy thing covered him from head to his chest. Anthony had enough experience playing with his own round mound of flesh that he knew that Abe was smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe was excited once he saw how much of his belly was covering his assaulter. His joy grew as he proceeded to pick up his belly, which was starting to expand from all the building he had recently eaten. Deafening thuds echoed in Anthony\u2019s ears as the gigantic belly smack him in the face repeatedly. Abe felt powerful playing this stranger that he never once questioned how this stranger was somehow the same size as him.

His arms and and legs were filling with more fat and strength as he grew, the legs smothering more of Anthony's belly.  Then Abe's ass started to grow and grow, falling off the sides of Anthony's belly and swallowed up his legs.  Abe was getting so big that he was pushing Anthony down into the ground into an Anthony-shaped crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-abe... p-please...\" Anthony grunted as he tried to use his own strength to push Abe off.  \"T-the... p-pills...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's arms were pinned underneath Abe's belly and thigh flab now so he couldn't lift the guy off of him.

He had managed to maneuver his arms low enough that he was able to punch at the big butt, but at the current size that they were compared to their tiny prisoner, all it did was make it worse for Anthony. All that movement forced the gigantic ass to wobble and smack Anthony in the face with the quivering rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly moments ago, it looked like they had been about the same height while only their weight distribution had been the only difference. Anthony had been proud of his belly has it was nice and full from all the food and employees that he filled it with to grow big. He was glad to give into his hunger along the waddle to meet Abe here as his now full belly was the only thing protecting him from becoming completely flattened under the man he had worked to grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Anthony, Abe must have looked and felt like he had grown to titanic size. Had he been able to view Abe, like some people sneaking a view from their windows, a couple blocks away, Anthony would have seen that Abe actually hadn\u2019t grown taller at all. The only growth that he had experience was in weight. All that eating that Abe had done was now affecting his entire body as his body became beefier.

They all stare at you, they're disgusted at themselves, but they think your a monster, you hate it. You decide to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't move...help me get up please.\" Anthony begs, faking struggling movements with his arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...we'll help you up.\" the biggest cop says. Anthony counts the cops, six, each at least six hundred pounds. God, this is a meal that'll fill him up quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Anthony starts, reaching out his hands, the two cops grab his arms and pull, the others put your arms over their shoulders and help you up, \"for the...meal.\" Anthony finishes menacingly, clenching his arms on top of the cops under his arms, knocking them unconscious. Yanking both heavy cops with his arms in a feat of strength and mouth size, both cops slowly slide down his throat, into his belly. They're guts putting up a large amount of resistance with them sliding down. The second largest, about eight hundred pounds, stumbles up from the blow of your elbow, and you grab him, you shove him into your mouth after the other two are down, and start pushing him deeper in your mouth. His shoulders are a struggle--he's built pretty strong--and his belly is a force to be reckoned with. Personally, Anthony thought he should have just let them go, but the looks the smaller ones gave him ticked him off, and once he ate the small once he <i>had</i> to eat the larger ones to avoid getting caught. The large cops belly finally pops into Anthony's mouth, leaving his legs kicking in a vain effort to escape Anthony's void of a belly. Anthony turns to the largest cop, hesitantly grabbing him and putting him to his lips. Anthony already feels so full, but he would know a knew definition of full after eating this cop. The largest cop's shoulders stretch Anthony's mouth to it's limits, the cop struggles to free himself, pushing against his cheeks, his belly is a bit smaller, but still takes a lot of effort. It sticks out from Anthony's lips, jiggling with the cop's movements to free himself. When it finally slides past his lips, his jiggling thighs are left kicking in the air, a last valiant effort to break free, but all was in vain, the last cop was eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh...hyurg...brah...\" Anthony mumbled, groaning in pain from how full he is. His belly is stretched to it's absolute limit, the skin starting to turn purple from being stretched so far. Stretch lines slowly made themselves known on his gut as the men struggle and kick inside of him, every kick sending coursing pain through Anthony's gut. His hands reach hurriedly down to ease the pain in his stomach, he caresses whatever parts of his gut he can reach--which is a fairly small area--and moans repeatedly in anguish. His belly is continuing to stretch, the men now working together to break out of their prison. The punches and kicks on the sides of Anthony's gut become stronger in magnitude, eventually, tears start blocking Anthony's vision, everything blurs, and his vision fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's eyes fly open--no crust glues his eyes closed this time--and immediately wipes his forehead of a cold sweat. His breathing was labored, and each breath felt even more difficult. He looked down on himself. He was growing, fast. His belly was titanic--literally. It looked to be the size of a cruise ship. His waist had long ago destroyed the walls of Belly Buster, his growing mass had become too much for it. His chest billowed outward over his gut, two mountainous sacks of flesh that had to be the size of his gut before he fell asleep. His ass was enormous--two spherical orbs of gelatinous flesh that wobbled and shook with literally every movement. His thighs were massive columns of flab that fed into his massive ass, each thigh slowly thickening to a size bigger than his ass cheeks, then flab folding over his kneecap. His calves folded over themselves multiple times--having become giant sacks of fat that overlap the back of his knee. He was hyperventilating. The weight of the fat on his stomach and chest was too much for his heart and lungs to handle. His breathing became more labored until it became quick exhales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic seized his mind and body, flailing in panic to try and breathe. Everything faded to black. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anthony attempts to move his arms--again futile, but only because of chains locking him onto the wall, he feels cold chains on his ankles, and every once in a while they brush his belly. Wait...his belly is at his feet!? Anthony looks at what he can of himself, he's absolutely massive! Every pound those cops weighed has jam packed itself onto you, and then some. Your belly looks like it could be a small home, and your nipples are roughly the size of a VW Bug. Your arms, while still mobile, are two massive sticks of fat that bend in the middle, folding over itself on contours in your elbow and forearm. He looks at the room he's in, a dark, almost dungeon like room, with tables holding books that could weigh as much as he did. Footsteps echo from the back of the room, and glossy heels echo against the ground. A rather curvy woman is slowly strutting up into your sight, wearing a flowing navy blue dress that seems to emanate a light all on it's own. Shiny black fingernails glint in the little bit of light there is the room, her eyes were shocking green, with small splotches of blue and brown within them. While Anthony was, and knew he was, gay, he couldn't help but feel some attraction towards the woman, like her entire body was a magnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I've introduced myself,\" the woman says, \"I'm Gwen, Weight Witchcraft Major.\" she holds out her hand in a handshake. Anthony moves his arm to shake her hand and chains clink against each other as it restricts his arm movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, that was just a precaution, allow me.\" Gwen says as her eyes glimmer with a pale blue light, the weight of the chains simply disappear from Anthony's arms. Anthony pulls his arms to in front of him and stares in awe, the chains didn't actually go away, they're molding into his flesh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, it's a compound spell, those chains will merely turn into more body fat, you wouldn't care, would you?\" Gwen says, her eyes back to their shocking green, her eyes widen as if she's giving a puppy face, and she gives a smile. Gray tinted teeth show themselves in her mouth, they're so close to a perfect white, but it's barely noticeable. Anthony studies her face closer, Gwen has long, curved eyelashes, and Anthony wonders how the woman can blink without her lashes becoming entangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what am I doing here?\" Anthony stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My humble dwelling,\" Gwen says with another warm smile, \"this is where I will put a curse on you...or it could be a blessing, depending on your state of mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlessing? Curse? Questions and guesses about what the spell could be whiz around Anthony's mind, what state of mind would he be in for it to be a blessing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the spell do?\" Anthony whispers, thinking out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time your body expels unnecessary gas, your body will gain twenty five pounds. Additionally, every effort you put into losing weight, makes you gain double what you <i>should</i> have lost, though the spell has a safety net: the spell changes your entire body so it can handle your weight, no worrying about immobility or heart attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...every time I fart or burp I gain 25 pounds, and if I was supposed to lose 25 pounds, I'd gain 50?\" Anthony confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you'll never be hindered by your size, unless it's getting into something, of course.\" Gwen says with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the spell already on me?\" Anthony questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it will take effect when I put you back where I got you from, feel free to expel any gas you have here.\" Gwen says, plugging her nose with a grin and a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...no thanks, but thanks for not...you know...killing me or something.\" Anthony says, slowly rising in a struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...<i>huff</i> you weren't kidding when you...<i>huff</i> the spell isn't working yet...<i>huff</i> were you?\" Anthony says, beads of sweat accumulating all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but goodbye, and good luck!\" Gwen says, her eyes flash that shocking pale blue again, and Anthony is suddenly in Belly Busters again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony is in a shock, he has a life time spell on him, starting now, to gain weight. His thinking about how huge he will become from the spell is interrupted by deep rumbling in Anthony's gut. Gas surges within him and flies out of his titanic butt. He feels himself grow heavier and moans in ecstasy as the painful pressure of the gas is relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...better...ooooohhh!\" Anthony is momentarily glad about the absence of gas when another powerful gas bubble forms inside him, painfully swelling his already massive gut. A massive belch thunders from Anthony's mouth, and even more weight piles itself onto him, after the titanic belch finishes, a dull pressure is felt inside of Anthony, gas swirling and intensifying slowly inside of Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be <i>urrrp</i> fucking huge by the end of the day!\" Anthony says, at this rate he's already gained 50 pounds, in what? A minute and a half? Anthony gets up and slowly makes his way to the door of Belly Busters, burping twice, and farting four times. Another 150 pounds. Anthony presses his gut into the door to open it.</span></div></div>",

Eyeing him carefully, Hank thought to himself, \u201cHmm\u2026 Even if he\u2019s a little scrawny, the little guy\u2019s kinda cute. I wonder what he would look like if he put some weight on these bones\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes gazing over the smaller man\u2019s body, Hank noticed that the tiny guy\u2019s stomach was peeking out from his sweater. He moved his hand to pull down the clothing. As he did this, Hank noticed how much bigger his hand was compared to the little man\u2019s body. As a 350 pound guy who stood at 6\u20195, Hank was used to towering over the customers at Belly Buster, but compared to some of his co-workers, he was on the smaller side. Up close and personal to this little man\u2019s stature, Hank felt a funny feeling rise up inside him. He had always like guys that were big like him, but there was something interesting to be compared as a giant to another guy. Hank\u2019s dominant side was starting to come out as he thought what he would do to this hot piece of man once he got him to his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as those thoughts were to appear, they left even quicker once Hank saw the smaller man\u2019s eyes flutter. He crotched low enough that both their faces were inches away. Once the smaller man\u2019s eyes were open, Hank gently asked, \u201cYou ok, little man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller guy answered, \u201cYeah\u201d, which he followed with a wide, bright smile. Seeing this, Hank felt passionate feelings for the man burn intensely inside his chest. That one smile made Hank feel as if he was a thousand feet tall and could take on any person in battle and win. Completely smitten with the man, Hank knew that he needed to keep him close by at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the incident earlier,\u201d Hank nervously started to say. \u201cI know that your meal was interrupted because of me, so why I don\u2019t I get you a voucher to eat here for free for a couple months\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the smaller man\u2019s deep brown eyes staring at him intently, Hank felt his confidence growing. He stood up to his full height of 6\u20195 as he continued, \u201cIf you need a job, I could hook up with one here. The boss and I are pretty close, so it could be arranged pretty quickly. Or, I could take you out to make up for tonight\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank felt confident that the little man was going to choose one of the options that he presented. He put his hands on his wrist as he waited for an answer. Looking down at the man, he noticed that his gut covered over half his body. He compared the size of his monster tank to the little man as he waited patiently in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the positive feelings surging in his body, Hank couldn\u2019t handle waiting for the little man to answer. He proceeded to nudge to the little man with the underside of this belly as he inquired, \u201cSo, what\u2019s it gonna be\u2026 Sorry, but what\u2019s name again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man pushed the belly away as he sat up to say, \u201cThe name\u2019s John, and I would \u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He bent his head down to look at the man he felt so smitten for. As he met the kind glaze that John\u2019s eyes gave off, Hank felt that nothing would be able to break complete attention that he had for the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a surprisingly low voice, John uttered softly, \u201cI think that it would be great to work at a place like this, especially if it means that I\u2019ll be able to see you more often.\u201d<br>\r\nA deep fluttering took place in Hank\u2019s heart once he heard John\u2019s words.

I can\u2019t wait,\u201d John said as he sat up and started to walk away. As he moved past Hank, John\u2019s hefty bum brushed against the giant sized man\u2019s left, wide thigh. Unable to contain his feelings any longer, Hank quickly turned around as he wrapped his arms around John and gave him the most passionate kiss he could muster. After some of the best couple seconds of his life, Hank broke away and stared into John\u2019s eyes as he waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being reciprocated enthusiasm, as he expected, Hank received a cold, silent look from the man who captured his eyes. \u201cHmmm\u201d muttered John as he broke away from Hank\u2019s hold of him. \u201cI guess you must\u2019ve thought that I\u2019m much quicker than I\u2019m actually am. Sorry that you have that impression of me. I\u2019m gonna leave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hank tried to stutter out an answer, John cut him off as he continued, \u201cBut I will be back to see you tomorrow for the job.

As he looked around the restaurant for John, the conversation that they had shared the night before replayed in his head over and over again. Hank\u2019s nerves started to creep up on him. It started with him fidgeting with his outfit. After he finally felt that he had correctly fitted his bow-tie, he begun to sample some of food that Head Chef made. He was halfway through a giant tray of mini-pizzas when John walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank\u2019s heart fluttered when he saw the 5\u20197 man outfitted in a white dress shirt and black dress pants. He waved to John as walked towards him. Hank was so focused on getting another close-up look at that adorable face that he forgot that he needed to be careful when he maneuvered his bulk while in the kitchen. Hank\u2019s hips and butt-cheeks knocked over 4 of his co-workers and random assortment of food as he rushed over to John. Caught up in his excitement over seeing the man, Hank grabbed and held the smaller man in the biggest bear hug that John ever experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his head resting on John\u2019s shoulder, Hank whispered into John\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled as Hank lowered him to the ground. As he softly patted Hank\u2019s round belly, John whispered back, \u201cYeah, I can tell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn leaned himself as far as had to in order to see past Hank\u2019s hefty size. Once he had a clear view past the love handles, John let out a low whistle. \u201cLooks like you made quite a mess,\u201d John said. \u201cHow about I clean this mess up for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn moved around Hank, and proceeded to pick up the random food that was on the floor. Hank\u2019s eyes focused on the smaller man\u2019s plump booty, and continued to follow it as it moved away from him. They grew real wide when John bent over, and his dress pants nicely showed off his assets. Hank let out a sigh of infatuation as he thought, \u201cA man that cute with a kind personality; where have you been all my life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank looked slightly above John\u2019s butt and into the eyes of Mark, a line chef, who was staring lustfully at John. Hank proceeded to look around the kitchen area, and noticed that all the men had the same feelings of lust towards John. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John watched as Billy's 4 foot butt shifted and pumped as he moved.  It certainly was an amazing sight to behold... He had to be at least 450 pounds, but John couldn't really estimate so well.  With Billy gone, John sat and looked around the restaurant.  He started to drift off in his thoughts about how weird this place was and how he may not really want to come back.  He did black out in the place after all...  Then as John was about to leave, he felt the floor shake and heard the deep THUD of Billy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant chef came out of the kitchen carrying huge, deep pans that were stacked with food.  He belched so thunderously that John's chest vibrated and he started to feel dizzy.  Billy took his seat again and set the trays on the table.  They were filled with beds of fries and burgers stacked high with toppings.  He grabbed a burger the size of John's head and took a massive, messy bite out of it.  Condiments and juice dripped out onto Billy's hand and plump chin as he chewed.  The man just smiled to John and started to munch on the fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good stuff.  When I started here,\" Billy said, swallowing, \"I was... 400 pounds?  Now I'm up over 550 just from my shift meals. This is my lunch, dude... Lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5...50?\" John stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, mmhm,\" Billy said, still eating.  \"But 550 is way too small.  I gotta be at least 700 before I consider myself fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... you gotta be kidding me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no!  In fact...\"</span></div></div>",

The poor thing groaned from the shifting mass and he ripped a deep fart that went on for a couple seconds.  He lowered himself down and the chair seemed to groan a little more.  There was a bit of a smell, but John tried to act cool.  Billy just started eating again, sweat starting to bead on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... sorry about that,\" Billy said, stuffing fries into his mouth a little faster now.  \"Just comes with the territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn reassured Billy and watched as the man tore through 4 massive burgers and well over 3 pounds of fries.  Billy leaned back in his chair and belched deeply.  He rubbed over his belly, staining his uniform with grease and ketchup as he did so.  The poor top looked ready to burst, but it wasn't the first to go.  No, the seam across the back of Billy's pants ripped loudly as John could swear he saw Billy grow.  Billy got up and turned around, asking John how bad the damage was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were shocking.  Billy's butt was big before, but now it was... getting massive!  Each cheek was far bigger than two of John's head and seemed to be expanding right in front of him.  The tear in the pants was getting wider as the butt spread bigger and pushed out further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Well...\"</span></div></div>",

You o.k.?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn responded with a low groan as his eyes refused to open themselves to the bright light that shined in the room.  He rubbed the sore bump that rested on the top of his head. He tried to raise himself up, but due to the fragile state that he was in, his body felt that the movement that John had done was too fast to comprehend. His heart pumped rapidly as his mind felt light headed.  The last thing that John thought before he fell back into a deep sleep was, \u201cDamn, that man is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                    *                         *                             *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank\u2019s mind went into frenzy when the man collapsed back down on the table. Just a little while ago, he was showing this customer where he could sit when he collide with his massive glutes. Hank was doing his job as the host of Belly Busters by showing the customer where his table was at when he felt something bump him. He turned around to see what had caused that soft pat on his rear, but there was nothing behind him. Confused, Hank speculated what touched him when he realized that the customer was gone. Thinking that the little man must\u2019ve not been hungry, Hank turned and walked away. After a couple of steps, he heard soft moans from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot again,\u201d moaned Hank. This was the third time that he had injured a customer at work, and with the previous two clients\u2019 complaints placing him on probation, Hank could not risk the unconscious man reporting to his boss, Dixon, this incident. In order to keep his position as the host of this restaurant, Hank started thinking of a way to keep this accident a secret.  Luckily, there weren\u2019t that many people to see what had happened. The lack of witnesses allowed for Hank to think for a moment of how to fix this dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it,\u201d Hank whispered to himself. Since it was later in the afternoon, there weren\u2019t that many people eating at Belly Busters, which resulted in less of his coworkers being around. With amount of food that was still left in the buffet, no one would be going down to the basement. Now that he had the perfect place to hide the unconscious man, Hank would be able to move him down there immediately. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many of the patrons were too fixated on the delicious food to notice that a giant marshmallow of a man that was waddling like a mad man through the restaurant. It seemed like no one was going to notice the unconscious John. Everything was going smoothly with this plan for Hank. All he had to do avoid the citation that could lead to his termination were the narrow halls that lead to the basement. It was tough to go past these openings by himself, but with a person in his arms, the problem had intensified. It did not matter to Hank that he faced problems getting to and out of this basement every day at work because this tiny space was all that stood between him in keeping his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the petite space between the walls, Hank took a deep breath as he walked down the hall. His heavy steps echoed through the halls. The noise of the kitchen and his footsteps were dulled by the heat beats that were thumping fast and loud. All of Hank\u2019s concentration was getting down in the basement that he did not notice that the bus boy, named Andy, was coming towards him from the kitchen exit to his right. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the sound of wheels\u2019 squeaking became louder, desperation set in. Without care, Hank impulsively decided to implement the next idea that popped in his head. Taking a deep breath, he opened his mouth, and started to stuff the guy into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was used to stuffing his face, this plan was proving to be difficult. The lifelong treatment of cramming massive amount of food into his mouth hadn\u2019t prepared him for the 234 pound man dangling from his mouth. Hank aggressively pushed the unconscious customer into his mouth, but each time he tried, John\u2019s lower half of his body slide out. \u201cAw, snap!\u201d Hank thought to himself. \u201cMaybe this wasn\u2019t a good ide-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud squeaky wheels had turned into a screeched.

He stood still waiting to see if Rick was going down the hallway he was standing in. Once he heard the muttered cursing of the Rick as he cleaned the mess that was made, Hank sighed in relief. At least he tried to, but John was still dangling from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a deep breath, Hank shoved John\u2019s legs as far as he could into his mouth. He grunted in frustration as the legs continued to slide back out of his mouth. Letting the legs drop, Hank decided to go an alternate route to fulfill his plan. Moving his hands up, he grabbed John\u2019s butt, and pushed from there. Even with a firm grip on the beefy buns, Hank still faced trouble. \u201cDid this guy really have to be so freaking bottom heavy?\u201d questioned Hank. \u201cIt looked big from afar, but the size of this thing is ridiculous,\u201d Hank said as tried to move the beefy ass into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to not get fired, Hank took a nice long inhale from his nose as he opened his mouth bigger than it was already was. As his jaw continued to go lower, Hank stuffed more and more of John into his mouth. Using his wide tongue to maneuver the pear-shaped man, he got a distinct taste of him. Hank thought about the favor of John for a brief second, but brushed it aside to focus on his plan. After a few seconds, John was finally crammed into Hank\u2019s mouth. Placing his hands on his hips, Hank thought to himself, \u201cThis plan is gonna work. All I gotta do is walk past Andy and then hide the guy out in the alley. Nothing can go wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No matter how terrible the situation was, the circular motion of his hands on his gargantuan gut constantly managed to bring him back to his happy place. It was better than a handful of chocolate chip cookies, especially if the belly rub came after the sugary snack. \u201cGod, that would be so good right now, Hank thought to himself. \u201cI could really go for some cookies. Maybe a few slices of pie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank\u2019s thoughts continued to drift towards the gluttony of sugary treats as he walked down the hall. In his thoughts of quenching the quivering feeling deep within his stomach, Hank did not focus on being careful while walking down the hall. His carelessness made him forget about the situation he had gotten himself into that when he turned the corner, Hank bumped into Rick and his cart of food. The collision of Hank\u2019s gut and Rick\u2019s scrawny body shoved the tiny waiter so hard that Rick and his cart was shoved against the wall. The crash between the cart and wall made the all the food that was being carried to fly towards the two employees of Belly Buster.

His mind raced with different ideas with how this could be possible. There was no way that a person should be able to do what he did a few minutes ago, but there he was, with a 234 pound man curled up in his stomach. In order to appease his mind from becoming a neurotic mess, Hank\u2019s hands instinctive moved towards his enlarged gut. Without even thinking about it, they started to rub his belly. With each circular motion, Hank\u2019s mind became calm enough to notice the mess he made when his gut collided with Rick and the cart of food that he was pushing. \u201cGoddamn\u201d, exclaimed Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, Hank said. \u201cThis mess is gonna take forever to clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that; I\u2019m talking about this!\u201d Rick stated as he touched Hank\u2019s stuffed gut. Rubbing the bloated belly with his hand, Hank\u2019s eyes grew bigger as he continued to examine his co-worker\u2019s abdomen. Due to his 6\u20194 stature, Hank was fortunate to look over his bloated body to see the smaller Rick coop a feel on him. He started to panic as Rick continued his inappropriate touching, but all these uneasy feeling started to transform into a pretty nice one. In fact, Hank started to enjoy the circular motion that was generating a calming fuzzy feeling in him. He closed his eyes and bent his neck backwards as he let out a soft sigh of content.

Before either man had a chance to say another word, Hank\u2019s belly shook again. In an effort to stop the vibrations that his belly generated throughout his entire body, he grabbed his belly. With each hand on each side, Hank grinned sheepishly at Rick, or at least he tried to as a loud burp escaped through his mouth. Rick stared back at his giant of a co-worker with mixture of disbelief and disgust. An odd feeling tingled down Rick\u2019s spine as he tried to guess what exactly was going on with the biggest employee of Belly Buster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange, gurgling noise emitted from Hank\u2019s swollen middle. Rick was already freaked out by the entire situation, but with the weird sounds that Hank\u2019s digestive system was making, this entire situation was getting to be too much for scrawny college sophomore. He slowly backed away from his larger co-worker as he watched him bend over in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat started to drip down Hank\u2019s face. He gripped his extended tummy with both hands. Hank\u2019s face grimaced in pain as he experienced the battle that was going on between his digestive system and John. The Belly Buster customer had finally gained his consciousness, and was trying to escape the cramp, fleshy prison that held him captive. All of the movement that was occurring on the inside was making all of Hank\u2019s stomach mass to jiggle wildly; none of which was escaping Rick\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain that the captive was causing Hank was becoming too much for the larger man. Desperate to relive the tension, Hank decided to treat the smaller man like a dish that he would force himself to eat even though he knew he was stuffed. Hank started to have his stomach muscles squeeze all the food that was inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith John being the biggest food inside, he tried to push Hank\u2019s belly away. At first, John thought that he had a chance as he held off Hank\u2019s belly off with his arms and legs, but after a while, the pressure was too much for his weakened body to handle. Even if John had spent 5 days a week weight lifting at the gym, no amount of bodybuilding would had stood a chance against Hank\u2019s lifelong training of finishing that last plate of flood even after body had been full several plates ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last push, Hank let out a soft moan as managed to silence the person that his belly held captive. Straightening up to his impressive height of 6\u20194, Hank towered over the skinny man, who was shocked over the spectacle he had witnessed before his eyes. As he watched Hank rub his enlarged gut with a satisfied grin on his face, Rick worked up the courage to ask his co-worker what the hell was going on. Before he managed to get a word out of his mouth, Hank broke the silence with a burp that burst out of his chubby face. \u201cDamn!\u201d exclaimed Hank as he followed that ear-shattering burp with a couple more that size. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that well, Rick. You mind covering the rest of my shift for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rick was able to give his response, Hank turned around and started to waddle towards the exit that lead out to the alley. Unable to understand what had just taken place, Rick wrote it up to be a bad case of indigestion. He muttered to himself, \u201cBetter stay away from the chef\u2019s special today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
