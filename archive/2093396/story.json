You rise from your bed, stretching your arms as you do so. Time to get ready for the day. You stand up to stretch, but in doing so you notice that your door is locked. That's normal. What isn't normal is that the doorknob has a keyhole on the doorknob, like it locks from the other side. You walk up to it and try to twist the knob, but it fails to budge. You're gonna have to call a locksmith...or an exorcist. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you glance at your bed to notice another strange thing: there aren't any sheets, pillows, or blankets on it! That is definitely odd considering that you know for a fact you had those when you went to bed! What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you move to your closet to open it and put on some clothes, but you can't. It won't budge. This is especially odd because your closet doesn't have a lock of any kind. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this makes no sense. Your bed is empty, your door and closet are impossibly locked. Wait a second...look at this room...there's nothing here! Besides the bed that you woke up on, there's nothing in your room! What in the name of Sam Hill is going on? Looking around, your eyes catch the glint of something under your bed. Crawling on your knees, you see there is a large black trunk under your bed, and you pull it out. It had a large, intimidating-looking padlock on the front keeping you from opening it, and a note taped to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Mr. Cobb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may be wondering where exactly your possessions are.

The costume barely covers your naked butt, but you slip it on regardless. You stand there, a grown man in a very poorly fitting woman's costume for a few moments, before you notice something odd. Is the room...growing larger? You look down and realize that the opposite is true: you are shrinking. That's not the only thing you notice. You brush your growing hair out of your eyes as you stare at your skin. It's becoming softer, the hue changing subltly. You can't seem to feel any of the changes as they happen, only by looking down are you noticing your thinner waist, your growing hips, your expanding breasts. Before you can really register what's happened, it's over. Maybe you should look yourself over, see what's changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, ready to see what exactly just happened to you. You try and steady yourself, still not acclimated to your new body, and look down. Before you can really take note of anything, a lock of long black hair falls into view. What? You've always had brown hair, not black! You touch it, and it feels soft and silky in your hands. Speaking of which, your hands look a lot smaller than before, and your nails are longer. You hesitate at calling them <i>feminine</i>, if only because you're not ready to accept that yet. You touch your face, and it's clear your nose is much smaller, like a button nose. Your lips are the only thing on your face that haven't shrunk, they're slightly larger than you're used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down, to your neck, and freeze when you realize you don't feel an Adam's apple at your throat. There's...no way. You can't just...change like that, can you? Realizing you might as well get on with the inevitable, you lower your hands to your chest. You find what you feared: breasts. They're not exceptionally large, in fact they're a little small. <span class=\"cviolet\">I guess it fits your small stature,</span> you think. <span class=\"cviolet\">Though you do wish they were a little...larger. Why did you get stuck with mosquito bites?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? Since when would you want larger breasts? Until today, you didn't have breasts, period! Maybe this transformation is affecting your brain too...<span class=\"cviolet\">Well, you still need to figure out the rest of this change, right? You haven't looked over your whole body yet.</span> Yeah, that's right. You move your hands down, further, to your waist. It's definitely smaller around than it used to be, but your stomach is mostly unchanged. The only difference there is it went from an average guy stomach to a <span class=\"cviolet\">cute, girly stomach.</span> Your hands keep wandering south, feeling around your hips. They didn't shrink nearly as much as the rest of you, which means that with your smaller frame they come off as a little bit wide, giving you a slight hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more masculine part of you can't wait anymore, and you reach around to grope your butt. It's definitely a little bit bigger than it used to be, but for a girl it's not really that big. <span class=\"cviolet\">Maybe if you eat more, you can work up to a sexy bubble-butt!</span> Of course, that would mean being in this body for quite a while. <span class=\"cviolet\">But...that doesn't sound too bad.</span> You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts. There's really only one thing left to check. You pat your crotch a few times, and it's clear that your old equipment is gone. You are 100% female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around in a circle, trying to get a full look at the new you. As far as you can tell, you're the spitting image of Maya Fey. How did this happen to you? <span class=\"cviolet\">Maybe it was some kind of crazy new super-drug! Or magic! Or aliens!</span> Or...maybe it was whoever took all your stuff. Maybe you should check that note again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Mr. Cobb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you've noticed your new power, eh? Now, whenever you try to wear clothing that doesn't fit you, you'll change to fit the clothing! Right now you're stuck as little Maya Fey; not even wearing other clothing will change you back. If you want your stuff and your original body, you need to get yourself to the convention near your apartment complex, and win first place in the Cosplay Contest. The prize is a key that unlocks this box. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nContract Providers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.S. Be careful with your choices from now on. Stray thoughts about how you'd like to change can easily become a reality. All further changes will make your mind slip further and further into the Maya persona. If you fall too far before getting the key, there will be dire consequences.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the note change? You've been in the room the entire time, it hasn't moved, and no one has come in. <span class=\"cviolet\">You guess magic must be the answer, right?</span> Regardless, you need to get to the convention. If the times for the events are anything like what they were last time you were there, the competition should be starting soon!</span></div></div>",

The first thing that happens is an immediate loss of weight, his fat disappearing until he is actually a more healthy weight. He also starts to shrink, not stopping until he is around your height. Then, his black hair turns bright red, lengthening out, and curling into a wavy hairdo. Some of the fat he has lost reappears on his chest and backside as large breasts and a bubble-butt.

You had bought it for your girlfriend, back when you were dating, although you can't remember if she'd worn it to any cons or costume parties. This mysterious \"Contract Provider\" can't really expect you to wear something like this, right? This was ridiculous! Still, you can't leave your apartment naked. With the local convention, maybe people won't give you too many mocking looks. Men dress up as sailor scouts and princesses all the time at those things, just for laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelenting, you push your way into the poofy dress. Its hard to zip up the back, but you manage to stuff yourself into the costume. The dress is long enough that it covers your entire body, although your hairy legs are still visible. You're just a little too tall for this thing and you look absurd. Yet soon, something odd happens. Is the room...growing larger? You look down and realize that the opposite is true: you are shrinking. That's not the only thing you notice. You brush your growing hair out of your eyes as you stare at your skin. It's becoming softer, the hue changing subltly. You can't seem to feel any of the changes as they happen, only by looking down are you noticing your thinner waist, your growing hips, your expanding breasts. Before you can really register what's happened, it's over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of blonde hair fall over your eyes again and its only when you push it aside that you recognize the oddity of this. You've always had brown hair, not a bright blonde! Its soft and silky in your hands, which you also realize are smaller than ever before. You pull off your white gloves for a closer look and find  dainty hands with long nails. Your gaze moves to the mirror, to examine your new face in detail. A much smaller, softer face looks back at you. Long blonde hair, with lengthy eyelashes for your wide eyes. You spy traces of eyeshadow, blush, and even pink lipstick for your bigger lips. Almost your entire body has shrunk into this <span class=\"cppink\">cute body.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading to see what you find, you feel your hips and chest for any change. Just as you feared, your hips have expanded and you've grown breasts. And if you had to wager, certain other body parts had completely vanished. You're very reluctant to touch anything else, but you feel your chest and lower body experimentally, to try and get some kind of understanding. Your chest is rather average-sized, <span class=\"cppink\">but it helps your figure look as hourglass-like as it does.</span> Your butt and hips, on the other hand, are quite large and impressive, <span class=\"cppink\">although its mostly the dress. Its supposed to make you look flattering, of course. Beneath all this, your figure is a little more demure.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin around in the circle, <span class=\"cppink\">watching the dress twirl around you.</span> All these observations have confirmed what you suspected: you are now the splitting image of Princess Peach. <span class=\"cppink\">At least the dress looks much more natural on you. You'd hate to draw too much attention to yourself.</span> But how on earth did this happen? Some kind of magic spell, or curse? You return to the note, desperate to find some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Mr. Cobb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you've noticed your new power, eh? Now, whenever you try to wear clothing that doesn't fit you, you'll change to fit the clothing! Right now you're stuck as Princess Peach; not even wearing other clothing will change you back. If you want your stuff and your original body, you need to get yourself to the convention near your apartment complex, and win first place in the Cosplay Contest. The prize is a key that unlocks this box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are, of course, other methods of solving the trial and we're curious to see if you manage to find them. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nContract Providers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.S. Be careful with your choices from now on. Stray thoughts about how you'd like to change can easily become a reality. All further changes will make your mind slip further and further into the Peach persona. If you fall too far before getting the key, there will be dire consequences.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this is just downright baffling. They want you to go through all these tests? What for? How did they even manage something like this? Maybe you should head to the Cosplay Contest, it might be the only clue you've got.</span></div></div>",

You kept pestering her to go to a con together, but you can\u2019t quite recall if you ever did. <i>That probably had something to do with the breakup, honestly.</i> One of the last arguments you had with her was that she should be glad that you didn\u2019t get the post-timeskip costume. The memory sends an involuntary cringe up your spine \u2014 That wasn\u2019t really the best note to end a relationship on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkward reminiscing aside, your promised way out of the room doesn\u2019t look promising. A powder-blue babydoll shirt, jean shorts, and accompanying underwear. You rub your forehead in irritation. Who were these weird Contract Providers, and why did they want you to crossdress? This could be some prank by your friends, if you had anyone with a predilection to stripping you in your sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick the black box in frustration, stubbing a toe by accident. As you hop around a bit in pain, you notice something odd. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to directly open it. No keyhole, no card reader, no nothing. You spend a bit of time investigating it \u2014 because at least it doesn\u2019t involve you crossdressing \u2014 but you can\u2019t find any way to open it. You even spend a bit of time laying on your stripped bed, hoping that this stupid prank\u2019d be over, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you approach the closet. You feel around the inside of the clothes \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any clothes-based traps inside. Do you <i>really</i> want to dress up in these and get some laughs from these tricksters? Your stomach answers you with a surprisingly loud growl. You heave a sigh into the closet. <i>No time like the present, I guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most annoying part about the costume is getting the bra on. Getting it off was never your forte, but having to bend your arms backward was another can of worms. You eventually resort to clasping it in the front and spinning it around \u2014which is more difficult than it sounds, considering your frame. The shorts are tight in the legs but loose in the back, creating a brand new sense of discomfort, and you don\u2019t even want to get started on the panties\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll decked out in your cosplay purchase, you stride over to the door barefooted, ready to face humiliation. You grasp the doorknob\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t turn. What the hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start banging on the door. \u201cHey! I did your weird pervert shit! Now <span class=\"corange\">let me out of</span>\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough a bit as your voice cracks. <i>Great, way to undermine me, larynx.</i> Now you weren\u2019t getting let out, your legs felt like they were falling asleep, you\u2019re getting a wedgie, and the doorknob looks highe \u2014 Wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your floor, and the sight shocks you. A wave of pale skin seems to be creeping up your legs, having already shrunk your bare feet into dainty replicas. It\u2019s already up to your mid-thighs, converting muscly bumps into smooth pale skin. You reach a shaking hand down to touch it\u2026 but a fringe of orange entering your vision stops that. <br>\r\nIn your surprise you let out a <span class=\"corange\">high pitched</span> scream and fall on your butt. Did you fall on a pillow? <i>{No,</i> you realize belatedly, paling at the implication. The sense of pins and needles enters your shoulders, treating you to the lovely sound of your bones popping and snapping into a newer, slimmer shape. You close your eyes as the wave reaches your chest, filling your bra cups to a <span class=\"corange\">respectable size.</span> Your breaths halts as your waist caves in, going from square to a <span class=\"corange\">nice hourglass.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your eyes closed for a bit, until you\u2019re fully confident that the pins and needles have faded. And, honestly you didn\u2019t want to see what happened to you, because you have a pretty good guess. You eventually relent, and open your eyes to exactly what you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re definitely shorter now, if the height of the door is anything to compare by. But, as a quick look down reveals that the height certainly wasn\u2019t taken from your legs. Three feet of muscle and fat compacted by smooth skin\u2026 <span class=\"corange\">They really were your best feature.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand across your now-foreign body, you see that all angular parts of your body have been replaced with a soft roundness. Feeling your face, the square jaw you once had now tapers to a gentle point. Your hips are certainly wider than before, but any presuppositions to their size were mostly formed by a comparison to your waist. <i>I\u2019ve seen <b>models</b> with larger stomachs!</i> At the very least, your new boobs and ass weren\u2019t too big. You internally thank yourself for not purchasing the post-timeskip costume. But, on the other hand, <span class=\"corange\">you\u2019d probably gain weight there first, so it\u2019s a win win!</span> Wait, would it? Ugh, your head was killing you, and it might have something to do with the countless adjustments to your skeletal structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally standing up \u2014 and wincing as your jean shorts dug into your soft thighs \u2014 you notice a note taped onto your door. That definitely wasn\u2019t there last five minutes ago, right? Ripping it off the door, you read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dear Mr. Cobb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you've noticed your new power, haven\u2019t you? Whenever you try to wear clothing that doesn't fit you, you'll change to fit the clothing. However, you are now locked into the form of Nami; not even wearing other clothing will change you back. If you want your belongings and your original body, you need to unlock the black box. To do so, you must approach it with at least $2,000, in three days at most. Of course, you have no ID, nor documentation, but that is part of the challenge. There is a convention near your complex holding a cosplay contest, and first prize does award you the requisite amount of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are, of course, other methods of solving the trial and we're curious to see if you manage to find them. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nContract Providers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.S. Be careful with your choices from now on. Stray thoughts about how you'd like to change can easily become a reality. All further changes will make your mind slip further and further into Nami\u2019s persona. If you fall too far before getting the key, there will be dire consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.P.S. Just so this box isn\u2019t unlocked by any miscreant coming in with a wad of cash, your door will now open for you exclusively. You can let other people in of course. There is also a small gift for you outside your door, free of charge. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crinkle your brow in frustration. What gave these people the right to mess around with someone\u2019s life like this? Making two thousand dollars in two days? The best that minimum wage could pay was a two hundredth of that? And you had to do it all barefoot? All these indignant thoughts and more surged through your head as you stomp over to the door, ignoring the answering jiggle in your lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you slam open the door, a brown, nondescript shoebox sits in front of you. <i>This better be two thousand dollars,</i> you angrily think. Ripping off the top of it, you reveal\u2026 some stupid strappy sandals? Your mouth hangs open in shock. Was this the only advantage you\u2019d get? Was this the onl\u2014 <span class=\"corange\">Wait, were those Louis Vuitton?</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly <span class=\"corange\">squeal in delight</span> as you strap the sandals on. God, these were, what, a thousand dollars brand new? You take a few appraising steps, taking a small amount of enjoyment from finally being able to wear shoes. (<span class=\"corange\">And the small sway they add to your step.</span>) You strike a few poses, too, for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasp the doorknob out of your apartment, your confidence renewed somewhat. However, you did have a few choices on what to do next. Did you want to go to that con? Or did you want to go to that <i>weird</i> \u2018restaurant\u2019 nearby? They were probably looking for \u2018talent\u2019 on short notice\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you've never danced much before, and being sexy on-stage? <span class=\"corange\">Well, actually, you're pretty amazing at being sexy in general, aren't you? But still, seeing how the pros do it will give you a firmer place to start.</span> So, you walk over to an unoccupied table, of which their are many at this time of day, and you watch the show. If you still were a guy, you're sure these dancing women, strutting their stuff and disrobing for everyone to see, would be turning you on like crazy. <span class=\"corange\">But it seems as Nami that's doing nothing for you, as all you can really do is appreciate the craft they're doing on a technical level, and observe their bodies as technically attractive, with no reaction to your own sex drive.</span></span></div></div>",

She takes one look at you and gives a half laugh. \u201cDamn, you kind of look like a character from a...show that I watch.\u201d You laugh internally at the fact she doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s an anime, and at the fact you found a fellow weeaboo at the strip club, working as a dancer. <span class=\"corange\">Though honestly, the idea of spending hundreds of hours of your precious time in front of a television for some cartoons is sounding less and less appealing by the second. After all, looking this good, there are much better things you could be doing.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy does your make-up, which doesn\u2019t take much considering your natural beauty, then helps you get out of your clothes. <span class=\"corange\">Any expected embarrassment of being naked in front of her doesn\u2019t even come to you, being nude in front of another girl doesn\u2019t seem odd at all.</span> For your first time up, she recommends something pretty easy: a cowgirl outfit. It\u2019s pretty simple, just a tiny top that shows off a lot of cleavage and will come off with no effort, and a pair of daisy dukes that might was well be painted on you. Under the top is no bra at all, just some pasties, and there\u2019s no underwear down below either. <span class=\"corange\">The idea is pretty sexy, honestly, but not as sexy as how much money you\u2019re going to make doing this. Oh, yeah, and some of that can go towards turning back to normal, you guess.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... the small D.va bodysuit and weird headphones that you had bought for your (former) girlfriend a while back. It had gone unused since then \u2014 and, honestly, it was probably some sort of catalyst for your breakup. The suit was covered with various faux brands and garishly bright pink and blue highlights. You gave the costume an experimental tug \u2014 it was stretchy, but was it enough for you to fit in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try the doorknob again. To your dismay, it was still locked tight. You easily lug the trunk over onto your bed, hoping that maybe you could find some clothes in there. Unfortunately, it's locked tight as the door. Your mind races as disasters sweep through your head. What if you had to walk around in this stupid costume? If it was a dress or something, that'd be easy to pass off as some sort of lost bet, but with that costume framing every part of you? You'd probably be arrested for indecent exposure in two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other option, you hesitantly start to put the costume on. Luckily, there was a zipper in the front and a small leotard included with the costume. It certainly wasn't flattering, but any amount of padding you could put between your manhood and the costume was a small blessing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to shrug yourself into the costume and zip it up, much to the protest of 'Little Bryan'. You turn to the door, your mind half filled with dread, and the other half resigned to its fate.  Hopefully the weird-ass 'Contract Providers' would at least let you eat some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you reach for the doorknob, your hand seems a little... smaller than before. You bring it up to your face to examine, but then the whole room seems to grow around you! You stand still, frozen in shock. Did those Providers drug the suit or something? What if you were poisoned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the swaying and growing of the room came to a stop, and a weird pressure manifested itself on various parts of your body. You look down as your hips and rear gradually tease outwards from your body, and two accompanying orbs bulge out on your chest. But before you can take stock of all the ongoing changes, everything stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to scream in terror, before a curtain of brown <span class=\"cmagenta\">lavender-scented</span> hair falls down in your face. You pull a strand of it in front of your face. For some reason, the scent calms you down enough to have you take stock of your changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down reluctantly, already knowing what you\u2019re going to see down there. Distressingly accurate to your prediction, two orbs dominate the real estate of your chest. You timidly hoist one up, trying your best to ignore the small sensation of pleasure that goes with it. You even out the examination with an appraising grope of your rear. Sure enough, it\u2019s a bit bigger than it was before, your newly-daintyfied hands only able to sink into each newly enlarged cheek, unable to fully grasp it. Still, though, there\u2019s a looseness in the suit\u2019s chest and hips that brings you a sense of relief. It\u2019s not as drastic as it could be \u2014 <span class=\"cmagenta\">though it is kinda disappointing...</span><br>\r\nYou bring up a hand to your face, feeling around your new features. Huh, seems that you have the little whiskers-things painted on. <span class=\"cmagenta\">That was nice of them.</span> You look askance around the room, licking your slightly plumped lips nervously \u2014 <span class=\"cmagenta\">Mmm, strawberry flavored, nice!</span> Your eyes catch on the trunk that you placed on your bed. It looks like there\u2019s a piece of paper underneath it that you didn\u2019t see before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to shift the wooden container, frustratingly enough. Ugh, would it be that much trouble to let you keep your strength? <span class=\"cmagenta\">Well, too many muscles wouldn\u2019t look good for the whole look you had going...</span> You shake your head, this weird set of circumstances must be getting to you somehow. But after a good deal of huffing and puffing, you finally are able to get the piece of paper underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Mr. Cobb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you've noticed your new power, eh? Now, whenever you try to wear clothing that doesn't fit you, you'll change to fit the clothing! Right now you're stuck as Hana Song; not even wearing other clothing will change you back. If you want your stuff and your original body, you need to get yourself to the convention near your apartment complex and win first place in the Cosplay Contest. The prize is a key that unlocks this box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are, of course, other methods of solving the trial and we're curious to see if you manage to find them. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nContract Providers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.S. Be careful with your choices from now on. Stray thoughts about how you'd like to change can easily become a reality. All further changes will make your mind slip further and further into the D.va persona. If you fall too far before getting the key, there will be dire consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.P.S. It seems that the auto-integration nature of your transformation may have shifted some things around your perceptual zone. We have done you the favor of leaving you a laptop if you wish to research. But we must stress that the previous warning still applies.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try the doorknob hesitantly, half expecting to transform into something else. But to your relief, it opens easily. Sure enough, as you peek your head out, you catch sight of a smooth black computer resting on your table. But did you really want to follow the advice of the weirdos who changed you? Or did you want to go through this a different way?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
