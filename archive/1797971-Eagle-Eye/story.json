The ring is gold all over and shaped as an Eagle's claw which is palming a small crystal inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't lose this now either, now where's that bus......\" - Cole stops as he's tripped up by the uneven sidewalk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring goes flying into the air and lands on the street during traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO!\" - Cole yells<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs over, umbrella in hand and tries to spot his ring, but the rain pouring down on the light grey colored street makes it a bit difficult for him to see anything. Then looking over at the traffic and he waits for a lull to come. He then resumes his search and spots it in the middle of the street. It landed on the center divider lane and he spots it throughout the mucky rain drenched road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA! Ugh, damn it!\" - Cole says annoyed. Looking over the road, he makes his break. The red light down the street signals everyone to stop and then Cole makes his move:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping forward he runs out when few cars and few and away behind him and reaches out for the ring. In one motion, he grabs it and makes a dash to the end of the street with the sidewalk 5 or so seconds before a car comes close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he trips on his shoe thanks to the weather and lands on the road on his chest. The visibility and bad wipers of the oncoming car makes it hard for her to see Cole out on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!\" - Cole screams trying to get up mere inches away from the car as it begins to swerve away but it's too late<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b><br>\r\n============================================================================ ===============<br>\r\n</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole is frozen in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes closed, he opens them to find himself standing out in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the?!\" - Cole says looking around his surroundings. Everything is black and white and frozen in time, including the rain droplets. He waves a hand and brushes past the surrounding water droplets in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?!\" - Cole looks behind him onto the ground and jerks back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands in the center of a large glowing black and purple glyph shaped as a malformed skull. The dark energies surround him then he takes notice of his ring as the crystal inside it emminates some of that dark energy as well.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"><i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\".........cole.......\"</font></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?!

What kind of artifact is this?! Something evil?!\" - Cole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"><i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Your ancestors used the dark arts to manipulate phenomenon. An extremely dangerous art in order to prevent wars, disease and other unfortunate circumstances. These dark arts were shunned upon because perfecting them and the crystals in the ring would take centuries to fully become usable. Now that you've triggered it's power, the power to alter reality is finally perfected and now rests in your hands. In order to keep my power from waning, increased use of my power must be regularly used. However whether you use this for good or evil is up to you, but be aware of the consequences should this fall into the wrong hands. I only act as a mediary and I have no conscience, only the user does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with my power to bend reality, you are given a secondary ability to slow down time exactly where you are now, In this limbo. People here have slowed to 1/1000 the accentuated speed, and because you are in this state, you can not die, be starved for food, needing to dispel wastes or age. You can freely travel anywhere you want, and then return everything to normal using the ring. Insert your finger and concentrate to what kind of alteration you want and it will happen. You can also teleport anywhere this way by thinking of the location as long as you have a clear picture of what the location looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must dispel from you, I must have your vow. Will you accept the contract and continue use of my abilities.

Also the car that was to hit him passes by in complete control. Also the small group of people who watched Cole jump into the street seem to go about their own business including the people beside Cole walking past him as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole looks down and notices the ring is on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's like it never happened.\"</i> - Cole thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his walk to his bus stop, the rain begins to pour fiercely this time, annoying Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alter reality huh? If that really was real, then I should do something about this storm.\" - Cole thinks to himself.

No even one minute later, the skies begins to clear away into bright blue skies. The people beside Cole take notice and do a small cheer that the rain ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well now.\" - <span class=\"cred\">Cole</span> smiles then folds his umbrella and runs to a section of the city where it's less populated. Turning a corner, he plants his finger into the ring and focuses on his LA apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a flash, Cole blinks then finds himself two feet next to his own apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I got to get used to the flash, but this is AMAZING!!!\" - Cole grins then unlocks his door and enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole enters, removes his coat and umbrella and shoes and enters the living room and plops down onto the couch. With a continued grin of his new power he raises an arm high to look at the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're early to come home.\" - <span class=\"cteal\">came a voice from the corner</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the corner was Cole's little sister Jade. She's the total definition when it comes to 'Goth'. Cole assumes it's just a phase in her life. She's fifteen, very intelligent and mature for her age. Somewhat short, decent figure, average bust size, long straight black hair dyed in blue green streaks, heavy makeup around her eyes, dark blue green lipstick. She wears a black and violet dress/corset with gold embroidery, black and white striped long stockings, black and white striped sleeves, dark violet painted fingernails, no piercings except her earrings on her left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was sitting in the corner barefoot with her striped stocking, caressing Cole's small black kitty Pepper and brushing her fur. Jade is pretty attached to Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, did you finally get lucky today? I can easily read that happy grin of your face.\" - <b><span class=\"cteal\">Jade</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you could say that.\" - <b><span class=\"cred\">Cole says</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you finally got suckered some poor girl into liking you!\" - <b><span class=\"cteal\">Jade smirks while brushing Pepper</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" -<span class=\"cred\"><b> Cole turns to her confused partially not paying attention to her</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her name?\" -  <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Jade</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...

From the looks of it, the clothes are fitted to his own roundish frame, the stockings, Jade's dress and striped undershirt and sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts Pepper down and reaches for his head and feels long straight hair down to his back exactly like Jade's hairstyle. He also can feel the Eagle ring as one of Jade's left earrings which seems to fit him as a head accessory now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm Jade.

At first he didn't even recognize her because she wears a lot of makeup, but here she has no makeup on her face and her hair has been styled exactly in the way Cole's hair was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looks at the changed Jade, several feelings wash over him. Looking at the girl, he feels nothing but worry and fear for the person sitting on the couch and it starts tying his stomach in knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm feeling her emotions. I was right all along. She's scared for me and I don't even feel any hatred for that person. She would never hate me. I was stupid to even think she would hate me.

Cole gets a close up appearance of his changed sister and even though they both look ridiculous, he feels he has no reason to laugh. these are Jade's own eyes and she see's her brother even though Cole's mind is clearly himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the goth Cole speaks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please understand.

You practically ARE one.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade</b></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Jade's feelings going <i>'yeah real funny dude</i>':<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.

You remember you ARE your sister again as you look down to see the Spider wardrobe completely misworn against your roundish frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is totally weird I............\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole says as he throws the dress on the ground.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was off and he started to feel more and more dread. As he leaned over for the re-sized pajamas on the bed, he was able to stretch farther than he would as a guy. Starting to feel afraid, he started reaching a hand down his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole jerked with fright.</span> He couldn't feel anything down below. The very organ that identified him as a man was not there even though his body was physically male. His lower body was completely flat and smooth. Sucking it up he looked down and also noticed his legs were completely hair free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really AM Jade now. This is pretty fucking unnerving and I'm learning too much for me to handle about this curse.\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole gulps as he puts on Jade's pajamas which have resized to fit him. Once he was done he took a deep breath and turned to the mirror.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to the reflection and saw in the mirror was Jade herself mimicking Cole's every movement. Jade's reflection wearing the teal pajamas, barefoot, fingernails painted, her long straight hair went down to her back above her butt. Her hair was also partially dyed with blue and teal streaks and her eyes were heavily in dark makeup and dark lipstick. Usually Jade would wash this all off during a shower but since Cole was possessing her life, there was no way in hell he was going to do that as Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"JADE HURRY UP AND GET IN THE SHOWER!\"</b> - <span class=\"cred\">Jade's voice booms from the door.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh son of a bit......\" -<span class=\"cteal\"> Cole grumbles and tries to find the ring, but can't seem to find it. Getting worried, he starts throwing things all over the place trying to find it.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!!\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole rejoices as he makes the change very quick</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole emerges in the hallway back as himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close. I'd totally take the shower if it was another girl. I didn't even see how she felt about me. I'll wait till after she's done.\" - <span class=\"cred\">Cole says as he plops in the kitchen bar stool and turns on the TV to the news. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade leaves her room a little disorganized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" - <span class=\"cred\">Cole</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go in there!\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Jade says a little nervous</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh why? What did you break?\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole says even though he knows it's probably because he himself messed up her room</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it!\" - <span class=\"cteal\">Jade says as she runs into the shower with clothes in hand</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes the door and begins her shower. Cole though keeps eyeing his ring and admiring it beginning to understand it more and more. He realizes that it could be extremely dangerous if in the wrong hands so he decides to keep the ring a secret only to himself. Cole continues watching the news as Jade finishes up her shower.  Hearing the sound of the locks unlocking, he begins to use the ring's power:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">= I wish to know what Jade thinks of me = </span></b> - Cole says this time only focusing on just KNOWING what she thinks of him, however it doesn't go right:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his perspective, the bathroom door opens as he realizes where he is again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"GOD DAMN IT!\"</i> -<span class=\"cteal\"> Cole thinks only to himself as he assumes the role of his sister again</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This thing only switches people's roles it seems!\"</i> - <span class=\"cteal\">Cole thinks</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole walks down the hallways where he plops down on the couch. Pepper leaps to join him. Cole looks over to see his transformed sister watching TV. Again Cole searches through Jade's feelings and emotions trying to understand himself and is surprised that his sister doesn't feel worried anymore after their talk earlier in the day. When Cole looks at Jade sitting on the bar stool, he can sense Jade's nerves are calmed and that's all he needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you Rachel was sick right?\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know.\" - <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Cole </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna back off for a bit on Rachel and focus on other women.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT WHY?!\" - <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Cole jerks up in a very un-Jade-like way. Cole has been primping and hitting on his boss Rachel for a long while that it borderlines on being dangerous considering he might risk his job.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You WANTED me to keep trying with Rachel? That's not like you.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade</b></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no, that's right. Yeah you better stop then, you better not risk your job.\" - <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Cole says even though he realized this was to be true even though he would have loved to be with Rachel his boss.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've opened my eyes. I got to stop taking stupid risks which might get me killed, in reality or financially. Customers though is gonna be tough to wean myself on. Bye bye Nadia.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bye Nadia. God damn it.\" - <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Cole quietly groans as well.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I gotta find some other babes to work my manly charms on.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade says out of character</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahahahahaha!!\" - <span class=\"cteal\"><b>Cole suddenly erupts in laughter</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah quiet you.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade says a little peeved</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole keeps laughing. Only because of what he's hearing from his stern and serious sister saying something that normally HE would say in Jade's voice which totally makes him loose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright shut up get to bed! You got school.\" - <span class=\"cred\"><b>Jade stands and points to your bedroom</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole gets up and decided what to do next.</span></div></div>",

If he became someone famous there could be some major repercussions to that. Cole had to think, and in his haste something clicked. An old book tucked away in the corner, Cole dashed towards the book and brought it up to his face. Dusting it he read the title aloud, \"Egyptian royalties?\" he questioned. Not sure what to do he decided to give it a shot. He flipped the book open and flickered through the pages rapidly, he turned and turned before stumbling along one particular princess that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zatiya, 20. Cole became mesmerized by her appearance, though only an artist depiction he felt entranced by what was before him. Coles interest soon began to shift with excitement of the prospect of becoming someone who had existed thousands of years ago. Letting out a small grin Cole shined the ring with his thumb and reached out with it. \"I wish to become princess... Zati? Zata? Zatiya!?\" He yelled. The ring shined brightly and Cole soon began to feel the ring alter and shift him. He became smaller, his skin tone changed to a rich caramel color. his features became more feminine, and his clothes too began to change similar to what was shown within the book. The book itself fell from his now smaller hands and hit the floor with a thud. Cole reached his hands outwards and began to take in his new appearance, before looking down and spotting the two new mounds upon his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole felt the shifting soon stop, had he done it? had he morphed into her? he was sure he had from his current perspective but he needed to know for sure. Cole rushed back to the mirror from earlier and gazed upon his new appearance. There he stood, there stood Princess Zatiya. he stepped closer, brushing his new wavy long dark blue her aside as he did so. Cole was lost at the sight before him, his clothes had changed into elegant silk robes that covered his new form. However Cole's interest soon shifted as he noticed the two ornaments dangling from his new chest. He raised his hands upwards towards them, spotting the ring still on his finger as he did so. He clutched his new breasts tightly and gave them a firm squeeze, the shock first putting him through some minor pain, but at the same time he could feel pleasure like no other before. Cole enjoyed this look and this new body. But what to do with it now? Cole continued to admire his new form, pulling various poses in front of the mirror as well as getting more \"experienced\" with his new form.</span></div></div>",

Fearing the worse and making those fears reality, Jade heard the unfortunate news from the police at their apartment. The police left behind Jade the golden Eagle Ring that belonged to Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely devastated, Jade locked herself up in her room and let it all out. This was even more hurtful because she also lost her father early on in life and was very attached to him. Similarly, she felt the same way to Cole, not like a brother but as a father figure (Because of the age gap) to her since he was supportive of her and raised her on his own for the past 5 years despite his somewhat outrageous personality. He kept himself grounded and knew when there was a time for jokes and wit and when it came down to supporting someone and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Jade did the following followup work with the police, contacted her family out of state with the sad news, stayed with the police a while since she was dependent and was ordered to move back with her mother and younger sister out in the middle of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't want to leave though and wanted to stay in LA and in Cole's apartment. She probably couldn't stay there and would have a better shot of living with friends. Her friends had already started making procedures so that she could live with them, likely her fellow goth friend Kathy, but the stress would soon start catching up to her coming up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another rainy evening, Jade exits the police department and starts waiting at the bus stop. It comes and she gets on sits alone on the side of the bus looking at Cole's ring that she wears on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the trip on the bus, unbeknownst to Jade, a car starts swerving and comes uncontrollable thanks to the rain picking up, the breaks can't catch and goes flying into the lane with the bus. It can't stop before the red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAH!!!!\" - Jade turns behind to the window to see the car at fast speed collide with the bus inches to where Jade is at. It only takes a split second before Jade starts flying to the other side of the bus, but doesn't make impact as she transitions realities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"><b>=============================================</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade awakens and find herself in an unusual predicament. Time has frozen and the bus has been torn by the impact of the oncoming car, The exact point to when time has frozen has Jade till inside the bus while it is starting to split in two with the car. Glass shattering is frozen in midair from the glass and windows. Jade herself is standing on firm ground however she's standing at an angle as the bus itself is in an angle completely uneven with Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down to find her uneven invisable footing is causing an aura of black and violet glowing energy surround her shaped as a skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......................\" - Jade is frozen silent and tries to make sense of what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"cplum\">\"I have saved you child.\" </span></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here.

He didn't accept this contract did he?! And that's why he.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.....\" - Jade begins to tear up again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cplum\"><i>\"Cole made the decision himself.

Expecting herself to go flying through the other side of the bus, Jade awakens to see herself still sitting down with the Eagle Ring on her finger and clutching her toy plush of a black cat similar to her cat Pepper back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm alright. I did get saved.\"</i> - Jade thinks then sulks again. She had a long day after all this still has to talk with some people back home about the accident. It's all too much for a young kid to handle even though she's normally calm and mature about things. She crouches over and sits sideways on the seat wrapping her arms around her stripped legs. Her finger unknowingly fiddles around with the ring and touches the crystal that the Eagle's claw holds. Thinking about trying to head home and just sleep, she pictures Cole's apartment in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis triggers the ring to activate and she gets swept up in another flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blinks again and finds herself inside her bedroom back home. Her room is red and black painted with purple carpeting, all clad in gothic rock band posters and her queen size bed is draped in black spiderweb like silk. Her cat Pepper is lying on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm back home? So this is the real thing.\" - Jade looks at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door surprises Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, we'd like for you to sign some paperwork. Only two documents and we'll be on our way. Our officer Natalie is all set to watch over you for tonight, so you can get some rest. It won't take long.\" - Came Charlie, a police officer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was a nice policewoman who watched over Jade and told her the bad news. She's tall, blonde in a ponytail and very beautiful. However Jade slumped to her bed and just wanted this to be over. She grew frustrated being so dependent and powerless. She grew tired of everyone getting in her business when she wanted to be alone and not think about this legal mumbo jumbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get out of here. I'm tired of this........\" - Jade slips a finger in the ring and makes a wish:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was totally independent...........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting off her bed she looks down on herself and noticed she's wearing different clothing. A black tank-top, blue jeans and barefoot with black painted toenails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird. Just a change of........\" - Jade says as she fiddles with her hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY HAIR!\" - She could feel it. Her hair was completely cut short to a boyish style. Her long, precious hair was completely gone. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my mirror?!\" - Jade fidgets but can't find one. She turns her attention outside since the bathroom has a full length mirror and where she does her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the large red bedroom door, she puts an ear outside to listen to the cops, but strangely she can't hear anything outside. Swallowing her pride, she opens the door and leaves her bedroom and finds:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole apartment empty. The cops are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did they all go?\" Jade says then she looks at the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wished for independence so I'm probably able to live by myself now. I don't understand why I have to change looks though.\" - Jade <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door knocks as Jade is caught off guard and walks over and answers it. Outside is Officer Natalie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Jade, sorry to intrude again. I just wanted to leave some leftover reports about the accident for you. I'm so sorry.\" - Natalie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... uh, oh thank you.\" - Jade says quietly remembering that what's done is done, and Cole is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie notices Jade tear a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'll leave you be to mourn your <i>younger</i> brother. You have my number if you want to hang out when I'm off duty. I'm sorry.\" - Natalie says quietly.then excuses herself out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" - Jade gulps and uses the couch to maintain her balance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'YOUNGER brother?!!\"</i> - Jade chokes up on spit and runs to the bathroom. Finding the full length mirror, she looses the ability to speak for a moment as she see's her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was looking at a FAR older version of herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was about 27 or 28 in her reflection, a little older than Cole was. Gained about a foot and a half of height, she was an adult woman however she was completely her fifteen year old self when she looked down at herself. Her tank top was a little loose and the jeans were a little baggy as well, plus her makeup on her face was completely gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely blown away by her older looking reflection. Her older self was quite the natural beauty. Nothing overly sexy, her adult chest was about a B to a C cup, hips were a little wide and her short, ruffled, boyish haircut which looked weird as her fifteen year old self, but looks a lot better as an adult. Think Emma Watson except black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this must be what it means to be independent huh? Wow.\" - Jade<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets out of the bathroom to look for more evidence. After looking over bills and other papers. Jade learned she did indeed still live with Cole and they both shared the bills. Jade was totally independent and was born around the same decade as Cole was, however she still was Jade the little girl and knew nothing about living on her own. She wasn't sure if she had a job or went to school unless she checked out her room for info. She was overwhelmed and plopped down on the couch to take a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer kitty Pepper leaps and sits on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see things never change\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do I do?\" - Jade says as she hugs her kitty</span></div></div>",

Except when she sat up, she noticed it wasn't HER bed or even HER apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in bed while the cobwebs of sleep slowly crept away. Once she was fully awake, the realization finally hit her and she began to freak out since she didn't know how she ended up in her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I and what am I wearing?!\" - Jade<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked around at the bedroom she now sat in. It wasn't that big, but everything in it looked expensive. It was then that Jade realized that this had to have something to do with that wish she just made. She looked down to inspect herself to see if what kind of changes happened to her. She still looked and felt the same, however she was now wearing a green t-shirt and bright girly pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww. These clothes make me wanna gag. These clothes and apartment are not mine. So where am I and what is going on!?\" - Jade jumped out of bed and began looking around. She saw a large clock that had the date on it along with the time. That's when she noticed that the date on it was two weeks ago. If it was right, then today is the day Cole gets killed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole! If this is all real, I need to find him! Okay I need to get dressed.\" - Jade looked around the room for any clothes. The room had lots of nice furniture, but nothing that looked like a dresser or anywhere clothes could be stored in. She did see what she thought looked like a closet. Stepping into the 'closet', Jade found it lead to a large dressing room full of dresser drawers, hanging business outfits and several racks of shoes. There was even an open bathroom in the corner. She still didn't know where she was but this place looked like it belonged to somebody that was extremely rich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe browsed through all the outfits that were hanging up. All of them looked like they belonged to a mature woman and would be too large on her smaller teenage frame. Even thought nothing looked like it would fit, Jade still spent a couple minutes picking out something that at least was close to her style. Eventually she settled on a black Italian pantsuit that she couldn't even pronounce the name of. She took it over to the dressing mirror on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH!!!\" - Jade startledly screamed as she dropped the outfit that she had been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her reflection in shock.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..... her reflection was that of Cole's boss Rachel Powell(38)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Fuck.\" - Jade muttered as she watched Rachel in the mirror move her lips as she was saying the exact same thing. All she wished for was to be totally independent, not to become Cole's rich boss. She didn't even know that the Eagle Ring could make her become somebody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..... her......!?! \" - Jade started thinking. Staring at her reflection for a moment, Jade became curious and tried something. She started making weird poses and faces and watched as Rachel in the mirror mimicked her perfectly. Jade saw her wild, red hair that was all over the place while sitting on her shoulders in the same way Jade's hair was. As she brought up her hand to her face, Jade saw that The Eagle Ring also changed into a more fancy looking bracelet which now was on her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.. I have to find Cole.\" - Jade said unenthusiastically. Even though Jade met Cole's boss, Rachel only once; She still thought that she was pretty. The kind of pretty that she knew her older brother fawned over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my brother is alive and hits on me, I'm going to be scarred for life.\" - Jade thought to herself as she saw Rachel's reflection look like she shared the same sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the reflection of the Eagle bracelet in the mirror, Jade decided to...</span></div></div>",

Cole Lewis' mother Morgan lives here with her boyfriend Andrew Richardson, and her own younger daughter Sabrina. Having lost her old husband and now her son, she's done her share of grieving by herself. She's disabled from the waist down and cannot walk so she only travels via wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer personality is very upbeat and bright. She loves her children and is pretty childish and reckless in nature just like Cole was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only memento she was given along with the photographs and video were his Eagle Ring that she proudly wears with her at all times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bright and humid afternoon out in the country, Morgan and Andrew reach the base of a hill where Morgan made a makeshift memorial of her son and former husband and honor both their memories. Knowing how tough this is, Andrew lets her be and walks down the hill to wait for her while she mourns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan continues her mourning then says one final prayer. Wiping the sweat from her forehead, she reaches over in her chair to find a bottled water but see's it nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. I better hurry back. It's getting very hot out here.\" - <span class=\"cmaroon\">Morgan</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks to the tombstones again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys keep looking down and watching over us. \" - <span class=\"cmaroon\">Morgan smiles as she starts heading down the hill</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat becomes a little too much as she starts getting lightheaded and looses control of her chair, swerving along, she looses control and goes flying down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORGAN!!\" - Andrew yells as he tries to catch up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, still out of it, slowly regains her composure but her chair starts picking up speed and continues sailing down the steep hill and then off the trail completely.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........uh...huh....\" -<span class=\"cmaroon\"> Morgan </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair does a leap off the edge and jettisons itself into a large hole that used to be partially boarded up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAH NO!!!\" - <span class=\"cmaroon\">Morgan yells as she regains complete control of herself again and she falls deep into the tunnel</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No.....

An extremely dangerous art in order to prevent wars, disease and other unfortunate circumstances. These dark arts were shunned upon because perfecting them and the crystals in the ring would take centuries to fully become usable. Now that you've triggered it's power, the power to alter reality is finally perfected and now rests in your hands. In order to keep my power from waning, increased use of my power must be regularly used. However whether you use this for good or evil is up to you, but be aware of the consequences should this fall into the wrong hands. I only act as a mediary and I have no conscience, only the user does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with my power to bend reality, you are given a secondary ability to slow down time exactly where you are now, In this limbo. Time here has slowed to 1/1000 the accentuated speed, and because you are in this state, you can not die, be starved for food, needing to dispel wastes or age. You can freely travel anywhere you want, and then return everything to normal using the ring. Insert your finger and concentrate to what kind of alteration you want and it will happen. You can also teleport anywhere this way by thinking of the location as long as you have a clear picture of what the location looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must dispel from you, I must have your vow.

The ride back is a very quiet one. Morgan fights back tears now knowing what her stubborn son should have done in the first place. She was now forever indebted to the ring's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sits alone in their bedroom. Andrew is out bringing the horses together and closing up the stable. Morgan holds the ring in her hand and wonders what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm to use this thing, I might as well not make any selfish changes. Wishing to walk again is out of the question since I've accepted my disability and this ring can teleport me anywhere. I just want to see my daughter Jade again. I want all my daughters to be here with me.

Her favorite color is pink and is totally brainwashed by the tween pop idol stars, that she begs her mom and Andrew to buy her clothes and toys with their logo.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My first wish is for my Momma to be able to walk again.\" - Sabrina said to the golden ring in her hands as she sat comfortably in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring gave off a faint glow, but then nothing happened. She didn't understand why it didn't do anything like it when her horse was bitten by that snake. All of a sudden, she became very sleepy. Sabrina could no longer keep her eyes open and fell back onto her stuffed animals and passed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina slowly woke up to an alarm going off in her room. \"I don't have an alarm. That sounds like my Momma's alarm.\" - Sabrina thought as she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her mother's alarm that was going off. Sabrina somehow woke up in her mother's room and didn't know how she got there. The last thing she remembered was being in her bed and making a wish for \"her Momma to be able to walk again\". Despite it being much earlier than she normally got up, Sabrina felt really tired still. It felt like she only got half the sleep she normally did. Suddenly she felt the bed move as someone that was in bed with her rolled over and turned the annoying alarm off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of who was in her mother's bed with her, Sabrina sat up so she could find out. When she sat up, she not only found out who it was, but how her wish had been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH!!!\" - Sabrina shrieked in a strange but familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew Richardson had just sat up out of bed and turned off the alarm clock. He wanted to slowly wake up when all of a sudden his girlfriend, Morgan began screaming. \"What's wrong Morgan\" - Andrew concerningly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina didn't know which was worse. The fact that she woke up in her mother's body or the fact that she was naked and so was her boyfriend, Andrew who was beside her. Looking down, all Sabrina could see were her mother's sagging breasts and aged hands which she brought to her face and covered her mouth with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Andrew wasn't completely naked and got out of bed wearing underwear. Sabrina was still quite young and the thought of boys or sex haven't appealed to her yet. If she had seen Andrew's privates, she probably would have screamed louder than she previously did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew got up and hurried around the bed to Sabrina's bedside. \"What's wrong Morgan? Do you need to go to the hospital?\" - Andrew asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was over the initial shock. Right now she didn't want to look at Andrew who was almost naked. \"I'm fine. Just had a nightmare.\" - Sabrina said as she shielded her eyes from Andrew's nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Andrew walk away from her, Sabrina lowered her hand that covered her eyes to see him standing in the corner pulling up a pair of worn jeans that she usually saw him wearing when he worked around the farm. He was still shirtless, but it felt much less icky for Sabrina to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got one of his flannel shirts on, Andrew headed towards the door. \"I'll go make us a pot of coffee while you get dressed.\" - Andrew said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sabrina was certain that Andrew was gone, she threw the bed sheets back and wanted to get out of bed. But she simply couldn't just do that. Her mother's legs (which were technically hers at the moment) wouldn't move. That's when she realized how her wish happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Momma can walk now because she has my body and I have hers!\" - Sabrina thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now all she wanted to find her mother and that terrible ring and undo this wish. Unsure how her mother got out of bed, Sabrina spotted her wheelchair a couple feet away and reached over her bed side to move it closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed was tougher than Sabrina thought it would be, but dressing her mother's aged and disabled body was much harder. Unused to how bras worked, Sabrina managed to slip on some panties and shorts before giving up and throwing a shirt on without a bra. She didn't have time to figure out how to put one on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that she had enough clothing on, Sabrina rolled the wheelchair that she was confined to down the hallway towards her room. She remembered locking it before making that wish and falling asleep. Right now she wished that she hadn't. Once she got to her door, she was surprised at first to find that it wasn't unlocked -until she realized that the Eagle Ring was already on her aged fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rolled up and saw herself laying asleep on the top of her bed amongst all her stuffed animals. Her body was still wearing the clothes she had worn when she made that wish. Sabrina wasn't sure what to do or even what to tell her Momma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan honey, the coffee is ready.\" - Andrew said loudly from down the hallway for whom he thought was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it did have the desired effect he wanted and Sabrina watched in horror as her body slowly began to wake up. In a panic, Sabrina quickly placed one of her now larger hands over her body's mouth...</span></div></div>",

After it's triggered, Cole is bound to the Ring's dangerous 'contract' and is forced to use it's power off and on because of the ring saving his life and being indebted to it's power. The ring activates a dangerous curse on Cole which allows him to warp reality.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatures:<br>\r\n- The ring is shaped as a Golden Eagles claw protecting a small jewel which changes colors just like a mood ring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The ring itself is Gold save for the crystal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <b>TO ACTIVATE THE RING'S POWER, COLE MUST INSERT A FINGER AND TOUCH THE GEM INSIDE AND THINK UP ANYTHING HE WANTS TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE OR HIMSELF, AND REALITY WILL WARP AND ADAPT. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The Ring also grants Cole the ability to teleport anywhere in the world, however, he must have a clear visual of the location he's trying to teleport so he'll be using GOOGLE EARTH a LOT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The ring's curse is to be mischievous and an experience for Cole. Cole himself is mischievous in nature so it fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The ring won't work for anyone else except if a person is in a life of death experience and the ring saves that person. Cole will still be allowed to use it's power, as will the second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The ring can change itself to one of many accessories depending on the type of person the character becomes.

Cole's large 3 room apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteractive Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This interactive will be heavily moderated. I will NOT accept short 1 paragraph chapters, and I reserve my rights to edit and delete as I see fit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do not rely on me to contribute for most of the time. Keep this interactive going readers. I'm extremely busy off and on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- To keep this more as an interactive, only I will choose select chapters to have THE END pages when it comes to the character making a life or death decision in his life. However I won't make these type of stops for BOTH choices. There will be a few 'Right Decision/Wrong Decision' choices and only I will do these. Although don't expect to have every chapter end, probably just the contributions to this that I see, or when that part of the story has served it's purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Keep the transformations mainly to body switching and keep their experiences descriptive. When the characters are PERSON A, have them have their own bodies but will appear to everyone else as PERSON A and wear PA's clothes, accessories and hairstyles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Have good grammar, unintentional typos are OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Have fun and enjoy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n</td>",
