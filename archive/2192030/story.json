He tried to move but he could feel invisible hands grabbing his arms and legs. He writhed about, trying to break free of the cold, unrelenting force that held him. \"LOOK AT ME DANIEL!\" He turned his eyes towards the voice and saw a tall, hooded figure emerging from the blackness. \"Oh crap,\" he moaned. \"Its you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn't see very well in the dark but he still recognised the figure's shoulders dropping slightly. \"No <i>'hello'</i>? No <i>'nice to see you for the first time in three years?'</i> Ugh, this is why I despise you mortals.\" Danny rolled his eyes as he shook off the hands and walked over to the entity. <i>Still the same drama queen...</i> He put a comforting arm on the entity's arm and said, \"Hello. Nice to see you again for the first time in three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity dabbed his eyes dramatically with a small handkerchief he'd materialised. 'Thank you, Daniel. That means a lot.\" His demeanour took a sharp U-turn as he shot up and grabbed Danny by the shoulders in his vicelike grip. \"So,\" he enquired, \"What's going on with you?! I haven't been back to this town in years! You know how it is, all the 'trait thief' nonsense and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm 18 now, I've graduated from school. Just about passed French but got pretty good grades in everything else. I'm STILL living with my parents- I tried moving in with Megs but she and her bandmates are... HORRIBLE, to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your hot Mother? How's she doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, ew. Second, she's great; she's aged a little but still doing OK. Rest of the family's doing fine as well: Kurt's moved out, he's gone to uni full-time on some major sports scholarship. Kourtney is as annoying as ever but it's made worse that she is literally only ONE inch taller than me. Kevin is... well he's still a cockface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, any other relationships I should know about?\" Danny blushed as the Entity exploded with laughter. \"Is it who I THINK it is?! Daniel, you sly dog! That neighbour of yours, Dana or whatever, you FINALLY got with her?! I've missed so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you really have. By the way, those 'trait theft' powers that you gave me? I, kinda-sorta, LOST THEM, but before you get mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I get mad?! Do you REALLY think you're the only one to lose your powers?! Oh no, even I've lost them once before- the year was 1268, she was a budding Byzantine sorceress and I was just a lowly, inexperienced turd like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the story, mate. Any of that gonna get my powers back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn't see his face but the Entity looked annoyed at his comment. \"As I was TRYING to say before I was so RUDELY interrupted,\" he continued, \"after I'd made passionate love to that treacherous witch and she'd stolen my powers, I had to go back to my own master and plead with him to get my powers restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, YOU can give me back my powers?! Hurry up and do it then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity wagged a bony finger in Danny's face as he replied, \"Not so fast, Daniel. It's not going to be THAT easy. You see, even after I'd successfully convinced my teacher to restore my abilities, it still cost me. Are you willing to pay a price for YOUR powers, Daniel?\" Danny hesitated, thinking solemnly for a few moments before solemnly nodding his head. The figure grinned deviously as he outstretched an unnatural palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let me set out the terms: I get full control over you and all the changes you make, mental or physical. I don't normally like interfering with my charges but, as you may remember, sometimes you just need a little PUSH...\" Danny suddenly moaned, a wave of ecstasy rushing over him as his penis swelled under his trousers. He knew this was all in his mind but he couldn't help but feel aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity cackled maniacally before resetting Danny's libido. \"I think you get the gist,\" he chuckled. \"I also want free roam to observe and modify the people around you, ESPECIALLY your beautiful mother, at any time of my choosing.\" Danny was about to protest when he stopped himself: he figured that the figure would find a way out to do that anyway. Plus it was only fair considering that the Entity was giving up a portion of his power for a SECOND time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Danny took the Entity's hand begrudgingly. The entity grinned unnervingly as they shook, saying, \"Now that the pleasantries are over we can do this.\" He cleared his throat. \"DANIEL BRONSON, YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN, blah-blah-blah, TRAIT THIEF... I BEQUEATH MY POWER, GO HOME!\" He muttered something indecipherable and whirled his withered hands; soon a tornado was conjured from thin air and hurled Danny away, higher and higher, faster and faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shot up from his bed, checking for any bruises or scratches. \"Just a dream...\" he reassured himself as he punched his alarm clock. Something was definitely different about himself though, he knew it, a feeling up powerful, pent up energy laying dormant inside him. <i>Are they really back?</i> he thought giddily. <i>Only one way to find out...</i></span></div></div>",

Danny's face quickly dropped, the disappointment at a lack of swapping victims this early in the morning clear on his face. He kicked his dresser in frustration before a sharp pain shot through his foot that made him instantly regret it. Fortunately for Danny this made him turn back to the window and he quickly spotted an attractive looking jogger going down his street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprinted down the stairs and shut the door behind him but alas, he was too late and the jogger had turned round the corner and disappeared. Danny cursed as he looked down at himself and noticed the extra few pounds of flab that he'd gained during the past 3 years looking around his belly. He was in the middle of giving himself a mental note to exercise more when he heard gentle whistling coming from the house next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the source and grinned lustfully as he watched his hot, new neighbour, Ms Maria Sanchez, polish her silver Benz idly in her driveway. This wasn't the first time he'd stopped to take a glance at his MILF neighbour- ever since she'd moved in six months ago with her 12-year-old son, Enrique, Danny had used his room as a perfect vantage point to bask in her beauty. She had a beautiful face, sweet and elegant with the added bonus of her long, dad hair, bright pink lipstick and large dangly hoops distending from her earlobe. Danny noticed she was rocking her usual cropped white jacket with a bedazzled, red bra that barely supported her buxom 34DD rack and tight booty shorts that barely covered her firm Hispanic butt. Danny could genuinely not understand why she needed to get dressed up like this just to clean her car but hell, he wasn't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/16/14/3c161496d4975689062b1b162fb848ec.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/16/14/3c161...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Sanchez looked up from her washing for a moment and noticed Danny, waving at him and beaming with her pearly whites. Danny waved back as he felt his power rising from his gut. A moment later and Maria's jugs melted away until they were tiny little nubs hidden underneath the tight bra. Danny meanwhile felt the familiar feeling of breasts erupting underneath his stained black tee. He massaged them indiscreetly ,enjoying the arousing sensation of his newly acquired globes, his puffy nipples going erect near instantaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Daniel?\" Danny had completely forgotten that Ms Sanchez had been staring back at him and he blushed before he put his hands back inside his pockets. Maria laughed heartily, her voice so happy and pure that it caused Danny to laugh with her.  She turned to leave and Danny chuckled at her obliviousness before feeling his glorious bosom once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh yeah,'</i> he chuckled to himself, <i>'I'm BACK, baby!'</i></span></div></div>",

He made sure to cop a quick feel of his new jugs, tweaking the now erect nipples through his top indiscreetly. Rediscovering his powers was absolutely exhilarating and he didn\u2019t want the thrill of swapping to end just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to an old codger that lived down the road, a nosy old git called Mr Clyde that\u2019d always snitched on Danny when he\u2019d been up to his usual antics with his mates before. He\u2019d been in the middle of watering his plants when a little girl, his granddaughter Casey, skipped out of the house to play around in the front garden. Unfortunately for her, she\u2019d immediately attracted Danny\u2019s attention and her nonchalant giggling ended when she felt a strange pushing sensation in her groin. She moaned- both out of pain and pleasure- as the erect, 6.5\u2019 member grew in under her pink leggings, throbbing incessantly despite its age. Danny laughed as Mr Clyde pawed at his crotch only to find the 6-year-old massaging her groin quite enthusiastically with a devious grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr Clyde shooed Casey back inside to address the current predicament they were in, Danny scoured his street for other worthy swap patrons. He was delightfully surprised to see that there were many other neighbours finally leaving their homes and walking about, making them prime targets for his peculiar brand of \u2018fun\u2019.</span></div></div>",

Or goddess, rather, since you're so keen on getting a milf body again just like three years ago.\" It explained, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a little since Danny realized the entity was spot on, he figured he could swap again with Maria any time, if he wanted to again. \"Okay, but I'm still not quite sure I'm following.\" he replied.

Finding himself with the woman's wet mature body felt both amazing and obnoxious. Now, it was Danny who's clothes showed off his intimate parts to the world, and he shivered from the cold. \"Probably should've thought that one out better.\" He quipped, wringing out his new long hair, and enjoying his new body's foreign accent. \"But this bod's a keeper!\" The entity exclaimed. \"Now who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rapidly rifled through the repugnant heaps of clothes on the floor, searching for any items of clothing that only smelt <i>\u2019a bit\u2019</i> off.

I thought you hated my house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I hated your house,\u201d she spoke in her soft Australian accent, \u201cI said I hated your ROOM! Seriously, have you never considered using AIR FRESHENER before?!\u201d Danny laughed as he beckoned her to come inside- Dana was the only person who could insult him AND make him feel good at the same time. She plugged her nose as she stepped through the minefield of dirty underwear, used socks and mysterious puddles that had never completely dried up. \u201cDaniel Frederick Bronson, you are the only person on this entire EARTH who is completely comfortable living in a pigsty like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, I thought you LOVED my mess! You know I\u2019m the perfect yin to your yang, the mess to your cleanliness, the slacker to your overachiever, the penis to your va-\u201c She pressed a dainty ebony finger onto his lips as she shuffled closer to his chest, his arm wrapping around her shoulder as they nuzzled each other tenderly. \u201cThe only thing WORSE than the mess you make,\u201d Dana giggled, \u201cis your BREATH.\u201d Danny grinned as his hand caressed her smooth black curls, just soaking up every moment he spent with the beautiful girl who he was proud to call his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready and willing to just rest his head on Dana\u2019s and take a quick nap when he heard a slow clapping coming from the other side of the room. He looked up to see an Asian woman sitting on the cabinet opposite him. The woman was completely unfamiliar to Danny with her straight auburn hair, cute, petite face and curvy body that would\u2019ve made Danny drool if he wasn\u2019t already taken. She was decked out in what looked like casual influencer attire with black 3-inch stilettos and  a tight tangerine jumper completed with a pair of old-reliable, faded jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.redd.it/cyq2aqcoj3401.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.redd.it/cyq2aqcoj3401.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the form may have been different, the cold, emotionless black pupils gave the away the Entity\u2019s true identity. \u201cCongratulations Daniel, you FINALLY snagged up the girl,\u201d he cackled, \u201cGood for you!\u201d Danny cursed silently as he quietly repositioned Dana\u2019s head so she wouldn\u2019t wake up. <i>\u2019Ugh, I thought you\u2019d left...\u2019</i> Danny hissed in a whispered voice. The Entity grinnned as he strutted up to Danny\u2019s face, squeezing his cheeks affectionately as he said, \u201cAnd lose my favourite plaything? No, NEVER!\u201d The Entity noticed Dana\u2019s head resting peacefully on Danny\u2019s lap. \u201cAnd you finally bagged the girl! Congratulations are in order, Daniel! Maybe she\u2019d appreciate it if I gave you a little boost, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny winced, his lips squeezing together as if he was eating a sour lemon, as he felt something shifting underneath his dirty Y-fronts. He couldn\u2019t help but moan sensually as he felt an additional length of about 2 inches being added onto his now throbbing peace of manmeat. Danny groaned as he massaged his new equipment tenderly, careful not to wake up Dana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Daniel. Now, for the real reason I\u2019m still here: over the past <b>THREE YEARS</b> I\u2019ve been stuck in the Limbo dimension with nothing to do but conjure beautiful women to pleasure me and deal with all the other trait-swapping imbeciles I\u2019m forced to oversee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, there are <i>OTHERS?!</i>\u201d Danny interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, <i>OBVIOUSLY</i> there are others,\u201d the Entity continued in his sweet, melodic voice, \u201cHow else am I supposed to afford the ladies? But that\u2019s not the point; I\u2019m tired of hanging back and watching you have all the fun, I want to have some fun too! That\u2019s why, from now on, I\u2019m officially retiring from my duties as a trait theif!

Are you going to tell her about me or are we going to have to lie? Ooh, please say lie!

You know what? Time\u2019s up.\u201d He- (wait, she?)- waved her hand in front of Dana\u2019s face, sending a swirl of golden dust dancing across her cheeks.

A stray arm jerked out and smacked an innocent lamp to the ground where it fractured vehemently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your boyfriend's right, it's not how you think it is,\"</i> the Entity boomed in an ethereal articulation of many layers of sound, <i>\"In fact, you won't even worry about what you've just seen because you trust that my friend Daniel here would never do anything of the sort.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never,\" Danny chimed in to which the Entity gave him a malicious glare for interrupting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Anyway, you believe that me and Danny are nothing but platonic friends and know that any intimate interactions we have with each other are nothing but playful. To you, and the wider world, I am just the new exchange student at Danny's university, Ginko Shimabukuro. You do <b>not</b> feel like you're relationship with Danny is threatened by me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...You also use the term <i>'slut'</i> as a term of endearment for me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity grinned mischievously as his dark pupils lowered in intensity, softening to a smoky cocoa colour. Dana shook her head as she regained her bearings. She rubbed her temple as the Entity spoke softly, \"Are you OK, Dana? You scared me there...\" Dana's amber eyes went up to the Entity's Asian features and a grin stretched across her face. She brushed herself down and giggled quietly to herself. \"I'm fine Ginko,\" she said, \"Just felt a bit dizzy for a second there. Mind if I go home and get my head straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shook his head and Dana gave him a quick peck on his cheek as she stepped out into the corridor. Danny closed the door softly and pressed his back against the frame. \"What... the f*ck?!\" He devolved into a crazy bout of laughter as he slowly sank to the floor. The Entity soon joined in, chortling cutely with his soft Japanese vocal chords. \"You're welcome, you lucky bastard,\" the Entity said as he threw one of Danny's mouldy socks at his face. They both laughed for a few more moments before Danny eventually ran out breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity snorted as he idly played with one of his now erect nipples. \"That, my young protege, was a good first lesson into the art of mental manipulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying I'll be able to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through continuous practice and training, yes you should do. But lets not get too ahead of ourselves. First we've got to re-affiliate you with the basics of trait-swapping after your three year hiatus.\" The Entity groaned as his new stomach growled menacingly. \"And if we can find some way to remedy <i>that</i>. Ugh, is this what hunger feels like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is, Entity,\" Danny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably start sticking to the backstory if you're gonna convince your girlfriend that my presence is normal. Otherwise something bad could happen, i.e. her brain exploding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine! I guess I'll call you Goku Shombo-kombo or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginko Shimabukuro. And I find your failure to try is just a tad racist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be racist when you're the one appropriating another culture?\" The Entity (or Ginko, as he wanted to be called) gave Danny a bewildered look. Danny sighed, \"Look, I took a semester in Social Sciences, okay?\" Ginko shrugged 'her' shoulders as she opened the door for Danny and allowed him to walk out. \"Where to first, <i>'Professor Bronson'</i>,\" she laughed.</span></div></div>",

He heard Ginko gag in disgust as one of her stiletto heels tangled in a sticky pool on the carpeted floor. \u201cWhat a f*cking pigsty,\u201d he heard her mumble. Danny chuckled. \u201cWhat, afraid of a little pa-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turned around to see the Entity had ducked out of site. Danny backtracked and watched as a flash of tangerine darted into the room his aunt now occupied. He peeked his head round and glimpsed Ginko standing in the room shock-still with her body facing the room wall. Danny followed her line of sight and noticed his Aunt Susan standing to the side, hips cocked and eyes locked onto her latest piece of \u2018art\u2019. He looked closer at the wall and his eyes nearly bulged out as he looked at the...well,<i>interesting</i> mural she\u2019d emblazoned on the plaster. To give his Aunt some props the image was actually vibrantly coloured and surprisingly detailed for an artist of her calibre. The problem was that the wall was now vibrantly coloured and the picture had a little <i>too</i> much detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Mum and Kevin having sex?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan rolled her eyes. \u201cUgh, you people just don\u2019t understand art these days,\u201d she lamented as she flicked her paint-speckled blonde hair out from her face and stroked her chin with her trimmed nails like a real Renaissance painter. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to focus on the sub<i>jects</i>- you need to look at the sub<i>text</i> underneath! Come on Danny, it\u2019s obviously a metaphor for-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the beautiful hypocrisy of procreation- the equal blend of innocence and lust that combine together to form the perfect natural composition: life itself.\u201d Susan and Danny both turned to the Entity, their mouths agape as the Japanese girl admired the work. \u201cY-yes, I mean of course I was aiming for the... y\u2019know, what you said,\u201d Susan stammered nervously. Though Susan was awed that someone finally appreciated something that she\u2019d created, Danny was pleasantly surprised at this new revelation. \u201cNever would\u2019ve pegged you as one of those \u2018art-expo\u2019 wankers,\u201d he chuckled half-serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile spread across the Entity\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t live as long as I have without developing a taste for the fine arts,\u201d Ginko said proudly, \u201cArt is all about documenting the culture of the times. Inspirations for the arts are always deeply rooted in the society they\u2019re constructed within.\u201d Sudan playfully jabbed Danny in the ribs. <i>\u2018Why can\u2019t all your friends be as wise as her?\u2019 </i>she whispered. Danny shrugged awkwardly. He had to get the Entity out of here fast before she and his Aunt became painting pals or something else that would be as equally embarrassing. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Danny hissed as he grabbed the Entity\u2019s slender arm and pulled her behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...But I haven\u2019t even started to critique her brushwork yet!\u201d Ginko struggled but in her new form she was simply overpowered. Seeing her discomfort made Susan riled up and she moved to pull her out of Danny\u2019s firm grasp. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to treat a lady,\u201d she said angrily as she latched onto the Entity\u2019s trailing hand. As soon as their skin brushed, a current of power seemed to pass from Ginko\u2019s body and into Susan\u2019s, making the blonde revulse momentarily before stumbling backwards into a pile of paintbrushes strewn onto the ground. \u201cAunt Susan!\u201d Danny cried out before running to her side. The Entity meanwhile was scratching his head about the sudden wave of energy he\u2019d just felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Susan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny jumped back as his aunt shot upwards like the Undertaker after he\u2019d looked TKO\u2019d. His breathing was ragged as he observed her, her now stormy-grey eyes roaming her body like a ravenous wolf. Despite his prior experiences with body stealing, it still shocked him when he watched his Aunt\u2019s hands jerk upwards and cup her buxom D-cups in her paint splattered digits. \u201c Howee, looks like ah gawt me one smokin' lookin' body raahyt here,\u201d his aunt said in a sultry Texan variation of her voice. Susan Bronson was a self-proclaimed \u2018master impressionist\u2019 but there was something about the accent that made Danny question whether it was truly authentic or not. \u201cAunt Susan, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had reached out his hand to help her up but her aunt\u2019s dainty hands slapped it away. He watched as the figure stood up by themselves and standing confidently in the centre of the room with their fingers tucked deftly in the back pockets of her jeans. \u201c Let\u2019s git sumthin' strayaahyt raahyt now lil\u2019 button, ah ain\u2019t your damn Aunt Susan.\u201d The figure giggled mischievously before plucking out a pack of cigarettes from his Aunt\u2019s bra and lighting one with a match that\u2019d spontaneously appeared out of thin air. The figure choked and sputtered, spitting out the fresh fag and stomping it\u2019s butt into the ground. \u201cF*ckin' lowlifes, takin' all thuh fuckin' tabacker out thuh damn cigarettes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who are you and why\u2019re you in my Aunt\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake-Susan threw an uncharacteristic sly wink at Danny, sending a repulsed shiver down his spine. \u201cAh, you must be his newest charge. Ask your mentor lil\u2019 button, ya know, thuh one quakin' behahnd yer back.\u201d Danny swivelled round to see the Entity standing squeamishly in the corner of the room. The light makeup that\u2019d somehow been put onto her face was now clouding from the matter sweat trickling down her face. Ginko cleared her throat as she stepped forwards. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here, Darla? This isn\u2019t your time period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled, Sudan\u2019s pearly whites flashing menacingly like those of a humanoid Cheshire Cat. \u201cYa thought a lil\u2019 taahm diestortion would stop me, ole man? Sh*t, ah done thought ya would\u2019ve expected mo-wr from one\u2019ve <i>yer own students</i>.  No matter though: after ah git what ah want you\u2019ll nary 'ave ta hear from me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me that the last time we met in Texas, \u201869. Why don\u2019t I believe you\u2019ll make good on your offer yet again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla chuckled heartily. She crossed the room and placed her hands seductively on the Entity\u2019s bust. \u201cAnyone ever told ya that you\u2019ve allers looked cute whe-yn you\u2019re sceptical, that\u2019s what ah love about ya.\u201d Danny shifted uncomfortably as he watched his aunt\u2019s body press itself closer onto Ginko\u2019s busty frame. What made it worse was that he could tell the Entity was getting slightly turned on by it. He coughed brusquely and watched as Ginko pushed Darla away. \u201cNo, not again Darla,\u201d Ginko finally uttered, \u201cJust state your terms so you can leave.\u201d Darla sent Danny a menacing glare for the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019ain\u2019t no fun no more.\u201d Darla batted her eyes innocently before saying,\u201dIs it a craahm for me t' visit maah ex-husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEx-husband?!\u201d Danny unconsciously blurted out. The Entity, unfazed, implored Darla to continue. She sighed, dropping the doting wife shtick and said, \u201cFine: ah need saynctuary. Ownlee for jus' a lil\u2019 bit! Ah done sumthin' <i>real</i> beef-headed an now, now the Trait Thieves ahr gunnin' for me!\u201d Ginko kissed her teeth in frustration- this obviously wasn\u2019t her first rodeo where this\u2019d happen and Danny felt pity for the cold denial the Entity was going to give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Danny\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cBut you owe me big for this one, Darla. Remember this for the next time I ask for your help.\u201d Danny looked on in shocked silence as he watched the Entity reach out her hand for a handshake. A mischievous smile spread across the woman\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllers a puh-leasyhaw doin' business with ya, Sebastian darlin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ginko now. And drop the accent: you\u2019ll stick out like a sore thumb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla roller her eyes sarcastically. \u201cWhatever you say, babe,\u201d she giggled in Susan\u2019s voice. She blew Danny a kiss and nuzzled the Entity\u2019s neck before sashaying out of the room (and though he didn\u2019t want to admit it due to his conflicted feelings about it, Danny could feel himself getting a boner over the prospect of someone stealing his aunt\u2019s body).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell just happened!\u201d he finally blurted out after getting his leacherous eyes off of his Aunt\u2019s backside. Ginko sighed, replying, \u201cJust an old acquaintance. Nothing much to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like there\u2019s <i>A LOT</i> to talk about! Like how your \u2018ex-WIFE\u2019 just happens to show up on the same day that YOU want to re-introduce yourself! Or what about the fact that there\u2019s another f*cking Trait Thief in my house and she\u2019s currently inhabiting my f*cking Aunt\u2019s body?! W-What the hell were you thinking? Just <i>giving</i> her body away like she\u2019s some kinda bottle of Coke or something?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinko snorted. \u201cIf anything she\u2019d be a bottle of piss on the side of the road...\u201d Danny glared at her. \u201cKidding. Geez Daniel, c\u2019mon, you gotta learn how to take a joke. Relax, ok? Darla\u2019s an...<i>\u2018old friend\u2019,</i>a remnant from just one of the many lives I\u2019ve led over and the past couple centuries. Sure, she\u2019s a tad unstable and will f*ck anything or anyone in her line of sight, but apart from that she\u2019s alright! Trust me, your Aunt\u2019s in relatively decent hands (theoretically).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, this\u2019ll all blow over soon and she\u2019ll leave as quickly as she came (thank God for that)! It\u2019ll be like she\u2019s not even here!\u201d Danny groaned as the Entity pushed him back outside into the corridor. In Danny\u2019s mind he knew he actually had no say in the matter- the Entity would do what they wanted either way because of the terms Danny had naively agreed to beforehand. <i>She\u2019s gonna leave as soon as she came,</i> Danny reassured himself.</span></div></div>",

No offence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity grumbled, asking himself why he'd chosen this arrogant mortal to be a trait thief in the first place. \"YOU KNOW WHAT- IT DOES'NT EVEN MATTER.

A trio of pretty Thai masseuses ran out from the darkness and started massaging him from head to toe.

She checked herself frantically, making sure she was still in one piece and then sighing happily once she'd confirmed. Megan couldn't help but crack a sly smirk: she had to admit, life without the Entity and her powers the past few years had been boring.

Kelly was the first, and since they were all staying over at Megan's house while her mother and aunt stayed at a friend's house for a day. The rest of Megan's family however, her two brothers and her sister, were all in their rooms, fast asleep. Which was ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, who slept in her trademark black bobble hat was half uncovered by a sheet as she laid on the spare mattress normally kept under Megan's bed. She was naked except for her underneath vest and her skull-motif panties. \"Let's see how you look with a dick Kelly.\" Megan amused herself, thinking of her brother Danny. Instantly, the fabric of Kelly's panties started to bulge outward as Danny's sizeable cock and his balls pushed out of Kelly's groin, sealing her vagina shut. Kelly fidgeted a little, but remained sleeping, even as her new cock hardened into a full blown erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, didn't know he'd got that big.\" Megan muttered to herself, referring to the size of her brother's junk. But she knew that Danny wasn't as big as Kurt was, and that was when she turned her attention to Lindsay, who unfortunately was laying on her stomach. However, Megan smiled, because she knew Lindsay was a heavy sleeper, and she was right next to her, sharing the same bed. She rolled Lindsay over, so she could see the change happen again, then she 'borrowed' Kurt's junk too. Lindsay's dark blue panties were stretched as a large penis and the balls to accompany it sprouted between her legs. She took popped a boner, and she had over an inch on Kelly, easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's more like it.\" Megan giggled quietly, watching the head of her step-brother's cock push up past the waistband of Lindsay's underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lets see what your boobs feel like.\" Megan mumbled, as she swapped her own chest with Lindsay's. She looked down at Lindsay as her ample DD-cup tits deflated in her bra, morphing into Megan's small B-cups. And Megan got even more turned on as her friend's breasts manifested on her chest... causing her own bra to snap in back. She took off her ruined garment and chuckled, groping and squeezing the soft 'pillows' she now possessed. \"Hmm, pretty nice, a little heavy though.\" She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly suddenly stirred again, reaching down to casually rub her hard-on, before drifting back on to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just grinned to herself.

She tweaked her sensitive nipples and then squeezed her \"borrowed\" breasts together, then closed her eyes again. As she thought of all the fun she'd be having from now on now that she had her powers back, she fell asleep contented. And also amused, knowing that her brothers both had her friends' pussies between their legs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan awoke when she felt Lindsay stirring next to her, and for a moment she forgot about the swaps she had done. \"Hey, how about letting me borrow your bra? mine snapped.\" Megan smirked, asking Lindsay, whose much smaller boobs were swimming her brassiere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised, it was way too small, idiot!\" Lindsay responded, yawning. She then removed and threw Megan her bra, going without one herself for now. Lindsay then stood up and stretched, her shapely ass on view for Megan to see. Turning around, Megan almost bust out laughing at the sight of Kurt's large package trying to escape her friend's panties. Talk about a case of 'morning wood'. \"Ugh, I'm gonna get rid of this boner.\" Lindsay said nonchalantly, scratching her cock through her navy panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lindsay had left the room for now, Megan put on her friend's bra, securing her DD's in place, then she looked over to a still sleeping Kelly on the floor, her mouth open and snoring. Danny's penis was currently flaccid between Kelly's Asian legs, but she knew that wouldn't last. There was still a sizeable bulge in her underwear. \"Hey, wake up!\" Megan shouted, throwing a sock at Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... fuck off Meg!\" Kelly groaned, turning onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fuck off! We're in my house, now get your lazy ass up.\" Megan told her, smirking as she crawled across the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly groaned louder. \"Fuck's sake girl, fine!\" She said, stretching and yawning before sitting up. \"Man, I have to pee!\" She said, getting up to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to wait, Lindsay is in the bathroom jerking off.\" Megan grinned, laying back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always!\" Kelly rolled her eyes. \"HEY SKANK... HURRY UP IN THE BATHROOM!\" She shouted loudly, as she began to get dressed, ready to start the day. Megan did the same, and she enjoyed the way her punk-motif shirt pulled tight across her new tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a good day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all she had been without for a while and she wanted to break them in again. Peering out of the window, she smirked upon seeing a few people. A parcelman delivering something to a house across the street got her attention first. The middle-aged blonde woman who had answered the door in her bathrobe was chatting to the delivery guy. She probably looked better later in the day, but first thing in the morning... not so much. Megan knew the woman's name, Michaela, she was split from her husband and probably fancied the mailman or something, since she talked to him a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want what's in his pants so badly, here...\" Megan smirked, swapping the pair. One of the woman's hands left the box she was holding and went down to her bathrobe, making sure her erection didn't appear through the folds since she wasn't wearing any panties. The late 20's parcelman had promptly 'delivered' another package to the woman, his own, and was now the owner of her mature pussy lips. And they continued chatting, Megan just snickered and looked elsewhere in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young mother walking her two young children to school was next. She was a brunette, about mid 30's and she had a 10-year old son and a 7-year old daughter in tow as she walked down the street. She wasn't in the best shape and carried around a little excess weight around the hips and waist, but she wasn't too bad. Which was good for the young boy, whose head was soon swapped onto his mother's body. He was now the tallest of the three at 5'6\", and he was wearing his mother's former white sweater, her jeans and her tennis shoes, not to mention her bra and panties. <i>No need for thanks kid.</i> Megan again thought, before also deciding to target the boy's sister too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Have your brother's boobs.\"</i> Megan grinned, swapping the boy's new C-cup breasts onto his little sister... and stretching out her little dress. The boy was now flat chested again, but would be developing some new boobs in a few years for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family disappeared from view, Megan searched the streets for more 'victims', and soon found a couple in the form of two unrelated strangers. A Latina high school girl suddenly lost the long dark ponytail she was sporting on her head and gained a middle-aged white man's short, chesnut-brown haircut. The guy on the other hand looked even weirer than the girl with her long ponytailed hair. \"Ahh, I can do better than that.\" Megan told herself, also exchanging the girl's juicy ass with the man's flatter, older one. The man kept walking as a shapely teenage Latina ass and hips stretched his corderoy pants to the point of splitting. On the flipside, the girl had to grab her own jeans to stop them from falling down off her narrow hips and flat butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm back bitches!\" Megan once again grinned, before deciding her next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly was the first one she called, and it took a while for the girl to answer her phone, as was usual. While she was waiting, Megan pointed at a passing black girl in her late teens, swapping her ebony ass and hips over to a skinny middle-aged guy with a beard and mustache. The white guy's grubby jeans stretched drastically as his 'ghetto' ass and wide hips took up residence in them, while the teenager's shorts became loose fitting around her now flat, male butt and narrow hips. Megan chuckled to herself as the two walked on, unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Kelly eventually answered. \"What's up Megs?\" Kelly said, calling Megan by the name she always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you come and meet me, I've got something extra awesome to share with you?\" Megan said over the phone, grinning and rubbing her snatch through her tight leggings and watching more people pass her by in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Now?\" Kelly asked. \"My mom has me kinda doing something.\" She grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, this is better!\" Megan promised her. \"This will take priority.\" Megan said, pointing at another couple of passersby. This time it was a 12-year old girl and who looked to be her uncle in his early to mid 20's. <i>Back to puberty for you dude.</i> Megan smirked, as the man's head was sucked down into his body, and seconds later it popped up on his neice's young body... and vice-versa. And this time the man would be having periods as he went through puberty, which amused Megan no end. She felt like she'd done the girl a favor, as it looked down her new adult male body was quite athletic and she was sporting a decent sized package in her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, where do you want to meet up?\" Kelly sighed, hearing Megan chuckle over the phone. Curiosity had got the better of Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside the park, and bring Lindsay with you if you can. She'll want to see this too.\" Megan said, before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Megan set off towards the park to meet up with her friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But being curious (some would say nosey), she took a quick detour and found out where the voices were coming from. A family of three, standing by their car arguing about where to go for their day out. The parents were in their late 30's and they had a 13-year old son just listening to his parents have at each other. \"Really? Arguing over some stupid shit?\" Megan mumbled, rolling her eyes, before a wicked grin appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you had something common with your husband.\" Megan smirked, swapping the mother's vagina for her son's puberty-stricken cock. The bulge that formed in her jeans wasn't that big, but from her reaction Megan could tell that she had instantly popped a boner. And Megan saw the woman staring at the ass of a teenage girl who passed by, before returning to arguing with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son meanwhile, now with his mother's mature snatch sat between his skinny legs, wasn't feeling as horny as he had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you should be able to understand your wife more.\" Megan continued, this time targeting the father, who was a tall man, about 6'2\" and had an average build. Megan swapped him with a mid 20's brunette woman across the street, a chubby-ish woman who was nonetheless pretty. The woman's round, jiggly D-cup breasts shriveled under her top, replaced by the father's hairy, flat chest. The dad meanwhile had his button-down shirt push outward as he gained his new tits, which were bigger than his wife's C-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that gives him an advantage over her.\" Megan reasoned, now that the husband had bigger boobs than his wife and a bigger dick. \"Easily remedied.\" She grinned, clicking her fingers again. This time the dad's pants lost some of the definition in front as his junk regressed back to puberty, and the mom's jeans had the bulge in them swell noticeably larger as she acquired her husband's larger cock and nustack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Now run along before your son starts his period.\" Megan laughed to herself, before getting back on track to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having way too much fun with her new power. And she had only just started.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked up a small brush and smoothed out the top of her black &amp; purple fauxhawk before she raised it up to her lips and yelled along to the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a quiet groan as she pulled on a tight Black Flag top and draped her signature beaten-up, black leather jacket over her thin shoulders. She hopped her way down the corridor and gasped as she saw Kelly's naked body splayed wildly on top of Lindsay's sleeping form (also naked). <i>'Oh my God, I knew it...'</i> Megan gasped, <i>'She FINALLY did it!'</i> Megan had always known that Kelly had a crush on her fellow bandmate but she'd been sworn to secrecy after a tense altercation with Kelly a couple years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grinned profusely as she closed the door and slipped on a pair of tattered jeans and old combat boots. She bolted down the stairs and slipped out, closing the door quietly behind her. She sucked in the sweet scent of the serene summer day, listening to the shrill chirping of the birds in the treetops as she watched the people of the neighbourhood go about their daily lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plump woman who Megan recognised as Mrs Andrews was the first person to experience Megan's changes, unmoved as her impressive bust shrunk back into her pink floral blouse while she attended to her front garden. Megan chuckled as she watched a Girl Scout going door to door stumble slightly as her impressive G-cups erupted from her front. She'd been having trouble selling the cookies before but Megan reckoned that this would help her out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smartly dressed lady who'd been strutting down the street with a briefcase suddenly stopped and looked down at herself in shock, cupping her juicy D-cups in full view of everyone else with no regard for the consequences. Meanwhile a horny preteen boy who'd been staring at the woman began to get very flustered, pawing nervously at the small erection building in his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple that had been casually making love to each other suddenly had their heads sucked into the folds of their necks only for a pair of infant children's heads to pop up a second later. The couple's bodies had stopped making out and were now chasing each other down the street, narrowly missing a pair of 7-year-olds (with suspiciously mature heads and faces) who were now hugging each other intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A breast swap, a body swap AND a headswap,\" Megan giggled. \"I forgot how GOOD I was at this crap!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Susan hadn\u2019t admitted it at the time she\u2019d arrived but she\u2019d found herself quite hot and bothered when her older sis had introduced her to her finely developed young boys, both of which she\u2019d have definitely tried to sleep with on a night out had they not been connected by blood. The last time she\u2019d seen them they\u2019d both been in their awkward prepubescent phase. She\u2019d done a decent job of keeping her more surreptitious thoughts at bay during her stay at the Bronson-Carter household but the gypsy lady\u2019s power had unlocked her more primal lustful tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty she would\u2019ve preferred to have Kurt to use as a test subject, what with his broad shoulders and bodybuilding physique, but as the saying goes, \u2018beggars can\u2019t be choosers\u2019. In some respects Danny was actually more appealing to her. In contrast to Kurt\u2019s well-above-average body, his personality was quite two dimensional and tedious; Susan could never seem to hold a conversation with him for more than a minute without him veering off into scientific jargon or athletic gobbledygook.  Plus, she thought, she\u2019d already seen Danny give her an occasional glance when he thought she wasn\u2019t looking. Even now Susan noticed Danny blush as he popped an uncomfortable boner in his joggers. It\u2019d been easy for her to lure him into the room as he did practically anything to please her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was especially fascinated by Danny\u2019s erect equipment- on her journey back home from the gypsy lady she\u2019d grafted an impressive cock onto the petite frame of a blue-haired college student and ever since she\u2019d been drooling over the idea of getting her own set of manmeat. No random stranger would do though- she wasn\u2019t that into stealing a random pair of balls and finding out she\u2019d also inherited one of their STD\u2019s- and Danny seemed the sensible type. However, his new girlfriend was quite the looker and Susan could understand if he\u2019d secretly popped his cherry in an intense moment of passion. But enough of getting sidetracked, it was time to get down to business. Her eyes fluttered as she quietly mumbled the incantation the gypsy\u2019d taught her before she\u2019d vanished into thin air. Suddenly a cold breeze pushed its way into the room, blowing Susan\u2019s blonde hair into her eyes and bowling Danny off of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Susan groaned as she felt something stirring in her pelvic region. She grasped the wall mounted radiator with white knuckles as she felt her vaginal walls collapse and fold into a lump of excess skin. Then the malleable pulp began to stretch and contort until it became more cylindrical. Susan groaned again, more out of pleasure than of shock this time around, as the nub gained form and grew considerably, throbbing aggressively inside the fragile seams of her lace panties. Susan\u2019s cheeks flashed bright scarlet as she brusquely pulled down her bottoms and fondled the monstrous cock in her manicured fingers. <i>Holy sh*t,</i> she screamed internally as she bit her lip in excitement, <i>The kid\u2019s hung like a horse! Oh God, how the hell does he resist the urge to not whack off with this monster?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan heard a cough from behind her. Sh*t. Susan blushed as Danny stood awkwardly by the door with the box of CD\u2019s strewn across the carpeted floor. \u201cErm, sorry, I dropped the box,\u201d he mumbled while scratching his head nervously. Susan was still feeling slightly overwhelmed by the sexual thrill her new addition had given her and nodded blankly. God, had he been watching the whole time? Suddenly Susan felt a lot more self-conscious. \u201cEr, sorry \u2018bout that little display Danno, didn\u2019t know you were still hanging around,\u201d she said as she moved her hands to cover her raging boner. Danny rubbed his head. \u201cN-Nah, i-it\u2019s fine Aunt Susan, it\u2019s completely normal. Basically everyone does it these days and I guess it is your room...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smirked- seems the gypsy wasn\u2019t lying when she said that most victims wouldn\u2019t notice their changes unless she purposefully willed them to. To Danny there was nothing wrong with Susan having a penis and touching herself up (other than the fact that she was his mum\u2019s sister and he\u2019d stumbled across her masturbating- yeah, he\u2019d be scarred for life). She helped Danny pack the contents up again and sent him off with a wave, shutting the door quietly as his feet pitter-pattered down the staircase. She turned the latch on the door to lock it- no more intruders, at least not until she\u2019d gotten a good look of her new genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shimmied out of her skirt and paced over to the large mirror Kurt had kindly left in the corner of the room. She giggled as she struck a pose in the reflection, admiring how Danny\u2019s engorged meat looked on her feminine frame. She loved how the pale complexion of her skin contrasted with Danny\u2019s darker cock. It reminded her of one of those old Vatican wall arts, the beautiful paintings with the pronounced outlines and shameless nudity. She herself was now her own piece of art, a scientific anomaly, an anatomical enigma. She\u2019d recently developed quite an affinity for cockgirls and to be one was giving her that rush that came from indulging in a fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be on the brink of busting a nut and she considered doing one right now, just to get more <i>acquainted</i> with it. However, the initial release that\u2019d come from swapping her genitals had dissipated slightly and her body craved that feeling again. The power was like a concentrated hit of LSD, boosting her libido and awareness temporarily, leaving almost immediately and leaving her thirsty for more. She\u2019d looked out of the window before calling in her nephew and noticed that the streets outside were crammed with potential swapees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sinister grin briefly appeared on Susan's face, only to be replaced by a more content, warmer smile as she gave her 'borrowed' genitalia a good squeeze with one of her manicured hands. Sure she'd just grafted her youngest nephew's large penis and testicles onto herself, but she didn't feel guilty, not when Danny remained oblivious and thought having a vagina between his legs was normal. She picked her skirt up off the floor and stepped back into it, zipping it up. However it definitely fit tighter than before and there was no hiding the bulge in front caused by her raging erection. She exhaled slowly out of her puckered lips as she rubbed her crotch again, then she sauntered out of her room and headed for Kourtney's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tilted her head slightly and paused, then smiled and knocked on her neice's door. \"Come in.\" Kourtney's familiar tone rang out. Susan did just that and smiled at her neice as she closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, how you doing?\" Susan asked, starting with small talk. She also admired her neice's 5'11\", svelte form as she spoke to her. Kourtney had definitely acquired some of her father's genes, in particular his tendency to be tall. Kourtney, even at 17 years old, towered over her aunt by a full five inches. Although Susan did have on a pair of 3-inch heels which helped her out. Kourtney was barefoot at the moment, but it was clear from the rest of her stylish outfit that she was getting ready to go out somewhere. And even then, Susan knew she'd be wearing her favorite white &amp; pink sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay aunt Susan. Why?\" Kourtney replied, thinking something was wrong maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan laughed, shaking her head. \"Nothing is wrong love, absolutely nothing. I just thought I'd... check on you. And maybe let you in on a secret.\" Susan said, lowering her voice at the end of the sentence into a hushed tone. She felt her massive cock throb again in her lace panties as she had a chat with her neice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret?\" Kourtney's ears perked up. She liked secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan just nodded. \"Sure. The secret that I can... um... switch people's traits around.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kourtney frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Susan nonetheless smiled. \"I have a pretty cool power, to swap people's body parts around. You know, take something from one person and give it to another, and vice-versa.\" She explained in laymans terms. And as she did so, she focused on letting Kourtney be aware of any swaps she made, including the ones she had done already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney was about to call bullshit when she saw her grinning aunt reaching down to stroke the obvious bulge in her skirt. The girl's eyes widened, then widened still further when her aunt removed her skirt again and let it drop to the floor. There was no mistake the large penis stuffed into her underwear, and Kourtney remembered having seen her aunt semi-naked before, and the bulge definitely hadn't been there. \"What the fuck!?\" She blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it look? Does it suit me? It feels sooo good.\" Susan giggled, striking poses as Kourtney just stood staring at her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how.... did you... um...\" Kourtney gulped, before her aunt cut her off, explaining everything. After the initial acceptance of her aunt's condition, Kourtney agreed to feel her cock through her panties, just to confirm it was real. And it was at that moment a smirking Susan informed her neice that she had swapped with her brother Danny. \"Eww!\" Kourtney drew her hand back from her aunt's masculine crotch, grimacing. \"That's my brother's dick!?\" She spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually, and I was pretty shocked at just how big he is down there... er... here.\" Susan nodded, patting her aching member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney stepped back, then nodded in astonishment. \"Well, yeah, so am I. I mean I knew Kurt was probably big down there, but I wouldn't have guessed it of Danny.\" She admitted. She was amused by the thought of her brother having a pussy between his legs, especially his own aunt's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grinned again. \"I don't think Kurt is as big as his little brother is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean as big as YOU are.\" Kourtney responded, beginning to smile finally. And it was then that Susan knew she had her accomplice in her favorite neice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, because this is mine now, for as long as I want.\" Susan murmured, again moaning a little as she caressed her lace-covered package. \"And I'll tell you right now, it feels amazing having manmeat between your legs sweetie.\" She winked. \"No wonder boys are always playing with themselves.\" She giggled once more, as Kourtney took the whole situation in and began to come around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it feels... different, yeah.\" Kourtney nodded. \"Your power is... amazing. Bet you're glad you met that gypsy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but enough of that. What say we have some fun?\" Susan waved her hand idly, as she walked back to retrieve her skirt again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI... I dunno, Aunt Susan.\u201d Susan frowned, forcing Kourtney to take a verbal backspace. \u201cNot because I don\u2019t want to hang out with you! Seriously, having a girl round the house whose fashion sense isn\u2019t just limited to \u2018edgy\u2019 black eyeliner or floral sweatpants is refreshing to say the least. Trust me, it\u2019d give me, like, the most joy to run around town screwing with all the f*cking losers in this deadend town but my schedule\u2019s already booked for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed and smacked her forehead. \u201cKourtney, honey, you must know that I\u2019ve put a lot of trust in you right now. I could\u2019ve made your brother my accomplice when I called him to my room. Hell, I trusted you enough to tell you before my own godforsaken sister! I honestly expected a very different response from you, my <i>favourite</i> niece, but I get it- I\u2019m <i>used</i> to disappointment.\u201d Susan sniffled, her lips curling into a deep pout and her mouth wobbling as she began sobbing. She stuffed her face in her hands and waited for Kourtney to console her. After a few awkward seconds Susan\u2019s resolve was waning and she peeked upwards. Kourtney was absolutely unfazed and towered over her with her arms crossed defiantly. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun,\u201d Susan whined as she stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney laughed and chucked a pillow at her Aunt. \u201cYou need to get yourself a refund on those acting classes,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWasn\u2019t believable at all. Look at you, couldn\u2019t even muster a tear.\u201d Susan rolled her eyes as she brushed herself down. \u201cBloody Mr Rivaldo, I\u2019m gonna give that two-bit hack a piece of mind when I see him next Monday! Eh, I thought I\u2019d try it anyway. Used to work on you <i>all</i> the time back when you were a little tyke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, back then anything and everything would work on me. Amount of times that that she-demon trickster of a Mum tricked me into going to the dentist by saying that Justin Bieber was performing a surprise concert...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, that\u2019s my sister you\u2019re talking about!\u201d They both giggled. \u201cWait, <i>\u2019Justin Bieber\u2019</i>?\u201d Kourtney blushed as she ducked her reddened cheeks inside of her wardrobe. \u201cOkay, maybe I had a little crush but that was years ago...\u201d Susan nodded knowingly, spying a frayed teen Bieb poster on the inside of the closet door with red kiss marks splattered across his face. Kourtney noticed her glance and squealed apprehensively. She slammed the door, nearly tearing it off its hinges in an impressive feat of strength, and sealed it off with her body. \u201cTell you what,\u201d she said, \u201cHow about you come with me? <i>You</i> get to try out your gypsy powers some more and <i>I</i> get you the hell away from my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Susan laughed was she rearranged her cock much to Kourtney\u2019s dismay. \u201cYeah, can your powers get that mental image of you having my brother\u2019s uncomfortably large wang out of my head?\u201d Kourtney sighed as her Aunt chuckled instead of answering. \u201cWhatever. Just try not to embarrass me there. I\u2019ve got a social reputation to uphold and, no offence, bringing my Auntie as a chaperone to a party would be social suicide all by itself if I didn\u2019t run everything in this town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan kissed her teeth. \u201cKourtney, I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble of preconceived prejudices about me, but your Aunt here is no stranger to the rave scene. It\u2019s only been a few months since I\u2019ve been to the club, y\u2019know. Know what, my mates back in Uni used to call me <i>\u2018Six-Pack Susan\u2019</i> \u2018cause I downed three full crates of beer in half an hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you drop out of Uni after only two months?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Didn\u2019t stop me from getting a plaque on the wall of the co-Ed bathrooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney sighed. She went back to her closet. She debated over her choices yet again before finally settling on an outfit and laying it on her bed. \u201cFine. But never say the word \u2018rave\u2019 again. Like, ever. Everything will be alright just as long as I crush that f*cking pest, Imra Lynch. She thinks she\u2019s <i>so</i> f*cking perfect, w-with her cute face, her stupid intoxicatingly lush hair, her...her fresh strawberry scented perfume...\u201d Kourtney coughed as she realised Susan was staring right at her. \u201cOoh, do I sense some sexual tension there?,\u201d the Uni dropout cooed playfully. Kourtney threw another pillow at Susan, this time with deadly accuracy that smacked her Aunt square in the nose and bowled her off the bed. <i>Thanks for those useless baseball lessons, Dad,</i> she thought to herself as Susan raised her hands in surrender. She twirled and strutted into the cosy en-suite bathroom hidden beside her closet doors, locking the door behind her afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will never understand how that girl blagged her way into a private shower when I have to share a bathroom with all the rest of these savages,\u201d Susan mumbled to herself as she picked herself off the floor. A thought came to her mind and she cupped her hand round her mouth to say, \u201cYou know what babe, I can give you a cock of your own if you wanna get all up close and dirty with this little friend of yours...\u201d The bathroom door creaked open and out popped a single middle finger. Susan howled with laughter- her niece had no sense of decency.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moving into his ex-wife\u2019s house with her new boyfriend probably wasn\u2019t the best decision he\u2019d ever made (it certainly wasn\u2019t the worst) but he was broke and desperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I won\u2019t be in just a couple more seconds...</i> he thought as he stared intensely at the TV screen.

He picked it up and scanned it quickly: there was a note on the side and it just said, <i>\u2019OPEN ME\u2019</i>. Reggie swivelled his head and tore open the wrapping to expose a box inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reggie yelped as his scalp collided against a rigid ceiling of reinforced plastic. He swore under his breath as his mind spun for a second. He reasoned his head was in some sort of dome but it was hard for him to get his bearings as there was a strange dark film draped across the surface of it. His nose wrinkled- there was something quite queer about the smell inside. It stunk of bleach and all the assorted chemicals that his ex-spouse loved to \u2018maintain\u2019 her hair with. He spotted a few stray hairs stuck to the side of the translucent wall and figured that he most likely wasn\u2019t the first person to be stuck inside there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Where the hell am I?,\u2019</i>Reggie mumbled to himself. No-one would be ecstatic if a random package had sucked them into a claustrophobic dome but Reggie was understandably more discomforted than most. He\u2019d been drowning his sorrows late into the night beforehand and his breath was a repugnant hodgepodge of booze, cigs and dodgy pizza. <i>Talking about pizza,</i> Reggie thought. After the lotto numbers he\u2019d normally get a tad hungry and order pizza but for whatever reason his eating urges had dissipated. He tried to shuffle himself out of the dome but to his surprise his body didn\u2019t respond. Mattter of fact, he couldn\u2019t even <i>feel</i> it anymore! He squirmed some more, his breathing getting ragged as he did so, but still nothing- all sensation below his neck had completely gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap, oh crap, crap..,\u201d he whimpered as the dark filter on the bowl around his head faded away to show beaming fluorescent lights glaring down into his eyes. He squinted and tried to cover his face with hands he no longer had while a cacophony of whooping, whistles and applause erupted from what Reggie could tell were either a live television audience or the most animated group of zoo animals he\u2019d ever seen. As more lights flashed onto the stage (Reggie realised it was a stage once he saw the polished vinyl floors and inexplicably large prize wheel to the side), it became apparent that he was on some sort of game show. He winced as a loudspeaker blared out, \u201cComing to you, live, on behalf of the TG corporation, ladies and gentlemen, get ready to watch our competitors assemble themselves...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd all changed in unison. <b><i>\u201dPIECE! BY! PIECE!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Piece By Piece\u2019?,</i> Reggie thought. <i>Great, the mail sent me to one of those cringeworthy eleven pm gameshows that no-one watches unless they\u2019re getting ready for retirement or prematurely balding.</i> Reggie paused. He breathed a sigh of relief as he checked his hair in the mirror. Then he turned back to the stage and watched as two reasonably attractive people walked onto the stage arm-in-arm, waving and blowing kisses to their adoring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019re you all doing tonight, ladies and gents?,\u201d the bloke on the right proclaimed in a heavily slathered Scottish accent. He seemed to ooze charisma as he pointed to the crowd, one especially star struck middle-aged lady in the front actually swooned so hard she collapsed in the floor, leaving her flustered friends having to fight her up again. Reggie himself could understand why- no homo but the guy with his chiselled features, five-o-clock shadow and dapper tux it was easy to understand why all the ladies in the house (and a few of the men too) looked hot and bothered in their seats. His dark hair was tousled to the side like an early millennial rockstar and judging by the boisterous way he strutted forward he acted like he was one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dhresource.com/0x0/f2/albu/g10/M01/BD/D7/rBVaWVyUmomAb3MvAACIDYuKuL0234.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dhresource.com/0x0/f2/albu/g...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the woman on his hip was the one that Reggie really had his sights on. Her demeanour was calm and tender but the sly grin on her glossed lips told Reggie that she had a playful side to her. Her off-the-shoulder dress conformed to her body\u2019s measurements perfectly, the velvet material exposing nothing whilst hugging every curve of her lithe body. Her long hair cascaded downwards as she cocked her head to the side, her hazel eyes glittering mischievously as they scanned the crowd in front of her. Her auburn skin glowed radiantly as the spotlights beamed on her, entrancing Reggie with its soft afterglow. Though certain \u2018assets\u2019 may not have even come close to the magnitude of those possessed by Diann, there was something inexplicably seductive about her that caused a slew of dirty thoughts to hover around in Reggie\u2019s lewd head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/00/1b/1d001b2e7802ccd3d2c48f8b38f11ff8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/00/1b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re your hosts, Zaynab and Kyle,\u201d the woman spoke in dulcet North-African tones. \u201cAs always, we promise to give you all a <i>very</i> entertaining instalment of our show tonight. So,\u201d she paused for dramatic effect, \u201cAre you all ready to start assembling our competitors?!\u201d Reggie frowned as the crowd frantically began cheering again. <i>Assembly?,</i> he thought. <i>Competitors?!</i> Suddenly black curtains which had divided up the stage crashed to the floor, revealing two new strangers to the world. Reggie gasped- like him, both of them had their heads trapped in translucent domes but underneath them were no signs of their previous bodies! Instead there were Greek-inspired pillars with strange collar-like-devices that connected the two. Reggie\u2019s eyes flashed downwards- he couldn\u2019t see his himself but he assumed he was in the same position as his body continued to not respond. He wriggled angrily as the two hosts moved to interview the other contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to be interviewed looked to be a relatively standard quinquagenarian with pale, wrinkled skin and a receded brown hairline. He had sparse stubble around his mouth and his chin was puffy   There was a dopey smile on his face as Zaynab lowered a microphone down to his case. \u201cOoh, I\u2019m so excited to be here, aren\u2019t you, eh?,\u201d he chirped in chipper Canadian. \u201cOopsie, silly me, I nearly forgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m Gavin. I\u2019m 54 from Scarborough, Toronto, representing all my Canucks back home! I\u2019m on the show today because... Well, mine and my wife\u2019s sex life has gotten a bit...<i>STALE</i> and I\u2019m hoping I can scoot in and take home a body that\u2019s a bit less dysfunctional. Plus, the cash prize will let me get some Timbits and two-fours for my boys back home, eh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laugh that came out of Zaynab\u2019s mouth sounded forced to Reggie\u2019s ears but the crowd still echoed it nonetheless. \u201cBrilliant! Well, all the best of luck to you sir!\u201d Gavin beamed as Kyle scooted around to the middle dome. Inside was a dorky Indian girl with unremarkable features and wide floral print specs that hung loosely on her cute button nose. She looked flustered as Kyle stared into her eyes and meekly stammered, \u201cErm, h-hello Kamya, I\u2019m Kyle. No! I mean, sorry, <i>YOU\u2019RE</i> Kyle, I\u2019m Kamya! H-hi, you\u2019re hair\u2019s nice... Oh, wait, sorry, no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle realised she was struggling and playfully interjected, \u201cOh, thanks sweetheart, yours too! Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a cutie!\u201d Kamya blushed profusely as Kyle twirled one of her twin plaits around his finger. \u201cSo Miss Kamya,\u201d he said, \u201cTell us some more about yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well I\u2019m 21-years-old from London. I\u2019m studying biomedical science at, erm, university.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny interesting facts about yourself that you want to tell our audience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, I dunno... My name apparently means <i>\u2018wish/desire\u2019</i> in Sanskrit. I guess that\u2019s somewhat interesting...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get your own \u2018wish or desire\u2019 today by the end of the show,\u201d Zaynab said as she finally crossed over to Reggie\u2019s case. As she bent over to angle the microphone in front of his mouth, Reggie couldn\u2019t help himself but take a quick peek at her bust. \u201cAnd you, Mr Dickson? What are you hoping to gain from today\u2019s show?\u201d Reggie looked around: every eye in the house was locked into him, the people expectantly waiting for his response. \u201cErm...\u201d He considered going into a huge rant about being kidnapped, being an unwilling participant in this strange game show and how he was going to report everyone in the studio to the police as soon as he got out. However, there was something unnerving about the soulless smirks on the crowd\u2019s faces that made him wonder whether anyone of them would allow him to leave if he actually did so. Moreover Zaynab\u2019s eyes bored into his eyes and down into his very spirit, weakening his resolve with their hypnotic glare and making him forget how to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I just really wanna go home with my body back.\u201d He finally breathed out as the crowd began to clap again. Zaynab grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s easier said than done, Mr Dickson. Alas, <i>ANYTHING\u2019S</i> possible on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201dPIECE! BY! PIECE!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!,\u201d Kyle exclaimed, \u201cAnd now it\u2019s time for our First Round! Competitors, get yourselves ready \u2018cause you\u2019re about to experience your first <i>\u2018Piece By Piece\u2019</i> challenge when you battle each other in...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Bored of life, bored of his half century of marriage, bored of his kids and grandkids, bored of his mundane daily routine that he repeated night and day in his rural little town in the South of England. He\u2019d long since tired of seeing the same people circle around him in a constant dance of greetings and goodbyes. It\u2019d been a couple years since his \u2018mindful\u2019 offspring had decided to leave both he and his spouse in their decrepit cesspit of a retirement home. In all honesty the facility wasn\u2019t half bad; free food and health care, constant reruns of all the classic sitcoms from his childhood and an endless supply of witless goons to challenge him to a game of checkers, chess, blackjack and all the rest. But after three years of constant winning against men and women whose memories were a bit spotty to say the least, the lustre had dissipated and there was little satisfaction from triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven today he was locked into a game of poker twenty-one with an old codger named Henry. Henry claimed he\u2019d been adept at cards earlier in his life, so skilled at gambling that he\u2019d apparently earned a pretty penny whilst serving in the trenches and used it to build his own business post war. Now he seemed a shadow of himself, squinting through his bulky lenses and forgetting the rules of the game many a time. Rolph rolled his eyes and flicked his long brown hair from his face\u2014the tips of his straightened locks were tickling his cute button nose and causing causing a needless distraction for him. He\u2019d have to ask his wife to tie it up into one of those tidy French buns later on. For now though he\u2019d just have to tolerate it whipping into his face. The game was in his favour despite his hair troubles. Rolph\u2019s mind was as sharp and as clear as glass, even at the tender age of 76. He remembered a doctor diagnosing him with Alzheimer\u2019s a couple years back. He\u2019d been devastated by the news at the time but now wiondered whether the doctor had somehow gotten it wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the circumstances he was certainly caring better than poor old Henry. The old bastard had gone busy yet again, the old compulsion to go big or go home too alluring for the man to resist. Rolph scooped his \u2018winnings\u2019 (if you could even call them that\u2014it was only a couple of five quid notes with a couple food vouchers, some buttercandies and a war memorial badge) into a satchel sat on his lap with his dainty hands before thanking Henry for the spoils and excusing himself from the table. Unlike most of the other septuagenarians at the home, Rolph\u2019s knees neither creaked nor wobbled as he stood up and he was feeling a little more spry than usual. He slipped on his brown loafers, scratched an itch on one of his plump boobs underneath the ugly woolen sweater his wife had knitted him and pulled the fabric of his boxer shorts out of his crack. His wife had recommended him to borrow some of her lingerie to properly compliment his junk (or lack therof) but Rolph was a proud man and would rather experience a cold draught in his khakis from time to time before he would allow others to think he was an effeminate crossdresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolph walked by and said his hellos to a couple more patrons before walking outside and approaching his wife\u2019s knitting circle beside the home\u2019s gardens. Maude was a sweet thing: kind, caring, wonderful with children but a tad too tame for Rolph\u2019s tastes. They\u2019d met as young lovebirds. She\u2019d been beautifully innocent but captivating, looking like Jane Fonda with her side-swept bangs and blue eyes while he sported a messy mop top akin to John Lennon. Or did he? His memory seemed to have warped in his mind\u2014funny, he distinctly remembered his brunette hair the same as it was now, a crude middle parting with fraying hairs sprouting up from where he\u2019d not bothered to brush them down. Weird, his mind seemed to have pictured someone else. He strode up to the group and greeted everyone in turn, getting wet kisses on his soft cheek from each woman in the circle. His wife didn\u2019t seem to mind as much\u2014most of the women in the home had become widows at one point in time and it was normal for them to get a bit flirtatious with the other men, especially ones in such good shape as Rolph. Sure, he may have looked feminine with his womanly curves, but he still presented himself as a man and the old girls slobbered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally made his rounds and gave Maude a light peck on her wrinkled lips. They\u2019d been married for so long that they\u2019d learnt to keep their displays of affection scarce and brisk. Rolph told his wife he was retiring to bed early and she waved him off before going back to her seminar on the nuanced differences between crocheting and knitting. Rolph grinned as he walked back towards his and Maude\u2019s shared room on the floor below ground level. He locked the door behind him and peered out the peephole to make sure no-one followed. He seemed giddy as he walked over to the old wardrobe in the corner of the room, standing on tiptoes to reach for the inconspicuous suitcase he\u2019d stashed there with a couple sets of clothes already packed inside. He pulled a small mobile phone from a secret compartment in the lining and hurriedly opened it, sending a flustered text that he was on his way. He shimmied out of his elderly attire and chucked on a fashionable polo, comfy jogging bottoms and a pair of branded sneakers he\u2019d stolen from his wife. As a final touch he pulled a cap over his hair, tucking the wayward strands inside before putting on a slimfit hoodie and pulling over the hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d pushed open the back window leading to the staff exit when another thought came to him. He rushed back to his bed and lay flat to pull something from underneath. Out came a standard cardboard box. He ripped off the lid and brought out the skimpy baby blue bikini he\u2019d hidden there months ago after a curious day of shopping. He stashed it inside the suitcase and moved back towards the door, turning back to take in the gravity of what he was doing before he squirmed outside and bounded through the unmanned gate. He giggled surreptitiously as he sprinted off of the grounds, waving down the Uber he\u2019d called up beforehand and hopping inside. His escape had been meticulously planned months prior although the steps he\u2019d taken were relatively easy. If his wife had caught him he\u2019d really be in the crap and there\u2019d be no opportunity for a redo. He\u2019d picked a day where his wife was orchestrating one of her knitting groups, knowing she\u2019d be blissfully unaware of him ducking away. He\u2019d subtly coaxed one of his children to buy him a phone separate from his family contract and had easily coerced a suitcase from one of their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he\u2019d be at the airport where his mistress would be patiently waiting for him. The name was Lupita and she was a sly vixen Rolph had met on a site he\u2019d caught his perverted teenage grandson browsing one day whilst babysitting. She was one hell of a looker, tanned Chilean skin, galumptious D-cups, supple thighs with an ornate rose etched onto the side of the left side. They\u2019d been talking frequently over the past year or so, lamenting their woes to one another; she was a college dropout, forced to quit school and work full time as a camgirl to provide for a family that resented her. He\u2019d been more than willing to indulge her escape fantasies as well as his own, telling her how he\u2019d been discarded into a home with all manner of senile old twits by his own family and how desperately he wished to escape from all of it. They\u2019d only met twice in person but felt it had been enough to plan their coming together in only a matter of a few short months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir age difference sounded horrendous on paper but Rolph felt no shame in being her sugar daddy of sorts. He\u2019d been hoarding money in a separate account in the Bahamas for longer than he could remember and relished the idea of travelling overseas and spoiling his South-American babe, putting effort to do whatever it took to make her happy as long as she could match his effort with her vivacity and enthusiasm. As he sat in the cab he felt some ounce of remorse for the life he\u2019d be leaving behind. His wife would be devastated at his disappearance, that was certain, and his family around her would surely share in the sadness. But he had to put that behind him. When he and Lupita had finished their journey and were standing on the deck of a yacht together,  the wind blowing their hair backwards as he clutched her tight to his bosom with the sea foam creating a delicate symphony of noise against the hull, he\u2019d finally be free. Free from the attachment of marriage, free from being stuck in a decrepit old care home, free to wear that beautiful bikini and show off his body to his beloved without the fear of scorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah,</i> he thought as the Uber trundled along the motorway. <i>That\u2019ll be the life.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m Gabby from <i>Transforming Genetics</i>, the world\u2019s leading company for genetic engineering and research!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...No, sir, this is not the call service for <i>Meats \u2018N\u2019 Treats</i>. No, I can\u2019t order you five triple-quarter-pounders. No, I can\u2019t patch you into my manager, I don\u2019t WORK there! Well I hope you choke on that dia-burger, you cocksucking, turd eating little sh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as her supervisor Rebecca strode past her, flashing her an exuberant smile to emphasise her productivity. She whispered through gritted teeth, \u201cListen here, you stupid assho...\u201d Gabby rolled her eyes as the line went dead. From the cubicle beside her she heard a slight giggle before her friend, Diann, called out, \u201cAnother customer cut off?\u201d Gabby sighed as she facepalmed- her clueless supervisor might not have caught on to her lack of customers but her abrasive tone to potential clients would DEFINITELY come up in the quarterly report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth is, Gabby was BORED. Bored out of her skull, out of her mind , whatever. All she knew was that she\u2019d been doing the same, mindless, mind-numbing task of taking phone calls for God knows how many years and she was still nowhere near her retirement. The only consolation was that she actually got on well with most of her coworkers and they\u2019d actually built strong friendships outside of the work walls. However, that was outside so before she could do anything interesting, Gabby had to endure the painstakingly boring daily slog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby\u2019s mind took her back to that time a couple years ago when her daily routine had been shaken up completely and she\u2019d been given a chance to shake things up a bit in her mundane life. <i>\u2019Those days are past though,\u2019</i> she thought to herself, going back to the quick sketch she\u2019d made of a lanky figure in a dark cloak that obscured their eyes and limbs completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I can\u2019t be THAT ugly!\u201d Gabby nearly jumped out of her swivel chair in shock as the looming presence of the Entity stood ominously behind her. Gabby recovered quickly, picking herself up and righting her chair before calmly smiling at all the confused faces looking over to her. <i>\u201dYou don\u2019t even understand how happy I am that you\u2019re back,\u201d</i> she whispered as she picked up the phone and pretended to be on call. <i>\u201dWhat happened to the little girl act?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurns out people aren\u2019t as scared of little pigtailed girls as my masseuse Yolenka told me. Here\u2019s a tip: don\u2019t try and threaten to permanently inflate someone\u2019s balls in a squeaky, prepubescent girl\u2019s voice. It doesn\u2019t exactly inspire fear into the person you\u2019re dealing with. That\u2019s why I decided to come with the OG Trait-Thief threads. People have to take me seriously now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, whatever.  Can I get my powers back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo proper introduction? No witty retort about my \u2018threads\u2019, no nicknames like <i>Creepy Cloak Guy</i>, no mention of my sudden appearance inside of your office out of the blue after 3 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, just want the abilities. Imbue me with power, O\u2019 great and powerful one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow: you really ARE desperate to get your powers back. Well I\u2019m sorry to say that due to my <i>\u2019careless empowerment and reckless endangerment\u2019</i>, I\u2019ve been exiled from my position as a Thief and so I cannot give you powers,\u201d Gabby\u2019s face dropped, \u201cin the conventional way.\u201d Although she couldn\u2019t actually see his face underneath the dark hood, she could sense that a devious smile had stretched across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the recesses of his coat with a bony finger, rummaging around for a second before pulling out a beautiful, intricate orange gem that gleamed seductively against the bland demeanour of the office. <i>\u2019Woah,\u2019</i> Gabby marvelled. \u201cThis, Gabrielle, is the coveted Blood Diamond of the ancient Middle East, the very same one used by Ibrahim the Valiant to expel the wicked Queen Nahira from the Sheban throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember hearing that from somewhere... Wasn\u2019t the stone used to create a portal though? How\u2019re you going to use it to get me powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity grinned. \u201cIbrahim was no magician. He was a simple, brutish soldier whose narrow mindedness led to him using the stone at its minimum capacity. In my hands...I mean \u2018<i>ours</i>\u2019, we can really become a force to reckon with. What say you? Do you accept my proposition?\u201d He held the gem over her head, magicking up a golden chain so he could drape it around her slender neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d She stayed still as the Entity put it round her neck before tucking it between her breasts for safekeeping. \u201cSo how does this wo-\u201c Gabby\u2019s sentence was interrupted as a sudden flood of power and energy entered her,  infiltrating every facial orifice and lighting them up in an orange glow. Just as suddenly as it started, the feeling ended and everything was back to normal albeit Gabby\u2019s bun looked a bit messier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Woah.\u2019</i> She stared at her dainty, nail polished fingers, turning them over as she felt the dormant energy stormed into her fingertips. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, I feel so... so... POWERFUL!\u201d Her eyes flickered around before locking onto Rebecca, her increasingly annoying supervisor that refused to leave anyone to their own devices. She made short work of changing her around, donating her modest C- cups and toned stomach to Richie in return for his hairy chest and beer belly before taking the definition from her backside and giving over to ever-awkward Tim who was now packing a moderately sized rump for a woman in her mid 40s. As a final touch, Gabby exchanged her personality with Ricardo, watching as she began to slouch and drag her feet round, her passion for looking into other people\u2019s business instantly fleeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see that... Entity?\u201d Gabby spun around. The Entity was nowhere to be found. She shrugged- if he was gone that just meant she had more freedom to do whate- <b><i>\u201dYes, Gabrielle, I DID see that and I\u2019ve go to say, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</i></b> Gabby gulped- for a second, she\u2019d been unable to control her mouth and although the voice that escaped was hers, it definitely wasn\u2019t her saying it. <i>\u2019How are you...\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your head? Simple: when you consented to me giving you the necklace, you also consented for me to inhabit your body and co-exist with you for the foreseeable future- haven\u2019t you ever heard the phrase, <i>\u2019read the fine print\u2019</i>?\u201d The Entity giggled in Gabby\u2019s feminine voice, spinning around in the swivel chair like an overexcited child. \u201cYour eagerness to escape the, how\u2019d you describe it, \u2018daily slog\u2019 made you more than willing to agree to be my new body mate while I hide out from the rest of the Trait Thieves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby tried to cry out and rip off the necklace but for some reason couldn\u2019t even muster up the willpower to do so. She internally writhed around but it was to no avail- the Entity was firmly in control and free to do as he pleased. \u201cNow,\u201d he said with a mischievous grin plastered onto Gabby\u2019s face, \u201cit\u2019s time to cause some havoc.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He gave his tits a squeeze, all the while Gabby was aware of everything. She tried screaming inside her own head, to no avail. The Entiry was in control now, not just of her body, but of the manipulation of all flesh in her work place and beyond. He was perhaps the most mischievous/wicked of the Trait Thieves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing two more of Gabby's co-workers, the Entity strolled over to them, identifying them (thanks to Gabby's memories and such) as Trent Lockheed, the company founder's sexist son, and physicist Emily Thompson. Trent, being his usual self was trying to force himself onto Emmy. Frankly, the Entity couldn't care less about the employees' feelings towards one another, but this scene was too delicious. He stood his new body close enough to hear the discussion the two were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just one drink after work Emily. You won't regret it.\" Trent grinned, showing off his ego as he sat on the end of a desk. He was dressed in his newest grey designer suit, but minus a tie, which he never wore. The thing was, Trent was handsome, but he knew it too, plus Emily wasn't into him that much and this annoyed him. He had tried chatting up Riley, the front desk receptionist several times, and although she was eager, he always cancelled their dates at the last minute, knowing he could do better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will Trent, I've heard of your last several dates. None of them ended well for the woman.\" Emily rolled her eyes, telling him straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever think how ironic the name of your company is Gabby? The '<i>Transformation Group</i>'?\" The Entity teased the owner of his shared body, as he remained in control. He enjoyed hearing her voice leaving his lips as he spoke. Meanwhile, Trent and Emily continued to converse/argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, Trent said something that precipitated a response from the Entity. \"Come on, you know want to get your hands on this?\" He winked, cupping his impressive package as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't.\" Emily snapped. \"Why would I want to touch the thing that you think with? It might cause brain damage.\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As insults go, I've heard better sweetheart.\" Trent said condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Emily should be able to touch his penis whenever she wants, right Gabby?\" The Entity said, turning to focus on the two employees. In no time, the evident bulge in the front of Trent's pants disappeared as his cock shrank away, along with his nutsack. As his equipment reformed into Emily's blonde snatch, he kept hitting on her, trying to 'break down the wall'. Emily, holding a clipboard in her hands, kept jotting something down even as her black skirt began distoring in front. As Trent's 8-inch cock spilled out into her panties... it stretched the fabric, and the bulge in her skirt only grew bigger as her ovaries dropped down into her new sack and formed into Trent's former balls, churning with semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you wouldn't want me sucking that big dick of yours?\" Trent smirked, eyeing the bulge in his co-worker's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent, go away!\" Emmy sighed, having had enough. \"Go buy a dildo or something. Oh that's right... you ARE a dildo!\" She feigned a smirk, before walking off to head into the ladies toilets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems he's just as irritating without Trent junior in his pants.\" The Entity giggled in Gabby's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked elsewhere.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a a malevolent grin stretched across her face as the Entity scooted over to the espresso machine. He pressed the button to activate the mechanical process but in reality he\u2019d just stood there to survey all of Gabby\u2019s coworkers. Sitting together at a table were Rosa, Aamil and Emmy and Gabby could feel herself vicariously experiencing arousal through the Entity as he scanned them all. Rosa was her usual enigmatic self, sipping her tea quietly with a stern glare in her eyes as Aamil and Emmy debated on the ethics behind dunking biscuits inside drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...All I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s a big difference between dunking digestives in tea and dunking bourbouns in lemonade,\u201d Aamil argued. A red vein had begun to throb on his temple, a telltale sign that he was beginning to lose his patience. Emmy giggled and rolled her eyes, blowing her dirty blonde hair out of her face as she chirped in her sweet American accent, \u201cYou need to stop being so pessimistic, Aamil! You can\u2019t knock it \u2018till you try it!\u201d The argument carried on and it seemed there\u2019d be no resolution to it. An incredulous sigh escaped Gabby\u2019s mouth before the Entity slapped his left palm over it; seems like he hadn\u2019t assumed complete control over her body as he\u2019d originally thought. Oh well. He punched himself in the stomach, feeling Gabby since from inside and temporarily weaken. Truth be told he was getting quite irked by the stupidity of the whole situation as well. He grinned as the gears in his mind started turning, his power clicking on almost instantaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cheekily groped his stolen breasts before walking over to the table, not bothering to stop the flow of coffee from the machine. He swiftly slid into the seat beside where Rosa was sitting and whispered to the person sitting there, \u201cSorry to disturb but Mr Lockheed is in urgent need of you in Laboratory 12.\u201d Aamil grumbled as he stood up, placing the mug of tea that\u2019d suddenly appeared in his manicured hands back onto the table. The Entity grinned as he observed Aamil\u2019s new form: in the past few seconds he\u2019d shrunk by a couple inches and, though he now possessed the alluring curves, plump C-cups and bubble butt of a MILF, his dark chocolate face was stuck between his pale new chin and neck and flowing brunette locks. \u201cWhatever. Emmy, this conversation isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said in a surprisingly sultry voice with traces of Italian laced inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I might as well go as well,\u201d Rosa said, unable to use her normal tone of monotony with her peppy new vocal chords. She straightened her Armani specs with her dark new digits as she stood up. The Entity giggled as he watched Rosa stop momentarily to pull her boxers out of her crack and scratch an itch on her new equipment. Emmy meanwhile drummed her fingers on the table out of boredom. \u201cMan, they\u2019re no fun,\u201d she moaned in Aamil\u2019s deep tenor. She may not have had any obvious physical changes but the sight of the prominent Adam\u2019s apple on her throat was more than enough amusement for the Entity. He chuckled smugly as he picked up Rosa\u2019s mug and sipped from it with his dainty fingers. All the while he used Gabby\u2019s eyes to foot around the room and assess his next course of action.</span></div></div>",

Her classy black heels clicked on the hard floor of the lobby as she approached her work station, the front desk. She briefly adjusted her long ponytail and then gave her navy skirt suit a quick dust off, before sitting down and preparing her work for the day. Her mind though, wasn't on the job, because of the accident that had happened on Friday the main genetics laboratory. The head scientist, Reginald Lockheed, had tripped while holding an experimental syrum and the hyperdermic needle had flown straight towards Riley and stuck in her chest... emptying it's contents into her body. She had fainted of course, but soon recovered and even finished her shift that day before going home to enjoy her weekend. And it was during that weekend, she discovered the extraordinary power that the syrum had given her. The ability to exchange people's physical traits and also alter reality while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley smirked as she remembered her visit to her ex-boyfriend Finn yesterday. She had parked outside his mother's house while he was visiting her, and as soon as they had emerged, Riley had swapped his mother's sagging breasts onto his chest... causing his t-shirt to stretch. And if that wasn't enough, she also swapped his dick to his little sister Michaela, 15, gifting her with a virile 6-incher. That had been the highlight of Riley's weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Riley, you feeling okay?\" A voice suddenly snapped her out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley looked up, seeing her boss Sharon standing there, dressed in her usual slutty clothes and trying to look younger than her 45 years. \"Oh, hi Ms McGee, I'm fine, thank you.\" Riley smiled, glancing up at the impressive (but fake) H-cup bust distending her boss's skimpy blouse. \"You look nice today, very youthful.\" She continued, knowing a bit of flattery would get her everywhere with Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you Riley, I appreciate that.\" Sharon smiled, unfolding her arms. \"I must say after last week's incident, I wasn't sure you'd be into work today. If you start feeling ill or anything please let someone know. That syrum was untested and it's effect on people is unknown. So I want to you to also report any undue side effects of the injection, okay?\" She said to Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah right!</i> Riley thought, while nodding and smiling obediently. \"Of course Ms McGee. I will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" Sharon nodded, before clicking off in her \"fuck me\" pumps. Sharon felt nothing as her sugically-enhanced butt suddenly deflated into a more flatter, masculine shape, making her short skirt sag in the back. While nearby, the apprentice (and gay) janitor Carson Wright, aged 20, had his overalls balloon out as he gained a very feminine (and very pumped up) backside, courtesy of Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That butt looked horrid on you anyway.\" Riley giggled to herself. \"Money doesn't buy perfection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Riley...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sickening crunch sounded as a steel-toed boot stepped over the obliterated glass scattered over the vinyl floor. There was an acrid burning stench permeating through the air, not necessarily as thick as smoke or soot residue, but more subtle like the resulting smell from an industrial laser cutter. A gloved hand reached out to one of the broken containers and delicately traced the smooth, circular edge with its bony finger. The finger pulled back carefully. <i>Blood,</i> Lockheed thought as he took in the coppery smell. His old bones creaked as he struggled to stand back up and soon a womanly figure took to his side to aid him upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jessica,\" Lockheed groaned as he righted himself with his golden cane. The woman must've been used to this solecism as she quickly corrected him, \"It is just Jes, Monsieur,\" albeit in a chirp of shaken French. The doctor took no notice of the young woman's anxiety as he mentally tallied the damage done. Eight of thirteen containment modules had been decimated by whatever- no, whomever had broken inside. Judging by the condensation forming on Module Four at least one of the intruders had leaned up close to admire what was inside before they'd clumsily sliced it open. <i>\u2018Ugh,\u2019</i> Reginald sighed in disgust- they'd taken their time to admire the projects before bypassing the security measures Lockheed had meticulously planned and cutting the glass. It was professional work, that was certain. Probably perpetrated by seasoned cat burglars, possibly even ninjas-for-hire (you could never rule out any possibilities in this line of work). Judging by the intruders\u2019 apparent skill he was astounded that they'd even been able to respond to their entry so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fetch me the Head of Security.\" Jes bowed her head and scurried out of the wrecked lab, coming back a few minutes later with a burly man that seemed reluctant to speak. Lockheed pirouetted and sized him up, his pale silver eyes hiding a burgeoning bonfire of rage. \"Mr Carter,\" he said as he edged closer to the brute, \"I seem to remember assigning you to tonight's shift in order to protect this very room, a room that I recall telling you had <i>items of precious value, items that if utilised by the wrong calibre of humanity could reap disastrous consequences'</i> !\" Lockheed's nose was firmly planted into Carter's line of sight and unfortunately his passive-aggressive rant had made crumbs of spittle squirt out into the trembling security officer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I swear on my Grandmomma's holy deathbed, rest in peace, that i had n-no part in this here heist Mr Lockheed, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where were you and your uselessly large physique during the break-in, Mr Carter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, w-well I'm not all sure if I'm, erm...supposed to disclose this information...\" Lockheed scowled. \"Humour me,\" he spat. Carter rubbed his hand uncertainly and whispered, \"Um, well, since it was a quiet night I thought I could sneak away for a second to check in with my kids...\" Lockheed's face bizarrely went completely blank as he processed his own indignation. He pointed out of the doorway. Carter's shoulders slumped as he trudged his way back out to perimeter patrol, a job he'd surely be demoted to for the foreseeable future. Lockheed gripped the golden lion's head atop his cane tightly. \"Imbeciles,\" he muttered. \"I'm surrounded by utter imbeciles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you <i>really</i> believe that?\" Lockheed slapped his palm against his forehead. A black stiletto heel clacked on the vinyl flooring, breaking the eerie silence that now enveloped the crime scene. Dainty feet housed inside were connected to ghostly pale slender stumps of legs. A suave combination of a black turtleneck and pencil dress created a contrasting motif of innocence and surreptitiousness that complimented the woman's narrow face perfectly, an almost robotic smile painted on it with her puffy, indigo lips. She deftly swept a lock of short, thick, blonde hair out of her eyes- it was clear she'd spent a considerable amount of time coiffing her pixie hairstyle. Standing 5' 7\" tall, this fair skinned woman had an untrustworthy feel about her. \"I thought you'd have grown out of that childish insecurity that caused you to belittle others decades ago but you always seem to surprise me, <i>little brother</i>,\" the woman remarked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockheed scowled. A red vein pulsed monstrously on his temple. Instead of acknowledging the snide comment Reginald turned back to his newest employee and said, \"Miss Roberts, would you mind escorting Ms McCarthy elsewhere, please? I think she would enjoy a thorough tour of our facilities here. Make sure you give her the <i>extended</i> tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs McCarthy feigned hurt. \"After all this time and you can't give your own flesh and blood a hug? Tsk, if this is the way you treat me, I cannot imagine how you treat the rest of your family. No wonder why Marion threw caution to the wind and disappeared from the lives of you and your son.\" Lockheed winced. \"Anyhoo,\" she continued, \"I am just absolutely overwhelmed with exuberance at the prospect of an all-inclusive tour, especially considering that in a few months these will be <i>my</i> laboratories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse you? What do you mean <i>'your laboratories'</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plastic grin on her face extended into a menacing smirk. \"You're not the only one that inherited Mummy and Daddy's superfluous wealth. I'm sure you've made little effort to follow my endeavours but, if you had, you'd know that over the past couple decades since you bothered to speak to me, I've made several profitable business ventures that have helped me to multiply that initial inheritance. Whilst on my Venice vacation with Sharon- no, Ms McGee, sorry, I always seem to forget she's your superior- and we got to talking about how you're science experiments were haemorrhaging money. I told her I could help ease her problems and, taking into account my close connection with you and persisting companionship with her, I was able to negotiate a preliminary agreement. But,\" she waved her arm across the wreckage, \"I'm now not sure if it was the greatest idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't, Diane,\" Lockheed replied. He'd gone back to observing the boxes for evidence. His eyes flitted to the seventh module and grew wide in their sockets.He muttered an imperceptible curse as he ripped the label from its stand. <i> Trait Exchange Dart Project, Initial Prototypes,</i> he read. <i>CAUTION: Early tests show errors with specific target trades. NOT SUITABLE FOR HUMAN TESTING.</i> \"Struggling to accept that I'm your new Boss, Reggie?\" McCarthy jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ripling! Initiate Protocol <i>Blue-H-12D</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young brunette manning the front desk was startled from her dating-app-swiping by the desperate hollering, nearly falling out of her velvet swivel chair. She quickly righted herself, sliding open a hidden compartment in her desk before pressing a small blue button hidden inside. The red lights instantaneously flashed sapphire as massive, imposing shutters clamped down over all the exits, cutting off any chance of escaping into the outside world. A myriad of groans, murmurs and cries erupted from the various workers in the building. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Diane cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald grinned. \"What I need to.\" He cleared his throat and whistled to get the congregation's attention. \"I apologise for your collective confusion. As most of you have learnt, there has been a break-in in one of our storage labs. Now there's nothing to worry about, no one was hurt. However, I have reason to believe that at least one of our experimental prototypes has been stolen from its place and, if inappropriately used, can lead to a legion of legal complications for all of us here.\" A lady with bright ginger hair and piercing green eyes whispered into his ear. \"...And of course harm to all of you, the diligent workers of this great company. This lock-down is only temporary so it's not vital to worry your families with unsubstantiated rumours. Just carry on your important work and this will all blow over soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hands dramatically and watched as the murmuring crowd dispersed. The green-eyed girl took to his side and said, \"Moving speech, sir. Reassuring them at the end was a good touch, a lot of whispers around were speculating on the dangerous precision of the attack, some even saying they might report this to the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hope that you'd know to make sure that doesn't happen Rachel. Calling in law enforcement would cause even more problems with some of our unethical tech. While you quell any frustrations the people may have, I'm going to locate our thieves. Matter of fact, get Minnie on the line and tell her to meet me in the surveillance unit.\" Rachel nodded her head and ambled away swiftly in her white Nike's. Lockheed sighed. Miss Cartwright had always been a dependable right-hand-woman; she didn't deserve what would happen next if his assumptions were correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What COULD happen next,</i> he corrected himself. <i>I just pray that we catch these vermin before they realise how to operate what they stole.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following Lockheed\u2019s speech, there was an almighty ruckus of chatter amongst all the people standing in the foyer. Most were curious as to why such a serious measure was necessary in this circumstance (as well as what was so dangerous that their boss had been willing to lock them inside the building for the next couple hours or so). A few people were less than happy to be stuck inside. Rebecca Gray was always one to capitalise on any opportunity presented to her and that\u2019s exactly what she did as she swaggered her way into the middle of the restless crowd. \u201cNo need to worry, ladies and gents,\u201d she proclaimed as she welcomed the attention of all the eyes on her, \u201cIf Mr Lockheed says everything is going to be A-OK, everything\u2019s going to be A-OK. Now all of you back to work, even in times like this we\u2019ve no time to waste dawdling around.\u201d She dispersed the crowd with her incessant shooes, brushing her dark hair from her long beak before seamlessly interrupting a conversation between Jes and Ms McGee in an attempt to aggrandise herself in front of the financier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa had secretly texted a message to her boyfriend, Fernando, that she was going to work a little later than anticipated and to send her love to their two infantile children. A lot of the other parents were in the same boat so to speak. Richie was worried about his family but at least he had his spouse to look after his kids- Jenny and Diann were practically single mothers already and Gabby was frantically calling up her daughter, Megan, to babysit for her. The parents all huddled together as a group and moved into a nearby conference room to discuss their predicaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the newest TG employees had similarly banded together to discuss amongst themselves. Emmy was in her usual hyperactive demeanour as she fired off a rapid string of hypotheses and theories about the lockdown that teetered on the edge between science fiction and conspiracy. Aamil was in essence her exact counterpart as he normally seemed subdued to the point of being bored when interacting with his coworkers. He did have a penchant for exploding once aggravated and he seemed to be on the verge of doing just that as he continued to argue with the 26-year-old physicist. Nabila was also sat at the table but instead of diffusing the tensions of her friends she began fanning the flames by offering Emmy new ideas to debate. This provided little relief to her preoccupied mind however. For the past few days she and her close friend and colleague Magnus had been hard at work conducting some more research on the human genome. The blood, sweat and tears they\u2019d poured in over the hours had brought them even closer than before and the lines between friends and something more was becoming a lot blurrier to her. She\u2019d considered saying something to him but decided against it once the alarms started sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus himself was quite confused about their relationship. He replayed the scenario preceding the alarm in his head as he and the rest of the his male coworkers took refuge in the quiet cafeterium beside the store rooms. He ruefully held his head in hands as Trent proceeded to tell an old story about an old college story on his negative experience alarms that included lots of lewd humour and graphic descriptions of nude bodies. Tim had been somewhat of a caterpillar in his own college days- in fact, the same could still be said about him up to that point in time- so he eagerly lapped up the over-exaggerates escapades, his eyes behind his round spectacles bulging wide in shock and awe. Carson on the other hand was having none of it and shook his head incredulously. He\u2019d only worked at the company for a few meagre months but he\u2019d already grown accustomed to Trent\u2019s tall tales. His interest <i>was</i> slightly piqued when Trent began describing his muscular college basketball teammates. A wry smile rose onto his face as he pictured the men\u2019s sweaty bodies pacing up and down the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the groups, along with the handful of other delivery staff and apprentice workers, had fled to their respective corners of the <i>Transforming Genetics</i> research complex. What was unknown to them were the elusive group of thieves scattered around the building, watching and analysing the people below them. What made them even more dangerous were the sleek black guns attached to their hips. No bullets were hidden inside, no, instead there were small capsules filled with eerily fluorescent green fluid. But they were only visible for a short moment as the intruders silently slipped back into the shadows, biding their time as the workers inside remained oblivious.</span></div></div>",

She sighed as she looked back on her life, wondering how it had gone <i>SO</i> wrong that she was slinging meals to random idiots in a second-tier fast food place called <i>'Meats 'N' Treats'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm very sorry, sir,\" she repeated in a bored, monotone voice, \"I cannot, as I've told you <i>MULTIPLE</i> times now, sell you a salad here at Meats 'N' Treats. Why? Because we don't HAVE salad. Because 'meat' is LITERALLY in the frickin' name! Fine, complain to my manager! See if I care!\" The man continued to hurl a tirade of insults and threats but Alex wasn't paying attention. Instead she was focused on an appealing looking woman who'd just stepped inside the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex scanned the lady quickly, noting her smooth, tanned skin and luscious raven hair cut down to her shoulderblades that partially covered 2 golden hoops. She was wearing a revealing green top and tight blue jeans, the rims of her juicy E-cup globes threatening to spill out completely while her voluptuous Latina backside swayed evocatively. Alex smiled playfully as the two women shared a quick glance, allowing Alex to get a quick glimpse of the lady's brilliant amber eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/33/0e/97330ea7874d1c85d014a915a48380ab.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/33/0e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sashayed her way up to the counter and tapped the man on the shoulder, saying calmly in her melodic voice, \"Sir, with no disrespect, can you please get the HELL out of here and go and be a PRICK somewhere else?\" The man turned around and looked down towards the woman (he had to, she was only 5'3\") with disdain, scoffing at the cheek of young people these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex watched the petite woman sigh and roll her eyes before she clicked her fingers and, much to Alex's disbelief, the man's gruff face disappeared as his head was suddenly sucked back into his torso, leaving him tottering and stumbling around blindly. The woman laughed as she saw Alex's open maw and snapped her fingers for a second time. However, instead of the man's head returning to its place, a teenage girl's cute head came up with a squeaky pop. The girl, unaware of how she'd left her family, apologised briefly before heading back to her table, unintentionally bumping past a man with an awkward, teenage girl's body going into the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stretched out a slender palm and said cheerily, \"Hi there.

One that I think you will very much enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha talked, Alex's mind went back to the socialite party and all the kinky shit that had gone off there.

But then again, she had never seen her since either.

He popped up a moment later, disoriented at the sudden movement. He tried to move his arm but found that he had no control of it. He tried to scream but found his mouth plugged by a greasy burger placed there by his new body mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex observed the predicament she'd just caused, chuckling as she looked upon Ronnie's spotty face sandwiched between the tubby woman's head and left shoulder. She passed in front of the two and blew Ronnie a quick kiss, laughing because she'd left him with his awareness- his scared eyes pleading for mercy. <i>'Sorry, Ron,'</i> Alex laughed mentally, <i>'But I'm not gonna help you out. Enjoy your new life!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stepped through the sliding glass doors and brushed down her top as she spotted Samantha sitting idly on one of the food court tables beside the store.

Have some fun back there?\" Alex smiled playfully before she changed the subject: \"Okay, what is this scheme you're planning and why do you need ME to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as I said, you can do so much better than this dump. That's precisely why I need you and your... <i>'special'</i> abilities to pull this thing off. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked around. She had to admit her current life was pretty good: she had her own apartment, the charm to get any job she wanted and a quiet, simple life. A quiet, simple, BORING life that involved going to work 9 to 5 everyday doing the same crappy job serving crazed nutjobs that screamed at her all day. She couldn't deny that joining that stupid heist was the most thrilling thing she'd ever done and some part of her still craved that adrenaline rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not?\" Alex said as she tried to disguise her obvious excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now do you remember your old friend, Lord Basilton, the host of the gala you were working at last time? Well after he accidentally stumbled onto your buddies' plot to rob all of the guests he was given a knighthood by our dear old Queen. These days he's hanging around with bigger fish, world-renowned socialites, rich business moguls, even a couple royals have been spotted with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, he's throwing a massive charity event at his one of his offshore properties. You know how it is with these celebrities; charity events are perfect opportunities to flaunt their 'limitless' generosity so you know that they're gonna be hauling TONS of cash with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the problem is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is that I don't know where the hell this 'offshore property', or if this thing is being held overseas. From what I know the place is swamped by armoured goons- Sir Basildon has taken more precautions to keep out unwanted visitors. To find out where the place is and work out how to get past security we need to find someone who has the answers, preferably someone that has a grudge against him after...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no! You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I know you won't like it but right now Santoro is the only one of Basildon's associates who might be willing to give us the information we want. We know he was making some shady business deals with Hector before he flipped on him to the Feds. All the information I've heard about the gala says that it's happening in a about a month's time and Santoro's gonna be moved to a secure place in the States in two weeks. Look, I don't like this either, but if we don't find out where it is soon there'll have been no point in quitting your day job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex groaned. The last time she'd seen Hector was when he'd pushed the barrel of his pistol onto the butt of her chin. She could see that Samantha's plan of working with Hector made logical sense but she couldn't help but feel resentment when his annoying, beautiful face popped into her mind. \"Fine,\" she grumbled as she finally relented, \"But don't expect me to forgive me him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never did,\" Samantha laughed, \"There's one snag though: Santoro is currently serving a life sentence in Wentworth Penn, the most secure prison this side of Alcatraz. You ready to go undercover, Beckett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ready?</i> I was <i>BORN</i> ready, Shaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Just need to pickup a couple more people then we're back in business, baby!\"</span></div></div>",

He's 40 years old now, but he's the best safe cracker I know.\" Alex explained. Moses was Jamaican-born, and he had spent his teenage years in London before moving out to the States where he eventually became a citizen. He still maintained his decent physique, despite his age, and he still had his dreadlocks. \"He might also have some information on Wentworth that could help, he was once incarcerated there I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. And I can give Henry a call.\" Samantha smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry?\" Alex muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a computer hacker, very talented for his age. He's from Los Angeles, originally, 22 years old. He looks like your typical nerd, but don't like that fool you. He's a criminal genius and can get into any computer system out there.\" Samantha smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds just what we need.\" Alex nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha got her phone out and looked up Henry's number, giving him a call. But Alex knew that Moses never kept a mobile phone on him, since he was sure they could be used to track anyone on the planet. He was paranoid like that. But perhaps there was good reason to be. They would have to visit his place in person. She knew he lived in California somewhere, but exactly where she didn't know. Henry might be able to help them track him down, if Samantha got hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sat back and smiled, looking forward to robbing some rich fucks and their suck-ups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fact that she and Samantha both had a swapping power, would make the whole thing that much sweeter... and rewarding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The place was rickety and looked like it was about to fall apart, still not as bad as some of the hellholes she'd worked at before she reminded herself. She walked up to the bar to see a muscular man wearing a tight brown T-shirt with a towel draped over his shoulders wiping a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me, I'm looking for someone. His name's Henry, Henry Chen. Seen him around anywhere?\" The man grunted before spitting downwards, narrowly missing Samantha's manicured digits. Samantha had half a mind to pull him over the counter there and then and beat his face in but she composed herself and said, \"Okay, I'm going to PRETEND you didn't just do that. Now you've got two choices before I lose my temper: either tell me where he is- 'cos I KNOW that YOU know that I know that you know- or I force you to comply. I'll give you three seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sniggered as he crossed his arms and glared at Samantha's deadpan poker face. \"One... Two...\" Samantha grinned as she stared into the man's pale green eyes: she kinda hoped he wouldn't cooperate just so she would have an excuse to practice her powers. A second later and the man's resolve broke and he squeaked that Henry was in one of the back room's, cowering as Samantha strutted past him. Meanwhile a hooker that had just been harassed by two shady guys suddenly gained some courage, pushing them out of the way before flipping a deuce at the douchebags. Samantha was proud of her act of charity but one thing was missing- a moderate sized bulge grew underneath the woman's skimpy skirt as she gained the burly bartender's sweaty junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha made her way quietly past the people in the club, passing through a horde of rowdy people pissing about inside. A young couple that had been making out on one of the wall's in front  of Samantha had their chests swapped, the flat lady now fondling her boyfriend's juicy breasts under his tank top. Two women that had been dancing erotically for a pair of male twins had their lives swapped with the men, the women now laughing and hollering as the men tried to dance sexily for them in their pinstriped suits and slicked back hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stopped as she spotted a lonesome person mashing away on a keyboard on an isolated table. The man, who she recognised as Henry, was quite scrawny, his muscles basically nonexistent on his slight 5'8\" frame. He had messy, uncombed black hair, dorky glasses and almond-shaped eyes to go with his pale, Oriental skin. Samantha noticed he was in his typical nerdy getup, an immaculate tie and suit combo complete with braces and a nerdy <i>The Witcher</i> tee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha silently slid into the seat opposite him and whispered, \"Henry!\" Henry jumped, narrowly saving his laptop from falling onto the ground and smashing into smithereens. \"What the HELL are you doing here Samantha?! I thought I made it VERY clear that I didn't want any part in one of your stupid schemes again! My parents kicked me out of the basement after the police raided my home at 4AM in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Henry, you and I both know that hacking into the Minister of Defence's computer and exposing her nudes was not <i>'dangerous to the security of the public'</i>, it was just plain HILARIOUS! Anyways, you've never been afraid of repurcussions before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the worst thing we were doing back then was leaking the news that our headteacher was banging his secretary behind his wife's back! It's different now, Samantha; we're ADULTS now, regular old citizens that have jobs, responsibilities. We're not kids anymore. Sorry, it's too risky- my parents have only just let me move back in and I haven't even earnt my other PC back yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha contemplated Henry's statement before replying, \"What if I told you that you could not only get another, brand-new PC with the money we make but you can also buy your own place, far away from your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips of Henry's lips raised slightly, his nervous frown changing instantly to an excited grin. \"When do we start?\" They both laughed as Henry ordered some celebratory whiskey shots, the both of them sharing a toast at the expense of Henry's overbearing parents.</span></div></div>",

Stepping off the bus, Alex smirked to herself. A particular annoying child, about 8 years old now had his head on his mother's chubby mature body in one of the front seats. \"I hate noisy brats.\" Alex chuntered to herself, taking in a breath of desert air. She was dressed for the occasion, her long dark hair tied up in a ponytail, and she wore a checkered crop top that tied in the front, a sleevless denim jacket, a thigh-length, imitation snake-skin skirt and a pair of women's hiking boots. The last thing she wanted was a snake bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God what a forsaken shithole!\" Alex mumbled. \"You'd better be here Moses.\" She then set off walking, taking her map out for a moment before doing so. She walked for a couple of miles across the barren territory, and as she did so, she understood why Moses had chosen this place to escape from the world, from the authorities. Nobody in their right mind would come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she saw a solitary building in the distance, a run-down house that looked like it had survived a couple of tornadoes. As she approached she tripped a wire, and she instinctively knew Moses had set up an alert system. \"What do you want out here Alex??\" Moses' familiar, gruff voice, tinged with a slight Kingston accent, called out from the house as he walked out onto the porch, pistol in hand. He obviously recognized her immediately, he had an excellent memory. Moses still sported his trademark dreadlocks, he hadn't shaved for quite some time and probably hadn't bathed either for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paranoid as ever, huh Moses?\" Alex smiled, shaking her head as she shouted her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses shrugged, slipping his pistol into his jeans. \"It's how I've stayed alive this long girl, you know that.\" He said, gesturing her closer. \"Well, well, you've only got prettier I see, and what do you want with me?\" He inquired. He had an idea it was something 'nefarious'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A job, of course. I mean, unless you're retired permanently?\" Alex said, wiping her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends what this job is.\" Moses said, scratching his unkempt beard. He then gestured into his current home. \"Come on in, we can talk inside, get out of the heat.\" He calmly said. \"I'll get you a beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Alex nodded, following him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Alex explained all about what she and Samantha had planned, but she decided to leave telling him about her power for now. She'd leave that to Samantha to reveal when they were all together. Moses listened, pondered whether to accept the job, then agreed. The main reason being he didn't want to spend any more years out in the desert, not when he could make a ton of cash and live somewhere much better. \"Alright, when do we start?\" Moses grinned, rubbing his hands, then taking another swig of his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to Samantha, she's the boss.\" Alex answered. \"But it won't be until we get Hector Santoro out of prison.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses nodded, relaxing in his worn chair. \"That'll be something to see.\" He mumbled, letting his imagination run wild.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Buster' Wayans was the fifth Cripps member killed this year so far, they're already plotting their revenge.\" Prison guard Malcolm Turner, 37, said as he leaned on the doorway of Hector Santoro's large, unlocked prison cell. However, these words didn't seem to have much of an effect on Santoro, who kept writing a letter to one of his colleagues outside of prison. The pen gripped tightly between Santoto's tanned, manicured fingers, he puffed away on a cigar and with each breath he took, his huge breasts heaved up and down on his chest. Even the prison guards had to admit, Santoro was the best looking gang leader they'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mr Turner.\" Santoro said in his female, Latina voice. The man's voluptuous body was mostly hidden underneath prison threads, but his lucious tits were on prominent enough display. Of course Santoro had no memory of his former body, and remained oblivious he had been swapped at the last swanky party he attended, the one which had been heisted by that group of \"amateurs\" who were caught afterwards. \"Is my whiskey on the way Mr Turner?\" Santoto then asked, brushing his long feminine locks from his gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a full crate, as you asked. But I need something from you, I need you to control your men more.\" The guard responded, acting very much like one of Santoro's goons rather than a member of the prison staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do. But you need to know, Jose was popular amongst my men, and that is why they've been getting revenge.\" Santoro then explained, his voice sounding even hotter in a Latina accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, the Cripps are out for revenge now, so tell your people to watch their back and to keep their shivs hidden. I'm gonna have to conduct a search of all cells today, and I don't want to find anything, clear?\" Malcolm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, anything for you Mr Turner.\" Santoro chuckled, leaning back in his chair for a moment a grasping his half-smoked cigar with his slender fingers. \" Malcolm just nodded, then went back to resume his duties. He wasn't the only corrupt prison guard Santoro had in his pocket, there were several, but the warden, Charles Levins, 45, apparently couldn't be bought off. He was a commited family man and had morals, which was annoying to Santoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Santoro was concerned, he was comfortable enough in his 'luxury' prison cell, he had most things what he wanted, except for women, of course. It was ironic and tragic for him at the same time that he was currently wearing the porn-star kind of body he'd normally love pawing and groping. What Santoro didn't know, was that he would be soon be getting busted out of prison, to perform a big job. A 'unique' job.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Moses had already been waiting for a solid half hour at the mall food court and the cacophony of disorderly children and ranting adults was definitely beginning to get on her nerves. She was going to turn and complain to Moses but stopped herself as she watched Moses ravenously tearing into his unfortunate burger. \"I haven't had a... meal like this in YEARS! Definitely beats, mm, scorpions and cactus,\" Moses said as he snarfed it down, droplets of spit shooting it of his mouth as he did so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" Alex replied, trying to stop herself from retching as she shifted her attention to a rowdy family nearby to where she and Moses were sitting. Alex noted down each of the members of the family: a husband and wife in their mid-30s who were violently arguing with each other about the husband's roaming eyes, completely oblivious to their 6-year-old son running around and screaming like a headless chickens and his older sister who was sitting and texting dirty messages to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, wanting to both practice her power and teach the family a lesson about respecting each other. A moment later and both the man's head and his daughter's were sucked back into their torsos only to reappear on the wife's and boy's bodies respectively. Both were discombobulated for a second but then quickly adjusted to their new lives: the girl's lustful conversation with her boyfriend had abruptly ended due to her immature penis not being able to gain any kind of pleasure from it. She quickly snatched her phone back from her former body and began to text her boyfriend again, the subject changing to Ninja Turtles and Transformers instead. The little boy who possessed his older sister's cute body had stopped running around and sat down on an isolated bench away from his sister. His juvenile mind was now obsessed with the image of Megan Fox from the last TMNT movie and he felt his teenage pussy getting moist at the strange, sexual thoughts popping into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed as she looked upon the... <i>INTERESTING</i> predicament that she'd put the husband in. His balding head looked downright hilarious on his wife's voluptuous bod dressed in a tight gold frock that emphasised his wife's ample cleavage and fat ass. The worst thing Alex did apart from leaving the wife's pretty face sandwiched between her shoulder and her husband's cranium was that she'd transferred the husband's middle-aged plumbing over to their shared body, causing a very visible bulge to appear as the husband spotted a decent looking young woman passing by. Alex observed eagerly as the man's wife noticed the erection and continued to scream at him, grabbing her children and strutting off sexily, the man's portly body left behind. Alex had never liked unfaithful partners and she hoped that the swap would bring the couple closer (literally) or at least make it harder for the man's eyes to wander without his wife noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When were ya friends s'posed to c'mere, Alex?\" Alex was snapped out of her trance as Moses spoke to her with his deep baritone voice. \"I dunno honestly, Samantha said she'd be here at half past 11 but it's well gone past. Don't worry she'll be here soon,\" Alex replied unsure of her own words, trying to reassure herself as well as Moses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where the hell could she be?</i> Alex thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also wore a form-fitting grey dress and her long black hair was secured in a ponytail. \"Very nice, but not my usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirked. \"Sorry sugar, Chloe is sick today, so you get me.\" The woman told Santoro. \"I'm Tonisha!\" She added, taking one of his mancured hands in one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no apologies necessary gorgeous, you'll do nicely.\" Santoro winked, turning on his 'manly' charm. \"That'll be all Mr Turner, we'll let you know when you can return.\" Santoro then told the guard, who obviously would have hung around to watch if he'd been allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonisha, the high class escort, stepped forward and produced a 12-inch strap-on from a bag she was carrying, as Santoro licked his lips. \"Hmm, you brought a bigger one than Chloe usually does.\" He chuckled in his feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do anything small, sugar.\" Tonisha winked, before slipping out of her grey dress, letting it fall to the floor and reveal her heavenly body and skimpy red lace panties. She really was a hot piece of ass, and a few minutes later, Tonisha had the strap-on equipped and was pounding the gang leader hard. The other inmates in the prison were forced to once again listen as the priviledged prisoner had sex with the escort.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alex had been waiting for so long that even swapping the people around her was barely exciting her. She nearly didn't have to stop herself from giggling as she swapped the heads of a hot woman in a tight red dress and a portly janitor that had just come out of cleaning the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to take Moses and leave before she heard a commotion coming from where people were queuing to get their food. She watched as a blatantly hungover Samantha stumbled her way past the restless customers with a Chinese dude tailing her and a drunken grin plastered onto her face. Samantha practically collapsed into Alex's arms before turning around and flipping off the group of men that had quickly grown in numbers. Alex observed as the bulges in all the men's tight bottoms dwindled, their genitals transferring to a Girl Scout troop that had just been passing by. She laughed as the girl's innocent faces turned devious, the same thought of ramming their cocks into their hot troopleader's 22-year-old vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha giggled deliriously as Alex set her down and put a glass of water in front of her. <i>'SHE'S the 'levelheaded', 'intellectual' mastermind you were trying to tell me about,'</i> Moses scoffed as he watched her rock around aimlessly on the bench. Alex rolled her eyes- this definitely wasn't the first impression that she'd pictured in her head. She sighed as she looked around and focused on the closest person to her, an average looking redhead, and transferred Samantha's hangover to her and watching as the woman started to wobble uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha on the other hand clutched her head in agony as she felt the consequences of her booze binge come back to bite her in the bum. \"Ugh, give me a second,\" Samantha groaned, taking a large gulp of water from the glass before continuing, \"Sorry about that. As you can see me and my old pal Henry were a little <i>TOO</i> eager last night. Isn't that right, H?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry just grunted loudly, his face smushed against the table's smooth surface. \"Henry, always so enthusiastic. Anyways, you probably have a general idea of what we're about to do: get in the gala, con some rich idiots into forking over their cash and making it out safely with a couple dozen mills each. Well I'm here to say that yes, yes that IS basically the plan but it's a LOT more complicated than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of complications,\" Moses grumbled, \"How the HECK are we supposed to break one of the world's most notorious prisoners out of one of the world's most secure detention centres?\" Samantha smiled as she shared a knowing glance with Alex before she pulled out a green jewel from her pocket and placing it in the middle of the four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses' eyes grew wide with awe and even Henry, who'd been practically passed out the entire team, was mesmerised by its hypnotic lustre. Henry oohed with fascination, reaching out for the emerald before Alex swatted his hand away. \"Ow!\" he yelped angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took no notice of Henry and said, \"Before you guys do this, I just want you to know that your lives are gonna change from the very moment you touch it. Your mind changes, your perspective of life changes, even your whole personality shifts. Once you do this there's no going back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry and Moses took a long stare at Alex to see if she was joking then to Samntha, both women's faces looking stoic and serious. They shared a quick apprehensive look between the two of them before they warily placed their hands on the stone. All of a sudden it was as though they were hurling through some sort of wormhole at high speed, getting bombarded by glowing particles. There was a crescendo of noise that suddenly ended and snapped them out of their trance as a strange voice echoed through their heads. The voice eerily whispered that they now had the ability to steal people's traits, or just to exchange them between others without them knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Henry exclaimed as he shot up from his seat, his drunken stupor having seemingly vanished as he tried to see if anything had happened to himself on the outside. Moses meanwhile was sitting down open-mouthed, raising his hands up to his face as he felt a supernatural power coursing through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the club, boys,\" Samantha chuckled as she and Alex fist bumped excitedly. \"You were asking how we were going to break one of the world's most notorious prisoners out of one of the world's most secure detention centres? Well it's quite simple really, all we have to do is...\"</span></div></div>",

A family enjoying their meals became his victims. A Latina woman, her husband and their two teenage children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try head swapping first? It's one of the easier swaps to make if you're new at it.\" Alex advised, winking at Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... okay then.\" Henry said, trying to focus. It didn't take much concentration, and he and Moses both gasped when the chubby Latina woman's head sucked down into her body, and her 13-year old son's did the same. Seconds later they emerged atop each other's bodies, and as a result of the swap the mother's new puberty-stricken cock hardened into an erection. It was still only 4 inches long though and caused a slight bulge in her shorts. As the mother berated her 15-year old daughter on her eating habits in Spanish, Henry smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moses, why don't you handle the next one?\" Samantha suggested with a proud grin, as she gestured to the father and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raatid!\" Moses nodded in his Jamacian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter was a little on the chubby side, like her mother, but she was still quite pretty. Moses focused on the girl's lower half and tried swapping her legs with her father's. In an instant, the girl's smooth, if slightly chubby teenage legs began swelling with more muscle, they stretched out in length and hair grew on them.... causing them to push further away from her under the table. The clothes failed to make the swap, and the girl's ballet flats split apart as her feet grew into her dad's. The girl's shorts also split at the seams as her bulkier legs grew in. The father had the opposite problem, his legs shrinking in length and size under his corderoy pants and his feet shrinking in his shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who retained her own vagina, hips and ass, looked extremely out of proportion because of her new men's legs and feet, and she looked under the table at  her destroyed footwear before complaining to her headswapped mother in Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not bad, well done.\" Alex congratulated Moses with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good job!\" Samantha weighed in with her own compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses was sporting a decent hard-on of his own and Henry was rubbing his pussy through his pants under the table as they continued observing the swapped up family. Samantha and Alex meanwhile were mainly observing the group of Girl Scouts, all of whom had popped boners in their panties and were hungrily eyeing up their troopleader. They both gave it a day before one of them was balls deep in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think our two proteges here are ready to help us bust out Santoro?\" Alex asked Samantha quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think so. Once you use the power, it's second nature.\" Samantha smirked, nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Moses sat like two excited schoolboys who had just received a top grade off their teacher. And both of them were eager to swap more people. But they also knew Samantha and Alex had a plan in motion, and they were now a part of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guards were standing stiffly to attention, their eagle eyes ready to spot any intruders trying to sneak their way inside. If the seemingly impenetrable defences didn't seem like they were enough there were a couple of armoured goons with their rabid looking canines on leashes. The mutts growled in unison, all of them ready to take a chunk on whoever their handlers allows d them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an almighty crash that lit up the air over a creaky, near delapadated caravan as it trundled slowly towards the gate. Inside there were loud whispers amongst the two women and one man that were sitting in the back while a bulky, dreadlocked figure sat in the front and listened intently. \"...Okay, I'll explain it to you <i>ONE</i> more time,\" Samantha said for the third time as she stopped herself from getting up and strangling Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple: first we've got the gate checks. These are just your standard checks to make sure you've got the proper identification to get into the facility. The only thing is that once they've checked the driver they're gonna check the inside for any unwanted passengers. We can easily take one of those bastards by the fence to get the ID but after that we've got no idea what comes next. That's why we need YOU, Henry, to hack into the security systems and tell us where to go and where all the alarms are while we find where Santoro's hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-wait-WAIT! You're <i>SIDELINING</i> me?!\" Henry protested. \"You, Alex and Mr <i>'I-bathe-twice-a-year'</i> are going to break into a federal prison, go undercover as criminals and bust out a convict WITHOUT ME?! C'mon Sam, you KNOW that <i>'real-life Prison Break'</i> was on my bucket list!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard dat, bombaclat,\" Moses grumbled in his light Kingston accent. Alex had quickly grown tired of Henry's childishness and grabbed him by his collar, pulling him closer so she was staring through his almond eyes and into his soul. \"I'm gonna be completely honest with you right now, Chen, the only reason I'm BARELY tolerating you is because Samantha personally recommended you for this job. If it was up to me, I would've kicked your sorry ass out back in California. Now suck it up and stop whinging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex let go of Henry's collar and he scrambled away as Alex went to the other side of the caravan. Samantha followed her, tapping her shoulder as she whispered, <i>'Damn, where the bell did THAT come from?!'</i> Alex turned and stared stoically at Sam as she said deadpan, \"Last time I tried this stunt it blew up in my face. I kept none of the money, all my friends got caught and I nearly got nicked myself. The only reason I agreed to do this was because I wanted- no, NEEDED to get a second shot at doing this thing right. I'm not gonna let an overgrown man-child like Henry be the reason that my new friends get caught. Not a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex brushed past Samantha on her way to checking if she'd prepared everything required for the heist. Samantha sighed forlornly as she thought to herself, <i>Why do all the good ones have to come with baggage?..</i> Meanwhile, Moses had gotten closer to the checkpoint and an armoured man came to ask for identification. A second later and Moses pulled out a small keycard from his pocket and had it scanned swiftly before he was ushered inside. Moses chuckled as he drove past, taking a quick glance at the man whose ID he'd stolen and pitying the shouting he'd get later on by his boss for losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alreet, ladies and gents, we've arrived. Time 'ta go!\" Alex, Samantha and Moses all hopped out while Henry disgruntledly booted up his laptop and computing software.

The guy always intimidated him, even scared him, even though he had the kind of appearance usually associated with female porn stars. Whatever 'condition' the gang leader had that made him to be born that way, this prison guard, and any of the others for that matter, weren't going to make light of it in any way. As he got closer to Hector's cell, the guard heard feminine grunts and panting. \"Great, he's got one of his sluts in with him again.\" The 25-year old guard grumbled. \"The fucker has a sex drive that would put a teenage girl to shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when the guard reached the cell, Santoro's usual 'escort' Chloe had her gorgeous made-up face between his legs, licking at and sucking his pussy. Santoro moaned and writhed as he was eaten out by the woman, but then scowled a little when he saw he had an audience. \"What is it kid?\" He barked in his feminine tone, as Chloe kept up her oral onslaught on his cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... M-Mr Turner says your friend will have to leave Mr. Santoro. The Warden Levins will be inspecting the cellblocks when his family has left.\" The guard muttered, clearly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, our dear... conscience driven... Warden,\" Santoro chuckled menacingly, in between moans. He refuses to get with the times. Morality...hmmmph.... is a thing of the... past. Money is now... the universal... uggghhh.... language!\" He went on, as he approached orgasm. Chloe was an exceptional escort, and her oral skills were second to none. But there were many reasons why she was Santoro's favorite girl. Chloe was a blonde with natural DD-cup breasts, shoulder length hair, a slim figure and also a bit of a temper when angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but Mr. Turner wanted me to... \"The guard stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET LOST KID! Unless you want my boys to pay a visit to your family.\" Santoro shouted angrily. Then seconds later his voluptuous body was wracked by one of the best orgasms he'd ever had. Chloe pulled her face away from his crotch and smirked as he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm done here anyay. See you later sweetie.\" Chloe said as she put her low-cut white top, red thong panties and short black skirt back on. She then gave a little wave to Santoro and blew him a kiss, before slipping her feet into her stiletto pumps, grabbing the used dildo off Santoro's bunk and clicking out of the cell. The guard walked with her to see her off the prison grounds, sporting a boner as he stared at Chloe's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid there recovering from his high, Santoro had a weird feeling that something was going to hapen today. He just didn't know quite what.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately we now have to get past another checkpoint, armoured personnel, a locked door and another prison wing before you can even SEE Santoro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great...</i> Sam grumbled as she relayed the information back to her comrades.

C'mon, there's gotta be a way in...\" A devious grin spread across her face as she watched as a group of nuns walked out of the prison gates after being scanned and sighed out. She stood up and gestured for Alex and Moses to follow her as she crept behind the convent caravan waiting outside for the ladies. She peered in and, only seeing three women inside, snuck inside with the others and silently put a hand on the lead nun's mouth. \"Sorry sister,\" Samantha laughed, \"I just need to borrow your LIFE for a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- --- - -- --  --- - - -- --- -- - -- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarden Jones always enjoyed when the sisters at the convent came to provide therapy for the prisoners. They were all a good escape from the testosterone pumped prison halls he patrolled everyday, especially the cute, young nun that had just joined, Sister Ethel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd just been in the middle of asking how a girl like that could swear off relationships when he saw three cloaked figures coming back towards the prison gates. \"Oh hello there,\" he said as he looked Alex straight in the eyes as she blushed playfully. He stepped straight past Alex and saddled right up next to an uncomfortable looking Moses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex feigned being hurt and Samantha giggled as the warden stroked Moses' burly arm and said, \"So, Sister Ethel, why are you back so soon? I thought you had urgent business to attend to at the convent?\" Moses stammered something <br>\r\ninaudible before Sam interjected and said, \"Well my dear <i>'sister'</i> Ethel here, she's only just joined us at the convent as you know and she'd like a quick tour of the facility. Just to, you know, find out where she can really <i>FEEL THE SPIRIT</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses gave Sam a sharp glance as Warden Jones slipped his arm through Moses' and replied, \"I would <i>LOVE</i> to do that: I'm always ready to help someone from one of the strong pillars in the community.\" He got close to Moses' ear and whispered, \"Especially one as beautiful as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses sent a look that said <i>help me</i> as the warden dragged him off. \"Have fun!\" Alex chortled as she watched on giddily. She was just about to follow Samantha inside when she suddenly felt an urge to do a couple of swaps first. She targeted the nuns once again and, focusing on a couple of gun-toting lunkheads, gave a couple nuns an 'extra present' for their generosity. While she couldn't see most of the results due to the long, flowing cloaks that the nuns possessed, she could see a large bulge erupting from a plump nurse's crotch region. One look at the nurse's face and Alex could tell that she, and many of the other sisters, would be breaking their vows of celibacy in a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Alex turned on her heels with an extra spring in her step, hoisting her black gown up as she and Sam turned a corner away from Moses and his terror tour.</span></div></div>",

And they also couldn't help but smirk at the sight of each other wearing a nun's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, aren't you you dirty little shit!\" Alex responded to Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry changed the subject as he kept two of his fingers buried into his snatch. \"Hey here's a plan, get 'Sister Ethel' to 'pump' the Warden for information that may be able to help us out as to Santoro's location, hmm?\" He snapped acerbically, so that Moses heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Alex both smirked and chuckled. \"That's not a bad idea, right 'Ethel'?\" She said, so that Moses would hear her over his earpiece. Luckily Moses couldn't very well reply, being in the Warden's company, otherwise he would have told his partners in crime EXACTLY what he thought of that plan. That said, Moses got the message that any information he could get out of the Warden would be greatly helpful to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moses, see if you can get any info from our Warden friend, and Henry... STOP fingering yourself... NOW!\" Samantha said, before she and Alex continued walking through the prison, living the two nuns' lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Henry grumbled, withdrawing his fingers from his pussy and drying them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So...\" Moses said awkwardly as he walked briskly through the halls with Warden Jones gripping his arm a bit too tightly to be regarded as just friendly. \"What exactly do you do here, Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, Sister Ethel. Please, Mr Jones is my father. I'm sure we can have a much more <i>personal</i> relationship than that. And as for my job, you know how it is: corralling these varmints- I mean, prisoners- making sure that they are calm and unable to cause damage to themselves or others around them. You know, one time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses groaned mentally as the warden continued to ramble on about his previous experiences inside the prison walls. <i>'No wonder you're a prison guard,'</i> he mumbled, <i>'No sane person would listen to your crap all day if they weren't locked up.'</i> Moses nodded innocently as Jeff continued, his gaze shifting to focus on the onlooking prisoners that were clutching the bars of their cells, whooping and hollering as he passed, all of them unaware that the cute nun they thought they were seeing was actually a middle-aged, big Jamaican man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses spotted a petite, female guard patrolling the corridor and, as an act of charity, decided he should 'help' the poor lady before one of the bigger felons tried to pick on her. He giggled as the lady shot up in height, going from a meagre 5'2\" to an intimidating 6'3\", stretching out the conservative black slacks and grey shirt she'd been wearing. A second swap was made and her clothes COMPLETELY gave away as her muscles swelled, her defined biceps tearing off her sleeves and her bulky new quads ripped what was left of her slacks to shred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Nearly done,'</i> he chuckled as the woman's wavy blonde locks were sucked back into her scalp only to be replaced a second later by a crude, DIY military buzzcut. Not only was the hair on the top of her head changed; no, at the same time little dots of stubble began to grow around her lips and mouth until she'd developed a fully grown beard that even a seasoned lumberjack would be proud of. Although Moses couldn't see it he guessed that the woman's pubic bush would have also swapped and he could only imagine the carpet burn that the woman's partner (if she had one) would feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight giggle escaped his lips when he walked past his unfortunate swapping victims: a hulking bruised that had been giving Moses the stink eye as soon as he came in was looking a LOT less intimidating now with his miniature stature and orange jumpsuit that was obviously meant for someone bigger. A man- who Moses suspected had built up his profile as a 'tough guy' due to his nasty sneer and confrontational stance- now looked plain silly as he tried to keep up how tough act despite his long, blowdryed mane and hairless body devoid of any muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses glanced at yet another unlucky soul, a scrawny looking man who's eyes fluttered nervously around, not trying to make eye contact with anyone in fear of getting on the wrong side of someone. <i>Someone needs some confidence,</i> Moses thought as he targeted the prisoner and the buff female guard. The Amazonian guard groaned suddenly as she felt something large growing through her virgin vagina lips and brushing past her hairy pubic bush. The impressive 7-inch boner was evident underneath the woman's red knickers and destroyed slacks and Moses could tell that the woman was silently cursing herself at getting an erection on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...some bad people over in the secure wing.\" Moses' curiosity was piqued as he turned back towards Warden Jones and asked, \"What do you mean by 'bad people'? Who's inside there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they aren't just your run-of-the-mill criminals, all the people locked up in the secure wing are not only threats to the outside world but to all the other prisoners in here. We're talking about the WORST of the WORST.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses didn't have to pretend he was intrigued as he replied, \"Oh yeah, they have to be pretty bad to get there. I heard that one of the inmates locked up there, Hector Santoro, was a former mafia boss, ruthless and cunning. Oh please, give me a couple of minutes with him, I've always wanted to, erm... help the criminally insane! Yep, that's why I got into this biz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I can't let you do that, Sister. I would LOVE to see your work in action, BUT, strict Wentworth policy states that I can't allow visitors anywhere near the private sectors of the penitentiary. Sorry Ethel, my hands are tied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses cursed silently before he placed one of his beefy hands on the warden's cheeks, holding down his urge to hurl as he forced himself to sultrily whisper, \"C'mon Jeff, just let me have a quick chat with Hector. I'll say that I forced you to do it and you'll get off Scott free. And you have NO IDEA how much I would owe you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses watched the Warden's face apprehensively, observing as the warden's face going from shock at Moses' blatant sexual advances to fear at losing his job to an unnerving lustful expression that made Moses shiver slightly. \"Well,\" he said as if he was considering his options, \"I guess a couple of minutes can't hurt anyone.\" Moses was about to fistpump in triumph before Warden Jones continued, \"But I need something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses only had a moment to mutter a quick, <i>Crap,</i> before he felt Warden Jones' arm start to roam his back, sliding down until he reached Moses' backside and squeezed it in rapid succession. <i>Think about the money, think about the money,</i> he told himself as he felt the Warden drag him away from the leering crowd and closer to an unoccupied cell.</span></div></div>",

We've got the perfect disguises, so no real rush yet.\" Samantha replied as the two of them walked past lots and lots of prison cells, with some very unsavory characters in them. Bald heads and tattoos seemed to be a thing, she noticed, as did Alex. But neither of them were intimidated by the wolf whistles, cat calls and sometimes outright threats directed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry!?\" Alex whispered, hoping to hear a reply in her earpiece. She heard nothing but static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pussy-boy is probably still fingering himself to his porn.\" Samantha grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave her a funny look. \"Why exactly did you bring him again?\" She asked, referring to Henry's uselessness... so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugged at first, but then looked back at Alex. \"His skills will come in handy on the job, even if he's been of limited health here.\" She said. Then she looked up, noticing a female prison guard approaching them. She wasn't particularly attractive and had her shoulder length brown hair secured in a neat bun, she was also a tiny bit of the chubby side and was no more than 5'5\". Sam and Alex had both noticed, but not been surprised by the lack of women in the prison. After all, it was a high secure penitentiary for some of the worst scum in the States. <i>Hmm, got to work with what you got.</i> Sam thought, smirking a little as she swapped the guard with one of the hardened cons in his cell. The Latino inmate, about 30-ish, slim but muscular... continued standing at his cell door as the guard's Caucasian C-cup tits sprouted on his chest... stretching his prison vest. His large puffy nipples were very evident in the cold cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\" Alex chuckled quietly, noticing the prison guard's deflated uniform shirt as they passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, give the guy something to play with while he's locked away.\" Sam chuckled back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes were fully locked on the screen on a pretty standard video of two women making out, one of the duo possessing what looked like a mighty 6-inch strap between her smooth thighs. <i>I wish I could get myself a good cockgirl,</i> he thought as he looked to a guard outside and smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside the porno the strap on suddenly disappeared, vanishing before being replaced by a hefty tanned penis that bulged angrily on the lady's petite frame. The woman, of course, was unfazed and continued to plough her thick womanmeat into her partner whose eyes had rolled back into her head with ecstasy. Henry could feel himself close to orgasming when he heard angry yelling coming from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly shifted away from his laptop and scurried up to the window. Outside he could see the forms of 3 armoured goons shifting around awkwardly as a 20-something-year-old beautiful blonde bombshell angrily lectured them about something. Henry couldn't help but admire her plump crimson lips, her unmissable bust and slim curves that perfectly complimented her tight black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...how was I supposed to know that you was reversing ya jeep next to my car, nimrod?\" Henry laughed as he heard the pretty woman arguing with a thick, Boston accent that seemed to annoy the guards that were standing there. As the conflict intensified, Henry could feel his eyes getting drowsy and his limbs getting heavier. The woman's voice, which had seemed far away and distant through the glass window, began to get clearer and clearer, so clear in fact that it was like he was speaking the words himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had closed his eyes for a second staring out the window but now found himself face to face with one of the bulky helmets of the goons, so close that he could see the pretty woman's face staring at him in the man's reflective blue visor. Wait, what the... Henry glanced down and squealed as he looked down upon his supple form, grabbing his plump DDs with mixed emotions of shock and curiosity. <i>'Holy crap, I'm a chick!,'</i> he whispered as he studied his new form with awe, not listening to the goon continuing to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ignoring me? Alright, that's it: you're comin' with me, lady.\" Henry's time exploring his new body was cut short as he felt the guard's beefy arm clutch his petite wrist. Without even thinking his body immediately reacted, flipping the goon over his shoulder before pressing one of his stiletto heels against the guard's throats. CLICK! Henry slowly raised his chin as he saw the two other guards train their rifles square in the middle of his forehead. \"Oops,\" Henry giggled nervously as the guards pulled him up and slapped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm REAL sorry that I flipped your friend! Now I don't think that being hasty and arresting me is the best option here, wouldn't you agree,\" he pleaded as the guards dragged him closer to the entrance of the penitentiary. <i>'Damn, Sam's gonna KILL ME,'</i> he muttered with the woman's pretty voice.</span></div></div>",

More precisely, taking one straight in the ass. He just couldn't believe this warden couldn't see anything wrong with \"Sister Ethel\" being a middle-aged, muscular black man. Moses gritted his teeth and closed his eyes as he felt the warden lift his Nun's gown, revealing his hairy backside and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say Sister Ethel, I've had my eye on you for some time, you're so cute!\" The warden flirted, sounding like quite the sexual pervert. Moses just agreed with whatever he said, unable to use his powers due to lack of concentration and the fact that he and the warden were the only people in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a married man Warden.\" Moses replied, playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warden just laughed. \"My wife hasn't understood me for years, and neither have my kids.\" He said to Moses, as he slapped both his hairy hands on his manly thighs and lined himself up. The Warden's pants were unzipped and his dick hanging out, fully erect. Moses braced himself and closed his eyes again as he felt the man's cock enter his sphincter. <i>Fuck you for this Alex.</i> Moses grumbled to himself, recoiling a little from the penetration. He was starting to wonder whether all this was actually worth it, swapping power or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********</div><br>\r\nMeanwhile, Henry was being led to other prison guards for processing, stumbling along in his stiletto pumps, blonde hair falling in his pretty new face and quite unable to take his eyes off the amazing DD-cup tits jiggling away on his feminine chest. He had to admit, this chick's body was smoking hot! He had gathered from the way she was dressed that she was a hooker or some sort, maybe a high class one. And he was intelligent enough to realize she had probably just been fucking one of the inmates, maybe even Santoro himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booking this woman for assault and verbal abuse Hank.\" One of the armed guards said, as another put Chloe's... now Henry's bag on the table. He arched an eyebrow when he produced a still wet dildo from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done fucked up Todd. That's Santoro's favorite girl. She's just left the place.\" The processing guard shook his head, smirking. \"If she's bruised in any way, Santoro is gonna have you fucked up good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" The guard, Todd grumbled, looking back at Henry. \"Well, she still assaulted a prison guard, so I'm filing charges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself!\" Hank mumbled, getting the paperwork ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry just rolled his eyes and sighed, as he looked down at the handcuffs securing his dainty wrists together. He this chick was now in his body back in the van with all his equipment... and his porn. But he was more afraid of what Sam and Alex would do to him when they found out he'd been arrested.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although Wentworth was supposedly a maximum security prison the duo faced barely any obstacles in their search for Santoro's cell apart from the occasional nosy guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So,'</i> Alex wheezed as the pair ducked behind one of the concrete walls just as a beefy female guard started pacing up and down in front of a set of heavy, reinforced steel doors. <i>'W-What's the?.. What's the plan here?'</i> Alex could feel the fatigue of running around taking a toll on her body; she knew that she would be out of shape after her three year tenure at <i>Meats 'N' Treats</i> but she didn't know she'd be THIS bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha held up a single finger as she pressed her other hand onto the earpiece hidden underneath her black shawl. <i>'Henry! HENRY?!'</i> she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -----  - - --  --- - -- --- - - --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gasped as her eyes flicked open and she found herself collapsed in a heap on the caravan's sticky, carpeted floor. \"Ew...\" she moaned before she slapped her mouth shut in shock, a strange voice with a hint Chinese accent emanating from her lips. She shot up and, even before taking in her surroundings, ran into the bathroom. A bloodcurdling scream followed a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe started hyperventilating as she pawed at her flat chest, flaky skin and messy black hair as she stared into the grime covered mirror opposite her. \"Ew, I'm, like, so UGLY!\" she cried. Not only had she lost her stunningly good looks, she'd also lost any chance of continuing her well paying job as an escort. <i>Or maybe not,</i> she thought as she lifted up the hem of Henry's boxers and peeked inside. <i>A little on the small side but I can work with this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe took one last glimpse outside to see her hot pink convertible being towed away by a couple of those gun-toting numbskulls. She silently cursed before she looked through the grubby van, both dejected and elated as she saw a greasy key left inside the ignition. \"Ugh, the things I do for money,\" she said as she hopped into the driver's seat, unaware that she'd both carried away hundreds of dollars' worth of computing equipment and also our heist team's hopes of having a smooth escape from the penitentiary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- --- - ---  --- -  - -- - -- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'...HENRY?! Pick up, you horny bastard!'</i> Sam swore under her breath as she gave up trying to contact Henry. She took one last glac\u00e9 at the guard in front of the heavy duty doors and grinned as an idea popped into her head. She then frantically slipped off the nun gown, handing it to Alex and stating, \"As soon as I do this, be ready to tie me up. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alex could protest, Sam peeked her head out once more, willing a swap between the beefy guard and herself. A moment later and there was a loud <i>POP!</i> as Samantha's head was sucked into the folds her neck and out popped a chubby little head that looked shaken from its journey. Alex capitalised on the guard's disorientation and expertly wrapped the shawl around Sam's former wrists and ankles, tearing off a portion to stuff it into the guard's fat gob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pushed the guard inside an isolated cell and pulled the door shut before running swiftly up to Sam who was definitely less than impressed by her new bod. \"Looks like you've gained a few pounds since I last saw you,\" Alex giggled, taking off her own cloak as Samantha rolled her eyes and placed her chunky palm onto the door's scanners. There was a soft whooshing sound as the doors slid open- Sam and Alex looked on with a sense of pride as they saw the line of cells on either side with only tinny red lights to illuminate the path forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ambled forwards, checking the identification numbers on the doors of each cell in order to locate Santoro's cubicle. Alex had just passed yet another wrong cell when she felt a tight, vice-like grip clamping down on her arm. She yelled timidly, struggling wildly as the eerie face of a tattooed man came out of the shadows. \"You're a pretty little one, aren't you?\" the man's hoarse voice cackled just as Sam ran over and tried to wrench the man's arm off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds of terror and Alex finally escaped the clutches of the inmate known only as <i>'The Snake'</i>. \"Are you okay?\" Samantha asked but Alex wasn't listening; normally she would've turned and tried to punch this pervert in the face (which probably wouldn't have ended up well, to be honest) but instead a strange calm washed over her. \"<i>'Snake'</i>, is it?\" she addressed the prisoner, \"Well Mr Snake, I didn't really APPRECIATE you grabbing me like that. So let's see how you do without YOUR snake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers and winced slightly as she felt a massive 8-inch-cobra slither out into her tight black knickers. In order to keep her new equipment from suffocating she also swapped over her underwear, giving the man her uncomfortably large bra and pants and in return recieving his comfortable white Y-fronts. \"Mhmm,\" she mumbled with delight as she massaged her new member, much to the shock and dismay of its previous owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Mr Snake, you've seen from that little demonstration that I possess a LOT of power, power I can use to not only HUMILIATE you but also make you lose all that precious 'street cred' that I know you've built up during your stay here. So if I even HEAR that you've tried to touch another woman inappropriately, I will stomp back in here and make sure that the rest of your sentence is a LIVING HELL. Understand?\" The man formerly known as 'Snake' nodded eagerly. \"Now where is Hector Santoro?\" The man pointed down the hall nervously as Alex arrogantly flipped her hair and strutted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, that was AWESOME! The way you handled him I'd be surprised if he ever even LOOKED at another lady again! You seemed like you were having fun,\" Samantha laughed as they reached the final cell door. Alex couldn't help but crack a smile as she coyly replied, \"Yeah, now I know why they called this guy <i>'The SNAKE'</i>!\" Sam once again pressed her chubby palm on the scanner and both of them heard a loud click as the door swung inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside sat Hector Santoro, the world-renowned mob boss known for his temper and ruthlessness, sitting cross legged on the floor with a mug of tea held in his delicate digits. The stories that Samantha had heard were true: Santoro was unarguably drop-dead gorgeous. He had luscious dark auburn hair that flowed elegantly down her shoulders and back. He had a beautiful face with mesmerising silver eyes that seemed to both make your heart flutter and menace you at the same time. He had perfectly, moisturised, tanned skin (probably paler than usual due to his lack of sunlight over the past few years) that seemed to radiate with an unearthly glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantoro had his full lips pulled into an expression that seemed to be unsure of what it was supposed to connote, either happiness at the presence or the girls or anger at being disturbed. Two large, golden hoops hung from his earlobes, swinging around silently as Hector craned his head to try and size up Sam and Alex. \"So,\" he spoke in a sensuous voice that you wouldn't have related to a man who'd ordered dozens of deaths beforehand, \"What are two pretty ladies like you here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nowheaties.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/desiree-jpg.jpeg?w=500&amp;h=800\" target=\"_blank\">https://nowheaties.files.wordpress.com/2...</a></span></div></div>",

He was sure a Nun's life was usually so much more tame, but not with Alex and Samantha around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the Warden was making more small talk when there was a knock on the office door. In walked senior guard Malcolm Turner. \"Excuse me Warden, but your family have returned.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Warden Jones grumbled, glancing over to Moses. \"I do apologize Sister, but it looks like our time together will have to be cut short.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shame they didn't return earlier. Before you fucked my ass man.</i> Moses thought, as he perspired under his Nun's gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Warden showed \"Sister Ethel\" to the door, he was suddenly startled by the sooner arrival of his wife Helen and his two children Kate, 12, and Robert, 10. The warden's wife looked at Moses for a moment, as if in disdain, but then she nodded, but only because she actually saw a religious figure standing there. \"Plans have changed my dear.\" Helen explained to her husband, stepping forward and kissing him on the cheek. \"We can stay here a while longer.\" She obviously knew her husband was being unfaithful, but then again.. so was she. One of the other prison guards, a handsome 6'4\" beefcake called Samuel, had been making a woman out of her now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses took his leave, but not before getting a little payback on the warden for having violated him. Seeing the two children stood to one side, behaving themselves, Moses swapped the warden's dick over to his daughter. The 12-year old girl's grey knee-length skirt stretched out in front as her father's sizeable schlong surged from her crotch, with the hairy nutsack following and making her wince even more. There was only so much room in her cotton knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see you fuck anymore Nuns you bumbaclot!\" Moses smirked, mumbling to himself in his Jamaican accent. Not wanting to leave the younger brother out of the 'fun' too, Moses swapped the lad with his mother. The boy's legs began stretching up in length, his feet grew slightly into his mother's, his ass inflated and ripped his jeans and his pre-pubescent dick and balls morphed into his mother's mature, sexually active snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake Robert. How many more pairs of jeans are you going to ruin?\" Helen turned, her smaller feet maneuvering in her too large flats and her skirt dropping down to her ankles, unable to be held up by her narrow, boyish hips and flat butt. Even her knickers were too large for her now ,but they didn't fall down because they got snagged on her soft, 10-year old penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say you both need some new clothes my dear.\" The warden chimed up, noticing his wife's wardrobe malfunction but of course unaware of any swaps 'Sister Ethel' had made. As he said this, he scratched the 12-year old pussy he now possessed through his trousers and briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses chuckled, and took his leave, feeling his cock swell with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in Santoro's cell, Sam and Alex had explained everything to the criminal gang leader, hoping to get him onboard. Once he had been told and became aware of the swaps to Sam and Alex, the Latino criminal eyed the hug bulge in Alex's Nun's gown... and smirked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha was starting to get restless, tapping her boot onto the cold concrete surface of the cell as Santoro sucked in a puff of another one of his seemingly endless supply of expensive cigars. \"So,\" he exhaled, breathing out a small ring of smoke, \"You want MY help to get inside some prestigious gala so YOU can steal some money from a couple of overprivileged bastards? Sorry, no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex moved like a blur, ripping the cigar out of Santoro's delicate fingers and crushing it under the sole of her shoe. She'd picked up a knife from one of the discarded plates strewn across the cubicle and pressed it menacingly against Hector's throat. \"Don't give us that bullsh*t. You obviously would rather spend your time on the outside, that's why you've fixed up your place like this. I don't really think you want to spend ANOTHER three years rotting in this crap hole.\" Samantha couldn't help but feel both terrified and dumbstruck. On one hand she couldn't let Alex ruin this job after so much time spent planning it but on the other hand, seeing Alex go unhinged like this was weirdly turning her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantoro laughed despite the sharpened shiv pressed against his jugular. \"Please, if you could kill me you would've.\" Alex held her position for a couple more seconds before releasing Santoro reluctantly, the knife still gripped tightly in her palm. \"I have to admit, feisty <i>puttanas</i> like you have the uncanny ability to get me REAL horny. See that murderous gleam in your eyes: yeah, I can tell you wanna kill me. What is it? Did I threaten you? An uncle? A niece or nephew, huh?\" Alex scowled as Santoro sized her up. \"<i>Oh</i>, I must've done something bad to YOU! If it makes any consolation, <i>mio bambina</i>, I haven't done anything close to murderous in about... two or so years. Can't say I'm sorry though- if I did something, there was probably a valid reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched as Alex tended and gritted her teeth. She could tell that she had to step in before this argument escalated. \"Whatever happened in the past can be discussed another time; for now we just need information on your old friend, Lord Basildon, and possible places he could host an event like the one we're looking for.\" Sam could tell that mentioning Basildon attracted Santoro's attention, his silvery eyes clouding over and his pretty face darkening in the dim artificial light. \"Wait, that lying, backstabbing <i>maiale</i> is gonna be there?!\" Sam and Alex shared a quick glance as Santoro began pacing up and down his cell (probably imagining torturing that traitor in 1000 different ways).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll help you...\" Sam and Alex fist bumped triumphantly. \"But...\" Alex sighed frustratedly. <i>There's ALWAYS a 'but' isn't there,</i> she grumbled. \"IF I help you, and that's a big if, there's gotta be some ground rules: first off, if I help you, you take me with you.\" Alex began to protest when Samantha held a stubby finger to her lips and motioned for Santoro to continue. \"Second, I get a 25% cut of all the profits we make during this heist, whether that's cash, jewels or assets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha obviously wasn't completely in agreement with this arrangement but time was running out: they had to get the location quickly before they could plan a way in. \"What's next?\" Santoro stroked his smooth chin as he pondered what else he wanted. As he looked at Samantha he could see the shimmer of something green peeking out through the unbuttoned collar of her guard's polo uniform. \"I want whatever the hell that is!\" He reached for the stone but found it difficult to overpower its owner in his petite body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, no way Jose. This necklace is not up for grabs. It NEVER leaves my possession.\" Hector guffawed as he said, \"Please, what could be so important about a lame trinket like that?!\" He moved rapidly and snatched the stone before anyone could react. Suddenly, a wave of knowledge passed over him, imbuing him with the same abilities and trait-thieving powers of all our other criminal protagonists. Samantha angrily snatched back the necklace, clipping it around her chubby neck and hiding it under her shirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hector was staring at his hands with amazement, feeling the strange power coursing through his veins as he chuckled giddily. \"What the hell was THAT?!\" he laughed as Alex also shot Samantha a questioning look. \"That,\" she explained, \"was a fragment of a very powerful stone that was gifted to me by my half-sister, a woman you may remember as Savannah Shaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By touching it, you've acquired extraordinary powers to steal and swap traits but you probably knew that. Now, about the location...\" Santoro was too excited to listen as Samantha kept on droning about that stuffy gala. He flew out of the room and out into the corridor, leaving a cacophony of frightened screams in his wake. Alex and Sam followed him out a few moments after but he was already gone. They walked out and heard another bloodcurdling scream coming from a cell nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Sam couldn't stifle thejr laughter as they looked at the source of the scream. The man had an average build with one of those <i>'you-don't-wanna-ask-me-where-I-got-this'</i> scars that made a zigzag pattern on his face. \"Damn, he works fast,\" Alex remarked as she saw the man trembling on the floor holding his crotch. His coveted maple coloured sausage was now nowhere to be found and, for some strange reason, neither of them could sense ANY genitalia in its place at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like he's LITERALLY stealing traits! (see what I did there?)\" Sam said as she turned on the emasculated prisoner. \"We need to stop him before he completely blows our cover.\" The girls turned and walked towards the heavy doors leading to the outside prison. Samantha began to push the doors shut but then couldn't help herself from making one more swap. The genitalless man's sobs grew louder as he felt his muscles melting away and being replaced by rolls of fat. Sam meanwhile admired her new bod; though it was not nearly as attractive as her old body, she'd gained a couple inches that now boosted her to a modest 5'5\" and also gained a little muscle mass in the process. \"Let's go catch that criminal.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Santoro was 'acquiring' his new powers and being pursued by an increasingly irritated Sam and Alex, Moses had discovered what had happened to Henry, and he was not impressed. \"How the fuck did he get himself into this situation? And in that body?\" Moses grumbled to himself, noticing the guards leading a stumbling Henry away in the high class escort's heels. He was sure it was Henry, just because of the way the 'woman' was complaining and protesting. Inhibited by his clumsy Nun's attire, Moses knew helping Henry would not be the easiest thing. The main reason though, there were only male guards in the vicinity. Moses knew swapping them out with each other would do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group of guards, with Henry in amongst them, stopped off to get a prison jumpsuit in Chloe's/Henry's size, Moses decided he'd better make his move. Luckily, he was still 'Sister Ethel' as far as anyone else knew, so he did have one advantage. If the pervy warden found him attractive, then maybe the guards did too. Sighing, and wincing as his asshole still tingled a little from the seeing to the warden had given him, Moses moved his muscular Jamaican form forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya boys.\" Moses announced his presence, waving at the guards and feeling quite ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guards turned to face him and smiled. Henry smiled when he saw Moses, but kept quiet. The guard called Todd was the one to speak up first. \"Hey Sister. What can we do for you?\" He replied, giving Moses the quick once over and imagining what was underneath the religious gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering, can I have a private word?\" Moses spoke quietly, trying his best to flirt with Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd nodded. \"Sure Sister. Hang tight guys, be right back.\" He said, before walking away arm in muscular arm with Moses to a nearby private security room. Once the door was shut, Moses headbutted the guard and knocked him out cold. \"Ouch!\" Moses grimaced, holding his forehead. He then swapped lives with the prison guard and became 'Todd Holloway'. Moses then stripped out of the Nun's clothes he was wearing, which was a relief, and got dressed in the guard's uniform. Fortunately, Todd was a similar build to Moses and the clothes were a good fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Sister, but this is your new life.\" Moses snickered, glancing down at the unconscious, naked prison guard as he dropped the Nun's clothes on top of him. He then checked his uniform and left the room, heading back to the other two guards, who were still watching Henry. They of course saw nothing out of the ordinary, despite the fact that their colleague 'Todd' was now a black man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quick, she just suck you off?\" One of the guards joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny dipshit.\" Moses responded. \"Why don't you go back to the front gate? We'll take care of our girl here.\" Moses told the guard, while gesturing to his other colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard yawned, then nodded. \"Fine by me. But if you're gonna have fun with her, let me know.\" He winked, before slapping Henry's sexy ass in passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses had control of the situation now, there was just him and one other guard with Henry, and as soon as they were in an appropriate area of the prison, Moses resorted to the good old fashioned way of dealing with someone. He hit the guard over the head with his nightstick and knocked him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time. Jesus frickin' Christ!\" Henry whined in his female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even want to know how you ended up in that ho's body.\" Moses shook his head, annoyed by Henry's predicament. Sam's probably gonna fuck you up good when I tell her about this.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't tell her!\" Henry sighed, trying to walk in his stiletto heels still. He then frowned and looked down at his female form. He was pretty sure Sam would be able to tell that he'd fucked up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the van?\" Moses asked, pretty much knowing what the reply might be as he admired Henry's new slutty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably gone. If the guards don't have it, I bet this bitch has stolen it or something.\" Henry shrugged his slender shoulders. \"Like I said, it doesn't matter. Let's just find the others and get the fuck outta here.\" He grumbled further, as his heels echoed in the prison hall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They both peeked out and sniggered as they observed the situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was utter pandemonium. Prisoners, guards and unlucky visitors alike found themselves changed by th renegade rouge Hector Santoro himself. They watched as a portly guard tried to shout everyone into order: this was made substantially harder by the fact he had the cute vocals of a 6-year-old girl along with her fluffy pink tutu and stubby, little legs. The girl on the other hand couldn't help but brag about her new equipment to her horrified daddy with the guard's booming voice, a toothy smile stretching across her face as her new hormones caused her new 'wee-wee stick' to get erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inmate that had been on the phone to his busty Latino girlfriend suddenly gasped as her ponytailed head disappeared into the folds of her neck. A moment later, a disheveled, bearded head appeared in its place with missing teeth and what looked like a giant, brown wart on the edge of its nose. The girlfriend continued flirting nonetheless, getting slightly offended as her lover began pointing out her 'facial issues'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guard that had been watching the scene with curiosity started to feel his own change coming. He looked down and saw his whole torso had begun to morph and change. He squeaked as he felt two engorged mounds erupt from his chest and immediately culled them with surprise. He wasn't actually too unhappy with his swap but a second later he felt the bottom of his prison polo stretch too as his brand new belly bump grew in. He looked outside the glass to an equally shocked lady on the outside who was looking at the man's new form with shock and jealousy at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attractive looking lawyer that had been negotiating a deal with her beefy bodied client suddenly stopped speaking and stared into the air. <i>'She'</i> snapped back to reality a second later and looked at herself with awe, rubbing her dainty fingers all over her navy-blue pantsuit as if she was unused to having her own body. \"What the... Randy, did we just...\" the inmate said as 'his' posture shifted and his legs crossed over effeminately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy sh*t, Mary! I'm in YOUR smoking bod!\" Randy Jenkins, a notorious misogynist and sexual harasser, now found himself in his sexy lawyer's, Miss Mary Dean, middle aged MILF body. He cupped his ample D-cups with his manicured hands and juggled them around much to the contempt of Mary herself. She slapped his hand away and they began to start arguing angrily while Samantha chuckled inthe background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he's already grasped the basics,\" she laughed before she saw Alex's scowling face looking back at her. \"What?! You gotta admit, it's pretty impressive for a rookie.\" Alex shook her head frustratedly as she turned away- Sam might not have cared about Santoro's past but Alex certainly wasn't going to forget about their confrontation from the last time they saw one another any time soon. \"Let's just catch him and get gat we came for,\" she replied sternly. She straightened out her black dress and readjusted her hefty snake. Even though the new set of genitals felt slightly uncomfortable in the delicate panties that Alex had decided to wear, she couldn't help but feel hard as she watched the chaos unfolding. <i>Curse you Santoro, you sexy, murderous genius!'</i> she whispered under her breath.</span></div></div>",

Alex also was aware that she still had the life of the Nun she had swapped with earlier, but she was hardly dressed the part. Sam meanwhile still had the life of the beefy (and now muscular) female guard her pretty head was currently fastened to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's part of the fun.\" Sam admitted, glancing over with amusement as the angry MILF lawyer tried to stop her horny client from shoving his manicured hands into his panties to finger himself. The bodyswapped mysogynist was discovering the joys of womanhood, much to his lawyer's distress. That said, she was experiencing a whole new experience of her own as a reluctant erection strained against her briefs and prison jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we have to catch him.\" Alex said, suggesting they split up. She then swapped identies with another female prison guard who was stood watching the chaos Santoro had caused in the visitor's area. But Alex kept her own clothes, making her a very sexily dressed prison guard. Meanwhile the new 'Sister Cartwright' was wondering why she was suddenly wearing a prison uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess he should be easy to follow.\" Samantha giggled, flexing one of her biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Alex scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women split up and went their own way, with Alex taking one last look into the visitor's room at the wonderful carnage Santoro had wrought.

Good thing she wasn't aware of her change. \"Oh you're a gem Santoro.\" Alex groaned, rubbing her hard-on through her dress. She then set off walking in search of the master criminal. After all, they still had somewhere to be and rich people to fuck with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha made her way through the prison, not finding anymore sign of Santoro's presence.

He felt the tight clothes cutting into his muscle tissue; the low-cut top severely restricted his galumptious cleavage, the short black skirt and red thong combo sliced into his gluteal muscles and the black stiletto pumps on her feet were nigh impossible to run in. \"Keep up will you,\" Moses hollered as he turned another corner and bumped past a busty Latin inmate careening past. <i>\"Easy for you to say, you unswapped prick,\"</i> Henry hissed under his breath as he cast the shoes aside. Moses had miraculously somehow remained virtually unchanged albeit his muscular body was now dressed in a prison guard's body with a foreign surname on his nametag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was forced to stop as a burly redheaded man stepped into his path. The man, deprived of sexual interaction for what Henry assumed was decades, had a surly grin plastered onto his face. Henry smirked, flicking his blonde hair out of his face before he deftly switched their genitals over. The man looked horrified as he looked down to check his junk (or lack of). Henry took this opportunity to attack, swinging his handcuffed wrists upwards into the man's chin and knocking him clean out. <i>'Huh,'</i> Henry laughed to himself, <i>'Guess I got myself a good cock-girl after all.'</i> He swivelled round and ran after Moses. The prisoners still left in that corridor stood back and observed in awe- they'd never make lecherous jokes about one of Santoro's prostitutes ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Moses had come across the visiting area and had stumbled into a situation of absolute pandemonium. Despite the chaos surrounding him he focused his mind and took a double take. He began to notice a pattern of people with <i>missing</i> appendages instead of swapped ones. A headless woman would've fallen straight onto the tiled floor had Moses not caught her midair. It was clear she was in distress due to the erratic jerking of her arms as he hoisted her back up but Moses had neither the time nor the patience to calm her down. \"The person that did this, where'd they go?\" The woman nodded(?) towards the right. Moses thanked her as Henry came to his side. \"Come on, bodysnatcher,\" he said as he gestured for Henry to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sprinted towards the area but stopped as Sam came into view in front of them. \"Sam!\" Henry cried out as Sam stood ramrod still. Though she looked to have gained a <i>significant</i> amount of muscle since the last time he\u2019d seen her, he still recognised her black hair and overall mannerisms. She seemed to be completely silent apart from a few momentary gasps that escaped her lips. \u201cSamantha?\u201d Henry repeated again in Chloe\u2019s squeaky hooker voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your friend can\u2019t talk right now, she\u2019s too busy <i>NOT</i> breathing,\u201d chuckled an insidiously melodic voice from the end of the corridor. Moses and Henry ran forwards, just in time to catch Sam as she collapsed onto the floor unconscious. The source of the voice stepped out of the shadows to reveal a stunning feminine form with caramel skin, sly golden eyes and a perfectly rounded face. Her figure was impressive, 5'10\" with slender legs, slim hips and a decent rack spilling out of the unbuttoned top of the milky blue belted shirt dress they were held inside. The womanly figure sharpened their dark edges with a white-acryliced nai before turning to face them imposingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1962/2013/products/SS19-1300050652-BUE_M1_400x.progressive.jpg?v=1586885003\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1962/2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Santoro...\" Moses growled. \u201c<i>Fyah fi yuh!</i> What\u2019ve you dun to her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantoro smirked as he straightened the ruffles of his oversized white jacket. \"Like the upgrades?\" He laughed as he used his new hands to caress his cute new form. \"I had to steal a <i>LOT</i> of people's traits to build this perfect body,\" he giggled mischievously, \"Unfortunately for my donors, they've all been dispossessed of their own.

I've put this whole thing together but I've no idea if it's <i>'on trend'</i> or not!\" He laughed maniacally (a very difficult task to do when you've stolen the voice of a soon-to-be superstar R'n'B vocalist) as he admired his spotless over-the-knee platform heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...As for what I <i>did</i>, I've just 'temporarily' borrowed one of her <i>lungs!</i> And if any of you <i>succhiacazzi</i>s try to follow me, you'll get the same...\" His monologue was halted abruptly as Alex pounced on him from behind, taking him to the floor and locking him into a airtight rear naked choke. Santoro gasped for air as Alex whispered, <i>\"Would you be so kind as to return my friend's lung, please?\"</i> Santoro choked, grasping at Alex's surprisingly strong arms helplessly. He tried to quickly steal Alex's arms but his head was already too far gone. Finally he tapped out on Alex's arms, breathing in deeply as she released her hold. \"Now your end,\" Alex barked. Santoro begrudgingly snapped his fingers and Sam shot upwards and heaved in oxygen from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little...\" Sam hissed as she regained her composure. She would've lashed out at the former crime boss had it not been for Moses' strong arms reeling her in. Hector grumbled as Alex helped him to his feet- he cursed under his breath as he noted the greasy scuff marks on his recently acquired belongings. Alex rolled her eyes as she reached for his hand and bolted towards the entrance with Sam, Henry and Moses tailing them in quick succession. Luckily for them, the chaos happening in the visiting area had meant that the penitentiary's staff had been diverted to the visiting area and cells where the prisoners had started an impromptu riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all heaved together as a unit towards the exit. Sam backtracked momentarily to inspect the cell where she and Alex had stashed the tied up, beefy headed woman with the rest of Sam's body. The raven-haired Latina waved <i>adios</i> as she re-exchanged their bodies, returning the woman's body (albeit with more additional muscle mass). A lone guard manned the exit and motioned to pull out his stun gun on the fivesome when he suddenly lost all sensations in his appendages. His slim torso collapsed to the ground, devoid of all limbs, and he was helpless but to watch them escape with one of the most high-value-inmates the place had incarcerated. Henry whooped as they left, ecstatic at the sight of them finally leaving that revolting cesspool of sin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stopped in the middle of the car park, causing a comedic pile-up as they all crashed into each other. \"Henry,\" she growled, \"...where's the van?\" Henry's dopey grin faded away and he began awkwardly chewing a stray lock of hair (a trait he'd unknowingly picked up from his host body. Alex rolled her eyes, Sam facepalmed and Hector cursed himself for letting himself be subdued by one of these idiots. \"You've <i>LOST</i> your getaway vehicle? <i>Oh dio aiutaci...</i>\" the mobster groaned. Moses, in another example of his quick, intuitive thinking, spotted the rust-encrusted convent caravan and bolted towards it and picked the standard locks with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop in!\" he yelled as the rest of the group clambered in, some more compliant than others. \"No! No way, I am Hector Santoro the Sixth, proud son of Hector 'The Stitcher', notorious crime boss and scourge of authorities worldwide! There's no way I'm...\" Santoro squealed unbecomingly as Moses slammed the rickety old bastard into gear and sped off, leaving a cloud of dust and dirt in his wake. Santoro sat dazed as the three others congratulated themselves and shared high-fives. \"Now <i>THAT'S</i> what I call a 'real-life Prison Break'!\" Henry whooped. He started doing his own celebratory victory dance, unconsciously gyrating sensuously with his lithe body in a way that made Sam and Alex blush sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" Alex said as she self-consciously cleared her throat. \"We've only made it past the easy part so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy?!\" Moses boomed from the driver's side. He then proceeded to spout a series of slurs in Patois about lying scumbags in quick succession. Sam rolled her eyes as she replied, \"Yup, got to admit, despite the chaos this guy caused, this operation was pretty straightforward. Even once Hector tells us where it's gonna be held we've got a ton of preparations to make: travel arrangements, invites, favours to cash in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A foolproof getaway plan that even an idiot could understand...\" Alex chimed in as she locked eyes with Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Harsh, but true. We can't afford any screw-ups from this point forward.\" Santoro had regained his bearings and raised his dainty hand in agreement. \"I second that idea,\" he drawled in a scintillating Californian accent, \"Ugh, after this roller-coaster of a day all I want is a nice soothing bath in my own room with a towel that hasn't been used to spank someone else in the showers.\" They all turned to stare at him. \"What, I'm a man of taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" Henry agreed. \"These puppies are telling me that they need to get out of these slutty clothes ASAP.\" He fondled his rack for a second before Samantha smacked his hands away condescendingly. \"Fine,\" she replied, \"Moses, take us to the nearest hotel you can find.\" The dreadlocked safe-cracker nodded and adjusted his route accordingly, riding off into the American sunset with a wary smile set on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was sweating profusely- whether from the humidity of the warm bubble bath he was lying inside or from the stress caused by his hair-styling, he couldn't tell- and his unblemished caramel face was littered with tiny droplets of sweat. His exquisite facial features were scrunched up tightly in anguish as svelte brown fingers weaved through his dark hair with unconscious precision and pace. \"Be <i>gentle</i>, Tonisha,\" he growled as the curvy African-American woman worked fervently to loosen his hair. The lady nodded robotically, her unblinking eyes diligently focused on her task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantoro exhaled loudly as he heard knuckles rapping on his door. He waved away Tonisha's painted nails as he levered himself out of the tub and wrapped a velvet towel around his toned midriff. He sensually twirled round a curly lock as he placed his eye on the peephole, groaning as he saw who was stood there. He reluctantly opened the door and watched as Henry nervously stepped through. \"I thought you were gonna be the pizza delivery boy,\" Hector sighed as he closed the door. Henry giggled apprehensively as he hopped onto the edge of the crimson love-heart bed. \"Sorry to disappoint you,\" he said as he fiddled with his dainty fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector sighed as he placed his hand on his hip and silently gave Henry the once-over. <i>Damn, he really looks just like her,</i> he thought to himself as he observed Henry's supple form from head to toe, noting how his well-rounded DD's stretched the tight fabric of the hotel tee he'd picked up from the gift shop whilst  admiring his delicately sculpted curves and shapely figure. He watched as Henry brushed a lock of blonde hair behind his slender shoulder, revealing two brilliant sapphires housed between a cute button nose. <i>He even sits like Chloe,</i> Hector thought as he espied the suggestive demeanour in which Henry crisscrossed his slender legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry picked up on Santoro's gaze and blushed self-consciously. Hector laughed as Henry's cheeks changed to a pinkish hue. \"Sorry for making you blush,\" the mobster chuckled, \"You just look exactly like my old girl, Chloe.\" Henry put on a uneasy smile as he replied in a soft Boston accent, \"Sorry about that, it kinda just happened when we were trying to break you out.\" Hector shook his head wryly as he opened the small mini fridge and pulled out a chilled bottle of white wine. He unscrewed the cork and poured equal portions into matching wineglasses, passing one to Henry as he sat in a velvet throne opposite him. Henry looked at the glass with disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't drink,\" he remarked before Santoro cut him off, saying, \"So what brings you to my quarters at this time of night?\" He expertly swished his glass with his slender fingers, sniffing the liquid momentarily before taking a gentle sip. Henry shrugged and attempted to copy Hector's gestures. He gagged slightly as the bitter concoction slipped down his throat. He brusquely downed the entirety of it before replying, \"Why do you think I need a reason to come over?\" Hector gave him an incredulous look and Henry rolled his eyes as he said, \"Fine, I needed to talk to you about something.\" Santoro smiled as he whistled Tonisha over to refill his glass. \"Why me of all people?\" Henry sighed as Tonisha bent to top up Hector's glass. \"Well, Moses decided to get an early night to recover and Sam and Alex are preoccupied in their own room. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Plus you might be the only one that might understand.\" Hector's ears perked up. He motioned for Henry to continue. Henry sighed as he gestured to himself. \"Look at me!,\" he whined, \"I'm a f*cking <i>dude</i> in a hooker's body! I've no idea what to do with myself! I'd imagined scenarios where this happened and what I'd do but this is a f*cking whole other level!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look at these boobs!\" He hoisted his massive mammaries upwards as he ranted, \"I've imagined being able to cup my own a couple times before but ,in real life, these are <i>such</i> a burden! These puppies add an extra kilo onto my chest, forcing me to always overcompensate by sticking out my butt, causing hell on my back!\" Santoro laughed as Henry jerked his hands erratically. \"...I'm pretty sure that I can feel I can feel some implants or something whenever I try to rearrange them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you, Mr Chen, that none of my... <i>hookers</i> have taken any augmentations on their bodies,\" Hector smirked, \"I have very high standards and I expect all of my partners to reciprocate them. Isn't that right, Tonisha?\" Henry craned his neck round, shuddering as he noticed the woman's soulless blank expression. \"What've you done to her?\" he enquired as he walked over to and waved his palm in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much at all. Just stripped her of her disadvantageous traits so that she's more useful to me. Now she's my loyal puppy, doing whatever I need her to do whenever I require it. I was just in the middle of using her expertise on Afro-Caribbean coiffures when you interrupted me. Like it?\" Hector held out his head and Henry stroked the soft black curls. \"Silky smooth, but that doesn't disguise the fact that by stripping her of her personality, you've effectively made her into a mindless slave whose only purpose is to do your bidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector shrugged. Henry's face got redder as he said, \"Do you not feel any guilt? No basic urge to do what's right, no moral or ethical implications?\" Santoro's sly smile suddenly disappeared as he stood just inches from Henry's nose, his amber eyes trembling with restrained rage. \"You can slander and taint me as much as you want to,\" he whispered menacingly, \"But <i>nothing</i> that you say will affect me.\" Henry gulped as Hector took a seat beside him on the heart mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was younger, I grew up as the oldest child of one of the most ruthless crime families in England,\" Santoro said as he stared at the ground, \"Though my father was one of the most infamous Capo's in the organisation, the other members were envious of him and our status as untouchables. One day I was sitting with my brothers when armed assassins stormed into our home and opened fire, leaving me and my father as the only ones left alive. He and I stormed to the base and I watched as my father shot the old Godfather in cold blood and assumed power. From then on I knew that there's no point being restricted by fleeting emotions like <i>guilt</i>- if you want to do anything in life you have to be swift and ruthless, not caring about who you use to get ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sat in stunned silence. He could've sworn he saw a small tear form in Hector's eye before the man turned and cleared his throat. \"That's just a lesson I learnt,\" he eventually squeaked. Henry reached out a pale hand tentatively, hesitating before he eventually laid on Hector's own. He smiled tenderly as Hector turned to face him. \"Sorry for saying that before,\" Henry apologised as Santoro ripped his hand away. He rubbed his eye annoyed as he spat, \"Never, and I mean <i>never</i> apologise for speaking your mind. I despise people that lie to protect others feelings.\" Santoro blew a stray lock out of his eyes before he finally said, \"So you came to my room and wasted my time just to <i>complain?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector chuckled anxiously as he shrugged. \"Yeah, pretty much,\" he answered, \"I thought that, you know... You're a man but you look... You're <i>body's</i> quite... <i>Womanly.</i> I thought you could empathise with me, even though you've had a feminine body your whole life.\" Hector giggled wryly as Tonisha passed him a beefy cigar. He lit the tip and took a deep drag from it, breathing out a perfect 'O' with the billowing smoke. His glossed lips stretched into a sly grin as he said, \"From what you're saying, I assume you're struggling with a couple strange urges...\" Santoro discarded the cigar into a dark ashtray as he sidled closer to Henry's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded apprehensively as Hector came closer, his round nose coming tantalisingly close to Henry's. \"New curious feelings, new sensations that you're both excited and reluctant to explore...\" Henry edged backwards as Hector came onto him, helpless as Santoro pressed his imposing 5'10\" body onto his smaller frame. A flurry of emotions and thoughts rushed into Henry's minds as Santoro's soft lips pushed onto his. A moment later (and with an obscure wave of Hector's hands) Henry's initial objections deserted him as a primal urge consumed him. He clutched Santoro's chin with his dainty digits and suckled on his plump lower lip. Both of them began to frantically remove their dressings as they became flustered with giddy ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby the expressionless Tonisha watched as they passionately wrestled in the blood-red sheets. She barely blinked as sensual moans erupted from the participants. Their mating sounds were distinct and travelled out through the open bathroom window, echoing slightly as they curled through the crisp night air.</span></div></div>",

He slowly reminisced on all the events that had happened in his life, the events that had left him in the situation he was in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been a gangbanger, Christopher remembered, a lowly little runt that had just started out. He was just 21 but he'd lost count of the amount of times he'd gotten into scraps and brawls (possibly due to his multiple concussions) with kids all the way back to when he was four years old. Getting into the mob wasn't necessarily hard for Christopher considering his uncle was the head honcho, the Don of the prestigious Gallo crime family. Christopher could remember himself strutting around like a peacock, gloating about all the alleged power he had by being the Boss's nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like he gave a crap about me,</i> Chris chuckled. The last time he'd seen his uncle was when his uncle had pointed the barrel of his gun to his head after a failed drug shipment, his finger placed unwavering on the trigger. Christopher could remember his fear, his voice growing hoarse as he helplessly pleaded for his uncle's mercy. He remembered looking up into his uncle's eyes and seeing nothing back, an icy, hollow stare that penetrated into Chris's soul. He had no doubt that his uncle would've killed him if the Feds hadn't arrived, watching as his uncle hopped into his blacked out Benz and skidded off, leaving him to blame for the drugs and the dead bodies that'd been left at the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher remembered himself not resisting as the armoured personnel threw him to the fooor and cuffed him, screaming at him to remain silent and promising that he would never see anything but the inside of a cell for the rest of his life. One year, six months, three weeks and four days later in the present day, Christopher chuckled to himself, an unnerving, spine-chilling laugh so disconcerting that it woke his cell mate up from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha doin' there after lights out, <i>'True-Blue'</i>,\" the man asked, referencing Chris's old nickname from his time in the Mob. Chris turned around slowly, revealing an inconspicuous necklace with a luminescent black orb that had been hidden inside of his sweaty palms. The man observed the necklace with a strange awe, marvelling at the jagged red veins that seemed to vibrate on the surface of the object, pulsing like a beating iron heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy you're awake, Ronald. That means that this part is <i>SO</i> much easier...\" Chris laughed as he brought the orb closer to his cellmate's face. Ronald Harper had never been a good man while he was alive: he was a convicted paedophile, guilty of dozens of cases of sexual assault and abuse on not only grown women but also premature girls. Christopher felt that he was carrying out justice in a way as he felt Ronald's life force being sucked out of him, travelling through the gem and into himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull thud as the husk that was Ronald's body dropped from his bunk, rolling to rest at Christopher's feet. Christopher grinned maniacally as he snapped his fingers and the corpse disintegrated into a swarm of tiny ant-like creatures and scurried through the tiny crevices in the floor and walls. Ronald's life force wasn't the strongest considering he was in his mid-70s but it still gave Christopher a rush of newfound energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It worked,</i> he thought as he marvelled at the power of the seemingly innocuous trinket in his palm. He'd been given it from an elderly looking prisoner who claimed he was a shaman, the man emphasising with Chris's plight and promising him the artifact could help him seek vengeance on the people who'd wronged him. All Christopher had had to do was first kill the man who'd assaulted the shaman's great-granddaughter. With his task completed, Christopher Gallo was a new man, a man with a single mission to hunt and destroy the lives of those that betrayed him.</span></div></div>",

The two female courtiers supporting his waxed arms down the marble walkway laughed too, albeit superficially for the deity stunk of day-old mead and goat pee. He hiccuped quietly as the woman carefully lowered him to the ground- he could still taste the succulent flavour of the mead concoction he'd guzzled down the night before. He curled up on the cold surface, chuckling to himself over an old joke swirling round in his head. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods and humiliated grandfather of the drunken deity, cupped his face in his palm as he looked at the pitiful state of his grandchild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ichor is thicker than blood,</i> Zeus reminded himself. He stood up from his seat and summoned a gust of wind that swirled round Atlantiades and righted him on his feet. Unfortunately for both of them, the breeze had blown the hem of his bedazzled toga off from his left shoulder and onto the ground, exposing his dual set of genitalia to the open. \"Eurgh, cover yourself grandson!\" Zeus cried out as he covered his eyes. Atlantiades sighed as he picked up his garment. \"It's grand<i>DAUGHTER</i> today, Zeusie,\" she corrected, \"And I don't understand why all you immortals are so hellbent against nudity. For Gaia's sake, all of us were born without clothes! What a shame, I've been studying these so-called <i>'nudist colonies'</i> down on Earth and let me tell you, they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Atlantiades, let's not delve into the semantics of why we cannot and will not implement those in Olympian society. We've got more important things to discuss. Like how this is the third time we've had to have a discussion about your excessive drinking and shameful public demeanour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame me for your son's misdemeanours! It's not my fault that Dionysus served his guests tainted beverages at his brunch! It tasted delicious but as soon as I indulged, my mind blacked out and I woke up in an Athenian farmer's barn with two beautiful maidens on my hip! Not a bad way to wake up, I must say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NO!\"</b> Zeus' voice boomed brusquely. Thunder cracked in the air and Atlantiades sly grin disappeared. \"This was the last straw! I gave you one last chance as a courtesy to your parents, Aphrodite and Hermes, but you've done more than tested my limits- you've crossed the line! In your drunken stupor you've singlehandedly caused a ruckus of vehemence that's never been seen before; crops turned into genitals, citizens waking up with random transformations and a myriad of people suddenly breaking into inexplicable passionate displays of affection in the streets!\" Atlantiades stared blankly. \"Chaos! How do you not see the extent of the damage you've caused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged lackadaisically, twisting a long lock of dark hair round a dainty finger. \"I'm more impressed than shameful, to be completely honest. To do all of that whilst inebriated..\" She whistled proudly. A dark cloud appeared in the sky as a red vein bulged from Zeus' temple. If not for the outcry that would come as a result of obliterating a fellow immortal, Zeus would have summoned a lightning bolt to vaporise Atlantiades there and then. Instead he composed himself and dispersed the stormclouds. \"It's clear to see that you show no remorse for your actions,\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I feel remorse that I wasn't conscious when I did all of that! That would've been an interesting tale to share at Hestia's Hearth at the Summer Solstice Bonfire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus groaned. \"...As I was saying, it's clear that your previous sanctions have had no effect on your actions. I'm truly disheartened to say this but this behaviour is very unbecoming of an Immortal of your calibre. Trust me, Dionysus and i are going to have <i>VERY</i> stern words after this conversation,\"thunder exploded in the sky, \"...but your actions were reprehensible and must be consequently punished. So, as a result, I officially strip you of your title as God of Androgyny, Unions, Lust, Desire and the rest for the foreseeable future until you've proved you're worthy of regaining it. You will retain a portion of your natural abilities, however, your immortality, godly foresight and general power have been reclaimed by Aphrodite in order to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus' voice trailed off as a speechless Atlantiades processed the information. She finally spoke, shouting, \"NO! No-no-no, you <i>can't</i> do this! No, I'm not going to let you!\" She raised her hands menacingly. Zeus had planned for this exact situation and restrained her mid-air with unbreakable nitrogen bonds. He strode towards her and cupped her chiselled jawline in his hand. <i>\"I am truly sorry,\"</i> he whispered as his wrinkled thumb rested on her forehead. Atlantiades chin shot upwards as a golden beam shot from her eye sockets. Atlantiades felt the power drain from her, being ripped out of her by an omnipotent intangible force. Soon the excess power had been completely tapped off and now her body was following the path of the gold beam, her form destabilising and disintegrating until all that was left was the discarded toga. Zeus picked it up guiltily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Godspeed my kin,</i> Zeus thought as he stared into the sky above.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candace giggled giddily as her husband Joel guided her blindfolded body through the sparsely populated car park outside the shopping complex. She squealed as one of her open-toed stilettos caught on a divot in the floor, nearly falling on her plump posterior had not Joel swiftly caught her. \"Eek, Joel, you're gonna get me killed!\" she laughed as she instinctively straightened her expensive houndstooth button-detail dress. Her golden hoops swung from her earlobes as she gingerly stepped forwards. Her moisturised chocolate skin gleamed radiantly in the sunlight. Candace yelped as she felt a stray hand come round and grope her voluptuous hips. \"Joel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashleystewart.com/dw/image/v2/AANZ_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-ashleystewart-master/default/dwb0f8c2f8/010-AS14610X_0010_front.jpg?sw=800\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ashleystewart.com/dw/image/v...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not sorry,\" Joel chuckled as he stopped himself and Candace in turn beside a stainless . \"Stay put for a second,\" he said as he rushed back into the mall. Candace laughed as she heard the quick tapping of his exuberant footsteps. Though they\u2019d been married for a good six years at this point, Joel\u2019d always believed he had to prove his worthiness to her, her extended family, himself and to the rest of the world at large- much to her ironic chagrin- but considering that while she was a 27-year-old black woman and he was a reasonably older 45-year-old white man, she could understand why there was a lot of abrasiveness surrounding their relationship in the early stages. But nothing stands the test of time. Soon her parents had shed the oppressive chains of their ethnic background and given their blessing. A few years later and they\u2019d welcomed their first child, Lillie, into the world and had settled down. Candace had recently landed an admin assistant position at a burgeoning pharmaceutical company and Joel had established a cult following as an internet personal trainer. Life was good and today they were celebrating their anniversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace lifted the blindfold from her eye with a painted white nail. She shared a smile with a passing septuagenarian, breathing in the fresh air (with a hint of petrol smoke) and gazing up into the sky at the beaming sun. Or so she thought until the radiance blossomed in size, it\u2019s outline less infundibuliform and increasingly humanoid.<br>\r\nToo late to react she stood ramrod straight, helpless to prevent the light from invading her orifices, flooding her body with an otherworldly presence and suppressing her consciousness until it was nearly unreachable in the backstreets of her own mind. Her tender brown eyes, filled with warmth and subtle kindness, glazed over; her irises becoming callous golden circles. Her disposition changed: whereas she\u2019d been standing expectantly in wait of Joel before, her stance became more confident with her hand resting on her hip as she struck a seductive pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace (or should I say Atlantiades?) shuddered for a second. Feeling his essence being ripped from his own body had been a harsher experience than Atlantiades had expected and being out of his element had jarred him severely. He calmly removed the blindfold, feeling the black curls cascade into his face as he did so. He twirled one around his finger. <i>Fascinating,</i> he thought as he caressed his dainty digits across his newfound host body. He started from his head and worked his way down, feeling his plump rose-gold lips, his bountiful casabas and wide hips before going lower and stroking his meaty thighs. Feeling a tad curious he squeezed said thighs together and yelped as he squashed the mighty cock-and-balls sandwiched between. A quick look and he noticed that, contrary to the rest of his beautiful dark body, his equipment was more in line with his previous complexion and tanned a light caramel colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Certainly not the worst form I've assumed after one of my punishments,</i> Atlantiades chuckled to himself as he tossed the blindfold aside. He stepped forward and, not knowing the mechanics of high-heel strutting, promptly stumbled over his own feet. His new form would've been compromised mere moments into his inhabitance had not a muscular man caught him midway. \"Hey,\" the dark-haired guy said as he helped Atlantiades up, \"Are you OK, madam?\" Candace Parker would normally have swooned had an attractive patron rescued her from an embarrassing fail like that but Atlantiades was familiar with others engineering situations to save (and romance him, much to his behest). Atlantiades dusted himself off and brusquely cast the heels asunder, opting to go barefoot for his own safety. The man tried to speak again but was cut off by a pretty brunette storming up to his side. She quickly looped her arm in his whilst giving Atlantiades the once-over. \"Aw, is my <i>boyfriend</i> Darren being a hero again?\" she said, \"Gosh, I'm literally <i>SO</i> lucky to have him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, calm down, she just fell,\" he said, incurring a sharp glare from her. Atlantiades meanwhile was tiring of this interaction and was already predisposed to despise this parasitic woman because of all the lovers that'd tried to maim him out of their jealousy. He decided this was a perfect test to see if he'd actually retained some of his godly powers like Zeus had said. Their spat of bickering stopped as Atlantiades clicked his fingers- a spark of gold ignited. Instantaneously Darren felt his body shrinking, his girl and himself sharing a glance as they exchanged heights. He felt his body collapse in on itself, his muscle mass depleting as his form became more supple and feminine. His face shifted, his bone structure morphing until his likeness had become the spitting image of Emily and vice-versa. <i>Now for the fun,</i> Atlantiades thought as Emily (in Darren's body) shrieked. She began melting into the floor, Darren's body becoming nothing more than pale pulp. Soon her body had completely gone, leaving Darren's clothes in a messy heap on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now <i>kai t\u00f3ra telik\u00e1</i>,\" Atlantiades chuckled in Candace's London accent as he motioned with his hands to lift up. At the same time the pulp that had formed rose as well. The former deity gestured towards Darren's shaking body. The pulp gladly obliged and engulfed the man-woman. A few moments later and the pulp absorbed itself into the body, giving the amalgamated body creamy skin, accentuated features and a frame worthy of bedding an immortal. The hybrid shook slightly. It's clothes had been shed during the merge and the shared consciousness it now possessed was conflicted with the contrasting identities and memories rushing into its head. Like Atlantiades, this hybrid also possessed genderbent genitals albeit ones with the right skin tone. Atlantiades stepped towards the woman, tilting its head to meet his hypnotic, golden eyes. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"Can you work one of those contraptions?\" He pointed to the black Range Rover that'd belonged to Candace and Joel. The hybrid may have been confused as to a lot of things but nodded her head meekly. Atlantiades smiled, leading it to the car and hopping in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later and they'd sped off. Unfortunately for Joel, that was a moment too soon as he ran back out with a bouqet of flowers in his grip. Two light thumps sounded as Joel dropped to his knees. The bouquet rolled out of his splayed hands. His wife, his car... gone. He stared bleakly forwards as the cars around him passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm the author of this interactive, <b>pee234</b> (I know, stupid name). This is basically a follow-up to a story about someone using (mostly abusing) their power to steal traits from other people. All the events that happen here are <b>three years after(3 years after)</b> the events of my original story <i>'Trait Theft'</i>. You can find the link here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2170031-Trait-Theft/map/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2170031-Trait-Theft/map/1</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can be very loose and I'm only adding two rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022Don\u2019t get TOO graphic<br>\r\n\u2022Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's out of the way, let's get onto some characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel 'Danny' Bronson: He will be the main protagonist in the story. He's Caucasian with bright green eyes and short, messy black hair. He's 18 years old and stands at 5\"10. He's quite clever but he gets bored easily and likes to act out a lot. He's got two best friends, Garry and Sherrill, who he hangs out with in and outside of his sixth form college and has just started a relationship with his long-time crush, Dawn Clark. His favourite sibling is his older sister Megan who is also known to have a rebellious streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan 'Megs' Bronson: Our second main protagonist is 25 years old. She has dull green eyes and has regressed slightly from her punk phase, sporting long beach wave bangs, died from its original brown colour along with a couple of piercings. She stands at a small-ish 5\"5 with small B cup boobs and a small butt. She used to go to college but dropped out to join a punk rock band called the Punkopaths as their lead singer and guitarist with her mates Lindsay and Kelly. Although she has had many boyfriends, Megan doesn't mind 'experimenting' every once in a while. Her current fling is an innocent looking redhead called Hannah who is very kind and timid, the direct opposite of Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle 'Gabby' Bronson-Carter: Danny and Megan's 40 year old mother and the third main protagonist. She is very calm and reserved, except for when she's either scolding Danny and Megan or arguing with her ex Barry. She works as a secretary for a secret government agency devoted to creating ways to change the human anatomy- through 'exotic' means. Has best friend, Diann Dickson, who also works at TG. She stands at a petite 5\"4 but has large D cup breasts that have started to sag and a large butt. She has pale blue eyes and brunette hair that is normally kept in a bun or a ponytail and she doesn't wear a lot of makeup. She also (not so) secretly has a favourite child in Kourtney. Although she invited her younger sibling, Susan, to live with her family, she is starting to regret it as Susan is not just a bad influence but Gabby feels that her kids would rather spend time with their cool aunt than their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin Carter: Husband to Gabrielle Bronson-Carter, father of Kurt and Kourtney Carter and stepfather of Daniel and Megan Bronson. A decorated US Army soldier, Kevin was shipped out to see a secret British company that were working on developing better soldiers (Transformation Group). There he met Gabrielle where they had 2 illegitimate children before eventually marrying. He is 6\"5 and built like a tank with giant rippling muscles. Kevin has a short, blonde army crewcut and pale blue eyes. Works part time for Transforming Genetics as security. His biological children adore him but Danny and Megan are very withdrawn and hostile towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt Carter: Standing at 6'2\" and with an intimidating physique at 22 years of age, Kurt is basically a younger version of his father, albeit his dusty brown hair. Although he is a swot and a know-it-all, Kurt can be very funny and approachable. He is fiercely loyal to his family and won't let people disrespect them, making him Danny's second favourite sibling. Kurt excels in sports and has received an all expense paid scholarship from a prestigious college to play basketball. He idolises his father and always seeks to impress him. His hopes of either becoming a pro athlete or lawyer are still looking quite. He\u2019s currently living most of his time at his college dorm but can still be seen at the Bronson-Carter house from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney Carter: Kurt's sister. Kourtney is 17 and stands at 5'11\" (she's stopped growing), with large C cup boobs and a large round ass (which she teases her 'big' sister Megan about). She has long, luscious blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, making her one of the most popular and sought after girls in her high school. She is intelligent like her brother, Kurt, making her adored by teachers and students alike. Her only downfall is that she knows this and this makes her aggravatingly arrogant and cocky. She struts around school but finds sometimes that she misses her lackeys Kay and Kellie who've gone to a separate sixth form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Bronson: Gabby's 24 year old sister. Susan is new to the cast, only recently moving into Kurt's vacated room a couple months prior because of a <i>'minor dispute with her landlord over a couple of unpaid bills'</i>. She's very artistic (or so she believes), a self-proclaimed 'quadruple threat' doing acting/singing/dancing/drawing. She resembles Gabby's attractiveness but younger and w/out stretch marks: 5'6\" with lush blonde hair, pale blue eyes, large D cups and a firm backside like her older sister. Gets on well with everyone, especially Kourtney who she talks to about fashion, boys and the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn Clark: Danny's new girlfriend. She is in the year above Danny and is built like a model, slender with large boobs and wide hips. She's black and is from Australia, giving her a cute accent that charms all the boys. She is 5\"9 with a pretty face, beautiful amber eyes and curly black hair. Although they'd lived next to each other for over a decade, Danny had never picked up the nerve to talk to her, resolving to just admire her from a distance before she finally asked him out. She and Danny go well together, both enjoying video games and the occasional prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImra Lynch: 16 year old new student at Kourtney's school. She's very similar to Kourtney in many ways: she's attractive, intelligent and very conceited. She's got luscious, shoulder length brown hair, plump D-cups and svelte curves on her 5'6\" hourglass figure. Imra could either be a friend, a rival, or even something more... ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry Henderson: Danny and Megan's biological father. He is 6\"1 and slightly overweight. He always wears sunglasses over his green eyes and a biker's bandanna over his black mop of hair and wears a leather jacket, jeans and boots to go with his biker look. He also rides around on his authentic Harley Davidson motorbike. He is the unofficial manager for Megan's band the Punkopaths and is also in his own rock band the Ruff' Riders. He can do no wrong in the eyes of Megan and Danny, which annoys their mother to no end. He is on bad relations with Gabrielle and whatever conversation they have always spirals into a heated argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Thompson and Garry Bennett: Danny's former (Rick) and current (Garry) best mates. All were inseparable as they have been mates since they were born. Rick is white, short and quite tubby but is braver- or stupider- than anyone Danny knew, refusing to back down to anyone about anything. Once they graduated from high school Rick began hanging with seedier crowds and distanced himself from his oldest companions. Garry is the opposite aesthetically; he is black, tall and lanky and does well in pretty much everything. He can be quite loquacious and won't stop talking until you force him to. His only weakness is girls- he freezes up every time one tries to speak to him. He also gets mercilessly taunted about his MILF mum's involvement in an adult movie Danny had found. Carol (or Cassie as she was called in the film) has giant, surgically enhanced breasts and buttocks which she always flaunts in tight, curve hugging dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise Turner: Danny's best friend (apart from Garry). Studying psychology. Louise has difficulties connecting and emphasising with those outside her social circle due to her egotistical personality, coming off as arrogant and selfish sometimes. She's not really that attractive: she's 5'4\" with mousy brown hair, small A cups and dorky spectacles. Although she may struggle to realise when she's said something too overboard, she is generally tame and easygoing when amongst friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny Thompson: single mother of Rick Thompson. Has 8 kids: Richard, 26, Layla, 24, Brittney, 20, Rick, 18, Freddie, 13, Imogen, 11, and Rose, 5, and Daniel, 3. Works at Transformation Group with Gabby and Diann as a cytologist (study of cells). Can be a very funny and sociable person but is subject to random moments of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah Beck: Hannah is a 20 year old student at Danny's college and also Megan's current fling. She's very cute and innocent looking: 5'3\", decent B-cups with an average figure, dorky glasses and crimson-red hair. Hannah is very kind, compassionate and timid (skills useful for her ideal job of being a vet), a direct contrast of Megan's brash, self-centred and outgoing attitude. While Megan may just see their relationship as a quick fling, Hannah believes in a long-term partnership and does everything to make Megan happy (e.g. going to Punkopath gigs, setting up equipment, scissoring, etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay Garrett and Kelly Wong: Megan's best friends and band mates, they make the other 2/3 of Punkopaths. They are both the same age as Megan. Lindsay's parents are wealthy real estate agents and she lives in a large apartment that her parents paid for her and that all the girls share. Her parents don't really care what Lindsay does, as long as she enjoys herself. Kelly on the other hand, is seen as a disappointment to her parents. They were intelligent computer programmers who came from a strict Chinese background and both expected her to follow in their footsteps. Kelly wears heavy black makeup and has large, unkempt black hair. She's 5\"7 with C cup boobs and wears a black bobble hat, jumper with a skull on it and hooped black leggings leading to large brown army boots. She plays bass guitar. Lindsay is very bubbly and kind, joining the band just for a good time. She's tall at 5\"11 and has braided blonde hair. She has hypnotic hazel eyes that are hard not to lose yourself inside. She's very self conscious, wearing baggy jeans and jackets to try and cover up her DD cup boobs and big bum. She's the drummer or the band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay and Kellie Dickson: twins that used to hang out with Kourtney wherever she went until they went to separate sixth forms. They are completely identical: both are 17, both are black, both are 5\"6, both have shoulder length hair that's frizzy and brushed over one side of their face and both have the same voice. It's nearly impossible to tell them apart as they even behave identically. Although they are not as pretty as Kourtney, both attract their fair share of boys, specifically Garry who's awkwardness around girls stopped him from asking one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiann Dickson: Kay and Kellie's mother. She's about 5'7\" and has large E cup boobs. A former cheerleader in high school, she is always trying to keep in peak physical condition with toned muscles and abs. Gabrielle Bronson-Carter's best friend and colleague at Transformation Group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie Dickson: Kay and Kellie's father. Former convict. Is 6'2\" and muscular. Shaved head and has loads of tattoos. Spends time smoking something or gambling away money. Not liked by neither Kay nor Kellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Transforming Genetics Characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald Lockheed: founder and head scientist of secret company Transformation Group. He's bald with a grey, wispy beard. He is 6'1\" and 70 years of age, requires a cane to get around his workplace. He is of the mad variety of scientists and he has devoted his life to developing a way to get young again (possibly by stealing over's youth, perhaps?). Dislikes Ms McGee as he wants to carry on his research in secret instead of turning TG to a cosmetic company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus Kronenburg: 26 year old geneticist at Transformation Group. 5'8\"- wears large round spectacles. Has neatly combed blonde hair and prefers to wear a tie and shirt opposed to casual clothes. A genius but is very shy, especially around Diann, who many male workers have a crush on. His only real friend is new colleague, Nabila, who he harbours some feelings for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent Lockheed: 28 years old, 6'3\", very handsome with rugged blonde hair. No genius by any standards but he can be clever at times. Very vain and pompous, only has a job because his dad owns department. Sexist and rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicardo Perez: 61 year old Mexican man working as a janitor at Transformation Group. Short at 5'5\" and is always seen with baggy blue overalls, low rimmed blue cap and a large, bushy greying moustache. He is very lazy and can normally be seen either reading a newspaper, sleeping or just walking around aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon McGee: the owner and financier of Transformation Group. Although she is 45 years of age, she likes to pretend she's younger by wearing skimpy and outgoing clothes with lots of makeup. Has had lots of cosmetic surgery, enlarging her breasts to a H cup and making her butt very large. Black haired with blue eyes. She wants Dr Lockheed to provide a way for her to become young again and also wants to make TG into a public cosmetic company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley Ripling: Front desk operator. Is only about 22. About 5'3\" with B cup boobs. Wears her brunette hair into a long ponytail and wears stylish circle-rimmed glasses. Can come across very uncaring and rude but it's because she has a very laid back and nonchalant personality. Normally when she's bored she'll whip out her phone and hop onto a dating app, surfing through the different boys (and occasionally girls) to get over her boyfriend Finn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Jenny Duckhold: inseparable brother-sister duo. Both have red hair, green eyes and casual specs. Jake is an engineer while Jenny is an analytical chemist, allowing them to work in sync and in perfect harmony together. Jake is handsome in a geeky way and stands at 5'11\" while Jenny is quite cute standing at 5'6\" with pert C cup breasts. Both are 25 years old and are very intelligent, both graduating at 15 years old. Megan Bronson has a secret infatuation with Jake while Jenny has a not-so-secret crush on Kurt Carter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Gray: R&amp;D supervisor. Stands at 5'8\" normally but is elevated to 6'1\" with her signature black stilettos. Has raven black hair done in a pristine bun and dark chocolate coloured eyes. She has a long pointed nose and always wears a permanent scowl with a high pitched nasally voice. Dressed always for business. Doesn't understand the actual science but believes that when they look like they're working it normally means productivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Richie Kendrick: 48 year old palaeontologist (specialises in fossils). 5\u201911\u201d African American man. Although he is not at the young age that most of his colleagues are, he's very sociable and gets on with everyone. Has small square spectacles and has a shiny, bald head. Outside of work he has a family of 5 with his wife Yolanda and kids Craig, Harry and Brenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim Lao: 30 year old bio-engineer. He comes from China and, while he speaks near perfect English, has a reasonably distinct Chinese accent. Measures at 6'0\" and has a bowl cut with large specs. Very smart but can be very naive as he doesn't know the local customs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalinda 'Rosa' Marchesi: 37 year old physicist that originally came from the Italian branch of Transforming Genetics. A MILF that keeps in peak physical condition despite having 2 kids with her boyfriend Fernando. Is 5'7\" with plump C-cup boobs and a toned ass but she tries to hide her assets in plain clothes and baggy lab-coat. Can be controlling at times but she always realises when she's piling it on too much and stops, making her very popular with her coworkers. Has long brunette hair with blonde highlights and has stylish Armani glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Cartwright: 27 years of age and has bright ginger hair and piercing green eyes. She's even shorter than Gabrielle standing at 5'2\". Is a bit of a tomboy, wears no makeup (except for special occasions) and chooses to wear baggy hoodies and jeans with beaten up trainers. Wouldn't admit it but she has a not so secret crush on Trent Lockheed, making her one of the few people that can actually stand him. Works at TG for PR and is very social and approachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAamil Abdi: 29 year old engineer at Transforming Genetics, formerly from Somalia. He has milk chocolate coloured skin with dark waves in his hair. Standing at about 5\u20199\u201d, Aamil can be very intimidating despite his limp physique. He can be very hot headed and confrontational, sharing a mutual dislike with Trent Lockheed. Lives with his 65 year old parents and younger sister, Azhar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabila Hussain: 26 year old geneticist at TG. She\u2019s 5\u20195\u201d and slightly more voluptuous than her coworkers. She\u2019s a Pakistani Muslim and wears a hijab everywhere she goes. Nabila has a very persistent personality, determined to make a name for herself at her new workplace. She has a good relationship with Magnus Kronenburg as they had studied together previously. She has some feelings for him but is waiting for him to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily (Emmy) Thompson: bubbly physicist at TG. 26 year old Caucasian and 5\u20194 with C cup boobs. Very hyperactive and erratic, Emmy is a bright young woman that many times talks more than she really should. She speaks with a light but distinct American accent as her father\u2019s from LA but her mother is from London. Has blue eyes and dirty blonde hair that\u2019s either tied into a messy ponytail or left hanging loose. She\u2019s trusting and very social and tries to be friends with everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson Wright: 20 year old apprentice janitor at TG. He's extremely handsome: 6\" with matted blonde hair, clear blue eyes with a chiselled frame and jaw- assets that would make any woman start drooling. However, Carson is more inclined to the male species, currently in a strained relationship with his partner, Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJes Roberts: 21 year old account manager (she works on the relations with clients) working at Transforming Genetics. She's originally from France so she has a hint of a French accent whenever she's speaking. She's lesbian and also an extreme feminist, believing that woman are not just equal but superior to men. Still she holds Dr. Lockheed with high regard and obeys his instructions unerringly. Jes is 5'7\" with dyed black hair, peachy skin with a C-cup rack and a decent figure.<br>\r\n--- --- ---- --- - -- ----- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workers I've added to TG are not the only characters there but the main and most relevant ones.
