You were great;  almost makes me regret drugging you.\" Finn says casually.<br>\r\n\"What...?\" you are bewildered.<br>\r\n\"They should be kicking in about now.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" Just then, you began to feel odd. Not sick- but very dizzy. You pass out within five seconds; the last sound you here is Finn speaking.<br>\r\n\"Oh, there we go!\" When you wake up you still feel odd, but not dizzy anymore. You feel that something isn't right. It is only when you see a sneaker that you realize what has happened. The sneaker is huge: easily bigger than yourself. The sneaker moves and you figure out that it belongs to Finn. A giant teenager stood over you and laughed. He'd shrunken you. Instinctively, you try to escape. You run as far as you can towards the door and for a short time you begin to believe that you might escape but that feeling quickly passed. Finn laughed as he took one step towards you. That was all it took as suddenly the teen reaches down and scoops you in his hand. You are lifted sky high and when you arrive at the giant's face you almost throw up. \"You're not getting away from me, runt.\" The giant states as he stares down at you- clutched in his hand. <br>\r\n\"My name is Sam!\" you yell out. <br>\r\n\"No it's not, runt. You're no longer a person: you're a tiny, insignificant bug and should be treated as such. Speaking of which...\"</span></div></div>",

You beg and plead but it's no use: you're all his now. \"Cya, dude\" and with no explanation or apology, you are sucked like spaghetti into the awaiting trap. Whilst you are being swirled around the mouth, coated in the teen's saliva, you struggle with all your might to escape but resistance is futile. You are forced down the throat and into the stomach of the titan. Through his abs and the wall of his stomach you can hear Finn speaking to you again. \"Mmm mmm mmm you were tasty little dude. Wish I could eat you again but oh well. Just think: you'll become part of me! You might become part of my abs, or even my butt! Rachel would love that. She's always spanking and groping it. It's a little weird but, hey, the ladies can't get enough! That would be a real honor, runt. Well, cya on the other side I guess!\" You shudder, sit back and wait for your demise. </span></div></div>",

He had marked about half the pile of Spanish homework when he began to feel a bit dizzy. \"It's been a long day, I think I should go home and mark the rest tommorow...\" Will said to himself. Packing his bag, he noticed the ceiling was getting further away and the floor closer. \"Right, this is a sign I've really overworked myself! I'm so tired the world seems to be getting bigger...\" Will said, walking out of the room. But by the time he was halfway out the room, he had shrunk to half an inch tall! \"Oh god, I wasn't tired and imagining things - I've actually shrunk! How did this happen?\" he gasped. Realising he'd be squashed if he stayed on the floor, he decided to climb up to a higher surface. But before he could do so, huge stomps made the floor quake. \"It must be one of the glee club!\" he gulped. Two huge feet came into view and Will looked up to see...</span></div></div>",
