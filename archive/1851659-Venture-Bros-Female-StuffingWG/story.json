The traitorous Twenty-One thinks to turn on the Monarch, does he?  Well, we'll just see how he likes it when he discovers all his gay little Star Wars dolls have been--\" <i>Rrrrrip</i> \"--<i>removed from their original boxes!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monarch tossed the figure into a small mountain of plastic forming on his right, and discarded of the rest in another small mountain of blister packs to his left.   \"So, Elan Sleazebaggano, now you know the bitter taste of the <i>Monarch's sting!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is pathetic.  You're arching toys now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And having a great time doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Twenty-One was just mad.  He'll be back when he's calmed down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I want him to see this!   I want him to see his empire in ruins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila sighed and sat down on the bed, picking up one of the dozens of shoeboxes that had been in Twenty-One's closet.  The man really loved his toys.   Star Wars, Transformers, Battle Beasts, Ninja Turtles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  The Monarch looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Let me see.  What's he got in there, the desiccated remains of a Cabbage Patch Kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, it's just... photos.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Photos of <i>you! </i> Oh, gross.  I bet they're all sticky.   Well, sure was a <i>goooood</i> idea to have him do all our digital archiving, wasn't it, honey?\"  the Monarch asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he was the only henchman who knew how to use a scanner.\"   Sheila pulled out a handful of photographs.  \"Wow, these go back forever.  Here's one of me as Lady Au Pair ... here's one where I was Queen Etheria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what's this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me as a 'sexy Queen Elizabeth' at a Halloween party in college.  Most of these aren't very -- whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone photo slipped out of her yellow-gloved hand and fluttered to the bed.  The Monarch picked it up.   It showed his wife dressed in a very skimpy couple of grape vine garlands that didn't leave much to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, that's from when I Number Two'd for Die-Onysus,\" Sheila explained.   \"I hated that costume, I couldn't even sit down without squashing a bunch of grapes all over everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly flattering, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh,\" Sheila mumbled, embarrassed.  \"Uh, that's not the costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh -- I kind of put on a little weight while I was with Die-Onysus.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>little?</i>\"  The Monarch turned the photo this way and that.  \"That's more than a <i>little</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't help it!\" Sheila said defensively.   \"It was all feasts and revels and wild parties.  I was drunk off my ass half the time!  And every time he arched, I don't even remember anymore, Professor somebody-or-other, the whole time he was talking I had to be eating these giant turkey legs in the background.  For an atmosphere of decadence, he said.  I put on about forty pounds in a couple of months and by the end of it I was having blackouts from all the drinking.  I was lucky to get out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know!  Like, half that guy's henchmen are on the Guild's looking-for-donor-liver list, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's depressing.  Anyway, my next gig was with Truckules, thank god; the costume wasn't exactly form-fitting.  And I lost all the weight carting the stupid thing around.\"  She looked over at her husband.   \"So now you know my chubby little secret.  If this turns into an excuse for fat jokes at my expense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" said the Monarch.  \"At least, not until I think of one.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After finishing her story Mrs. The Monarch turned and pushed aside a vintage captain sunshine lunchbox and picked up a pack of Pokemon cards. \u201cGawd, Why does he waste so much money on these things\u201d She mutted as she flipped through them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Monarch was glad his comely wife was so pre-occupied looking back to the photo Monarch bit the tip of his thumb as she gleefully schemed. It wasn\u2019t the bloated vision of his wife\u2019s younger self he was so keen on; it was Die-Onysus himself in the background. To be more specific Malcolm was looking at what he wanted from Die-Onysus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[[ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/330/drgfphoto.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/330/drg...</a> ]]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Onysus had scored a new number 2 to replace the bloated booze hound his previous right hand man had become; and boy had he scored. Returning to his habit of picking out pretty young girls to follow him around in tempting costumes Onysus had found an unbelievably curvaceous woman to gallivant around with. Her dark hair and deep brown eyes suggested she was a true greek goddess, so to speak anyway. The girl just radiated sexual energy and every pound gained as she lounged about eating greek cuisine slathered in olive oil and drinking wine bottles dry had only gone into filling out her buxom body even more. Her shapely body was borderline impossible to believe. She was already past the point any photos of her were often written off as \u201cphotoshopped\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm knew all this because he had been scouting Die-Onysus and his new beauty for a few weeks now. Not so strange considering the nature of Monarch and his wife\u2019s relationship as swingers. However as the Mediterranean beauty continued to swell so perfectly Monarch had resigned himself to the reality he\u2019d never get Sheila to go for it. Even if they had an open relationship she would make a jealous stink the moment she saw who he was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now things had changed, Sheila was the one with the connection to Onysus. Monarch could easily invite him over in a more friendly capacity without raising suspicion. Monarch batted an eye at his wife\u2019s still shapely caboose as she bend down to dig into another pile of toys in twenty-one\u2019s room. \u201cTsk- look at this!\u201d she flared pulling a nerf dart gun from the mess. \u201cThis looks just like the pneumatic dart turrent he pitched to us last month! Jis-wha-\u2026 He based that design on a toy?!\u201d She stammered baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonarch\u2019s plan was already started to take shape. He would invite Onysus over for old times sake and bait the hook by tempting him with a second shot at his wife, he could even give him hints on how to strike her fancy. Then it would be Mrs. Monarch suggesting the swap not himself. Monarch would get a free pass at that sultry number two Die-Onysus had found. This was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was one little matter Monarch didn\u2019t know about...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, he was managing to keep himself balanced, although you couldn't say the same thing for the various liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of want to see him fall right on his ass, don't you?\" the Monarch muttered to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice.

And they did not have those things when I worked for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, they didn't have Wikipedia when you worked for him either.  I saw the old picture.  He looked like he based his costume off the guy from Fantasia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the new one really is an improvement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... you're right!\" the Monarch said, suddenly remembering what he was trying to do.  \"It's very ... flattering.  It makes him look... super sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the Monarch found his eyes caught by the <i>real</i> reason for his invitation.

What a pleasure to welcome you to the Cocoon.\"  The Monarch extended his hand.  \"That is just a name, right?

Well, he <i>did</i>, he just ignored it to focus on blowing up school facilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha'\" slurred Mistress M, \"shounds like my kinda guy.  An' you musht be the <i>old</i> Mistress Maim-Nad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'former' Mistress Maim-Nad, yes,\" Sheila said, frowning slightly.  The Monarch hastily put his arms around her shoulders.  \"Ahahahah, honey, why don't you help get Die-Onysus settled?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'll go see if we have a guest room somewhere that will fit a <i>giant table</i>.  If we can even get it through the lower halls -- it's a pretty tight turning radius--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, dear, go catch up.\"   The Monarch shooed her away.  \"So, now that it's just us, give it to me straight.  What's this guy's deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Mistress M blinked blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thump in the background.  \"Ow!  Fucking soup all over the fucking gangplank...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die-Onysus, of course!  How does some shlub in a toga bag...\" <i>turn on that old Monarch charm</i> \"... two of the hottest women on the planet for his number 2s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he <i>ish</i> a <i>god</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, like Zeus was?

He's not even Greek.  He sounds like he's British or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I dunno about that, but he's got powersh, allright.  Wash.\"   Mistress M threw her head back and drained the bottle in a few hearty chugs, then held it out in front of her unsteadily.  In seconds, a thin film of dark liquid appeared at the bottom.  Soon, it deepened.  The bottle was refilling itself with wine before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shee?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In her path a young, lanky henchman dressed in a butterfly costume stood staring off into space. \u201cYou!\u201d Mrs. Monarch called out and lifting an arm to point at him. \u201cYou look like you just got an eye full of his buxom scantily dressed henchwomen,\u201d Sheila chided him. \u201cDid they just pass through here on their way to the auditorium?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor young man yelped in surprise at the sight of his boss\u2019s shapely wife advancing toward him. \u201cY-yes ma'am!\u201d his voice squeaked, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they were headed towards the auditorium, ma'am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sheila stopped and put her hands on her lovely hips. \u201cWhere were they headed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Henchman gulped hard, trying not to stare at her cleavage too much. \u201cTh-they didn\u2019t turn left towards the maintenance elevators\u2026\u201d He momentarily glanced down the length of Mrs. Monarch\u2019s graceful figure and broke out in a cold sweat. \u201cI think I her-heard the guy in the toga saying something about finding a grand place to set up his re-reception chamber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila made a disapproving clicking noise with her tongue and looked down the corridor. \u201cI suppose they continued up towards the east stairwell then?\u201d She looked back towards the pale henchman who was having trouble forming the words to respond, his eyes were now glued to her chest. \u201cTsk, nevermind!\u201d  She groaned and glanced down at the carpet. \u201cI\u2019ll just follow these soup stains in our fucking carpets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Monarch was admiring more than just the bottomless decanters surrounding Mistress Maim-Nad. Picking up on his wandering gaze, the comely beauty picked up a cluster of grapes from her costume and tilted her head back. Opening her plump lips wide, she lowered the entire vine of grapes into her mouth. Monarch\u2019s mouth slacked open slightly as Mistress M looked back to him with a playful look in her eyes, lips pursed around the stem sticking out of her mouth. Gently she pulled the stick back out, showing all the grapes to be picked clean off. She opened her mouth enough to reveal every grape still whole, each one picked from the vine without popping and balanced inside her mouth, her cheeks packed like a squirrel\u2019s. With a single gulp Maim-Nad swallowed them all, the hint of the grape mass shown through her neck sliding down her throat. She finished with a cute little satisfied puff of air.  \u201cYum,\u201d she sweetly cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeh-ha heh heh,\u201d Monarch laughed nervously and tugged on the edge of his cowl to let some of warm air out. \u201cThat\u2019s really an impressive eh heh heh- trick\u201d Monarch tried to regain his composure, if he wanted to make this work he was going to have to establish his presence and wow her. What did she mean by god anyway? passed through his head as he repositioned himself and stood up straighter. Maim-Nad watched him with a curious gaze over her wine bottle while she took another long swig. \u201cThe wine thing too, that was really something, Die-Onysus has like, for real god powers?\" Monarch tried to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her drink Mistress M nodded and wiped a small spill off her chin she clumsily spilt. \u201cMmm-hmm, He\u2019sh had thish power since before I worked for him. Your\u2026 wife? She was never mentionin\u2019 dis?\u201d She reached for a large cake covered in rich frosting and soaked in rum. She tore off a hunk the size of a cantaloupe and started stuffing the entire piece into her mouth, juices dribbled down her chin and onto her cleavage. \u201cHe shaid he was ready to begin his new plan to take ovah da world.\u201d She paused again to wash down her indulgence with more wine. The cake was already re-growing the missing chunk. \u201cHe shays he had everythin\u2019 he needed now and all he was missin\u2019 was a goddessh to rule beshide him.\u201d Misstress M let out a satisfied burp but didn\u2019t bother to cover her mouth or excuse herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe world domination racket eh?\u201d Monarch mused \u201cYou know most guys that get into that game are just covering for insecurities, the real men are the ones with the passion and focus to truly hate someone and dedicate their lives to the pursuit of someone else\u2019s downfall.\u201d Monarch smugly smiled and leaned on Maim-Nad\u2019s plush chair. He cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cI guess ol\u2019 toga boy in there is really desperate for attention\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttenshun ish not what Die-Onysus desiresh\u201d Mistress M stifled another burp. Holding up her wine bottle to look at the cocoon through the dark liquid she continued \u201cHe\u2019sh more interested in building hish own how you shay, following?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, like a cult?\u201d Monarch scoffed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like the Marshall Applewhite type to me, a bit too flamboyant if you catch my drift\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm,\u201d Maim-Nad sensually cooed, \u201cMore like a faith in\u2026 pleashure.\u201d  She slowly glided her fingers up and down the shaft of her wind bottle in a slow motion.  \u201cHe and I, we really enjoy partiesh.\u201d She picked up a chocolate covered biscotti and broke it in half, offering part of it to Monarch. \u201cDo joo like partiesh Mishter Monarch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnward my minions!\u201d Die-Onysus beckoned. \u201cOne more push ought to do it!\u201d As Sheila caught up to her former employer he already had his long banquet table halfway lodged in the wide doorway to their master bedroom in the cocoon. All sorts of liquids and food had splatted against the wall and onto the floor around the doors as they attempted over and over to shove the large buffet through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no!\u201d Mrs. Monarch scolded and sprinted to stop them. However, ignoring her protests, the horde pressed the table through the portal at last. Sheila\u2019s stomach tied into a knot as she heard dishes and platters noisily clatter to the floor inside the room. Die-Onysus stood as his minions lowered the table to the ground and he hopped off to tour the room himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie-Onysus, this is not where we told you to make yourself at home!\u201d Sheila stormed with a forceful posture. \u201cThis bedroom is my husband\u2019s and mine!\u201d She stopped in the middle of the room and folded her arms, looking at the would-be god very crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon my intrusion, my good lady,\u201d Die-Onysus half bowed, \u201cbut am I not correct in assuming you and your man have a place of rest inside that lavish house out front?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah,\u201d Mrs. Monarch shrugged, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean this bedroom is vacant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnysus looked away from her, admiring the view of Malice through the large 360 degree view from the elegant master bedroom. \u201cQuite a lovely community this is.\u201d Onysus suddenly changed his tone to a more romantic one. \u201cSo many powerful villains here.  My number two and I have been trying to get a place here for a while but it is difficult, let me tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, we got our place as a part of the mutual aggression rivalry between my husband and Phantom Limb, the house was considered part of the spoils of victory by the guild.\u201d Sheila casually gestured toward their house. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d have any trouble, you look like you\u2019re doing really well for yourself.\u201d She looked back to the lavishly decorated dinnerware and gold chalices adorning Onysus\u2019s feasting table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, you left me too soon Sheila -- quite a lot has changed since we parted ways.\u201d Die-Onysus gave her an inviting smile. \u201cAlas, money has nothing to do with it, the guild has refused to approve me for residential living. They would prefer all villains who are tyrannical class to be operating in a base that is at least-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyrannical class?!\u201d Shocked, Mrs. Monarch cut him off. \u201cYou\u2019re dropping arching for world domination? The Guild doesn\u2019t provide protection for villains that don\u2019t abide by the controlled aggression pact.\u201d Mrs. Monarch\u2019s voice grew concerned. \u201cYour minions are all soft and drunk, or weird half animals with giant phalluses. You won\u2019t survive against armed nations!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDo not worry your pretty little head, my former minx.\u201d Die Onysus gently caressed her shoulder. \u201cI will not be attempting world sovereignty by force.  \u201cAs I said\u2026 much has changed since we last saw each other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie-Onysus moved back to his table to pick up a gilded stein and took a long heavy drink. In the soft Florissant lighting Sheila could see what he meant. Gone was the doughy red-nosed merrymaker. Dressed in his new silky snow white toga golden chest armor and brilliant red cape, Die-Onysus was more statuesque. His round portly frame was a little taller, more robust and toned. He still had a generous amount of body fat but a thick layer of muscles clearly supported this. His arms in particular showed well-toned biceps and broad shoulders Sheila had never known him to have. As well his company seemed more imposing than the drunken slobs he once trod around with. The sloppy frat boys and 40 year old drunks he once attracted to his employ. The new hench were all young able bodied girls and boys running the range from their teens to early thirties. Despite many being chubby or plump with a liberal amount of alcohol in them they seemed well disciplined. Not to mention there were the strange Satyr he had acquired. Their fur looked all too real, they were definitely not costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would say I\u2019m not the only one who has changed though.\u201d Onysus broke Sheila out of her silent admiration of his new physique. \u201cYou have grown to be quite the woman since you left my employ.\u201d Onysus looked Mrs. Monarch up and down with a soft leer. \u201cI see the weight you put on as my number 2 found its way to the right places, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Mrs. Monarch became aware just how much Onysus\u2019s gaze had wandered and quickly crossed her arms once more and shot him a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that really the way you talk to a married woman?\u201d she reproached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ho my,\u201d Die-Onysus chuckled, \u201cIndeed it is, especially one I am as familiar with as I am with you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSpeaking of your husband, I am most gracious of this offer he has uh, extended to me for visit. It really is quite generous of the both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it sure is.\u201d Sheila rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie-Onysus snapped his hands at one of his tubby hand maidens. His minions had already picked up all the spilt dinnerware and returned it to the table. The round girl he had summoned quickly grabbed one of the wide wooden bowls and brought it to Mrs. Monarch.  She had always hated these drinking bowls. They were as wide as hubcaps and deep enough to fill with plenty of soup. However, no matter how sober you were it was impossible to drink from them without spilling it all over yourself. She was shocked to see the bowl full to the brim with a thick brown stew. Even after all the mess and spills they had made in bringing the table up here this bowl and indeed many others that she could see still looked topped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been hoping for an opportunity to meet and greet some of the residents of this fine community, um you and your husband included of course.\u201d Onysus nodded to her and made himself at home, sprawling out on top of The Monarch\u2019s large round bed before she could protest. \u201cYour invitation affords me with exactly such a favorable occasion. I would like to throw you and your husband a grand celebration as a thank you, and invite everyone who lives in Malice. It would of course be to my benefit as a way of meeting some of your neighbors. But first, come Sheila, let us imbibe!\u201d Die-Onyus raised a bowl of his own in one hand and a golden chalice in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Monarch glanced down to her own bowl and tried to shake her head. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure I could really-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Onysus bellowed humorously. \u201cEat up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Monarch was about to decline but her stomach suddenly let out a soft gurgle. \u201cWell\u2026 maybe a little,\u201d she recanted. Lifting the wide-brimmed bowl to her lips, Sheila tilted the bowl up and started to sip the rich stew. The flavor was amazing. <i>Was his food always this good?</i> she thought to herself. The broth may have been a little heavy with oil but the full-bodied taste was a treat for her taste buds. Without realizing it she started to tilt the bowl up higher, taking bigger sips. The more she ate the better it tasted. Higher and higher the bowl went as her pace increased. Trickles of stew escaped the sides and ran down her cheeks. Sheila took big long gulps from the bowl, often slurping noisily as she ate faster than the soup could flow and had to lift the bowl higher to speed the stew up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate for as long as she could before she had to stop and get some air. Returning the bowl to level only a small layer of stew remained in the bottom. Mrs. Monarch let out a very loud uncouth belch, unable to hold it in. Sheila turned bright red from both her unladylike outburst and how greedily she had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie-onysus let out a boisterous laugh. \u201cGood, good!\u201d he chortled. \u201cYou\u2019ve not forgotten how to eat like a true member of my court! Now come, finish the bowl and we may discuss business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila was just about certain she was full enough as it was, but before she could decline she felt another twinge of hunger in the pit of her stomach. Despite more than a gallon of soup filling up her belly, she really felt like she could manage just that last little bit. However, turning back to her bowl she was shocked to see the stew was nowhere near as depleted as she thought it was, the bowl was just shy of half full. Sheila stared at the stew for a few moments, trying to think of an excuse, but nothing came, only the stew beckoned. Silently she lifted the bowl to her mouth once more and tilted it high. She let the taste wash over her taste buds and began gulping the stew down like a thirsty fish again. Streams of stew flowed down her face and her stomach started to swell into a slight curve as she filled up. But even after consuming what seemed like more than she had before the bowl still seemed to keep flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila couldn\u2019t believe how much was left; the bowl just would not empty. Her pace increased, she tried to eat faster, not just to finish the stew but because it really was good. Holding the bowl nearly vertical she guzzled the stew, lapping up the heavenly broth with her tongue.  At last after what seemed like an eternity the bowl yielded the final few drops. What Mrs. Monarch didn\u2019t see was Die-Onysus wave his hand at the bowl just before it finally ran dry. Gasping for air, she held the bowl over her mouth for a few more seconds still trying to shake the last few drops onto her tongue. Finally, she lowered the bowl, her stomach distended into a small paunch from the stew inside her. Dark brown lines ran from the sides of her mouth and down her neck. Wiping away some of the stew on her mouth she tried to hold back another loud burp but could not. Jerking her head back slightly from the force, she tried in vain to cup her hand over her mouth to muffle the sound of her expulsion that filled the room like a trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvelous\u201d Die- Onysus smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the lower corridors, Monarch was checking room to room looking for his wife and their guests. Sheila came down the elevator behind him and called out. \u201cMistress Miam-Nad said you came in looking for us,\u201d she explained as she approached him, trying to hold her hands in front of her abdomen to hide how stuffed she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been looking all over, where the hell did that dick disappear to?\u201d Monarch spat, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Mrs. Monarch trailed off, \u201cfirst I wanted to ask you something\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I had something I needed to run by you too\u2026\u201d Monarch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you feel about letting Die-Onysus host a party here?\u201d they both asked at the same time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought I was going to have to get out the electroshock paddles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila gave a crooked smile.  \"Well, we don't have time for <i>that</i>, sweetie.

Are you actually wearing a tux?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...\" the Monarch shrugged.  \"I figured, if this guy is really tyrannical class -- the Guild handbook said the parties were usually formal, so I thought, why not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably way overdressed for a Die-Onysus party,\" Sheila laughed, \"but thanks for making an effort, anyway.\"  She kissed him on the cheek.  \"Hold on, I'll slip into my little black-and-gold dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, why haven't I seen that one before?\" the Monarch asked as his wife slithered into the glittering satin sheath.  \"That is <i>hot</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we got it a few years ago so -- unh -- so I could seduce Dr. Venture and inject him with... nanotech itching powder, I think it was.

Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiiith pleasure,\" the Monarch cooed.  \"This is... wow, this is really small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm kinda bloated,\" Sheila said, grunting as she adjusted the fabric around the slight curve of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing you didn't save room for the little cocktail weenies.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's barely room for <i>me</i> in this thing, let -- let alone the half a damn turkey they stuffed down my throat.  Would you make sure the Icarus Kids leave me alone tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sent them away,\" the Monarch said, waving dismissively.  \"Hatred's on the guest list, I didn't want him causing any embarassing <i>incidents</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Sheila continued, \"at least it's legal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say,\" boomed the enormous man approaching them in the entry hall, \"that is a <i>hell</i> of a spread I see back there.

Uh, I'm still getting used to the rules; all I know is, you can pretty much do whatever you want to her, only if she says 'armadillo' then you've gotta stop right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  Thanks for involving everyone in... this,\" the Monarch said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no trouble!\"  He tugged on the leash a couple of times, and Princess Tinyfeet stepped forward, blushing and biting her lip slightly.  \"Would Mistress like me to finish zipping up her dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, don't bother,\" Sheila said evasively.   \"It's kinda stuck.  You just enjoy yourself, dear.  Go eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They better not be the only ones who show up,\" Monarch whispered darkly to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax, people will come.

She was white trash incarnate. I kinda thought he was more into the Greek theme for his persona, not the trucker side.\u201d Monarch quipped. \u201cSo did I miss anyone while I was having my ears assaulted?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust Mommy Longlegs\u201d Mrs. Monarch glanced at the list \u201cWe\u2019re nearing the end anyway, we could probably join the party in the bit\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does she wear a black widow costume if she- Ya know what, forget it, I\u2019m not getting into this right now\u201d Monarch threw up his hands to stop himself.<br>\r\n\u201cHere comes Lady Hitler and Catclops\u201d Mrs. Monarch noted the approaching couple as they said their hellos<br>\r\n\u201cI hope the Baron isn\u2019t coming, the last thing we need is a drunken \u00dcnderbheit getting into a fight at this party\u201d Mrs. Monarch grimaced<br>\r\n\u201cNah we\u2019re good\u201d Monarch waved his hand \u201cI helped Mistress Miam-Nad trim down he guest list while you were glutting yourself on poultry this afternoon, no one from the \u2018revenge society\u2019 will be showing up\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly enjoying her company\u201d Mrs. Monarch shot her husband a discerning look.<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat?\u201d Monarch tried to deflect \u201cI\u2019m just being a good host\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMmhm\u201d I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s all you\u2019re trying to do with her\u201d Sheila cocked her head to the side before an approaching Vain Gloria and Auntie Matter stole her attention. Monarch sighed in relief as his wife was distracted by the gossip the three women began to delve into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party began to pick up momentum and soon The Monarch and Sheila joined their neighbors in the merriment. True to his word Die-Onysus was throwing one hell of a celebration. Throughout the crowded garden gala Onysus\u2019s hench flowed offering endless refills to everyone\u2019s steins. Food and booze were laid out on long tables surrounding the party goers with islands sprinkled across the middle. One never needed to move far to help themselves to seconds or thirds. Many quickly found themselves too smashed to stand up straight and took a seat on one of the many feast laden tables; lounging and stuffing their faces as they grew drunker and more indulgent.<br>\r\n\u201cYummy, Ah like dis one\u201d Misstress Miam-Nad cooed as she tugged on Princess Tinyfeet\u2019s leash beckoning her to climb up onto the lounge chair and sit like a pet at her side.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah she\u2019s a real prize she is\u201d Hatred beamed \u201cCourse you\u2019re quite the comely lass yer self missus\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaim-Nad\u201d The exotic woman spoke not even giving Hatred her attention. She gave the leash a sharp tug forcing Princess Tinyfeet to lean in closer and continued speaking in a soft sensual voice right into the young girl\u2019s ear \u201cMistress, Maim-Nad\u201d Princess Tinyfeet shuddered in fear and delight as the mature woman\u2019s voice had such a suffocating presence to it.<br>\r\n\u201cOh ho, so yer into that type of control play eh?\u201d Hatred tried to chat her up but was unable to draw Maim-Nad\u2019s piercing eyes off his young wife\u2019s helpless expression. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t think I could go that far if I let the woman be in charge of the game, but I suppose some fellers just aren\u2019t as rugged and manly as I am. You know I once took on <i>the</i> Brock Sa-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you could use a good drink\u201d Maim-Nad suddenly swiveled her head around to meet Hatred face to face and snapped her finger\u2019s in the air. Princess Tinyfeet gasped for air having been unable to think or breathe under Maim-Nad\u2019s crushing gaze. She was like a deer caught in the powerful woman\u2019s headlights.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve actually been trying to stay sober tonight\u201d Hatred scratched the back of his head nervously \u201cWhen I drink I have a tendency to overdo it and pass out, I was really looking forward to what the missus and I were gonna do once we go home later ya see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm\u201d Maim-Nad narrowed her eyes as she smiled politely and nodded to a chubby woman in a loose fitting robe who approached with a pitcher of sweet wine. The curvaceous woman held the pitcher out under the Sargent\u2019s nose to let the heady aroma fill his nostrils. Her other hand reached around and playfully worked its way under the collar of Harted\u2019s shirt as she rubbed his shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my that does smell pretty darn good\u201d Hatred found himself saying as if on impulse, the smell alone making his head swim. The voluptuous Maenad giggled in his ear and pulled the pitcher away letting Hatred follow it with his nose. Slowly she guided Hatred away letting him take small sips and tugging at his collar. Hatred quickly grew flush and his head seemed to cloud as the drink overwhelmed him.<br>\r\n\u201cAh-\u201c Princess Tinyfeet tried to call out to her husband but Hatred was quickly led away into the crowd. She turned back to her new captor to find Maim-Nad holding out a large leg of lamb dribbling with a thick sauce for the helpless girl to eat, a crule smile spread across the olive toned woman\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShesh, this is starting to get a little out of hand isn\u2019t it?\u201d Monarch scowled as he watched his neighbors grow more and more rowdy and slovenly.<br>\r\n\u201cIsh not really a surprise\u201d Sheila slurred slightly putting her hand on her husband\u2019s shoulder to steady herself. \u201cDie-Onysus\u2019s parties are always like thish, and they can get a lot worse\u201d Mrs. Monarch went to take another sip of her wine and found it gone already. Before she could even look for a new source a helpful cherub fluttered to her side instantly and held aloft a golden amphora pouring a thick stream of new booze into her glass.<br>\r\nSheila just smiled warmly her cheeks already turning crimson, Monarch meanwhile swatted at the small winged caterer in annoyance. \u201cShoo, get out of here, I thought I told you things you can\u2019t come to the party!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAw it\u2019sh fine sweetie, really\u201d His wife patted the Monarch on the back \u201cEveryone is having a good time see?\u201d Shila gestured around them to their neighbors and friends. The party was growing more loud and lively by the minute. Everyone it seemed was really beginning to cut loose, modesty quickly disappearing. All around them the Cherubs were fluting about topping off beverages and plates. Toga dressed women and men who had been serving people just a short time ago were working their way through the crowd getting rather friendly with singles and couples alike offering to give them body massage or feed them grapes.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried if Hatred seems the half-naked kids floating around\u201d Monarch grumbled<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is really paying mush attention\u201d Sheila pointed out picking out Hatred roaring with laughter as two shapely women took turns pouring a dark colored liquid in his mouth or feeding him a plate of baklava.<br>\r\n\u201cWow Hatred getting loving from two mature women?\u201d Monarch was dumbfounded \u201cThen what happened to his little leashed kid bride?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u201d Mrs. Monarch grunted into her glass tilting it back to drain it dry, she pointed in the direction of Maim-Nad\u2019s lounger where the imposing woman was reclined with the small girl straddling her midrift. The little girl\u2019s dress was even tighter as a packed belly pressed on the dress. Maim-Nad was ordering the obedient girl to feed her new mistress hunks of rich cake. Every time the girl leaned forward with a new piece the larger woman would take advantage of her lowered guard and cram a buttery pastry or greasy slab of meat into the girl\u2019s mouth. Despite the forceful stuffing the girl was forbidden to choke or spit out the food and had to eat everything Maim-Nad shoved into her. Suddenly Maim-Nad got a wicked idea in her head and shot forward knocking the poor girl onto her back. Quickly pinning her down Maim-Nad tipped her large chalice of wine onto the girl\u2019s face. Princess Tinyfeet spat and gagged for a moment before finally accpeting her fate and drinking in the flow. The small girl no match for the powerful alcohol felt her mind grow fuzzy. Before the Monarch had finished watching the spectacle Maim-Nad had an entire decanter of wine held up for the girl to chug. Princess Tinyfeet greedily slurping down the sweet nectar as fast as she could manage despite her already packed gut.<br>\r\nMonarch turned to find his wife accepting another refill of her own wine from her own personal cherub as well as a plate of Souvlaki. \u201cWell that resolution certainly stood the test of time\u201d Monarch sarcastically rolled his eyes. The Monarch glanced down at the zipper on his wife\u2019s dress start to feel the pressure push on it once more as the cherub urged her to start eating.. <br>\r\nThe Monarch didn\u2019t have time to chase the cherub away however as more soon arrived. A chalice of his own was quickly forced into his hands and the Monarch was finding himself in a similar state. The wine making everything feel comfortable. The Husband and wife villain team were guided to a table where they could relax leaned against one another and brought all the wine and food they could manage. The zipper on Sheila\u2019s dress creaked and slipped down a few notches.<br>\r\nDie-onysus watched with a grin as his gracious hosts were being coddled and fed by a swarm of cherubs. All around him the other party goers were finding themselves overwhelmed by booze and food. The party collapsing into drunken groping and hedonistic indulgence.</span></div></div>",

Onysus nodded with satisfaction and signaled to the satyrs, who drew long trumpets from beneath the tables and put them to their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the multi-toned blast, the party-goers turned to face Die-Onysus.  It would be wrong to say they were \"disciplined\", exactly.  They were rowdy, sloppy, and completely shitfaced.  And yet the group as a whole took on a sort of cohesiveness, a sense of purpose beneath a thick coat of chaos, as if a spell had fallen over them like a net and suddenly been drawn tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my grand bacchanal, my army,\" the villain said, climbing up on the table, \"are you ready to <i>party?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>YES!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to shake the world with the force of our revelry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>YES!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then follow me, and I promise you, the rivers will flow with wine!   The forces of boredom and lameness will be crushed beneath our sandals!  Oh, they may call the police with a noise complaint!  They may even call out the army!   But will we let that kill the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NO!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tonight, my grand bacchanal, we<i> rock!</i>\"   Die-Onysus thrust one beefy finger towards the exit.  In moments, the heavy doors had been torn off their hinges as the crowd thundered forth in an unstoppable wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh.\"  Sheila's head was pounding.  \"Where...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she knew was that she was surrounded by the overpowering odor of orange chicken.   After several seconds of serious thought, she managed to figure out that it was because she'd passed out face down in a pile of it.   She rolled over onto her back and slid off the buffet table, feeling more than a little overcooked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around.  She was in some sort of lavish restaurant, stocked with a dozen long buffet tables covered with every type of food imaginable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, what happened?\"  she wondered.  \"Was I up all night eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncomfortably stuffed sensation in her stomach certainly seemed to support that possibility.   She could barely bend at the waist, she was so full.   She put a hand against the table for support; her head was spinning, and she didn't want to lose everything in her stomach.   Her rumpled costume was already messy enough from all the orange sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she worked her way along the table towards the drink dispenser.   She'd been sweaty copiously in her sleep (not to mention all the alcohol she'd downed) and now she was parched enough to drink about a gallon of lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tripped over something and nearly fell.  Looking down, she saw--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A member of the SWAT team?\"  she murmured, nudging the unconscious body with her toe.  \"What did we <i>do </i> last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask Randall freaking Flagg out there?\" a familiar voice said from behind her.  \"I'm sure he's about to give another speech aaaaall about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila turned to see her husband, dressed in the top half of his costume and a pair of boxer shorts and looking like he'd been hit by a few buses sometime during the night.   He was taking tiny sits from a mug of coffee with \"I HEART LAS VEGAS\" printed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are we in--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" the Monarch said with a shrug, \"apparently, we spent last night conquering Las Vegas.  Excuse me, 'New Dionysia'.    All morning it's been 'today, New Dionysia, tomorrow, the world!'   That guy is even harder to take when you're hung over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We took over--?\" Sheila sputtered.  \"This is a disaster!  This is--this is all-out war, and <i>we're in it!</i>   Why didn't you wake me up earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another sip.  \"You looked so cute sleeping in the chicken like that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Up and down the strip throngs of civilians were being herded and split up. Anyone who had been in Vegas last night seemed to be captive of whatever Die-Onysus had planned. Far more Saytr and Maenad than Sheila had seen previously seemed to be in charge of directing the flow of would be prisoners to god only knew where.  A semi-coherent henchman in a toga was able to direct her to one of the more lavish hotels nearby where Die-Onysus was setting up his center of operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila crossed the street between one of the processions of Vegas captives and rounded the corner of a large casino and hotel where Die-Onysus was to be found. Out front Sargent Hatred was apparently in charge of his own group of hench. Parked in the courtyard of the Casino were many of the party going villain\u2019s weapons and vehicles, Hatred\u2019s own hover tank,  Manta Claus\u2019s sleigh, Scorpio\u2019s Stinging Speeder, and of course Monarch\u2019s flying Cocoon were among them. Hatred seemed to be directing many of the hench in and out of the various super vehicles, having them stripped down and rebuilt with greater defenses and weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously helping that lunatic?\u201d She frowned at Hatred as she neared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hey Sheila!\u201d Hatred greeted over his shoulder, His usual army fatigues had been replaced with a toga and gold breastplate. Hatred finished giving some directions to an assembled team of toga wearing henchman who immediately charged into the cocoon tools in hand. \u201cOl\u2019 Onysus put me in charge of getting all possible assault vehicles battle ready in case the army decides to make a counter-attack. And of course there is the OSI\u2019s flyin\u2019 carrier parked a few clicks to the south east just observing us, gonna have to find a way to counter that puppy. But Ya know I think yer cocoon might just be what I need to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho even gave you permission to take our equipment!?\u201d Sheila blew up \u201cThis is all insane and this is just digging us in deeper!\u201d She spat growing red \u201cWe\u2019re going to get killed if that pompous idiot keeps up the world domination shit and this:\u201d Sheila got louder as she threw an arm up to gesture to the parking lot full of well-armed vehicles \u201cIs all the pretext the army needs to charge in here right now an put a bullet in to our heads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa now darlin\u2019!\u201d Hatred tried to calm her down \u201cI think you need to go speak to the big guy yourself. I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to throw my support in behind someone I didn\u2019t believe in one hundred percent I tell you what. Die-Onysus just has a way of making you feel like he\u2019s got all this under control. After all\u2026 today New Dionysia\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow the world!\u201d The henchman around them joined in cheering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaaaaugh!\u201d Sheila stifled her rage as she stormed off towards the front doors of the Hotel to see Die-Onysus herself.</span></div></div>",

Several hench tried hopelessly to step into her path and slow her down but they were quickly knocked to the ground as she marched past unphased. A large Saytr moved to block her from entering the largest suite but Sheila was more than ready planting the heel of her stiletto in it\u2019s over sized groin and landing a sharp chop to the side of its neck as it crumpled in pain. The goat like man fell to the floor as Sheila began to huff and breathe a bit heavier. Her over indulgence catching up with her already feeing fatigued from the minor assault. She could feel the hint of sweat forming on her brow and when she kicked the beast in its soft bits she was sure she heard the last few links of the zipper on her dress break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila threw open the doors to find several of her Malice neighbors and some other familiar villainous faces seated in the foyer of the suite. Most of them were out of their usual costumes and dressed in new togas and robes just like Hatred. They were seated around a few tables covered in a lavish spread still picking at the food and drink as if their consumption  from the night previous wasn\u2019t already enough to last a lifetime. Vain Gloria dressed in her own greek-wear with her wide brown hips cutting through the side was the first to get up and try to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheila what has gotten into you?\u201d She tried to ask as she approached the enraged woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Onysus?\u201d Sheila growled cutting right to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVain Gloria turned and waved a hand to a conference room to the side of the main hall \u201cHe\u2019s in a meeting with his generals but I don\u2019t think you should be interrupting him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila just shoulder checked her way past Vain Gloria and started matching towards the set of doors. \u201cYou all may be falling for that nut job\u2019s new world order spiel but I am giving him a piece of my mind and then my husband and I AND our cocoon are leaving. That is if we even can leave <b>without being shot by the army first</b>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila kicked open the double doors and charged right in. Inside just as Vain Gloria had said Die-Onysus was seated at a long table with an assembly of what were arguably the strongest villains who had been invited to the party. All of them now wore their own flowing robes and golden breast plates and armor. On the table before them nested among the various dishes and chalices of whatever they were gorging on was a map of Vegas was spread out with markers placed on top of it to indicate the various forces at play. A large model plane sat in the mountains to indicate the OSI carrier, Some green plastic army men were grouped up in clusters on all sides of the Vegas strip to show where each of the army\u2019s forcers were primarily focused and in the middle of the strip sat a collection of various action figures and hot wheels cars around a gold painted Abe Lincoln. Die-Onysus and the villains present at the table seemed to notice her entry but continued with their meeting regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe guild is still awaiting an official response from us , they say they won\u2019t make a decision on whether to get involved for diplomatic purposes or back off and leave us to handle the government ourselves till they do. They seem pretty angry with the situation but because of the number of Guild members involved they have no choice but to wait on you to make a formal declaration of your intentions before they can respond appropriately, After all counting those present in this room and throughout the strip we account for more than a third of the guild\u2019s power.\u201d Spoke a gold armored Storm Front<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry sir, I have it on good authority that the Guild\u2019s council of 13 is in disarray at the moment following last night\u2019s events\u201d smiled Don Hell in a dark red toga before glancing at Mommy Longlegs across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful! Then we have a little more time to prepare for the next phase\u201d Die Onysus stood triumphantly \u201cThe army will not act as long as Washington holds their leash, and the American government will surely want to know what the guild\u2019s position is before declaring war here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Sheila had made her way around the table and was a arm\u2019s length away from slapping Onysus across the face. However by time she reached him he had already turned to greet her and with a simple wave his generals knew they were dismissed. Sheila panted slightly out of breath decided to spare Onysus the embarrassment of attacking him in front of his generals but also needed to pause and rest before she started screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Die-Onysus that spoke first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t change the subject!\u201d Sheila grew angrier \u201cI want an explanation for all this! What happened last night??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnysus didn\u2019t seem to pay her much mind; he made a simple gesture to her figure while looking to his cherubs and sent them off without a word. He then turned back to the table to scoop up his large golden chalice and a smaller one nearby. He offered her the smaller goblet, or rather thrust it into her hands before turning to a window to look out at the strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what I want Sheila?\u201d He began after a sip of his wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her chalice heavy with wine back on the table \u201cI assume you\u2019re looking to usher in some new world order that\u2019s just a Greek civilization copycat. Probably want everyone wearing robes and walking around in sandals. Maybe even bring back the rules where only land owning males can vote?\u201d Sheila mocked \u201cMaybe your just suicidal and this all seemed easier than stepping in front of a bus\u201d She waved her arms around at the smoke rising off of Vegas in the distance and the army men sitting on the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnysus waited for her to finish with only a smile \u201cNo my minx; I want to free mankind from the cruel shackles of moderation. To break the chains of depression forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy here we go\u2026\u201d Sheila grumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 They, deserve to live their lives carefree and happily. Man was not put on this world to toil for a lifetime and only enjoy a few meager and fleeting moments of happiness. Life should be all about merriment and jubilation. I can give it to them Sheila, I can give mankind the key to eternal satisfaction.\u201d Onysus had returned his gaze to Mrs. Monarch and was now standing very close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you give it a rest?\u201d She started by taking a step back from him \u201cI didn\u2019t come up here to hear your manifesto. I want; nay, demand an explanation. Why did you kidnap us? What did you do to us? Why is everyone just going along with everything like it\u2019s no big deal?!\u201d Sheila was out of breath at this point and needed to lean against the table. She placed one hand on her now developed pot belly as she took in deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheila-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call me Mrs. The Monarch!\u201d She shot him a stern look cheeks flushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnysus paused looking down at her \u201cI told you that much has changed since you left my court, I\u2019ve acquired all the means to see my plans through to fruition. I really want to show you how, but that time has not come yet. However that is close at hand\u201d Onysus lifted his chalice to swirl the wine about \u201cLast night was a sample of the power I\u2019ve come to wield. As you and the other villains lost yourself to the passions of revelry you all entered a state of bliss, some call it bakkheia, it\u2019s a higher form of consciousness that is tied to festivity. In this state you were all empowered by your jubilance. With my power and the throws of bakkheia staking a claim for New Dionysia was child\u2019s play. Now the others have drank deep of my nectar and see things as I see them, they have all offered up their resources and powers freely to me to help make my dreams come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila just cocked her head to the side before letting out an exasperated sigh. \u201cSo basically we all got so drunk off our asses you convinced us to attack US territory en mass and now they\u2019re all hopped up on adrenalin and whatever booze you\u2019re still giving them that they still think this is a good idea. Is that about right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my dear dear She- Mrs. Monarch, you may be skeptical now but as I said in time I will be able to make you understand, ah!\u201d As Onysus spoke the Cherubs returned with two maenads carrying an elegant flowing dress. It was clearly a more luxurious material than the robes he had given the others and the design was elegant. \u201cIt\u2019s a gown befitting of a goddess\u201d Onysus leaned in close to Sheila\u2019s ear as she was momentarily muted from her rage by the beautiful dress  \u201cA dress you will look stunning in\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha? F-for me?\u201d Sheila was dumbstruck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m trying to build to my lovely minx, I am very serious when I say I have the power to usher in a new age for mankind. I will see it through, but I need a goddess at my side to make it work. Mrs- No, Sheila; You are my goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPff, baha ha ha ha!\u201d Mrs. Monarch burst out laughing \u201cYou\u2019re really serious with this god thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sheila wiped away a tear \u201cLook I\u2019m not your goddess, I\u2019m a happily married woman and I\u2019m going back down to find my husband and if we can get out of this alive we will be leaving, goodbye Die-Onysus.\u201d With that Sheila made her way past the maenads and the dress and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But if you entered through the tastefully decorated foyer and climbed the beige-carpeted stairs, you would find a room with a locked door -- and through the crack beneath that door, the bright magenta glow of a neophyte's flashy, undisciplined magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of mournful wailing filled the air, and a chant arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darkness of sin, heed my call,<br>\r\nDrain the souls from one and all,<br>\r\nFire ants will eat their eyes,<br>\r\nAnd in the dark the shadows RIIISE!</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nTriana clicked the 'pause' button of her Shuffle.   \"I don't know, Raven -- I mean, I liked Screamchill's first album, but this one is so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corporate?\"  her boyfriend offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Now you hardly even have to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just potato chips.   They're about the lightest thing there is.\"  She smiled.  \"But thanks.  Now I need to focus on reducing the level of thaumic overspill -- uh, the light, I mean.  It's still kind of sloppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get there.  You've been practicing a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana waggled her fingers again, but nothing happened; the tendrils of her mind couldn't seem to get a hold on the next chip.  A moment later, she rolled over with a grunt and opened the bag the old fashioned way.  No wonder; it was empty.  She crumpled it up with her mind and tossed it over her shoulder into the trash, where it joined a Cheetos bag, a Thin Mints box, and a flattened tub of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>have</i>, haven't I?\"  She wasn't going to have much of an appetite for dinner, that was for sure.   \"I'd better watch that, you know?   I'm not getting as much exercise lately, since I can't go dancing--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped her mouth shut, too late, and felt a blush creeping into her cheeks as her gaze flicked over to his crutches.    \"Sorry, I -- I meant --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Raven said.  \"You know, if you want to go out dancing with your friends sometimes, it's totally cool.  I mean, we'll always have movie night, right?\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhat friends?</i>, Triana thought.   Kim would just give Triana an earful about how dancing was sinful, and Dean -- well, she didn't even want to think about what his idea of \"popular\" dance might be.  Probably something like a slow waltz, but without the touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay.  Really.\"  She shrugged.  \"All this telekinesis probably burns off just as many calories, in the long run, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it with such sincerity she even managed to convince herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite appearances, it was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now who's going to help me clear the table?\" the Outrider said, rubbing his hands together.  \"Come on, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana groaned.  \"Next time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, honey, you looked like you were enjoying the meal, so it's only fair--\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nOh, come on!  The spirit is willing</i>, Triana thought, <i>but the flesh is</i> stuffed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is a good time to put your magic to practical use, Starry Eyes,\" Raven suggested.   Triana perked up.  \"Hey, yeah!  That's actually a really good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to get all the plates in the air at once, and levitate them all into the sink -- well, all but one, anyway.  <br>\r\n\"Seventy-five percent.  I mean, that's a passing grade, right?\" she said, maneuvering the pieces into the trash.   \"I'd say I did okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did excellent,\" Raven said, pecking her one the cheek.  Triana grinned.   Her powers were developing, she had a wonderful, attentive, and <i>drop-dead gorgeous</i> boyfriend, and she was warm, contented, and comfortably stuffed.  Everything was going her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a visual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see her now.  First she made an absolute <i>pig</i> of herself, then she started throwing dishes around with her 'powers', and now she's sucking face with her... her little <i>boy toy!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, we can work with that.  I mean, there's got to be something in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Some</i>thing?\"  The Avenging Angel narrowed her eyes.  \"Gluttony, sloth, lust, <i>sorcery</i>.  She's everything that's wrong with the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.   If that works for you.\"    The deep voice in her earpiece sounded more resigned than enthusiastic.  \"I gotta say, I really liked this angel thing when you pitched it to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's who I am!\" the Avenging Angel said, a little too loudly.  Triana's head turned, and she could swear the girl looked right at her for a moment.  Hastily, she ducked behind the hedge, hoping it had been too dark for her target to spot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, I think if you let me work on the costume a little, you could really have something.  I'm thinking white spandex with gold accents; very angelic, fits your theme, and it complements my look as well.  I know some people think white makes you look heavy, but you've got the figure to pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with my costume.  It's modest and practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look, the long skirt and blouse combo would be great if you were doing a Village of the Damned kind of mind powers thing, but you're equipment-based, okay, honey?  If you wear normal clothes, you're not really even a villain.  You're just, I don't know, an angry Amish chick or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do I attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't.   Tonight is for recon.   She's still a neophyte; the Guild won't let you arch her until she's a practicing sorceress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I brought my flaming sword!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to talk to you about that, too; you've got to be more careful where you're squirting lighter fluid.  Our henchmen are very flammable; it's the wings, I think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\"  The Avenging Angel slunk away, ducking down to keep the hedge between her and the people inside the house.  \"Go ahead, Triana, live in sin for another day.   Judgement is coming.  The judgement of -- the <i>Avenging Angel!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, honey, that was a very nice read.  You're good with those, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana turned back from the window.  \"I'm not sure.  I heard something -- or sensed something -- and I thought I saw... well, it's silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think you saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, probably,\" Triana said, \"but for a second, I could have sworn there was a girl in our yard. And -- and it almost looked like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana's gaze flicked once more to the darkness outside the window.  \"<i>Kim</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a conundrum, all right.  Triana's stomach wanted breakfast, but her bed was so warm and cozy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled under the covers, trying to wriggle back into the grasp of the sandman's fingers, but another insistent pang of hunger reminded her that she hadn't eaten since ... well, since that midnight snack, but still, that had been hours ago!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe there was a way she could satisfy her hunger without getting out of bed.  <i>Hmm.  I wonder if I can manage it from all the way up here?</i>, she thought. <i> Only one way to find out. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuesting fingers of thaumic power oozed their way down the staircase, under the door, and into the kitchen.   Grasping, she opened the cupboard -- removed the box of Fruity Mummy -- opened the fridge -- removed the milk -- closed the door --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a delicate series of operations, especially because she had to do the whole thing using only her arcane sight.  By the time she had the milk and the box of cereal resting next to her bed, she was exhausted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a workout ... oh, damn!  I forgot the bowl!</i>   Well, she wasn't getting out of bed <i>now</i>, not after all that.  She emptied her mind, let it \"cool off\" for a few moments, then heaved the milk and cereal back into the air, lifting them directly over her face.  She tried not to think about what would happen if she lost her grip -- if she thought about it too much, she almost certainly <i>would</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tipped the box, filling her open mouth with cereal, then tipped the half-empty gallon jug of and sloshed milk over it.  She overestimated slightly, and ended up almost spattering it across her face, but she got plenty of it in her mouth as well.  Cheeks bulging, she chewed the enormous mouthful.   <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHow about that?  I got myself breakfast in bed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted a little weird because she'd picked up the chocolate milk -- all milk looked the same on the astral plane! -- but still, she was pleased with herself.  She kept practicing, and had the pour down perfectly by the time she ran out of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triana, honey!\" her stepfather called up the stairs.   \"Are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo?  Oh, right!  She was supposed to be visiting Dad this weekend.   Well, time for another challenge -- could she get dressed using only her magic?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving herself plenty of room, she stood in the middle of the floor and lifted her arms.  With a whisk of mental power, her nightie slipped over her head and flew across the room.  From there, it was almost too easy; bra, shirt, stockings, they all went on easily.  Only the skirt gave her a little bit of trouble; she had to force the clasp together by hand.  Apparently, that was a little too complicated for her magic as of yet -- <i>But a few more mornings like this, and I'm sure I won't have to worry about it anymore</i>, she reassured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look back at her pillow -- which was soaked with milk and covered in loose Fruity Mummy pieces -- was enough to convince her that she should probably do her makeup the old-fashioned way, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swirling vortex opened the in the sky above the mountain highway, and out of it stormed a pale horse with two riders.  The ethereal stallion landed on the asphalt, leaving hoofprints of purple flame.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are; the Venture compound!\" the Outrider said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana slid off the horse's back and looked over the steel safety railing.  \"What gives?   We're like two miles from the front gates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" the Outrider said sheepishly.  \"I must have steered us back onto the material plane a little prematurely.   Well, it's a lovely day; why don't we walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed his stepdaughter.  His \"miscalculation\" had actually been entirely intentional; Tatyana had suggested it.   Frankly, Triana could use the exercise.  She'd barely moved a muscle all week, and it was starting to show.   The \"Neophyte 15\", they called it.  It was easy to put on a few pounds if you started relying on magic for everything, and just as the girl was an <i>exceptional</i> student of the arcane, it had taken her an <i>exceptionally</i> short time to get soft and sloppy, especially around the middle.  That skirt had always been a muffin top waiting to happen -- and now the prophecy was coming to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you just didn't come right out and tell a teenager that she was getting fat, particularly not when she'd just learned to set someone's soul on fire two days ago.  Hopefully, a little walk would stir her out of her rut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'okay, I know the way,\" Triana said.  \"Thanks for the lift.  I can get there on my own from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure -- you've got your phone if there's any trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.  See you on Sunday evening!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana waited until the vortex had winked shut, then walked over to the railing.   It was a long way down.  She lifted herself into the air, just a couple of inches, but enough to be sure that she could keep from plummeting.  When she was satisfied, she stepped over the railing and began gliding towards the Venture compound far below, descending on a cushion of air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho needed walking?</span></div></div>",

I'm the one all the chicks come to see.\"  Dermott crossed his arms over his bare chest.  \"'You play in the background while they admire my sweet pecs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, which pecs would <i>those</i> be?\"  Triana asked.  She'd been floating in the direction of the Orpheus apartment when the sounds of bass guitar and shouting had caught her ear, and she'd peeked into one of the compound's many abandoned garages to find a practice session by none other than the so-cool-nobody's-even-heard-of-them band Shallow Gravy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, see, it worked!\"  Dermott said.  \"Every time we play this, goth chicks are just gonna come in and want to bang us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana raised an eyebrow.  She hadn't quite perfected the loser-into-frog spell yet, but she could always use the practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's just Triana,\" Hank said. \"Hey, Triana!

Especially not chicks.  She'll probably put, like, Hello Kitty and crap all over everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, who's gonna do the special effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, duh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but it's too hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dermott scoffed, \"that's what your mother said when I was, like, nailing her last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe I could help out,\" Triana said, \"as a favor to<i> you</i>.\"  She looked pointedly at Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Hank said. \"You don't have to decide now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We do have a show lined up this weekend, in fact...Er, well...kinda,\" Hank said, his enthusiasm straining a bit under reality.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'kinda,' Dumb-ass?\" Dermott interjected.  \"We're headlining at Kletchy Park on Sunday.  We are gonna ROCK that bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kletchy...\" Triana repeated, squinting in thought, \"the playground?  With the day-care center?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hank admitted.   \"Nikki volunteers there sometimes.  She said it would be OK as long as we didn't bother the kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bother?  The chicks are gonna be, like, tearing off their tops with lust at our primal wail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,  did you catch a case of Sergeant Hatred syndrome?  Most the kids there are 6 years old, tops.  Unless you're talking about your sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Dermott shot back, folding his arms across his chest.  \"Just...shut up, Jerkoff,\" he replied after a failed moment of trying to formulate a snappier response.  \"It's gonna be awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh kay,\" Triana waved her hands at the pair, retreating a few steps \"I think I need to see Dad now, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, aren't you at least gonna stick around for our rehearsal?\" Hank pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana couldn't help but cringe.  She had a hipster's delicate sensibilities when it came to music, and she'd heard more than enough of Hank's clumsy fumblings when he'd first taken up Brock's bass last year.  The muffled clamor she'd heard while gliding across the Venture compound didn't suggest the addition Dermott's stylings had improved the artistry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Hank said before Triana could voice an excuse.  \"Take a seat and prepare to be entertained. \"  Leaping up onto the stage behind Dermott, he made a finger gun and shot her a wink.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTriana rolled her eyes, but found herself smiling all the same.  Obliging in the way one might indulge a charmingly naive toddler, Triana hopped her bottom onto the folding table, next to the pizza.  Unconsciously, she adjusted the pinching waistband of her skirt down a smidge in front as she settled into place. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"She'll be up on her feet again in a few seconds--if you don't screw up this time,\" Dermott promised, cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Exactly what I'm afraid of</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H.E.L.P.E.R., if you please,\" Hank cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana blinked as the garage lights suddenly shut off.   A moment later the rhythmic Casio-esque *tap* of  H.E.L.P.E.R.'s karaoke drumming program filled the silence.  The robot's \"walking eye\" and headlight flashed in tempo, intermittently bathing the room with a dim red illumination.   After a few measures, Hank bass seamlessly slid into an impressively catchy walking bass line.   Triana's eyes widened.  By the time the trio struck the final chords of \"Jacket\" a couple minutes later, her mouth was hanging wide open too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank, Dermott and Helper all turned expectantly to their audience of one.  For a pregnant moment Triana said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  My.  God,\" she finally managed.  \"What--when did you actually get <u>good</u>??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Brock taught me some chords,\" Hank beamed, inspecting his fingernails in a gesture of absurd nonchalance.  \"I've been practicing all summer.  But I'm pretty sure it's mostly Pop's old Fleetwood Mac eight-tracks that I stuck into my learning bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Dermott grumbled.  \"We'd be better than 'good' if your lame-ass robot wasn't stuck in bosa nova mode. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH.E.L.P.E.R. beeped forlornly and hung its head in shame.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it again,\" Triana said, cross her legs and tearing off a slice of pizza.   \"I want to hear the melody structure a few more times and try a couple things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll be signing on as our FX witch with all benefits and responsibilities accruing thereto?\"  Hank asked expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana took a bite, then wiggled the fingers of free hand, conjuring a shadowy. ethereal serpent to coil around the clearly disconcerted H.E.L.P.E.R.'s spidery legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yes.\" she replied around a mouthful of greasy dough and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana spent the better part of the next two hours running through the same song with Hank, Dermott and H.E.L.P.E.R.  It turned out \"Jacket\" was the only song they could play, aside from \"Go Tell Aunt Rhodie,\" \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" and half a dozen other public domain hits from Hank's introductory bass guitar music theory book.  It also turned out that making a skull from flames was harder than it looked.  Triana had been able to manage a passable version after a few tries, but it still looked a bit off.  Or, \"retarded,\" as Dermott had put it.   She'd just have to practice her summonings a bit more.  Most of her attention had been on telekinesis lately, after all.   Regardless, the effort had left her thoroughly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to ask, though,\" Triana said, pressing a cool can of root beer (re-branded as a Hank Co. product in smudged sharpie) against her slightly sweaty brow, \"Jackets?  What's the deal with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>My</u> idea, naturally,\" Dermott answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, shouldn't it actually count as your mom's idea?  I mean, it was her Burlington Coat Factory catalog we were flipping through...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana smirked.  \"You know, that's so dorky it's almost cool.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh,\" Dermott scoffed, \"if you had half a brain you should've been <u>begging</u> us to let you tag along after we totally brought down the house at Home-School-Prom-alooza.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana frowned.   \"Huh.\"  Now that he mentioned it, she did remember Shallow Gravy playing that night.  It wasn't all that long ago; they couldn't have improved all that much in such a short time.  But she'd stormed out almost the instant they'd started playing, after Dean's braty little tantrum.  \"I kinda left the party early. I guess I must've missed you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hank said, \"Dean told us about how you ran off to go 'slut around for poopy hand sex.'  It's cool.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Triana groaned at the reminder.   \"I might've been a little drunk, too,\" she admitted, cracking open the can of root beer. \"There was definitely something in that punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drunk on a heady wine of my, like, masculine god-musk,\" Dermott offered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew-wwww.\" Hank grimaced, turning back to look at Dermott.  \"That is exactly why you need at least put on some deodorant if you're not going to wear a shirt on stage!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, no way!  I'm <u>telling</u> you, this shit is pheromone city!  Chicks are like ants, they can't help but chase after it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're trying to tell me that's a good thing?  Last time your 'god-musk' turned all the girls into mutant bug beasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They turned into mutant <u>flies</u>, dumb ass.  Not ants.  That's <u>totally</u> not the same thing.  Besides, they weren't even that hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH.E.L.P.E.R. emitted a series of inquisitive-sounding beeps, glancing back and forth between the arguing boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Triana took the engrossing debate as her cue to leave.  She was already late, and Dad was probably getting worried.  Or, you know, more worried than usual.  Triana downed the rest of her root beer in a long swallow, grabbed one of the pizza boxes, then quietly snuck out the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you--hey, your pet gothic chick's gone.\" Dermott observed several minutes later, finally interrupting their argument. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Hank whispered, looking around the room--and under the table--with wide-eyed awe.  \"Magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phhh.  Whatever,\" Dermott snorted as he walked over the table and lifted the lid on the remaining pizza box.  \"I could've been invisible this whole time if I was wearing my Torque of Mental Domination.  I just don't like to use it except on...  Aw, what the hell!\"  Dermott slapped the mostly empty box away with disgust, sending a few of the nibbled crusts it contained bouncing out across the table and onto the floor.   \"She ate all our damn pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just beware of the crimson vial behind the baking soda, for if you touch it, your very <i>SOOOOUL</i> could be rrrrrent in <i>TWAI--</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da-ad!\"  Triana laughed.  \"I haven't been gone <i>that</i> long!

Is this -- oh my god!  You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering into the freezer, she took in the site of the familiar brown-and-black carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death By Dark Chocolate!  That's my favorite flavor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I knew you were coming...\" Orpheus said, pleased.  Triana cracked open the fresh carton and scooped several large helpings into a dish, forming a delicious-looking mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said, perched on the couch and working her way through her bowl.  \"Everything's been good around the compound?  That Monarch guy hasn't been causing you any trouble or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no, he keeps mostly to Doctor Venture's side of the compound.

I'm sleeping well, I'm getting enough to eat--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see,\" Orpheus muttered with an aside glance.  Triana froze with final bite halfway to her mouth.  \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well -- well, I hate to bring it up, Pumpkin, but all the parently magazines say that sudden changes in weight can be a sign of an -- an underlying problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana let the spoon clatter into the bowl.  Her face flushed.  \"It's... <i>maybe</i> ten pounds, okay Dad?  You really don't need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, it isn't much at the moment, but I recently had a conversation with Helicopter Parent and her Hateful Hover-Achievers and she said that it can be a sign of depression, problems at school... drugs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana stood up.  \"<i>Drugs?</i>  I thought you knew me better than that!  I am <i>not</i> on drugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Helicopter Parent said--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helicopter Parent's minions' suits don't work if they weigh over eight-five pounds, so of course she cares!   Look, my weight's just going to -- to go up and down sometimes.   It's normal.

Can we -- can we pretend you just never brought it up at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Orpheus said, \"we can do better than that.\"  He placed his fingers on her forehead.   \"<i>Sleep!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ... you... doiiing?\" Triana slurred as she slumped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And in your sleep, forget...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana woke up with a start.  Her head felt fuzzy.  She tried to remember what had happened.  She'd arrived at her father's apartment and ... well, that was it.  She must have conked out on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Dad,\" she said, sitting up with a yawn.   \"I guess after all that pizza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" Orpheus said cheerfully.  \"I went ahead and put the leftovers in the refridgerator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriana sat up.   Her mouth felt dry, and her head was still a little blurry; she had similar spells from time to time.  Nothing really to worry about.  She wanted a drink, though, and walked over to the counter, getting out a glass and some ice cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This weekend will be just about bonding,\" Orpheus contained, \"and talking, and sharing -- but only what you're comfortably sharing, Pumpkin, I'd hate to get too personal and spoil thing--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my god! </i> You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you --wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death By Dark Chocolate,\" Triana enthused, removing the half-empty carton from the freezer.   \"Da-ad!\" she chided him.  \"You just couldn't wait for me to get here before you got into it, could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha,\" Orpheus laughed nervously.   \"I'm afraid you've caught me red-handed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna finish off the rest,\" Triana said, scooping it out into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not ... full already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always room for ice cream,\" Triana said cheerfully.  \"Especially this kind.  God, I haven't had this in<i> forever!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrpheus nodded with a strangely fixed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oogh,\" Triana moaned, lying back and putting one hand on her stomach.  \"That stuff is... rich, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrpheus looked like he wanted to say something, but refrained, and Triana was too crammed to pursue it.  Who knew a little milk and ice and chocolate could be so <i>filling?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she was in her civvies -- a pink sweatsuit -- she felt considerably better about things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this wasn't a sentence after all.  Maybe it was more like... a vacation.

Her leg felt much improved, but it was still far too soon to go jogging.   Nevertheless, a week of lying around doing nothing much more than eating had made her antsy.  She needed to get <i>some</i> kind of training in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking, she drew the long throwing knife from the leg of her swimsuit and flung it.  The dual <i>thunk-thud</i> as it hit one of the neighbor's apples and knocked it to the ground was very satisfying.  At least she still had her aim.  With two more quick flicks of her wrist, she knocked down two more.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect.  I haven't lost my touch</i>.   Unfortunately, just as she finished congratulating herself, she heard another sound.  A hissing sound.  Apparently, the last time she'd shifted her position on the raft, one of the hidden knives had punctured it.<br>\r\nShe tried to the paddle to the side, but her ribs hurt if she leaned too far; she wasn't going to make it.   Within a few second, her butt dipped under the surface.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have sprung for heated pool,\" she muttered, standing up to her shoulders in chilly water.   She hadn't really intended to go <i>in</i> it.  Molotov was more of a floater than a swimmer; if you were in the water, you hadn't planned a good enough escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortably, she heaved herself up onto the pink tile, feeling stabs of pain in her sore muscles.  She got to her feet with the aid of one of the deck chairs and limped stiffly into the house.  <i>Stupid, stupid idea.  What if I'd been over the deep end?</i>   Now that would have been an embarrassing way to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in the foyer and checked herself over in the mirrored doors, just in case any gaping wounds had reopened.  Nope -- she looked good.  Healthy.   Even a little bit... <i>\"robust\"</i>.   All those calories she'd been scarfing down hadn't just been vanishing into thin air, apparently.   She smoothed the black fabric of her bathing suit over the slight curve of her stomach.   It really wasn't much, but she'd never been even a <i>little</i> pudgy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolotov shrugged.  Oh well; it was nothing to worry over.  The fact that five or ten pounds overweight was literally the fattest she'd ever been was proof enough that her lifestyle would melt the chub off her frame soon enough, once she had her old life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping off the wet suit and leaving it in a sodden heap on the marble floor -- and the bandolier of knives on the hall table -- she retired to her bed to spend the next few hours practicing her aim in a different way: catching bonbons in her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please follow the below guidelines, and make your entries at least a few paragraphs, and I'll try to add new chapters when I can as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please keep things grounded in reality as it exists in the Ventureverse -- rapid weight gain or inhuman levels of consumption should only occur if there's an explanation such as superscience, superpowers, magic, etc.  <br>\r\n- Avoid scat, vore, exploding, children (in a fetish context), non-food/drink-related inflation, character death, or excessive slobbiness -- mild slobbiness is okay.<br>\r\n- Leavening the sexy bits with plot and character development is highly encouraged! Making it more than \"she ate, then she got fatter, then she ate, then she got fatter\" is how stories stay interesting.<br>\r\n- Try your best to use good grammar, spelling, and punctuation. I'll do my best to catch and fix mistakes (both mine and others'.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tend to not like supersize/immobility or male WG, and likely won't be adding to anything going in those directions.  One more important note: as of this writing, there have been four seasons of The Venture Bros., and because the status quo of the show continually changes, it's pretty much inevitable that there will be spoilers.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun, and if you enjoy this one, please check out my other stories and chapters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
