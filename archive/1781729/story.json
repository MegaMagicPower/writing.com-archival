Amongst the walls were several tapestries that depicted several dragon pokemon on them. With his legs lifted up, Don Tanner slammed his fee onto the desk he was seated behind, \u201cMan, dad, you certainly had a comfy job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, the Dragonair Moemon smirked as he lifted up a small map in front of him \u2013 On the map was what appeared to be an island that had several buildings on it \u2013 A large main building with a track and several sport fields around it. A few miles from that, there was a pair of buildings that were marked on the map as \u2018Dorms\u2019. There were also several other facilities on the island, but before Don Tanner could read them all, he immediately tossed the map to the side, \u201cAlright, I may have inherited the principal position from my father here at St. Gijinka Academy, but its not like this is a cushy job\u2026 Still beats hanging around that dusty old mansion of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick gaze to the desk, Don Tanner sighed at the sight of the tall mountain of papers that sat on it. \u201cAlthough, I do wish I didn\u2019t have to deal with all these student files. But then again as dad said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>\u201cAs principal of this fine school, a principal must know all of his students who are under him.</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan dad, you had some harsh life rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Don Tanner lifted up one of the papers up and began to read the profiles on his students and\u2026 Teachers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Student No. 1 </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Midnight<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nMoemon: Mightyena<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nClass: Junior<br>\r\nDescription: A dark haired beauty of a woman with a dynamite, tan body with curves in all the right places (although she thinks she can do better with her figure), usually dresses in a black leather jacket, cut off jean shorts and a silver belly shirt, pushing the academy dress code.<br>\r\nPersonality: The so-called leader of this party, she\u2019s quite prideful and has an overbearing ego. She has a quick temper when it comes to dealing with one of her other teammates (but has a secret affinity to sweets).<br>\r\nExtra: Loves chocolate (but doesn\u2019t like to broadcast that fact), was also held back two years for playing hooky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Student No. 2</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alison (Nickname Ali)<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nMoemon: Quilava <br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nClass: Freshman<br>\r\nDescription: A small, petite girl (so much that she often gets confused that she\u2019s a little girl) with short red and black hair with a cute face. Over her petite body is a yellow and black hoodie and a red skirt. <br>\r\nPersonality: A hot headed girl who often bumps heads with Midnight over random crap. She often falls prey to cute guys and whatever tricks they have up their sleeves. Has a vulgar tongue to her.<br>\r\nExtra: She\u2019s really envious of other girls\u2019 figures that are better than hers, and seems to have a crush on the local Riolu delinquent leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Student No. 3</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fontina <br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nMoemon: Vaporeon <br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nClass: Senior <br>\r\nDescription: A shy cute girl with short blue hair (with a few fin-like bangs) who dresses in a white blouse and a long blue skirt. She has the best figure out of the three girls on this team, and is often shy about people talking about her curvy figure.<br>\r\nPersonality: A voice of reason in this School, although, she often has her words of wisdom ignored most people until she actually makes her point. Loves to read and often gets too deep in her books to realize what\u2019s happening around her.<br>\r\nExtra: She used to be a petite Eevee Moemon in her freshman year, but thanks to the school\u2019s cafeteria food and her studying habits, she developed her figure (and it grew worse when she turned into a Vaporeon Moemon). She\u2019s currently on a diet. President of the book club and Librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner pulled the papers away with a raised eyebrow, \u201cThese profiles\u2026 They read like some bad Fanfiction writer wrote them\u2026 They sound like the personal ads. I suppose I should look at the other profiles as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen only whispers could echo through the dark, allowing the sleeping form to slowly doze back into her sleep\u2026 At least until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY CRAP! NINE IN THE FREAKING MORNING!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was the last straw that broke the Camerupt\u2019s back, and opening her yellow eyes, the sleeping form immediately lifted her head up from her pillow. And while she was annoyed with the fact that her sleep was broken, she couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the sight of the young Quilava Moemon roommate dashing around, trying to get ready while tripping over herself, all the while the busty Vaporeon Moemon was trying to calm down the younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Nothing like a fun little show to wake up to in the morning.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m really sorry for not waking you up sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool! But if you ever let me sleep in that late again, I\u2019ll pop your bubble boobies with a fork.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the door to the dorm room closed shut, allowing the Vaporeon Moemon sigh slightly. \u201cI can remember when I was a freshman\u2026 I always thought I\u2019d be late\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also used to be able to see your feet too, Fontina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy Vaporeon Moemon \u2013 Fontina turned around towards one of the beds to see that her third and final roommate was finally awake\u2026 \u201cG-Good morning to you as well, Midnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in question merely sat atop of her bed\u2019s covers, stretching her arms over head, in an attempt to showcase her curves \u2013 She may not have been as curvaceous as Fontina was, but she was no slouch with her perky breasts and toned behind. They were easily seen since she was dressed in only a black wife beater that was two sizes too small for her slightly hourglass figure and a pair of black panties. Her long black hair was a little messy due to the fact that she had just woken up and had a little case of bed-head, but the strands were kept out of her beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Midnight slowly pushed herself from the bed, the mocha skinned beauty stood in front of Fontina, secretly making a comparison between herself and the Vaporeon Moemon. \u201cYeah, yeah\u2026 So, the little runt\u2019s late for her first class huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I believe it was b-b-because you kept egging her on to play those vi-video games last night,\u201d Fontina countered as she pushed up her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you wanted me to be friendly to her,\u201d Midnight replied as she slowly walked over to the bathroom. \u201cNot my fault she\u2019s a sore loser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that you\u2019re late too,\u201d Fontina answered back, sighing as she rubbed her slightly softened stomach. \u201cAnd here I was hoping that we all could get breakfast early today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d Midnight retorted as she grabbed her usually toiletries \u2013 Some (somewhat) clean clothes, a towel, and her favorite shampoo. \u201cYa know I don\u2019t like eating breakfast, Fontina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m sure my sister would\u2019ve made some other food for you,\u201d Fontina pointed out, grimacing as she rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, you said your big sis was working here now,\u201d Midnight mumbled slightly as she headed for the door. \u201cOh well, maybe you and I could get something after I take a quick shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you have classes?\u201d Fontina questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkipping a class never hurt anyone,\u201d Midnight replied as she closed the door to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately closing the door to the bathroom, Midnight was unable to hear Fontina mumble, \u201cBut skipping is what got you held back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Midnight to peal off the panties and top she was using as pajamas, and she hopped into the shower, immediately allowing the warm water to wash over her chocolate colored body and pitch-black hair. \u201cAhh\u2026 A show and a shower, the perfect opening for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the body wash that Fontina left in the shower, Midnight rubbed the sweet smelling hygiene product over her body. In order to keep up her beautiful, yet tough image, she had to smell good\u2026 And smelling like cherry blossoms seemed to work. However as Midnight\u2019s hands rubbed onto her normally well toned stomach, she stopped and realized something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could pinch some of herself. \u2018<i>Great\u2026 I gotta lay off those late night chocolate binges\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting it out of her mind, Midnight continued her warm (if not seductive) shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes later that Midnight opened the door to the bathroom \u2013 Now dressed in her usual attire of a silver belly shirt that showed off a decent amount of cleavage and midriff, a black leather jacket (that had seen better days) and a pair of jean shorts that showed off her toned, trim legs. As she looked around the room, Midnight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...saw absolutely nothing to do of even the slightest remote interest to occupy herself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" she groaned; now that she was up and about in clean clothing, there really wasn't a reason <i>not</i> to go to class- or at least get out of the dorm. She'd been going here for a full four years now (running on her fifth), in that time period Midnight had done absolutely everything a Bad Girl could possibly want to do in a hoity-toity academy such as the one she currently attended. Her teachers recommended that she study and keep her mind at work, when they weren't threatening her with expulsion, and some classmates suggested getting a hobby. But those things weren't really for Midnight. She had never studied once a day in her life, and she was always way too cool for making stupid... model airplanes or whatever hobbies were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo; back in Hoenn, where she and her parents used to live before moving to Johto, she studied the wild unpredictable forests, her hobby was intimidating all the other kids on the block. At age 8, she had beat up this Zigzagoon kid, and when she got her older brother he just whooped his butt too! After the move, Midnight noticeably calmed down; no longer a simple Wild Girl, Midnight's divulging into Johto's cozy mix of metropolitan and oriental culture had exposed her to the finer things in life. While she didn't really care for much of them, it at least gave her some class and structure. Instead of modelling herself after the brutal Magma tribes in Hoenn's past, the then young Poocheyena moemon came to emulate the rougher city girls that she had been exposed to in her habitation in Goldenrod. Of course, this was where she would meet Fontina and later Ali; but that's a story for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Midnight was stuck with the simple options of either: run the course of the campus (again), or actually show up to her second period. She checked the wall clock. Damn, it was already 9:35! She really had to stop taking such long showers! \"Weeellll, since I'm already late,\" the Mighteyena moemon said slyly as a toothy grin spread itself across her sharp features, \"And I'm really not into breakfast...\" she said deviously aloud to herself as she started for the doorway, \"I guess I'll just have to pop on by the campus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Midnight whipped the door open and allowed the bright sunny air to pour itself onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSt. Gijinka Academy. It was, even the socially undercultured Midnight had to agree, beautiful. From their high dorm in Building D, anyone on the 12th floor could see rows of eleven windows shooting downwards towards the tan pueblos of St. Gijinka. As Midnight gripped onto the safety railing that guarded most moemon from a damningly doomed fall, she picked one foot up and rested it on the thick black metal. Holding onto the vertical pole that supported it, she used the fence as support to pick up her other leg so that she may stand bravely at the face of the educational abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep inhale, and relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the sort of strength that only Hoenn girls could even hope to have, Midnight kicked off with a mighty strut of her misguidingly underplayed legs. For a full three seconds, Midnight is airborne before landing on a balcony four stories lower on Building E. She grips onto the pole and eases slowly down before reaching a distance safe enough to fall onto the much smaller Building A, which stands base to Building E. She lands on her feet, catching herself with the tips of her fingers, and lets out a grunt. \"Oh man, that was rough.\" she said with mild agitation, several popping sounds heard as her knees ached. \"I gotta remember to dig up those Yoga tapes so I don't break something one day.\" she said to herself before getting a running start into another Hail-Mary jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she landed on an awning, more specifically the one belonging to the Bad Luck Shop. \"Huh, its a Unovian restaurant now.\" Midnight said with mild amusement, \"Last month it was a bookstore.\" As much as she was \"not into breakfast\", a low rumble escaped Midnight's tummy. \"What's that tummy?\" she asked playfully, \"You're hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes before scanning the visible horizon, \"Well... I don't really see anything. At least anything that doesn't taste like crap.\" she spat unto the marketplace. For the last couple of years, in addition to her lackluster attendance record, Midnight had really become a restaurant aficionado when it came to the little Mom 'n' Pop stores around the academy. Not even the Sheer Cold Creamery, a place that had led to a few pounds and inches during her freshman year, could really satisfy her hunger anymore. It was all too familiar, too simple. Even the Bad Luck Shop's constantly changing motif did little to satisfy her. Even if it was good, the business would just fail in a month or two anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother low rumble. \"Oh quiet you.\" Midnight barked as she looked peevishly into the city, \"Now there's got to be something out here to do besides... ugh, school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from her position on top of the Bad Luck Shop, Midnight hopped up onto the main building and climbed onto the neighboring florist. Turning left, she jumped atop the comic book shop and turning back to her right from there landed her atop the Bellsprout Boudoir. From an elevated position, Midnight could make out La tienda de la Casa del Agua , a nice little place run by a Ludicolo Moemon and his wife. But that was really more for groceries. There were little novelty stands, but Midnight had lived here too long to be amused by those little tourist gags. Fruit Stands? Ew. Cliched.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, hey! There, off in the distance, was something new and shiny! Jumping from there, Midnight landed on a clothesline, caught herself with the tips of her fingers, and let herself go abruptly onto the street. \"Hey!\" she shouted at the bulky Vigoroth moemon handling said novel attraction, \"What'cha got there?\" An innocent question enough, but almost everything sounded flirty with Midnight. It couldn't be helped. \"Oh, well my boys and I got these here vending machines from the Boss.\" he said, sounding rather proud of his overall lifting ability, \"Mr. Sunny told me to get 'em down here in the busy streets where people could see 'em, lifted this one here all by myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vigoroth moemon held up an index finger, bent down, and connected the wire from the machine to the one out of Portabello Parasect Pizza Parlor, and emerged. Immediately, the machine came to life with lights and colors. Midnight's mouth started to water as her tummy began to growl. \"I take it that it works now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I gotta load up the stuff inside, but gimme about thirty minutes an' I'll have this puppy up an' running.\"</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, what the Mightyena saw wasn\u2019t the cheapest of foods, the kind that you\u2019d expect to see in a vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub Sweets\u2019 Chocolate creamed and iced donuts, half gallon bottles of Krooko-aid (in its many flavors), Vileplume Farms\u2019 fresh fruit, there was even Beartic Ice Cream bars (those were being put in first). Most of these brand names were known to be extremely expensive, and yet here they were, being put in a vending machine by this husky Vigoroth. If the school was putting them in a vending machine, then the prices were sure to be not so outrageous\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gggrrgle* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hand placed on her toned (if not empty) stomach, Midnight scrunched her face up in annoyance, as she had told herself before, she was not a breakfast person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a snack person\u2026 Especially when there were chocolate filled, chocolate covered, chocolate chipped, or any thing that was mixed in with chocolate\u2026 Now that was another story. So a small plan began to form itself inside Midnight\u2019s devious mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how long have you been working on this sort of stuff?\u201d Midnight asked as she sauntered a little closer towards the Vigoroth, making sure to sway her jean short covered hips just a little more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the Vigoroth as he almost stumbled in putting in a few of the donuts into the machine. \u201cO-Oh, not too long miss, we were commissioned to do this early this morning and get it done while the freshmen were at their orientation and the other students were in their first class\u2026 Speaking of, aren\u2019t you supposed to be in one of those classes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don\u2019t you worry about little young me,\u201d Midnight cooed as she ran a finger on one of the boxes. \u201cYou don\u2019t like having to talk to a fine young girl like me, now don\u2019cha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of the larger Moemon was now a bright cherry red, and yet he just continued on his work, trying to get his mind off of the flirty attempts by this mocha skinned vixen. \u201cW-Well\u2026 I have to get this done r-real soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, too bad,\u201d Midnight pouted with large puppy dog eyes as she leaned forward, trying to show a healthier dose of cleavage to the older Moemon. \u201cI had so hoped to talk to such a strong, strapping Vigoroth\u2026 Oh well, can I at least ask for one little, teeny, tiny favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, s-sure,\u201d The Vigoroth gulped, and his brow began to get covered with sweat especially when Midnight began to trot her fingers over his large bicep. \u201cW-What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight if I have just a small sample of these fine wares?\u201d Midnight asked innocently enough, getting closer and closer towards the Vigoroth\u2019s body. \u201cI mean, a guy as sweet as you could spare a couple of chocolate donuts\u2026 Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, w-well,\u201d The Vigoroth stammered as his eyes began to roll into the back of his head, the excitement starting to overtake his nervous system. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What sort of evil deeds are going on here?\u201d A rather gruff and heroic voice sounded through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Midnight and Vigoroth turned to where the voice originated and they were both struck dumb at the sight before them. For in front of them was a familiar red golf-cart (that had Mr. Sunny written on the side of it), but what drew their eyes was the figure that stood atop of the golf cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a messy red and black baseball jersey, black pants and a red shirt stood tall a muscular Arcanine with his wild blonde hair billowing past his broad shoulders. If it was for the fact that he had a large goofy grin on his scarred face, his dramatic pose would\u2019ve given him the appearance of a dashing young hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Damn it, its Vayne</i>,\u2019 Midnight sighed as she slowly inched away from an awestruck Vigoroth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine known as Vayne leapt from the golf-cart and landed effortlessly on the ground before the other two Moemon, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cAh, if it isn\u2019t madame Midnight! Up to your lustful tricks this morning again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadame?!\u201d Midnight snarled as she leered daggers at the oblivious Arcanine Moemon. \u201cDo I look like an old lady?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo me you are almost as such,\u201d Vayne chuckled with a shake of his head. \u201cBut it is my way of showing respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well it sucks,\u201d Midnight growled in return. \u201cNow what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vigoroth Moemon blinked a few times at the two canine moemons\u2019 little squabble and slowly began to get back to work. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"As this academy's protector,\" Vayne began, with his usual fervor in long drawn-out speeches about morality and whatnot, as he started towards the slinking evil that was his nemesis, \"The joyful burden of guarding my precious Alma Mater from the wicked deeds of seductive harlots and the rest of your ilk is rested solely upon my shoulders and mine alone.\" he said in a dramatized, deep rendition of his usual voice. \"For my heart burns with the fiery passion of a protectors, one that melts the evil away from those that I care for and scorches only the deserving; I am-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just freaking enough, okay?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight, while passionate and protective in her own rights, was far from patient and understanding. This, on top of being painted on the darker side of things and her leaning towards manipulation, was what actually led to the dispute in question in the first place. Sure, when one looked abstractly, the two would make a great pair: both had great physical strength and almost completely forewent their individual elemental prowess, both were loud and older than most students. But, when it came down to it, Vayne was just so damn annoying that anything that came out of his mouth seemed to grate on a certain Mightyena moemon's nerves. \"You've been playing Superhero since Freshman year, Vayne!\" Midnight shouted wildly, \"Can it with the whole \"protector\" crap and get a life! Maybe a girlfriend or something, seriously, pick up a hobby!\" Of course, she failed to recognize the hypocrisy in her arbitration; as she'd been playing \"bad girl\" for quite some time too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, wench!\" Vayne exclaimed, still posing in a way that deserved a thick outline and a cape even as he defended his standpoint, \"I will not stand by and let you make a mockery out of the Academy's simple stockmen!\" the Arcanine Avenger declared as he rushed Midnight. His wide bulk, as proven several times, kept a good bit of his opponent's immediate escape room occupied. However, again like so many times before, Midnight's agile reflexes and strong leg muscles provided her with more than enough physical strength to propel herself above the would-be hero via frontflip; putting her in front of the vending machine and behind the pituitary case of a Vigoroth, who seemed to be simply ignoring the scuffle at hand and right back at work peacefully. \"You're getting stale, Slugger!\" Midnight taunted as she turned around, \"Or maybe you're just losing interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne fumed, his long platinum hair waving cautious flows towards Midnight as the Legendary Moemon activated his signature move: \"Extremespeed!\" he shouted, instantly vanishing in a flashstep so fast that you could <i>not</i> blink and miss it. Midnight looked around for any sign of distortion, anything that might give away his current plan of attack. To the left; nothing. The right? Nothing. Even the ever-predictable above tactic didn't seem to be useful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of anticipation led Midnight to guard her ankles! She did another flip from her standing position, feeling quite cocky in her abilities to defend herself from anklebiting scum like Vayne... when she felt an intense burst of air knock her face-first into the ground. Aerial strike, well played. And, with the added pressure of Vayne's muscley build on top of her, Midnight was all but bested. \"Huh.\" she rasped, \"Nice one, Hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this whole thing was about me not <i>paying</i> for my snacks?!\" Midnight barked as she sat hogtied in Vayne's Golf Mobile, hopping up and down furiously as Vayne's heroic smile gleamed stereotypically in the sunlight. \"Absolutely.\" he said deeply as he continued to steer his golf cart down the streets of the city surrounding his academy, \"So long as you start paying for your snack foods and other yummies, there will be no hard feelings between us on this matter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why hogtie me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that I may bring you to another, untainted snack treat vendor without fear of retribution.\" he said happily, \"I shall untie you when we arrive at a suitable location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I will promptly punch you in the face.\"</span></div></div>",

Heck, the next working vending machine was practically around the corner (which was both convenient and somewhat weird). The virtuous Arcanine laughed loudly as he stepped from the cart\u2019s driver seat and proceeded to head over to Midnight so he could untie her. \u201cAnd here we are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 You had to tie me up just to take me here?!\u201d Midnight growled with a blood vessel appearing on the side of her head. Midnight easily recognized this place, it was practically right next to her favorite clothing store that had her favorite, cheap black leathered jackets. They were parked a few feet from the corner, but the machine was still in sight as it leaned up against the building. \u201cWe could\u2019ve walked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd would you have walked if I told you?\u201d Vayne countered as he slowly began to undo the knots of the rope he had wrapped around the mocha skinned Mightyena. However, as he continued to untie, the Arcanine Avenger didn\u2019t show any hesitation from Midnight\u2019s earlier threat to pop him one in the kisser. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Besides, I couldn\u2019t help but stop evil in its place and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKER-RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne\u2019s and Midnight\u2019s ears perked up when the sound of glass shattering, and it was rather close by too boot. Vayne turned his head to the side and looked at the vending machine to see that there was a large amount of glass and a brick laying before the machine. \u201cFiends! Not even the first day has passed and already two evildoers are trying to ruin the brand new machines on our island!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is unacceptable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d Midnight barked as she wiggled about, partially to get free from her binds and the rest to get Vayne\u2019s attention. \u201cYou stupid mutt! Get your mind off of your damn justice for thirty seconds and untie me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty seconds later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight grumbled as she rubbed the skin where the ropes had caused some minor friction burns, Vayne however was tossing the rope into the back of the golf cart and crossed his arms. \u201cThere, now can I please continue on the path of justice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more thing\u2026\u201d Midnight stated as she stomped up to the Arcanine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s fist collided with Vayne\u2019s right cheek, making the young hero turn his head upon impact\u2026 But other than that, there seemed to be no damage to the Arcanine\u2019s face! In fact, while it took a few seconds, but then Midnight\u2019s eyes grew wide and she pulled her fist back. Her fist was red and was burning with pain, \u201cSONVABITCH! What the hell is your face made of?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken worse hits right here,\u201d Vayne answered as he patted his freshly punched face, although, there wasn\u2019t a bruise or even a red patch on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a technique that martial artists used on their arms by bashing rocks on their arms and sides of their arms. It\u2019s to build up calcium deposits in a person\u2019s skin, so it becomes as hard as rock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since I\u2019ve been hit there so many times, I\u2019ve developed a large amount of calcium in my face\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re a literal rock head?!\u201d Midnight hissed loudly as she waved her hand a few times trying to shake away the pain. \u201cYeesh! You keep getting weirder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, my sassy sidekick!\u201d Vayne laughed chuckled as he began to head towards the vending machine. \u201cThere\u2019s evil afoot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell told you I was your sidekick!!?!\u201d Midnight practically roared as she chased after Vayne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the two didn\u2019t have to go too far to see the damage that was done to the vending machine, and it wasn\u2019t that hard to figure out what had happened. Someone threw a brick at the glassed vending machine, and had made off with quite a number of snacks and drinks from inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne surveyed the scene with his hand at his chin, \u201cHmm, this machine\u2026 Was murdered!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?!\u201d Midnight scowled. \u201cOf all the stupidest things to say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in a sense it was murdered,\u201d Vayne stated with a shrug of his shoulders. \u201cIt was struck in the face with a  brick and had its\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust forget it,\u201d Midnight growled with her tongue sticking out. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of dealing with your crap! Every moment that I\u2019ve had to deal with you, everything\u2019s gone south and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a finger was placed on Midnight\u2019s lips, courtesy of Vayne. With his other hand, the Arcanine pointed a few yards away towards a table that was partially hidden from view from a few of the nearby shrubs and trees. Seated at the table (which was loaded with the brim with snacks and drinks that were obviously from the vending machine) sat a particularly weird looking Moemon. The Moemon in question was dressed in a tan-yellow hooded jacket with a lined black shirt that was ripped at the neck and over the stomach. The most eyecatching about this Moemon was the fact that her head only had red hair on one half of her head, and that hair was combed down on the right side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis punk-like Moemon was currently munching on some of the pilfered food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Vayne quickly smirked at, \u201cAh, evildoers certainly are lazy now-a-days\u2026 Come Merciless Mightyena! We must stop evil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Who the hell came up with that name?\u201d Midnight growled as she watched Vayne dash forward. Now, part of her wanted to walk away and let Vayne make a hero (ass) out of himself, but another part wanted to watch how this turns out\u2026 And heck, maybe she could sneak a few snacks away from that thief that Vayne would obviously distract\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices, choices\u2026 So many choices. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the form of a deep sigh, her choice was made clear. While it would have been oodles of fun to just sit back and let what is be, Midnight just simply couldn't stand back and let a freak like Vayne endanger the sanity of yet another honest student here at the academy... even if it was Eldreich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them never really got along well, from the very start Eldreich thought herself the superior tough chick of the academy due to her schoolyard days filled with brawls with the toughest Unovian students at her disposal. Most of them, admittedly, were pretty scary individuals. Having grown up and attended school on Unova Route 4, located in a harsh desert, she was subject to the company of the Sandile evolutionary chain. She would eventually learn how to fight and proceed to whoop every one of their butts up until Grade 8. Of course, the only reason Midnight knew this was due to the fact that Eldreich never freakin' shut up about herself. Always so egotistical and arrogant in her abilities... it probably reminded her a little too much of herself, actually. Anyway she decided that, for once, she would be the bigger moemon and step inbetween her sworn rival and just another annoyance. Whichever of the two fits to what category we'll leave up to third-party decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that didn't mean that she'd back off and deny Vayne his entertainment. Or hers. Watching Vayne preach about morality and whatnot was so hilarious it was almost cute. He had morals. Ha, that's gut-busting. Anyway, Vayne decided to take her vague sighing as a green light that she would be coming with; his ambush on slithering, crafty Eldreich would be all the more fulfilling now that one of her ilk had turned against her! \"Come Merciless, we have justice to spread!\" he shouted loudly, much to said sidekick's dismay. \"Yeah, sure, whatever. \" she said boredly, crossing her arms and plodding slowly forward, \"Just make with the super-hero jazz so I can hurry up and grab a bite. I'm starved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne's toothy smile did little to encourage her. \"No worries, this delinquent is simply on the wrong side of justice.\" he said valiantly, \"Why, if even you can be converted to the cause, then what's to say that she can't also?\" Midnight ignored the urge to drop kick that smarmy grin off of his face, fighting it as she had him just a few minutes ago. \"Whatever.\" she said indignantly. \"Quite whatever indeed!\" Vayne repeated vigorously as he made a dash for the still obliviously dining Eldreich. \"Hey, wait up!\" Midnight hollered after him, \"I don't wanna miss this!\" But of course the thick-headed moemon was too far gone in his drive for justice to really take into account anything that Midnight was saying. The petty justice that needed serving was afoot, about slathered all over Eldreich and her illegally gotten goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in front of the table, Vayne pointed strongly in the direction of the Scrafty moemon's post-breakfast pilfer. \"You, vile woman, are in desperate need of some discipline!\" he said heartily, \"Now stand so that I may deliver said discipline without the guilt of striking an unready opponent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the \"bad kids\" that took residence in St. Gijinka's, Eldreich was one of the many who refused to play along with Vayne's superhero style of life. Sure there were a few who loved to humor him, namely Midnight, but the majority just wished that he would lay off of their faces and let them be. Of course he wouldn't. That was a lesson that most of them learned the hard way. \"Go away Kibbles.\" Eldreich said through a mouthful of masticated doughnut mush, \"I'm eating.\" Vayne, slightly taken aback by her utter refusal to play along, simply reiterated his presence. \"I-I see that!\" he wavered, \"And your consumption of those illgotten goods is precisely why I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not gonna get up.\" Eldreich said boredly, swallowing her mouthful before taking another big bite, \"So just get about your way and leave a girl alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne had actually never encountered this situation before. He never imagined that a ne'erdowell would refuse to rise in order to defend his or her point! And, he couldn't very well strike an opponent that wasn't properly prepared for battle... \"Aha!\" he shouted vigorously, \"How would you feel, if-if I told you that I had recruited your ringleader to my side of the battle!\" the Arcanine moemon reached behind him and pulled Midnight into the ring, much to her shock. \"Haha! Truly you feel on equal terms with your old friendly rival?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight?\" Eldreich asked in a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mightyena moemon blushed profusely and ushered the loudmouthed moemon away. \"Look Vayne, why don't you... um... go polish your goody two-shoes or something while I... uh, deal with Eldreich here.\" she said angrily. \"Oh, of course my sidekick!\" Vayne's deluded sense of reality kept him going strong even as Midnight turned it against him in an attempt to save face. \"I believe you have my cell phone number, if there's any difficulty find the time to call me so that I may swoop in valiantly and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, swoop. Got it.\" Midnight said frantically as she pushed him back into his cart, \"Don't forget to drive off a cliff, alright?\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"So, you and Vayne, huh?\" Eldreich said, her voice high and nasal. It grated on Midnight's last ever-loving nerve every time she opened her mouth. It only hurt worse when it was something derogatory. \"Oooh, how juicy.\" she said, biting ravenously into a half-melted prepackaged ice-cream cone. \"But ew, how gross. I mean he's just so... freaky!\" she went on, \"Like there's something wrong with his brain or something.\" Midnight just waited her out, she couldn't go on forever. Her grimacing face and short sentences sold her actual lack of interest in the topic at hand. She was really just in it to bug Midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" she finally asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldreich nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Midnight said curtly, \"First, no, we're not dating. Second, we're not dating. Third, we will <i>never</i> be dating.\" Midnight barked, struggling to keep her eyes on the awkward lizard moemon sitting in front of her, \"I don't know why you would ever pair me and that depraved lunatic together, but you need to stop it. Right now. I mean it, Eldreich. Right now.\" The Scrafty moemon rolled her golden brown eyes, \"Sh'yeah, whatever.\" she said dismissively, \"You want in on some of these things? I'm suuuuch a chocoholic right now.\" she said dreamily, \"Couldn't afford to use those expensive-ass machines, so I broke one... they won't miss just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've forgotten what a weird little person you are.\"</span></div></div>",

She wouldn\u2019t admit it, especially to Eldreich, but the mocha skinned Mightyena was as much as a chocoholic as the Scrafty girl herself claimed herself to be. Maybe even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Midnight did know the effects of what this vice could do to a dynamite body like Midnight\u2019s, so she couldn\u2019t splurge like Eldreich was doing right now. The growing mountain of empty wrappers on the other side of the table was a testament to how much the Scrafty Moemon was putting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Damn, it was only a few minutes since she broke into that vending machine</i>,\u2019 Midnight thought to herself as she pulled one of the packages of chocolate cream donuts from the shrinking pile of pilfered food. \u2018<i>Where the heck is she putting it all.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little curious, Midnight leaned over slightly to get a better look at Eldreich and her eyes widened ever so slightly \u2013 around the usually trim, punk moemon\u2019s waist was a layer of pudge! Nothing too big, but it was definitely noticeable since the Scrafty Moemon was wearing a shirt that showed off that pot belly in the making. Heck, Edlreich looked a little thicker everywhere! It was definitely showing too since she seemed to wear that orange hoodie every day and it was a little tighter on her frame than what Midnight, there was even the beginnings of a muffin top that oozed out from the top of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Eldreich growled through a mouthful of purloined (ha ha! Loined) donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing,\u201d Midnight muttered out loud as she pulled back and ripped open the package. \u201cJust seeing what you had in your pile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Eldreich grumbled loudly before she swallowed and reached for another one of the packaged foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh Eldreich, you\u2019re really putting those away, haven\u2019t you eaten over the summer?\u201d Midnight pointed out before she tossed a donut into her mouth and began to chew on it\u2026 Taking a few moments to savor the amazing taste of the artificial sugar and cream that almost exploded in her mouth. <i>\u2018At least she\u2019s got good taste, this stuff\u2019s freakin\u2019 amazing!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, as subtle as usual,\u201d Eldreich snarled loudly with her death glare aimed at Midnight. \u201cBut whatever, a little splurging here and there won\u2019t kill me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u2018No, but I\u2019ll make you explode out of your clothes,</i>\u2019 Midnight snickered in her head as she started on the second donut from the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 \u2018sides, I got a taste of these things over the summer,\u201d Eldreich admitted through a mouthful of chocolate cornet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme guess, another one from your \u2018<span class=\"corange\">free samples\u2019</span>?\u201d Midnight questioned, subconsciously pulling out a second package of said free samples from the pile, having already finish the first package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get the wrong idea,\u201d Eldreich spat back, waving one of the unopened packages at the Mightyena Moemon who was sitting across from her. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of sweets, I just wanted to shut up a lousy whiny brat of a Snivy who\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight sighed as she drowned out the rest of Eldreich\u2019s story. But from what she could tell, some Snivy Moemon had been bragging around Eldreich, annoying her to no end and as a way to shut her up, Eldreich snatched up the Snivy girl\u2019s snack that was the same brand as the snacks that the two were eating right now. It was a little childish, but then again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s ears perked up when that sudden shout caught her attention, making her gulp down the food that she had in her mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for eating the rest of my breakfast,\u201d Eldreich spat with sarcasm dripping from her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight blinked a few times, at the table before her\u2026 And realized that the large pile of snacks that the Scrafty Moemon she was sitting with had taken was now only a pile of empty wrappers that had the creamy and chocolate stains of some sort of snack food massacre. And the culprits were none other than the two girls seated at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking some chocolate that had managed to escape from her lips, Midnight gulped down and waved her hand, \u201cDamn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Eldreich sighed as she spun around. \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At an obtuse angle, her back leaning hard against the back of the chair, Midnight had to struggle for comfort. Her stomach bloated pushed outwards slightly as the food inside slowly churned and digested- probably adding an inch and a pound here and there knowing her luck. While it was certainly a consolation that she wouldn't end up quite the edging porker that Eldreich showed the potential to be, she certainly didn't want to get to a point where she had to console herself with \"at least I'm not as heavy as her\". That just wasn't her style. Thankfully though, one little slip wouldn't put Midnight in that position; thus meaning that this groaning tummy of hers could easily be worked off with a quick lap of the island... or two, judging by the strain on her shorts' button. As she forced herself into a recline, her callused (though perfectly manicured) hands traveled to the convex of her belly- instinctively rubbing the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I am stuffed.\" she said remorsefully, giving her midsection a light slap, \"I don't think I've ever eaten that much crap in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the table, Eldreich didn't share quite the same sentiment. As evidenced by her ability to move with relative ease within her seat (give or take a few grunts) underneath Eldreich's slight paunch belied a belly aching to be stuffed silly. Apparently, an entire mountain of junkfood just wasn't enough for the starving Scrafty girl; the hungry glimmering in her golden eyes was all the tell that Midnight needed to see that Eldreich had been quite busy indulging herself over the Summer. \"Well hi Stuffed. I'm Bored.\" she said sarcastically, bringing up one booted foot to balance on the edge of the table while she lay an arm over the back of her chair and pick at her teeth. \"And frankly Stuffed, I could probably use just a little bit more to eat right about now. Whats say we knock over another one of those rich-kid vendors and resume our breakfast?\" she asked greedily, obviously near salivating at the mere thought of more delicious goodies to stuff her kraut with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight looked down at her for-now partner's blossoming waistline and grimaced, \"Eh, I don't think so Eldreich.\" Midnight said in a wishy-washy tone, \"I mean, I'm pretty full. You sure you wouldn't rather... I don't know, go hit on anything that moves or go hassle a shop keep?\" The sand dweller snorted, a toothy smile (but then, all her expressions seemed to be toothy) creased her thin lips. \"You're so desperate.\" she said in a generous tone, \"But alright, I guess I should be keeping all the sweets I can away from you, huh you Chocolate Spaz?\" Midnight snarled back, a friendly snarl if that was possible, \"Hey, I'm just naming off things that I've seen you do, Eldy.\" she jeered, \"And I'm not a spaz... I'm a recovering Chocoholic thank you very much Ms. Snack Machine Bandit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldreich grinned and turned to her right, \"Yeah, yeah whatever.\" she said dismissively. As she attempted to stand, it was quite obvious to at least Midnight that dear old Eldy might have bitten off a little more than she could chew. Underneath her tattered black top, a belly significantly rounder than it had been before they had met stood out loud and proud as it hung ever so slightly over her tight burgundy perhaps-not-so skinny jeans. All that food was going to go somewhere, apparently, and it would certainly take some time for that belly to deflate back to just plain paunchy. However... she was really in no shape for judgement. Her own stomach, bulging ever so slightly underneath her much more modest silver reflective tube top was probably just as painful as Eldreich's. The light mocha dome sat restlessly atop her perfectly sculpted abdominals, not so much mocking her as much as goading her. Goading her into solitude, so as to wait until it deflated to her normally perfect bod. But that wasn't really an option right now, especially given that the rock-hard midsection she sported would make all those flashy acrobatic moves she performed not even three hours ago all but impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause between the two as Midnight continued to stare down her belly. Seriously; stare down her belly. Her head was almost at a perfect one-eighty degree angle as she craned her neck to glare into the taut tummy of sweets and other sugary spenditude. The Mightyena girl let out a small growl as she contemplated just how round she was when full. It was almost illogical- but then considering that the food <i>had</i> to go somewhere, she wasn't at so much of a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Eldreich said abruptly, tearing the Mightyena girl from her knuckle-whiteningly strong interest in her bloated middle, \"You gonna spend all day staring at your gut or are we gonna go make a ruckus?\" the Scrafty girl said with a hungry look in her golden eyes. Of course she meant exactly what she said; its just that she planned on taking more than a few slaps on the wrist from the few vigilantes that roamed the academy. In that she was probably intently set on looting every shape, form, or state of snack food matter for herself. Her appetite, thanks to these high-class sweets that had so mysteriously been adopted into the Gijinka Academy way of life, she was hopelessly hooked. Or it at least appeared that way. There might be a point of return from here, but this is really a topic for another time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, whatever Chubs.\" Midnight said dismissively, unknowingly upsetting Eldreich's defensive sense of denial. \"And whats that supposed to mean?!\" she asked in an elevated voice, hands balled up beside her waist in anger, \"You're the one with that huge gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but by sundown I'll have it all digested.\" Midnight said mockingly, \"Your summer blubber's apparently grabbed an extended trip and then some.\" she snickered, much to Eldreich's chagrin. \"Whatever, okay!\" she shouted, cheeks growing flushed in anger and embarrassment, \"J-Just what do we do from here?\" she demanded with her usual brand of indignant scrappiness. \"Fine, fine, no need to get so worked up.\" Midnight said knowingly. \"We could always hang out at that hispanic store. The stuff's really cheap there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does price matter if we're going to steal the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Anyway, La Casa is probably our safest bet y'know. The family's all nice and junk, so they won't suspect a thing.\" Midnight said nonchalantly, picking between her sharp teeth for remnants of solid sweets that may have gotten lodged up into her gums. \"Look at you, Ms. Heartless.\" Eldreich said coldly, but not without a sense of pride detectable in her voice, \"Should I tell Vayne that you've been re-assimilated into Ne'redowelldome?\" Eldreich said in a snotty voice. \"Wow, that was a lot of big words for you, Eldy~\" Midnight mocked, finding a bit of taffy, \"I'm really proud of you- Summer School actually did you some good!\" Said lizard-based moemon rolled her eyes, \"Shut up Fuzzy. I don't really wanna go there, their daughter -Miss GoodyTwoShoes Luca- is such a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like Luca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a Ludicolo moemon, how can you hate her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatev.\" Midnight said with a frenchman's wave, jumping to her feet with a bit of difficulty due to her swelling midsection. She noticed with a sort of wicked glee that as Eldreich followed suit, the ring of fat under her shirt's edge jiggled one good time as her feet made impact with the ground. \"I think we should head over to La Casa. What's your big idea Sheds-for-Brains?\" Eldreich thought for a second before a look of realization hit her face, \"We could sneak go see that new Don Walrein film at the Cinema.\" she said with some detectable excitement in her voice. \"You excited about the movie or the popcorn, Chubs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KNOCK IT OFF!\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, with it being the first day of classes and a majority of students in classes, the theatre was practically a ghost town. However, not all the youthful students were in classes - the seniors had the first two periods of class off, those with club activities were doing their best to prepare for the year, and those who were just skipping their classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence why we had the slightly bloated Mightyena bad girl and chubby Scrafty punk girl were walking into the main lobby of the movie theatre. Although, the two of them were currently discussing something of the utmost importance\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever pegged you as a Don Walrein fan,\u201d Midnight snickered with her arms thrown over her head as the two slipped into the lush lobby of the theatre. \u201cAny reason why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m a fan?\u201d Eldreich spat back, walking a little bit faster (although, there were signs that her walk was beginning to look like a waddle with her thighs rubbing against each other in her pants) to get in front of Midnight. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight only shrugged in reply, either Eldreich was truly a fan, or she didn\u2019t want to admit that she was in only for the popcorn\u2026 Then again, popcorn did sound good to the Mightyena girl, and besides, a movie was the perfect way to skip out on the classes that Midnight didn\u2019t really have a care for. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t strike as a fan of his\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Although, taking into account your \u2018enhanced\u2019 figure, it would make sense.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove your tail!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight shook her head and followed the Scrafty girl deeper into the theatre, taking note that Eldreich\u2019s behind was so big that her pants looked to be painted on her tush, and swished left and right with each step that the punk girl took. With a second shake of her head, Midnight reminded herself that she wouldn\u2019t end up like that\u2026 With no self control with what she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>All I have to do is keep up my exercise,\u2019</i> the Mightyena girl thought as she quickly followed her fellow delinquent towards the screens that listed the times of the current movies. \u2018<i>I won\u2019t let myself go like Eld here did.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got about fifteen minutes till the flick starts,\u201d Eldreich grumbled as she fitted her hands into her tight pants\u2019 pockets. \u201cAnd it looks like they stepped up security over the summer\u2026 Cheh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight looked around, and indeed, there were more ushers around than last year \u2013 And they weren\u2019t the geeky Magikarp and lazy Dunsparce Moemon that the Mightyena girl remembered from before the summer. Instead, there were a few Gyarados, Ursaring, and\u2026 Was that an Aggron Moemon?! Yep! And even though they were dressed in those geeky red uniforms, they still looked like they could easily tear the slim (if not sporting a little gut) Mightyena and slightly chubby Scrafty girls in two if they were caught sneaking into the movie theatre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut aside from the staff, it was if the two ditching Moemon girls were the only ones in the theatre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it still too late to hit La Casa?\u201d Midnight muttered out loud with her eyes turning slightly dull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph, go ahead and ditch, mutt,\u201d Eldreich stated as she walked towards the ticket counter. \u201cMore popcorn for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight rolled her eyes, at this point, she was just too tired to really even care to walk the distance to La Casa \u2013 Heck, she was really hating herself for not stealing Vayne\u2019s stolen golf cart earlier, it would\u2019ve made getting around the island easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, a movie with moderate snacks was probably better than having Mexican food for breakfast (or brunch as it were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after getting their tickets (which were actually on discount since they were both students), they were both standing in front of the snack counter where a slightly chubby Flaffy girl getting Eldreich\u2019s order down. \u201cGive me your moviegoer\u2019s special, and go heavy on the extra butter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Moviegoer\u2019s special,\u2019</i> Midnight read in her head. <i>\u2018Extra large tub of popcorn, extra large soda of choice, and two candies of choice\u2026 Damn! I was just kidding about the popcorn, but damn! And its only four dollars?!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Midnight was thinking all of this, the chubby Flaffy girl was quickly getting the order ready (with record time speed) and placed the large order out on the counter in front of her. \u201cEnjoy! Next please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldreich licked her lips slightly as she pulled the snack food away from the counter, trying to make sure she didn\u2019t drop any on the ground. Midnight shrugged her shoulders and turned her attention to the Flaffy counter girl. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just have a small coke and medium popcorn with regular butter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to make both of them a large?\u201d The Flaffy attendant asked with a warm smile on her chubby face. \u201cIt\u2019s only fifty cents more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah I\u2019m\u2026\u201d Midnight started until she heard a little grumble coming from her stomach, which made her narrow her eyes. \u2018What the hell? I just ate a whole bunch of snacks! How the hell am I hungry?!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Are you alright?\u201d The Flaffy attendant asked with a concerned look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, yeah, sure, fine,\u201d Midnight muttered, putting the money she owed on the counter. \u201cJust do whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away!\u201d The Flaffy counter girl answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Midnight was met with a large popcorn and large soda on the counter in front of her, not that she really cared. With a sigh, Midnight began to turn around with the snack foods in her arms, and almost knocked into someone who was standing right behind her. \u201cHey! Watch it\u2026 you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d turn around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight didn\u2019t finish her sentence, cause as soon as she looked at who was in front of her now (although, to be perfectly honest, he was standing behind her, but that was a technicality) she was shocked stunned by the very handsome face that was looking right back at her with bright gold eyes. After a few moments, Midnight stepped back and got a better look at the owner of those golden colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a young man, long black hair that had two tails of black hair styled to fall to his shoulders. His slim body was covered with a blue denim vest, black t-shirt underneath and he had deep navy blue jean shorts wrapped around his slim waist. From the tanned skin and youthful face this handsome young man had, Midnight could only help but blink a few times at him \u2013 Unaware that there was a small streak of crimson dashing her cheeks that she had at the sight of this Riolu Moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man could only shrug his shoulders before he walked past her and began to place an order from the Flaffy girl attendant. Midnight shook her head and slowly walked away from the counter to follow Eldreich into the theatre\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Do you really think its healthy to stuff so much crap in your kraut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldreich let a deep belch rise from her seemingly permanently scowling demure in response, taking time to down another handful of popcorn before answering; \"Nah, its just the butter that'll kill ya. No one ever died from Popcorn Overdose- you know, except that one time.\" she crunched away noisily at the popped kernels, \"Besides, you got just as much crap as I did Fluffy, so who's the hypocrite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two troublemakers make their way down the aisle towards the large silver screen and its rising rows of seats, they had taken it upon themselves to begin feasting readily on their purchased foodstuffs. With a wobbling belly bobbing ahead of her every step, Eldreich openly gorged upon her buttery delights. Next to her, a still stuffed-taut Midnight was a little more wary; namely in the face of how much Eldreich had already consumed today. It wasn't even lunchtime yet and she'd eaten more junk than most people eat food in a day! Though in all truth, she was guilty of a little overconsumption herself this morning... all those sweets were probably a really bad idea for her girlish figure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Tick Bait, you listening to me?\" Eldreich huffed unpleasantly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe addressed moemon's attention snapped from the hypnotic jiggling and swaying of Eldreich's flabby middle to the asymmetrical girl herself. \"Hm? What?\" she asked flatly, taking time to realize just how round dear ol' Eldy's face was getting in the cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>asked</i> if you thought that little shortstack back there was a cutie,\" Eldreich repeated begrudgingly, \"But I see that you're obviously still daydreaming about Vayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight turned a little red at the smarmy Scrafty's suggestion, puffing out her cheeks ever so slightly before responding in a huff, \"N-Not in your lifetime, Side-Hair!\" she corrected sternly, \"I would never, <i>ever</i> daydream about that pompous, mask-and-cape brained, fireheaded loser!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh~\" Eldreich teased as she pawed at her bucket, searching for the ones with them most lubrication, \"So I take it you <i>were</i> daydreaming about Sweet 'n' Low?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to the end of the aisle and made a ninety-degree turn to face the rows. Midnight had spent many a school day hiding out in the movie theater; in most cases literally, as if she had been found she would have been surely been dragged back to class. So it was a little bit of a shock to see just what had been done to one of her favorite places to pass time of three years (give or take a failed one here or there) in little less than four months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe renovation bill at St. Gijinka's was no doubt astronomical, and it probably required a good bit of strong strapping moemon to carry out the job. That or magic. Where there used to be about thirty or so rows that went up to the wall, it was now probably about seventy. It wasn't obvious to someone who hadn't partaken in a movie there, but to Midnight it was just that; this room went back twice as far as before! The silver screen was still exactly the same length in front of the aisle as ever, but there was another tier of seats above what used to be the back of the theater, and then another one after that! There were more than twice as many places to sit now; <i>'twice as many places to hide'</i>, Midnight made sure to make a mental note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Midnight gasped as she took in the ever familiar dragon mural on the walls, the school's mascots being the majestic dragon-types. A Rayquaza took center as two Dragonair wrapped around it in a double-helix formation. Below it, a Gyarados firing a wicked hyperbeam  into the corner of the sky and behind a matching set of Dragonite. \"When did they have time to do all of this?\" Midnight asked aloud as she was taken into an awestruck art appreciation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dey did all dish crap over the Shummer.\" Eldreich said through yet another mouthful of popcorn, \"I didn't get to see any of it done though, I kinda liked the old way better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right... you pretty much had total control of the school while all us people who <b>didn't</b> have to go to Summer School were home.\" Midnight teased, taking her first piece of popcorn from the bucket, \"You know all the improvements, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Eldreich answered plainly, \"All I know is that they redid the cafeteria, some of the theaters, like where they show the movies and stuff- ugh, you know- , um the grocery store, the candy shop, and installed all those vending machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Eldy, did you do <b>anything</b> in summer school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, Don Stupid says I've gotta repeat my sophomore year.\" she griped through buttery lips, \"Its whatevs though, I hate school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight rolled her eyes and started up the stairs. Eldreich was becoming a real butterball inside and out these days, and Midnight couldn't help but worry just a little. She didn't really like Eldreich per say; nor her mannerisms, the company she kept, her style, her stupid yellow jacket with eye holes ripped out of the hood, her fool's gold earrings, her stupid red hair or how it was cut, or... alright, she just didn't like Eldreich. But still, it was rather strange to see someone once so violence hungry just get so... hungry. She hadn't seen Eldreich go less than thirty minutes without eating in the hour or so they'd been hanging out, and that was on the walk to the movies! It was unnerving, yet she just kept eating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mighteyena moemon was halfway up the first staircase when Eldreich suddenly decided to settle into row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" Midnight asked rather disgruntled, \"You're supposed to sit at the top of the seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so mainstream.\" Eldreich said defensively, her breathing a little labored from those stairs, \"There's nothing wrong with these seats, plus we're closer so we can see <i>just</i> the movie, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus you're closer, so you can ruin your eyesight faster, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, thanks a lot Mom, when did you get all that new doghair?\" Eldreich chided, \"Just sit here, okay? Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Midnight rolled her eyes and started down the row, sitting next to Eldreich (as she didn't want to have to go over her in case she decided to bail if the movie sucked) and plopped her firm denim-draped rear down into the plush confines of the seat. At once, a strange sensation of vibration went through her body. She jumped immediately before sinking further into the chair. \"Oh my God...\" Midnight groaned, \"Don't tell me they actually put vibrating seats in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every fifteen minutes you get a nice cool vibration so your butt doesn't get sore.\" Eldreich said with a smirk, getting more popcorn from between her legs, \"We tested them out in Summer School.. w-when I actually went y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Midnight sank and allowed the pulsating massage to permeate her back and glutes, she found her hand reaching for her own popcorn bucket placed in the seat beside her. The massage chair seemed to even reach her stomach, a strange sense of aching relaxation coursed out from her ailing tummy. \"Mmm...\" she moaned quietly as she bit into the suddenly a lot more compelling popcorn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they (well, <b>she</b>) saw a familiar face go up the stairs; that cute little Riolu moemon was carrying a large drink up the steps coolly as he continued to climb the tiers. \"Ooh, there goes Midnight's sweet lovin'.\" Eldreich teased, \"I'll bet you want a piece of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-As if Eldreich!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the movie was interesting to say the least, Midnight was more preoccupied with the fact of the cute little Riolu kid who sat about two seats in front of her and Eldreich\u2026 That and the almost bottomless bucket of popcorn that she kept diving her hand into every few seconds to fill her need for the buttery and salty movie snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the movie and the Riolu cutie, Midnight didn\u2019t realize that with each mouthful of popcorn that she stuffed in her mouth, she kept getting fuller and fuller. It was a standard movie effect, while you enjoyed the movie and you had a snack or so, you subconsciously eat whatever\u2019s in front of you, not really caring about how much you ate or even what you ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the fact that there was a cutie in near her, the effect was amplified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that was prevent Midnight from going all gung-ho and stuffing herself like a tick, was the pudgy Eldriech who had somehow managed to inhale all of the extra large bucket of popcorn within the first half of the movie. Eldriech kept sneaking her hand into Midnight\u2019s bucket of popcorn, stealing a handful of the buttery goodness every few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Midnight noticed this, once again, she was too engrossed with the movie and the passing glances she gave to the Riolu Moemon in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, well, that killed some time,\u201d Eldriech stated as she lifted her hand up to block the bright sunlight that was pouring down from the sky above. \u201cUgh, I hate that after movie glare. So, tick bait, wanna crash a few more vending machines for some more free samples?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought mutts were supposed to have good hearing!\u201d Eldriech spat as she spun around to see Midnight staggering out of the movie theater, her hands on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off my case snake-skin,\u201d Midnight growled back as she slowly stood up straight to continue her walk towards the plump Scraggy moemon. \u201cI really don\u2019t need you riding my hide. Sides, I got better things to do now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing scavenging among the freshmen?\u201d Eldriech sighed with a roll of her eyes. \u201cFirst the \u2018hero of justice\u2019, now some freshmeat? Yeesh, you just have no real standards when it comes to men, do ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I can get a man,\u201d Midnight countered with her arms crossed under her breasts. \u201cWhen was the last time you got some action?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeh, I\u2019ll date someone who isn\u2019t an idiot,\u201d Eldriech countered with her eyes narrowed down at Midnight as she placed her hands on her chunky hips. \u201cWhich means I haven\u2019t found someone\u2026 I\u2019m being tolerant enough by talking to a number of people who are barely on that line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s eyes dulled a little bit and shifted her gaze to the building, she knew she was being insulted here, but she didn\u2019t want to scare the cutie away if he caught her getting into a fight with Eldy here. So with a deep breath, Midnight raised one of her hands up. \u201cWhatever, look, it was fun killing a couple of hours with ya, but I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wanna kill the rest of the day arguing with me. I know you\u2019ve got better things you wanna do than haggle me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you obviously haven\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d Eldriech muttered under her breath as she spun around, her exposed gut jiggling with the movement. \u201cFeh, fine, I\u2019m outta here then. I\u2019ll see you around, tick bait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the chunky Eldriech began to walk away, and it was not a moment too later, cause just as Eldriech\u2019s wide behind was turning the corner around the movie theater, that Riolu freshman guy was just exiting the movie theater, looking at his hand and was using his other hand to count something. The young Riolu simply counting some change that he had in his hand (Midnight was able to see that when the blue and dark haired moemon walked past her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight watched as the Riolu slowly walked away, she couldn\u2019t help but take a gander at him again \u2013 Blue vest, black shirt, and blue jean shorts, all of those clothes clinging to his slightly muscular frame. He had a tight body and with his cute innocent face and wild hair, Midnight couldn\u2019t help but lick her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo energetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026 Innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, while those were all good points, Midnight knew that freshmen scared easily (even the most confident ones got a little scared of upper classmen approaching them, especially on the first day), so she had to play her cards right and get the right impression with this Riolu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a hyena stalking its prey, Midnight carefully and discreetly followed the younger student, watching him as he walked through the small town on campus. It wasn\u2019t long till she saw what his destination was \u2013 It was a vending machine! But it wasn\u2019t one of the new ones that riddled the entire campus now, it was an older one that just served drinks and such. One of the faulty ones that Midnight had learned stole money from her while trying to get something to drink\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 But this was exactly what Midnight was hoping for. The Freshman Riolu was putting those coins of his into the machine. Knowing exactly what was going to happen, Midnight adjusted her shirt, pulling it down over the taught dome that was her belly while at the same time, making sure that her cleavage was shown, not too much, but enough to catch the wandering eyes of some freshly hormone induced freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sound of the Riolu kicking the vending machine, Midnight realized that was her cue and slowly sauntered over to the vending machine that was getting kicked by the freshman. When she arrived, the freshman Riolu had his shoulders slumped and was just about to turn away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, this thing giving you trouble, darling?\u201d Midnight cooed as she placed her arm on the side of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu moemon turned around, and turned his gaze slightly to the side when he saw Midnight (although the slight blush on his face didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the Mightyena girl) talking to him. Midnight mentally smirked to herself as she slightly pushed herself from the machine, \u201cThis old thing always steals money from unsuspecting students, all you gotta do is have the magic touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu guy turned back to Midnight as he watched her bump the side of her hip into the side of the vending machine. Oddly enough, the sound of plastic on metal echoed from the machine until a soft impact echoed from the opening in the machine. The Riolu was a little surprised, so Midnight continued her assault and leaned forward to reach for the drinks in the machine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich gave the Riolu freshman a decent view down her top, just on the fringe of the black bra she was wearing, and the blush on his tanned face grew slightly. Once again, Midnight smirked inside her head as she stood up and held up the bottled soft drink up to the Riolu freshman. \u201cI hope this is what you wanted\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for it to register in the Riolu\u2019s mind, but he quickly accepted the drink, \u201cUh, yeah, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm, looks like I got a bite,\u2019 Midnight thought as she leaned against the vending machine again. \u201cSince you got suckered by this machine, I assume you\u2019re a freshman, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes,\u201d the Riolu freshman stated with a slight bow towards Midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, aren\u2019t you supposed to be in class right now?\u201d Midnight asked as she moved a little closer to the reddening Riolu freshman, a small coy, if not seductive smirk growing on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have a reason for not being in class,\u201d the Riolu replied as he slowly opened the bottle. But he stopped when he realized that Midnight lifted up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s not need to explain yourself to me, freshman,\u201d Midnight playfully said watching as the freshman began to drink from the soda. \u201cBut, you got a name? It would kind of a shame to not get a chance to know some of the new faces around here, especially one that\u2019s easy on the eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu nearly gagged on the soda when he heard Midnight say that, Midnight playfully giggled at the flustered Riolu as he slowly began to regain his composure. After a few coughs, the Riolu Freshman stood up straight, trying to remain calm, \u201cL\u2026 Lucas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, very nice,\u201d Midnight stated as she inched closer to Lucas. \u201cPeople around here call me Midnight, so, feel free to do so\u2026 Tell me Lucas, would you like to kill some time with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas jumped slightly, nearly dropping the soda in his hands when Midnight offered the invitation to him, it wasn\u2019t every day that an attractive young (although slightly older than him) woman would just offer to spend time with him just like that. But here was the opportunity\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas took a deep breath and calmly answered\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The problem was that Lucas already HAD a girlfriend. Yup, he was one of those lucky guys who ended up going to the same academy as his girlfriend.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dorms in St. Gijinka's Academy for Young Moemon, building D are prone to short circuiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it be due to shoddy wiring in that particular building or due to the large population of electric type students that had populated that area for the past four years, it always seemed that at least once a week the building's power would flicker for a bit before going dead for a complete thirty seconds; only to turn back on not even a minute later. Those who have been living here for some time have learned not to rely on things like alarm clocks or radios to wake them up in the morning. However, this is a habit developed out of necessity, and often enough the students don't even notice it anymore. So its only natural that when someone fills in an empty slot in the dorm rooms, they find it a little hard to adjust at first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aliiiii...\" a hum from her bedroom door sounded as her roommate quietly tiptoed her way into the Quilava's den. Outstretching an arm to rouse her slumbering friend, the good natured intruder gave the smaller girl an innocent nudge. \"Hmmm...\" she sounded as she looked over the sleeping body of her little buddy. Clearly Ali hadn't taken her warnings and had gotten little to no sleep last night. Placing her elbow in the palm of her hand and nestling her chin into the groove between her index finger and thumb, Fontina let out a low grumble, \"Oh gosh, I told her not to stay up so late.\" she chastised the slumbering moemon. \"Aliii... come on, wake up.\" Fontina pleaded as she continued to poke and prod at Ali's unmoving form. \"Omigosh, do you think she's... no, she couldn't be!\" at once Fontina's fiction-riddled brain took siege over her normally rational way of thinking, \"Oh no, she's dead! Her heart must have given out from all the excitement of coming to St. Gijinka's!!\" she wailed, \"Oh how could this have happened to her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of Fontina's blabbering, it was no shock when Ali's petite shape rolled over underneath the covers, mumbling quietly to herself in her sleep. \"Ali?!\" Fontina rushed to her side as she soon realized that her friend was <i>not</i> in fact, dead, \"You're alive!\" Fontina squealed with glee as she quickly roused the girl up into a sitting position in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... was I not supposed to be?\" Ali yawned as she rubbed her heavy eyelids. \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was snapped back to reality as she remembered just what it was she came into Ali's room to do anyway. \"Oh, its um...9\" she said meekly, lips narrowing in her embarrassment, \"I figured that I should wake you up before I left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a full three seconds of silence between the two of them. Slowly, Ali's dark eyes widened as her sleep raddled brain processed the number she had just been given. \"9.\" she repeated in a dull, almost monotonous voice. \"Uh... yeah...\" Fontina smiled sheepishly as she noticed Ali's knuckles whiten. She took a step back away from the bed as she anticipated what was sure to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough: \"HOLY CRAP, NINE IN THE FREAKING MORNING?!\" Ali shouted as she tore off her blankets and rushed towards the bathroom. \"Well you just looked so peaceful!\" Fontina cooed apologetically as she watched Ali ready herself in their restroom. \"And you couldn't have woken me up!?\" she snapped back, sending fracture lines running up her toothbrush and a little ember from her mouth. \"Well, I had just came back from the library and Midnight told me not to...\" Fontina shied away as Ali returned to furiously beating the plaque away from her teeth with her toothbrush. \"crap, Crap, CRAP!!\" Ali hollered as she pulled off her yellow nightie and grabbed one of her many red-plaid skirts from her closet, \"Great, no time for a shower... ugh, whore's bath in the sink!\" she instructed aloud as she grabbed the soap and washcloth and began rubbing herself down with both of them. \"Ali, just calm down!\" Fontina pleaded, \"I'm sure there's plenty of time to get you some breakfast before second period starts-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to me for the rest of the morning!\" Ali spat fervently as she attempted to brush her teeth, comb her hair, and bathe herself at the same time. Finally she reached something somewhat decent. Not perfect, but decent. She pulled up her skirt, grabbed her pullover, rolled up the sleeves, got some socks, and slipped on her shoes before she started towards the door. She was stopped just at the doorway by her longtime friend, Fontina; her heavy breasts smooshing right into Ali's face. \"Ali slow down.\" Fontina chided calmly as she held the little spitfire at arm's length, \"No one's going to be mad if you miss your Freshman Orientation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli glared, only to be met with Fontina's kindly smile. She didn't really have a choice in the matter; Fontina may have been a bookworm, but all those hours lifting books in the library had made her pretty strong! The small moemon took a deep breath and exhaled warmly. \"There, good.\" Fontina said in a motherly tone, \"Look, you've gone and undone all the hard work you did on your hair.\" Fontina teased as she fixed the loose strands that Ali had left untouched in her hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a pretty girl by all means, whore's bath or not. With tanned skin, a small frame, and a lovely face. Her jaw was small but sturdy, and her complexion usually clear as crystal. Her hair was predominately black, but grew gradually more of a burgundy as one reached the tips. But most of all; she was short. Like, <i>really</i> short. Four foot ten. It was really kinda cute actually, but her total lack of curves got her mistaken for a boy quite a lot. Fontina could only smile as she remembered the days when she was just a little cyndaquil moemon tugging at her skirt. But now, here she was; all grown up and enrolled in the very Academy of which she herself was about to graduate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Fontina.\" Ali said apologetically, \"I'm sorry, its just... I'm all wound up for today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up into Fontina's glasses and caught reflection of herself; all grown up and in school. The same school her mother, father, and brother had gone to when they were her age. It was a really humbling experience. \"I understand. I was exactly the same way when I was a freshman.\" Fontina said with a distinct tone of nostalgia in her voice, \"I think all of us are... um, anyway, go on and get to orientation!\" Fontina urged, back to her rather excitable self, \"Or... what's left of it.\" she smiled sheepishly, \"Again, I'm really sorry for not waking you up sooner.\" she oozed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool!\" Ali said as she stormed out the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before poking her head back in the door with an intimidatingly blank expression on her face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you ever let me sleep in that late again, I'll pop your bubble boobies with a fork.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, it didn\u2019t matter if she was as fast as that Jolteon girl that Ali saw running around yesterday (seriously, that girl ran like crazy around the place), the distance between the dorms and the main building was at least a fifteen minute jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that empty stomach and slight fatigue from staying up late last night (once again, thanks to that mutt of a roommate \u2013 Midnight), Ali was unaware how long it would take till she collapsed onto the ground and become officially late for the orientation\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Shake it off Ali!\u2019 The Quilava Moemon thought to herself as she ran even faster and faster in an attempt to get to the auditorium. \u2018Just keep running and you\u2019ll be able to make it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TTTTTTTT</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli wasn\u2019t the only one walking around the island this morning, but most of the others were pretty lax about it. One in particular was currently taking an easy jog towards the school, a large smile on his face that grew with every step he took, \u201cAh, a new semester, a brand new chance to meet new people and a chance to see what the next generation has to offer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man laughed loudly as he adjusted the large metal baseball bat he had over his shoulder, making sure that the large bag that was strapped to the baseball bat wouldn\u2019t fall off. He was a brash looking young man with messy, dirty blond hair that billowed over his broad shoulders, and his skin was a light bronze, one of the many traits that highlighted his active life style. He wore a black wife-beater underneath a baggy red baseball jersey that highlighted his athletic body. He was also wearing some old, beaten up black pants but that\u2019s highly irrelevant, unlike the deep, stripe-like scars that were around his neck. An Arcanine Moemon, and one that was well off to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little off putting that he had a large goofy grin on his face, but the man just continued his trek through the school grounds\u2026 At least until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! OUTTA THE WAY!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burly Arcanine turned to the left, just in time to have a familiar Quilava freshman ram into him. However, due to the difference in sizes, the Arcanine Moemon didn\u2019t even move an inch while Ali was sent to the ground, making the young freshman wince. \u201cOW! Hey! Watch where you\u2019re going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine Moemon smirked to himself as he shook his head, \u201cIf I recall, you were the one who crashed into me.

The diminutive spitfire girl managed to get a firm grip on the underside of the dashboard, clenching tightly out of fear for her own safety, as she was comically strewn about the vehicle despite her vice-like grip on the plastic. Vayne was a reckless driver, who just barely dodged obstacles and completely obliterated any sort of standards that a small golf-cart should adhere to while he was behind the wheel. He turned viciously and never let his foot an inch off of the ground, but kept himself planted with his overall muscular build. Though during a few close calls he would should out a victorious \"Whoo!!\", which would again be repeated as he slowly approached the ground level of their school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how waz'zat?!\" Vayne barked wildly as he slid out of the driver's side of the vehicle, \"I swear we broke 80 in this thing, did you feel it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli didn't share nearly the same maniacal pleasure in being thrown about like a ragdoll while inside a vehicle going far beyond its manufacturing limits. The little quilava-based character slowly dripped out of her side of the cart and onto the cobblestone paved the island, winding up staring her school straight in the face by expected delivery time. Not that she really cared about school right just now. \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?\" Ali shouted as she struggled to catch her stricken breath, \"Y-You must be crazy! There's no way a sane person would drive like that!!\" The poor thing was so flustered that her knees buckled as she tried to stand, \"J-Just... thanks a lot, I-I'm glad I actually got here before it was over.\" Ali stated calmly as she wobbled unsoundly towards the front steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem.\" Vayne said with a hint of apology in his voice, \"I'm sorry if I scared you, but hey; at least I got you here when I said I did.\" he said with a big toothy grin before checking his watch, \"Actually, a whole thirty seconds before!\" He excitedly elevated his hand for a congratulatory palm slap, \"High Five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, and choking down the better portion of whatever she had eaten last night, Ali concurred and slapped his hand before hobbling back towards the school. \"Th-Thanks a lot... uh, Vayne was it?\" she said flatly, \"But I've really got to get to class, so...\" Vayne's smile widened as he started up the steps with her, \"Hey no problem, I've got class too!\" he said excitedly, \"Tell you what, since you're a freshman, I'll even get you to the auditorium.\" Ali grumbled audibly, already beginning to loath this lead-footed psychopath as he continuously attempted to force his company upon her. \"Yeah, I don't think so.\" she said curtly, \"See, I've got Freshman Orientation, and you look like... what, a senior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm a Junior, but thanks for the compliment.\" he said obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an unacknowledged staredown between them before Ali just finally grumbled and gave up. \"Alright, come on... you freak...\" she said dismissively as she started through the doorway, \"You know how to get to the auditorium, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Freshman Orientation had still gone as according to schedule. It wasn't uncommon for a student to skip the admittedly boring procedure. All it really pertained of was rules, policies, and the general know-what of the school. More so than anything, the echo was unbearable. Why on earth the academy needed such a large sitting arrangement was beyond most of the faculty, though none of them could quite complain. Since last year, there had been several upgrades in the accommodations of one's posterior including seat warmers, soft fabric, and soft cushioning underneath it as opposed to the cold wooden seats of generations past. The decor was new, though kept the spirit of the place through a mural of several dragon-type pokemon all carved into the walls; namely the famous piece, 'Evolution of Dratini' done by Gespercho Smear Galle, worked into it on commission. Since it was by far the most esteemed center of learning standing in this world today, a little ostentatious was prescription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, an entire flock of freshmen bored out of their little minds sat in said cushy chairs as they half-heartedly listened to whoever might be on stage. A few were convincing, a few were lacking, and a few were just asleep. Even Don Tanner, from his section away from the children, had pulled up the armrests of a few seats and made himself a comfortable place to snooze while the 'Organizer of Events' did her job and kept these kids out of class. In front of him, a tall man in a burgundy suit with several ponytails rolled his eyes and grumbled about incompetence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one taking this thing seriously was the aforementioned Organizer, a Snivy moemon who stood proudly on stage with her nose high in the air and her personal caretaker beside her as she delivered her expectations of this year to her uncaring classmates. Check that, not the school's expectations, <i>hers</i>. This girl had been to every prepping program offered back in Unova, so it was no surprise that she was the most qualified to act as Ninth Grade President without so much as an election. Looking at it now, most students would definitely have chosen otherwise. She stood on stage, all dolled up in her best yellow skirt and green blouse, and blew the short green hair from her eyes as she continued. \"Excuse me,\" she laughed (no one esle did), \"Hair issue, anyway, as I was saying; this class has a lot of potential, I know that I can drive the best out of you young boys and girls!\" Even next to her, the tall dark woman in maid's garb couldn't help but roll her eyes underneath half-closed lids. Her chocolate skin turned a bright red around her cheeks as she saw more and more students questioning her presence on stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when you graduate, you'll be able to look back and say \"She helped me do that. Lilian did that.\" and you'll have <i>me</i> to thank, Lilian Lillygrass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her arms for applause, though none really seemed to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyway, I'll turn the microphone back over to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the auditorium's doors swung open, revealing Ali's slender shape for all to see. Unfortunately subtlety was not in her move list, Ali's sharp opening of the doors echoed throughout the entire auditorium, much to her embarrassment and the infuriated expense of Lilian, whose speech had now gone interrupted. \"Ahem, excuse me!\" she hollered into the microphone in an attempt to calm the quickly unsettling crowd, \"Excuse me!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow her, the man in burgundy couldn't help but crack a smile, \"How embarrassing.\" he said in a gruff voice, \"But, even if, it managed to shut that little tramp up.\" he smirked, \"I guess I owe that little freshman something.\" To his shock, a pair of lanky arms draped themselves over his shoulders and a heavy weight landed on his head. \"You really should take a chill pill, Sunshine.\" Don Tanner's lax tone sounded from above him. His head, soundly propped upon Mr. Sunny's, yawned as he kept his dead-weight status, \"But'chea, I'm pretty glad little miss Nose-Face finally let someone else get a word in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" Lilian huffed after getting the crowd's (lack of) attention, \"I certainly hope this has all be entertaining for you, and I'll be returning the microphone to our Vice-Principal, Mr. Sunny!\" the little girl, once stepping down from the podium, was revealed to be quite short. Even shorter than Ali! She looked a lot like a grass fairy with that green hair of hers. \"Come on Suzu.\" she huffed, snapping her fingers at her maid... who apparently floated. \"Well now, that was... enlightening.\" Sunny said sharply into the microphone, \"How about we give Ms. Lillygrass a hand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I don't blame you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, one last thing; we've recently adopted a student service policy, which would be those vending machines located on these areas of the schools; outside of bathrooms, the gym...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli sunk into her chair humiliated. \"Craaaaaaaaap...\" she whined to herself, \"Now I wish I <b>had </b>skipped the rest of this class period.\" she groaned, noticing the evil eyes that Lilian was shooting her from across the auditorium. Apparently, she had already made a friend. Great. This school year was <i>not</i> turning out anything like she had hoped for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost as soon as the Freshman Orientation was over with, the freshmen flooded out of the auditorium. Unfortunately, it was still the first day of classes, therefore they all still had their first class to attend to this day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more unfortunately, that included Ali herself who had managed to step out of the way of the onslaught of other freshmen to look at her schedule (one of the few things she managed to grab before she rushed out of her room this morning). \u201cAlright\u2026 Let\u2019s see, according to this, I have to go to Special Moves Class with Professor... Locke? That\u2019s a weird name, I wonder what kind of Moemon he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ali was wondering what sort of weird character she\u2019d bump into next (Vayne certainly made an impression on the young Quilava Moemon \u2013 not the kind that he would\u2019ve enjoyed, but still, an impression), a slightly loud growl echoed from the small Moemon, making her face turn a bright red to match her outfit and auburn hair. <i>\u2018Damn it, I skipped out on breakfast and I almost lost whatever I ate last night thanks to that crazy speed demon.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her flat stomach, Ali looked around and saw a large vending machine (one of the many that Mr. Sunny himself had spoken about) standing only a few feet away from her \u2013 But it wasn\u2019t like any kind of vending machine she\u2019d seen back when she was at home. Still, the growls coming from her stomach were snarling for her to quell her hunger\u2019s anger \u2013 So much so that she\u2019d settle for anything to eat, even if it was chocolate coated or filled with cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be unhealthy, but still, it\u2019s better than skipping out on a meal. So quickly walking towards the large machine, Ali looked at the variety of foods and drinks that were lined up inside the machine. \u201cChips, fruit cups, cola\u2026 Is that ramen? Man, talk about choices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of looking over the choices, Ali quickly slipped in a few coins that she had scrounged up in her pocket (Thank goodness she didn\u2019t empty her pockets before she crashed last night) and quickly punched in a few buttons, making the machine hum to life. And with a soft thud, Ali quickly reached into the compartment at the bottom of the machine and pulled out a small four pack of powdered donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ali ripped into the donuts\u2019 plastic package, she told herself in her mind, <i>\u2018I\u2019ll need all the sugar I can get today, maybe they\u2019ll help me get through the day\u2026 Besides, donuts are still considered a breakfast food\u2026 Right?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that reassurance in her head, Ali began to walk down the hallway \u2013 Munching on one of the donuts as she took her steps. However, when she managed to get a distance away from the machine, Ali was unaware of a certain Snivy Moemon and her Frosslass maid were watching her as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzu,\u201d Lilian growled with her hand under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mi\u2019lady?\u201d the Frosslass maid asked with a slight bow, although, she sounded rather tired when she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want information on that insolent girl by the time of lunch,\u201d Lilian requested as her eyes traveled to the Vending Machine next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mi\u2019lady,\u201d Suzu yawned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu knew where this was going, her young mistress may have had a so called \u2018noble\u2019 attitude, but she had a short temper. Said short temper never ended well for the lady and for whoever was on the receiving end of the anger \u2013 as Suzu had seen before. But, who was she to prevent her mistress from making many mistakes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, Suzu, could you hand me some money?\u201d Lilian requested as she licked her lips at the juice in the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, mi\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><br>\r\nTTTTTTT</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Ali to find her classroom, and in all honesty, she expected there to be another freak like Vayne getting in her way. But she was glad she didn\u2019t, it gave her a chance to polish off three of the four donuts she had gotten from the vending machine, <i>\u2018Hmm, these donuts are actually quite tasty \u2013 I think they\u2019re from Swinub Sweets! They always make tasty foods.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ali entered the room, she was surprised to see that she was in a room that only had one desk in it, which meant that the students were either sitting on the ground or standing alongside the walls. Other than that, it was a large room (almost like a gymnasium) that had some large windows and slightly padded walls and floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Ali walked towards some of the clearer parts of the room, still chewing on the donut she had in her mouth. When she got to a good place, Ali sat down on the ground, making sure her skirt was under her butt. \u2018<i>Still, I wonder what kind of class this is, and what kind of professor we\u2019ve got here\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli swallowed the donut and quickly pulled out the last from the emptied package and quickly tossed it into her mouth, immediately chewing and swallowing the sugary food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chewed on the last of her makeshift breakfast, the sound of rolling wheels filled the air, making all the students in the room look towards the door. It didn\u2019t take long to see the source of the noise, for almost a few moments later, a black and gray blur sped towards the door and immediately fell to the ground with a loud thud. \u201cUrk! Well, that could\u2019ve gone better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure that sped into the room immediately stood up, revealing to all of the students a tall and sleek man with really dark skin, long spiky black hair wearing a long gray scientist coat with a light purple sweater and black slacks underneath. The man had a pair of glasses over his surprisingly sharp and red eyes, which took a lot of students back when he looked at them. Behind the Gengar moemon\u2019s body was a fancy red and black office chair that had fallen when its wheels collided with the door frame, obviously sending the weird Gengar Moemon to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dusting off his scientist coat, the weird Gengar quickly picked up the chair and began to walk out of the room. \u201cLet me try that again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all of the students in the room sweatdropped as the Gengar stepped out of the room\u2026 And those beads of sweat grew larger as the professor actually tried to speed into the room with the office chair, only to fail in the same manner as before! \u201cURK! Okay\u2026 We\u2019ll do this later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking himself and the office chair up, the Gengar slowly walked to the desk, yawning loudly as he set himself up at the desk. \u201cAlright, welcome to your first class at Gijinka Academy. I\u2019m your first teacher, but I prefer to be called Professor Locke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Yep, its official, this school is filled with freaks,</i>\u2019 Ali thought to herself as she sighed slightly, remembering Vayne, then that Snivy moemon \u2013 Lilian, and this guy to top off the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, before we get to discussing to class today,\u201d Locke continued, placing his elbows on the desk in front of him. \u201cI want to point out a few things about the academy itself\u2026 Gijinka academy is a school designed for Moemon who wish to bring out their potential \u2013 This means that this school will teach you all how to fight with your natural abilities. Now, that isn\u2019t to say that you have to compete in the pro leagues necessarily, in fact, only a handful of graduating students become a part of the battling league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do teach the regular high school curriculum so that you can even go off to get regular jobs or even continue your education at a college. Most of the time, these classes here act as self-defense classes, while at the same time refining you all into model citizens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud yawn, Locke twisted his head slightly, \u201cAlright, now that we\u2019ve gotten that boring crap out of the way, time for my class\u2019s introduction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of students stepped back from Locke\u2019s bluntness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his hand up, Locke smirked to himself as a dark aura appeared over his arm, \u201cNow, this class itself teaches you all how to tap into your natural abilities and even use that as a powerful ability or attack. Watch, I\u2019m of the Gengar family, known for their ghostly characteristics\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Locke plunged his hand into the desk, his hand literally phasing through the wood and making some of the students jump backwards. \u201cNow, this technique is only for ghost type Moemon, so unfortunately, I can\u2019t promise that you\u2019ll all learn how to do this, but still, I\u2019ll teach you how to access your own Moemon traits and control them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his hand from the desk, Locke also pulled out what appeared to be a large clipboard, \u201cNow, continuing, since it\u2019s the first day, I won\u2019t be expecting a lot from you all, so today, I\u2019ll be assigning partners that you\u2019ll have for the first half of the semester. Your partner should share at least one of your \u2018attributes\u2019, and you\u2019ll be acting as study partners. Eventually, once we reach the second half, I\u2019ll be assigning an upperclassman to your partner listing, so you can learn from a more experienced student. Now, we\u2019ll start with the Fighting-types, since there are so few of you listed for this class. When I call your names, raise your hands so you can find your partners. And when I\u2019m done, I want you all to spend the rest of the class period getting to know your partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, Wright Steelhart\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(had to continue on the next chapter du te to word count.

Ali stepped back at the sight of the large ball of what was going to be her future partner in this class. The girl Ember in question was a rotund girl with tanned skin, large innocent blue eyes and long curly crimson hair that reached past her shoulders. The girl was dressed in a long black skirt that flowed just above her chunky knees (and from what Ali could see from the faces of the male students that the short vulpix girl skipped past, the hams called her backside were probably barely covered by the expansive cloth), a white shirt that struggled to confine the twin large melons that Ember was smuggling along with that large belly, and to top things off, she had a pink vest  that didn\u2019t seem to serve much of a purpose other than for decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpix girl stopped right in front of Ali, almost smacking into the small Quilava Moemon \u2013 And it was at this point that Ali realized that she and Ember were almost the same height to boot! Ember smiled brightly on her cute cherubic face. \u201cHeya! Ali, right? Let\u2019s get along greatly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli shook her head, trying to get her mind from wondering if Ember\u2019s breasts were bigger than Fontina\u2019s, and lifted up her hand to the chucky Vulpix. \u201cUh, yeah, sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber took Ali\u2019s hand, but much to Ali\u2019s surprise, Ember pulled the Quilava girl towards her and put her in a deep hug, almost smothering Ali into her monstrous breasts. \u201cAh! There\u2019s no need to be so stiff! We\u2019ll be the best of BFFs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ali was starting to suffocate, Professor Locke was just continuing his name call off, so a majority of the class didn\u2019t pay attention to the Quilava girl\u2019s plight. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Some were excited about meeting their new partners, some weren't. <i>All</i> were quiet. Professor Locke was a very intimidating man, and he didn't look like the kind of guy who enjoyed repeating himself. Even Ali, not that she had much choice, dare not holler out that her new partner was trying to kill her out of fear of the ghost type moemon leading this seminar. \"I'll be conducting preliminary exams to get a feel on how far along you and your partner are in regards to your natural abilities.\" Professor Locke said rather lifelessly, \"This way I'll be better able to instruct you, because frankly I just don't expect that much from any of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Ember turned (apparently either choosing to ignore, or completely oblivious to the second condescending half of that sentence) looked at Ali with the most excited gleam in her eyes. \"Yay!!\" she squealed, \"I get to show Professor Locke just how good I am with my fireballs!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her excitement, Ember's grip grew tighter and tighter around Ali's spinal cord. The poor little Quilava moemon could absolutely feel the vice-like wrap this doughball had around her; her only complaint and thought to complain about was \"if I just had some damn breasts I'd at least have some room to breath.\" However Ember eventually released her pint-sized partner from her death lock, not because she sensed the immediate danger that she had placed her new BFF in but only so that she could shoot up one monstrously thick arm and wave it around like a lunatic. \"Oooh!\" she called excitedly from the seats, \"Mr. Locke, can me and Ali go first?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli took a deep raspy inhale the very second she was released, dramatically throwing her head back as she whipped away from Ember's suffocatingly fat arms. It didn't even occur to her that Ember had said anything at all until she had a clear head, her response being an immediate and sharp; \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the shock of everybody, much less Ali, the addressed professor's response was a simple: \"Mmmm... okay.\" with a relatively amusing influx. Ember stood up and started jumping around, clapping her hands throwing out 'yay's like confetti, and while the rest of the class watched with relative disgust at how the big butterball jiggled, Ali could only parrot her earlier response. \"What?\" Locke said dismissively, \"We were going to go in alphabetical order anyway, and you're the first one on the list Alison Reaves.\" he emphasized her name teasingly. \"Alright, I'll take these two and... um... you two...\" Locke pointed vaguely into the crowd of students as he rushed the two fire-types out of the gymnasium and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the confusion of everyone else left standing aimlessly in the hallway, someone finally piped up: \"Who, um, who did he mean by you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke seemed to have taken a breath of fresh air; his demeanor had changed slightly. Still really scary, but now there was a sense of new life about him. His eyebrows were no longer furrowed to the point of wrinkling and his gaze more relaxed. Frighteningly enough, a small grin worked its way onto his dark face; scaring the crap out of Ali. She wouldn't dare say this out loud,  but Professor Locke really had a pedo's smile! \"Now that I've got you two out here\"-again, really not a good thing to say with your pedo smile on-\"We're going to see just how well you can already control your natural element... in your case, how well the pyrocentric abilities have progressed inside of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one arm spread out, he gestured towards the dead end of the hall, \"This hallway is flame retardant, has an inside layer of rubber, and was painted with oil-based paint on top of being structurally perfect.\" he almost sounded like he was bragging, but Ali knew just what was to come next. And it was something she'd been waiting to hear since she enrolled in this stupid school, \"You can be as rough as you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smile crossed Ali's lips as she got the itch to let loose. \"However I should warn you, anything you singe, melt, or otherwise destroy will be cleaned up after class. By you. So don't go too crazy.\" he said rather warmly. \"Do we have a sparring team yet?\" he asked, peeking at the doors behind the two of them in search of another pair of students; casting the two of them aside so he could (literally) pop his head in. \"Hey, I asked for two students!\" Ali could hear his muffled voice even through the heavy wooden doors. Seriously, the way he did that so easily... well, <b>at all</b> was just too creepy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be out in a sec.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Locke?\" Ember asked innocently as her hand rose and commenced its ritual flailing around, \"How come we're in the hallway when all the fighting stuff is in the classroom?\". Her answer was met with a blank stare and pursed lips, the look lasting for a good five seconds before being completely ignored altogether. \"Ah, here they are.\" he said flatly as he ushered in a short girl with vibrant citrus hair. Wait. What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its the oversleeper-slash-underachiever.\" came the haughty tone of one recognizable freshman prez. Those ridiculous green locks of hers made her pretty easy to spot, \"And she's partnered with the... well, just plain over-eater, how fitting!\" she laughed at that. It was really an abrasive laugh too, and the way she tilted her nose back as she gafawwed... It made Ali want to just rip it right off! \"Yeah, thats me.\" Ali said flatly, \"So I guess its just you versus me and Ember here since no one can stand to be around you.\" Lilian scoffed, tilting her head back and to the left as she did so. \"You wish. I have my own personal partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, much like the professor had before, the woman that Ali recognized from Lilian's speech phased through the doors and took her place at Lilian's side. Ali took one glance at her and shot back to the professor, \"There's no way she's a freshman!\" she barked, eye twitching slightly, \"Look at that rack, that girl's got to at least be a junior!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, Ali was completely right. No freshman had a bust quite like this girl's. For starters, she was dark-skinned like the professor; a common attribute amongst ghost-types. Her tail of her long black hair reached down to her backside. while it split above the shoulders into braids that reached the exact middle of her waist when standing. Atop her head was a sort of veil. Her face, solemn yet beautiful, sported relatively dainty, doll-like features including the most piercing pair of blue eyes Ali had ever seen. She was dressed in a traditional Unova maid's outfit and, as mentioned above, her boobs were huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to pair up with some freshman when I have a perfectly good Suzu standing right next to me?\" Lilian asked haughtily, \"She graduated here a long time ago, so I know she's the best choice! Aha-ha-ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Locke!!\" Ali cried, \"How can you let her do this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind his glasses, Ali saw the blank stare of her mentor. One that spoke truth. The kind of truth that only a trusted older gentleman could so easily speak of. In one word, he revealed to Ali just how the world worked outside of high school, and she would be wise to never forget his lessons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cash bribe.\" he said, whipping out a fat wad of bills, \"Okay, battle commence.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ali was dumbstruck at the sight of the brash, and blatant bribery that her first (albeit creepy) professor at this academy so proudly displayed. From the creepy red eyed look in Professor Locke\u2019s eyes, Ali could tell that the Gengar professor didn\u2019t seem to really care that he was setting one of the worst examples that a professor could ever do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty!\u201d Ember cheered as she jumped up, surprising most of those who are hallway with the facts that she could jump so easily and so high, while at the same time surprised at the amount of bouncing that the girl\u2019s bosom produced. \u201cLet\u2019s show\u2019em what we\u2019ve got, BFF!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how cute,\u201d Lilian laughed slightly as she took a few steps back behind the busty Frosslass maid. \u201cThe bigger of you two seems to think you can win\u2026 And you\u2019re BFFs? That\u2019s just hilarious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig talk from an ironing board of a Snivy!\u201d Ali snapped back, making Lilian\u2019s laughter cease almost on a dime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large blood vessel began to pulse on the side of the slim Snivy Moemon\u2019s head, her shoulders slumped slightly and her eyes narrowed down at the Quilava Moemon. \u201cHumph! Like you can talk! You\u2019re no better than a cutting board, you rude, sorry excuse for a Moemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cutting board?!\u201d Ali stuttered before she stomped her foot into the ground. \u201cBetter than being a snobby loudmouth who survives by listening to herself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW DARE YOU!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsults, left and right, began to shoot off from both sides of the hallway, those who weren\u2019t involved couldn\u2019t help but blink a few times in confusion at the battle of insults. However, out of the three who weren\u2019t include in the childish battle\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOWZA! This must be trash talking!\u201d Ember squealed with stars in her eyes, watching as the two slim girls kept slinging insults at each other (for some reason, they both kept bringing out the fact that they both had a flat chest, but Ember put that fact out of her head). \u201cOoh! Ooh! Can I be apart of this Professor Locke!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving fallen partially asleep on his feet, the Gengar snapped himself away and shook his head. \u201cActually, I\u2019d prefer if we could get on with the real battle\u2026 But since these two aren\u2019t likely to do that without a third party interference\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his hand up to his face, Locke\u2019s face began to curl up into a malicious smirk that seemed to almost fly off of his face, forming into a ghastly smirk that immediately screeched out loudly, making both Ali and Lilian cease their squabbling as well as making Ember\u2019s joy quickly disappear. The only one who didn\u2019t seem affected was Suzu, who had her eyes closed the entire affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScary Face,\u201d Locke snickered with his regular face returning (albeit it was still creepy and sent shivers down all three of the younger girls\u2019 spines). \u201cI should\u2019ve done that in the beginning. Now, either you fight each other right now, or perhaps, you\u2019d like to fight against me? I wouldn\u2019t mind tussling with a few young girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018He didn\u2019t even try to hide it that time,</i>\u2019 Ali thought with a shake of her head as she clapped her hands together, creating a pair of circular flames around her hands. \u201cFine, if that\u2019s how you wanna do this, then I\u2019ll show you what I can do with my Flame Wheel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh!\u201d Ember added as she lifted her arms up, creating several small blue flames that danced around her large, bulbous body. \u201cWill\u2019o Wisp! Will\u2019o Wisp!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzu!\u201d Lilian sighed with a snap of her fingers, making the dark skinned, busty maid strike a dramatic pose with the wind around her arms starting to freeze, as evidenced by the ice crystals that were forming around her form. \u201cTeach them a lesson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes milady,\u201d Suzu sighed before she dashed towards the two fire type freshmen girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was long and hard, even if it was with a type advantage and two against one, but things began to look brighter at the end and the winner was\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fight began with Ali rushing into battle head first with Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarvish Quilava girl's instincts told her that, despite the significant difference in age and ability, her pyro powers would be enough to melt away Suzu's cryokinesis. Instinct would prove wrong, as the older woman dodged her hearty charge with relative ease; taking it upon herself to begin floating in midair to further enhance the small girl's chase. Already things were looking pretty glum; a fact that would be recognized and dealt with by a low growl coming from Ali. She turned on her heels to face the levitating lady in black and roused her flames higher up on her body. Positioning one arm as outstretched, open palm, and facing towards Suzu, she conjured up a relatively strong Ember that was sent soaring towards the ice mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated downwards to just barely miss the surprisingly proficient burst of flames, escaping them without being scorched in the slightest. Using her own levitating ice crystals, Suzu effortlessly sent an Ice Shard attack hurdling at the young moemon. A hit on the right leg, Ali winced as she fought herself to stay on foot. Regardless of encroaching frostbite, Ali fired up another Ember attack at her opponent; another miss, but it got her much lower to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking matters into her own hands, Ember's big brown eyes sparkled with a mischievous glee. The blubberball took a few steps back and began charging towards her still levitating challenger. Not exactly the brightest move. \"Body Slam!\" she shouted aloud, jumping up surprisingly high into the air and falling reminiscent of a meteor to the Earth's surface. However, due to a type mismatch, Ember's skills went unnoticed and unappreciated as Suzu effortlessly phased through the belly flop. \"Ooh...\" Ember moaned, \"that hurt my tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking flight once more, Suzu rose higher and higher above the tagteam, her own partner, and the ever-observant Professor Locke; raising her arms to a perfect 180 degree angle and opening her palms, she gave a single command: \"Hail\". At once the hallway's ceiling was lost amongst thick, dark clouds of noir, small flakelets of snow falling from above quickly becoming chunks of ice. Undaunted, Ali continued her pyrocentric attacks in hopes of subduing Suzu with proper type matchups. She cast fireball after fireball at Suzu's mysterious form, but to no avail. Out of seven casts, only one hit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember!\" Ali shouted out to her partner over the heavy icefall, \"You got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her on the ground!!\" Ember shouted back, cupping her pudgy hands around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Ali decided to prepare herself for the worst. The only thing Ali had in her disposal that could get her up to that altitude was Flame Wheel, and that was quite a long shot given Suzu's evasiveness. But, never the less, it was worth a try! Ali fed the fires that floated around her hands, letting it encroach upon her back. Slowly, it spread as she curled over and readied herself for a roll. She jumped, and ignited the mystical flames that covered her so that they may propel her through the air. Success! She was now hurdling towards Suzu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a physical attack, Suzu could very well have easily phased through it to avoid damage. But due to her secondary type, ice, she was at a loss for that ability. Fire weakened her, and it was pretty obvious by her moveset. She had no choice but to physically avoid the hit, lowering herself down significantly until she was just a hair's length above the floor. As Ali rebounded off of the wall, she uncurled and shouted to her partner, \"Do whatever you've got to do <b>now!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled, dimpling her chubby cheeks, as she too curled herself up. Surprisingly enough, she was quite dexterous for a girl of her overall girth; enough so to sit down and wrap her arms around her knees. Using the properties of a rock-type moveset, Ember began to roll faster and faster in place before releasing herself to Suzu's back. A minor hit, but damage still. Ali decided to run defense and keep Suzu vulnerable with continued fireworks. She slung embers wildly at the ghostly woman in hopes that she wouldn't have the chance to block Ember's rebound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all that did was get her mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming somewhat exasperated at her continued abuse, Suzu stopped Ember dead in her tracks with Mist. The overfed lummox hit the wall without even knowing what was happening! With her evasiveness raised, Suzu could operate in secrecy. A quick ice shard towards Ali was enough to get her riled up, the girl fired blindly into the thick mist while getting pummeled with hail. However, she missed every single time. Ember, desperately trying to assist her BFF, found herself lighting the way with will'o'wisps in hopes of leaving Suzu with a burn; but again, they came up dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle came to an end in one mighty move; Suzu decided to whip up Sheer Cold to freeze her opponents. Nearly to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it might have been, at the worst, a very serious coma. But after some reprimanding on Professor Locke's part, the two girls were revived with a handy pair of Revives from the Professor's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Ali and Ember groaned simultaneously after jolting up. \"Congratulations, you lost.\" Lilian said haughtily as she let her head fall back and let loose another heinous bout of laughter. \"I don't know what you're so... proud about.\" Ali struggled to make words, finding this near-death experience very hard on her, \"You didn't even fight...\" Her knitpicking fell on deaf ears, of course, as Lilian chose to ignore the cries of her flat-chested rival. \"Suzu really showed you a thing or two, why would I bother stepping in on an obviously perfect lesson in humility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli tried to jump up, but found her body far too weak to do so effectively. She instead just fell back down to the floor with a serious headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh School sucks.</span></div></div>",

I hope that this teaches you a valuable lesson you two lousy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilian yelped when a clipboard gently bonked her on the forehead, eliciting a small snicker from Suzu. The clipboard was still held in Professor Locke\u2019s hand as he casually looked down at the weakened fire-type duo, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor Locke, what do you think you are doing!?!\u201d Lilian snarled as she stomped her foot into the ground a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy job,\u201d Locke answered quickly with his red eyes narrowing down on the snobby Snivy Moemon in front of him. \u201cYou may have paid me to pair you up with these two, but as a teacher I can\u2019t let you harm the students past a certain extent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>He says this after we get out tails handed to us,\u2019 </i>Ali thought to herself before she closed her eyes, trying to subdue the headache that was rasping around in her head. It was getting too much that Ali began to slip out of consciousness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TTTT- Some Time Later\u2026-TTTTT</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2026 Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question that Ali had asked herself, cause from where she was standing, it looked as though she was standing in nothing more than a huge mess of nothing but white. White as far as the eye could see\u2026 Ali could almost compare it to the snow storms that she saw whenever she tagged along to the school winter trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference was that there seemed to be no light, no darkness, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli took a few steps, her footsteps echoing through the spacious area. \u201cWell this sucks\u2026 What the hell happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? You failed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli turned around, the voice she just heard was so familiar, heck it was a voice she heard several times. And as she turned around, her suspicions were confirmed \u2013 It was none other than that snobby Snivy herself, Lilian who was behind Ali. Only there was one big difference, and by big, it was BIG! Lilian\u2019s was practically towering over the smaller Quilava Moemon, standing at least a good twenty feet taller than her, almost as if Lilian was a giant Snivy Moemon. \u201cAre you so hopeless that you can\u2019t see how bad of a drop out you are? Ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Drop out?!\u201d Ali snapped, her eyes narrowing at the enlarged Snivy. However, while her face and tone of voice showcased rage and anger, the rest of Ali\u2019s body was shivering slightly. She knew it wasn\u2019t out of fear, so once again, Ali spun around to see what the cause was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as she turned around, she found herself mashed up against something incredibly large and soft, but extremely cold at the same time when Ali\u2019s body touched up against it. When Ali pushed herself away from the large object, she immediately saw what she was touching and her face went as red as Ember\u2019s hair. In front of her was an extremely gigantic Suzu, but somehow, Ali was standing right in front of her massive bust \u2013 Both tits seemed to be bigger than Ali\u2019s whole body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli staggered backwards once again, this time tripping over the backs of her feet and sending her bouncing on her tiny tush. It was then that she noticed a large shadow looming overhead and saw that the gigantic Lilian was looming over her (and thanks to that, Ali was given a not so welcomed view of the Snivy Girl\u2019s lime green panties). The large Snivy Moemon scowled down at Ali and slowly lifted her foot up into the air, \u201cTrash like you doesn\u2019t belong in this world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when Lilian dropped her foot on top of Ali\u2019s body\u2026<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nTTTTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli shot up in the bed that she was laying in, her forehead covered in a cold sweat that dripped over her entire body. Her breathing was forced and she slowly clutched her arms tightly, trying to calm herself down from the odd dream she had just experienced\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake, good,\u201d A calm, loving voice stated, making Ali lift her head up to see the owner of that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the foot of Ali\u2019s bed was a large, and chubby woman dressed in a long white lab coat that covered her busty and bubbly frame. She had a chubby if not cute face that was surrounded with long chestnut colored hair (although the top part seemed to be darker). Under her coat was a regular tan T-Shirt with a black skirt that struggled to contain this woman\u2019s chubby hourglass frame. If Ali had to guess about what this woman was, she would probably put her money on a Kangaskhan Moemon, she certainly had the figure as such a Moemon. Ali blinked a few times as the young woman in front of her walked up to her and placed a hand atop of Ali\u2019s forehead. \u201cHmm\u2026 Good, you appear to broken that fever you had when you came in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fever?\u201d Ali questioned with her head tilted to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you were practically chilled to the bone, dear,\u201d The bubbly Moemon in front of her stated as she placed her hand under her chin. \u201cWhen you and your friend were brought in, you both were burning up. I\u2019ve only seen this with seniors when they use attacks like blizzard or such\u2026 But freshmen? I\u2019m going to have to speak to headmaster Tanner about this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli had so many questions that she wanted to ask this Kangaskhan moemon\u2026 But the only question that came to mind was, \u201cW-Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d The Kangaskhan Moemon mused as she smiled warmly at Ali. \u201cOh dear, that\u2019s right, you\u2019re a freshman, well, I\u2019m the nurse and Home Ec professor here \u2013 Shera Strongarm, but please, call me Shera, everyone else does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that would explain the bed that Ali was in. Slowly, the Quilava Moemon turned her head around the room, seeing all of the regular stuff a person would see in a school nurse\u2019s office \u2013 Medicine, charts, a curtain around the bed areas, a desk with donuts on it (although, Ali was sure that those weren\u2019t standard in a nurse\u2019s office), and there was another bed next to Ali\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s where Ember was snoozing currently, her whole body looking like a huge ball of tan colored dough \u2013 It was a wonder to Ali how Ember could sleep sitting up, but then again, if she had sweater puppies as big as Ember\u2019s, she\u2019d probably be able to sleep on those things as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, dear, you should be okay,\u201d Shera stated as she smiled down at Ali. \u201cBut I need you to promise not to take on any upper classmen, even if you have a type advantage, you need to take into account the difference in levels\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I was the one who picked the fight?!\u2019 Ali thought with a dull look on her face. \u2018Why do I think that snob is behind that as well?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026 Ali Reaves, right?\u201d Shera questioned, immediately getting her answer from Ali with a quick nod. \u201cGood, I\u2019d like you to stay for a little bit longer, at least until your friend wakes up and your other one gets back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that just confused Ali, maybe Ember considered Ali her \u2018BFF\u2019 but Ali barely knew the girl! And who was this other friend? Could it have been Fontina? She was practically the only other person she knew close enough to consider a friend\u2026 And you could include Midnight, but that was using the worst concept of \u2018friend\u2019 to describe her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the door opened up, catching both Ali\u2019s and Shera\u2019s attention, and almost immediately, Ali\u2019s eyes widened when she saw who was standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood AFTERNOON, Nurse Shera!\u201d a familiar muscular Arcanine laughed as he stepped into the room, a large bag slung over his shoulder. \u201cI hope you took good care of the two guests in here, giving them your trademarked bedside manner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always give my best Vayne,\u201d Shera giggled back in reply as Ali\u2019s jaw dropped slightly. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be happy to know that your friend here finally woke up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Vayne laughed as he trotted over to Ali\u2019s bed. \u201cWhen that old coot Locke called me to drag a couple of freshman to the nurse\u2019s office, I was a little surprised to see this little freshman amongst the two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was about to say something, but that\u2019s when a slightly loud rumbling sound echoed through the air, at first, Ali\u2019s eyes traveled over to Ember\u2026 But saw that the bulbous Vulpix Moemon was still sleeping, albeit she was licking her lips, but still asleep. That\u2019s when a second growl echoed through the air, and it was Ali\u2019s face that turned red when she realized it was her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera smiled brightly as Vayne laughed loudly, the athletic Arcanine Moemon walked up to Ali\u2019s bed and placed the bag carefully on the bed. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d be hungry, so I got you a few things from the cafeteria\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what you liked, but here ya go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, Ali had some questions, and it was obvious that Vayne and Shera had the answers\u2026 But then again, that smell emanating from the bag was taking the side of her growling stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she sat, slowly losing herself to the potato sack'd siren, its aura flooded outwards and touched a little bit of everything in its conquest of Ali's nostrils. The smell of cotton balls and band-aids usually stereotypical of such a facility as this, was over-run by sweet smellings of meat, many juices blending together in the great conqueror that was odor to make a mouthwateringly tantalizing smell that would drive even the most dedicated of vegans into a voracious carnivorous frenzy. The dainty nostrils of the Quilava girl flexed as they struggled to take in as much of the aroma as possible, chilled bones nursed back to warmth by the healing power of Vayne's package...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Actually Vayne, that smells...\" Ali paused so as to take another whiff, finding herself at a lack of words to describe the delicate harmony of meat, \"Pretty damn good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Vayne roared as he slammed the sack at the foot of the bed, \"Because, since I had no idea what sort of meals you might fancy, I just took a bunch of mine and tossed them together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next would destroy Ali's perfect paradismial thought bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVayne, foolish as he often was, had thought it perfectly acceptable that none of the food he would be bringing the two fire-type patients be individually wrapped, contained, or cared for in any general matter. When he said \"tossed them together\" Vayne actually meant that he gathered up his favorite foods, put them in a sack as they were, and carried them to the nurses's office; actually expecting Ali to be okay with eating complete and total slop. As you can probably imagine, it was utterly disgusting. Several meat bones were visible in the large pile, cooked to absolute perfection and dripping with juices, most of which oozed into the mashed potatos that he hadn't cared to bowl or package. The bread, soggy with meat juices as well, was mostly cheesy due to the clearly under-cared for packets of queso. All of this sat atop a once clean bedsheet and at the foot of a deeply disturbed Quilava moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How can you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, it all looked fine when I put it in there...\" Vayne said quizzically as he dipped a strong sturdy finger into the mashed potato goo, grabbed a dollop of the concoction and licked it off of his finger. Flashing an approving smile Ali's way, he gave a thumb's up and his seal of approval. \"No worries, Citizen!\" He said deeply, \"The taste has only been altered minorly, your meal should still be quite enjoyable for you and your-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT EATING THIS CRAP!\" Ali hollered as she drew the blanket closer to her with one hand and chucked a bowl previously containing mashed potatos (judging by the debris left inside) at Vayne's head. He was eerily unafflicted. \"This is just... this is just nasty!\" she continued on, \"I mean really; how much of a brain-dead idiot do you have to be to eat something that looks like that?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a sign from Heaven Above, Ali's questions were answered in the form of a low rumble emenating from Ember's tummy. The slumbering girl next to her, adorably using her own humongo-boobs as headrests as she snuggled with her own corpulence, was shaken into a half-cognitive state at the pleasant smell of the ungodly mixture. \"Mmm...\" Ember moaned, beginning to kneed her tummy longingly as the smell made her chubby little legs kick, \"Ember smells something yummy~!!\" Cutely, the massive girl struggled into a seated position and let out an almost infantile yawn, stretching her impossibly thick arms out wide and plopping down to the floor with a heavy \"BOOM!\" beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of the massive pile-up of randomly placed foodstuffs on the bed next to her own, Ember's eyes widened as much as her chubby cheeks would allow them. Without saying a word, she simply giggled madly and skipped over; beginning to sample out the least-deformed parts. \"Oh num num num!!\" the nearly spherical Vulpix girl said, giddy as a schoolgirl, as she bit off a large chunk of meat. The Mashed Potatos were extra. And so Ali, Shera, and Vayne watched with a sort of morbid curiousity at the gluttonous little ball of caramel colored dough that ate such curious things. \"Um... Ember?\" Shera piped up at the feasting girl in front of her, \"M-Maybe Vayne should escort you two to the cafeteria... its almost lunchtime, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunchtime?!\" Ember said, energy almost frighteningly psychopathic, \"Oh boy oh boy oh boy!!\" she squealed before grabbing Ali's hand and jerking her out of bed, \"Lets go, BFF! Its First Day Meatloaf Day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, gross!\" Ali hollered in the hallway, \"At least wash your hands after touching that crap first!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slightly awkward silence between the two well-acquainted veterans of the academy after the two fire-types left. \"Vayne?\" Shera asked calmly, neck cricking menacingly as she slowly turned towards the flamboyant Arcanine moemon. \"Yes Nurse Shera Strongarm?\" he answered dumbly. \"Who was it who fixed you up after your first big fight with that Tyranitaur moemon your freshman year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you Nurse Shera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who was it who patched you up good as new after your battle with that Recruiter from Swampert Tech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You did, but my memory is a little hazy due to all those medications...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Shera said menacingly, palming the decorative ball at the end of the restbed and sending several fissures down its side, \"So why do you pay me back by dumping food ALL OVER my CLEAN sheets?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"I suppose I shall go escort my friends to their luncheon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should do that.\"</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, the Quilava Moemon was impressed with Ember, it was hard to believe that a girl with Ember\u2019s\u2026 bountiful curves was able to move at such speeds or even move at all! Heck, the girl even knew how to use her weight (Ali was pretty sure that Vulpix Moemon couldn\u2019t learn Roll Out, but she wasn\u2019t an expert on Vulpix move lists), and was showcasing it by easily dragging Ali through the hallways at a decent pace almost as if the petite Quilava girl was nothing more than a rag doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sense, Ali could\u2019ve been considered a little jealous of Ember \u2013 Heck, those melons she was smuggling under that tight shirt were already competing in the size competition with Fontina\u2019s (and that icy bitch \u2013 Suzu\u2019s), and she wouldn\u2019t have minded having that strength and agility\u2026 Of course she wouldn\u2019t want the rest of Ember, all that flab. <i>\u2018How much do you have to eat to get that big?! And considering how quick this girl moves, how has she not burned any of that flab off?!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ali wouldn\u2019t get the answer to those questions in her head for as the two were going through the hallways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi! Wait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber came to a quick stop, which made Ali go skidding directly into the two beanbags that were Ember\u2019s behind and forced her from the vulpix\u2019s surprisingly strong grip. Almost like she was being pushed back by rubber, Ali was flung backwards right into the person who had just called out to the two Freshmen Fire types which was none other than\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, my, miss, are you alright?\u201d Vayne questioned as he gently caught Ali before she crashed into him. \u201cYou just seem to get into more and more trouble every time we cross paths!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli yanked herself from Vayne, surprising the Arcanine Moemon, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s because your insanity keeps bringing me bad luck? What the heck are you doing here anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to Ali\u2019s comments, Vayne just snickered with his arms crossed, \u201cHmm, maybe! Maybe! As to answer your question, Nurse Shera asked me to accompany you two to the cafeteria, after all, you\u2019re both freshmen and I doubt that you two know where to find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, Ali had to give him that. The only cafeteria she knew was in the dorm she was in, and from what she could gather, she wouldn\u2019t have enough time to get there and back before she had to get back to classes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber knows!\u201d Ember announced, surprising both of the other Fire-Types. \u201cIn fact, I work in the cafeteria before school! So, I can get us there quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was actually thankful to know the portly Vulpix\u2026 At least until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! But you can come too, scruffy man!\u201d Ember offered, holding a hand up to Vayne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you little miss!\u201d Vayne laughed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that Ali knew that the chances of her having a normal social life while at this school were quickly disappearing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even five minutes passed when the three fire types arrived in the kitchen \u2013 The very kitchen of the school, with all the brush steel, the lovely mixture of aromas, and even the large looming shadows that a student could want. Although, this did bring up a question or two\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are we in here?\u201d Ali asked bluntly as she pulled her hand away from Ember\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber released her hand on Vayne (who took a moment to rub his sore hand slightly) and smiled brightly at both Ali and Vayne, \u201cMy boss wanted me to have lunch with her today! She\u2019s having a couple of her sisters for lunch too and said that I should bring some friends with me to lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, what an honor young miss!\u201d Vayne laughed loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ali didn\u2019t have the same sentiments as the Arcanine Moemon had, she was still a little sore (both metaphorically and physically) from the loss at the hands of that snobby Snivy \u2013 Lilian and her overly chest-inflated maid \u2013 Suzu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ali\u2019s thoughts were once again interrupted when Ember appeared in front of her with a small box that was filled with blue colored berries (that seemed to have a waxy scent to them). \u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Ember gleefully offered as she placed a berry in Ali\u2019s hands and began to walk over to Vayne. \u201cWhile we wait for Miss Blaire, help yourselves to a Wacan Berry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Ember held one up to Vayne, the heroic Arcanine Moemon jumped back slightly with his hands held up. \u201cS-Sorry, but I must pass\u2026 I\u2019m actually allergic to these kinds of berries, last time I had one, I was bedridden for a week! And as a warrior of justice, I cannot afford to get sick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli snickered slightly when she saw the \u2018hero\u2019 of a Moemon show fear for a tiny little berry\u2026 Albeit, the berry had a weird smell to it, like it was incense or something like that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could the harm in one little bite be?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cool, crisp morning at Gijinka Academy, the sun was barely even rising over the island designed academy. Most of the students were still sleeping in the dorms that sat parallel to each other, however there were a few students who were up at this hour (like the energized Jolteon Moemon that was running laps around the school grounds). The main building itself was as dark as the night, save for a few lights that were on and showed that there was activity going on in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne light belonged to the library, where only one figure was inside, with a large amount of books surrounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh literature\u2026 You truly are the best way to wake up in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library itself was quite impressive, with two floors of shelves that contained a near unlimited number of books that lined the walls and stand up shelves. Famous works, student papers, and even a section of manga (courtesy of a familiar Dragonair Principal) \u2013 whatever your taste in genre and need of references, you could find it here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front desk, there were several large piles of books atop of the desk. And seated behind the piles of books was the rumored \u2018Blue Rose of the Library\u2019 \u2013 one Vaporeon Moemon known as Fontina with a book in her hands. She was a young blossoming woman, with short blue hair that was pulled from her beautiful, glasses-wearing face. She was dressed in a white blouse with a long blue skirt that went down to her ankles, and her clothes hugged onto her ample curves, showing off her hourglass figure in the works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read the book, Fontina sighed to herself, her mind placing her in the place of the main heroine in the story\u2026 Being swept up into the arms a handsome, and rugged Lucario Moemon with a muscular body dressed in thin blue clothing that exposed a lot of muscular, tanned skin with his long black hair billowing in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s heart began to beat faster and faster as her mind began to picture her face growing closer and closer towards the Lucario moemon\u2019s face, their mouths only inches away from each other\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost feel his warm breath caressing her lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Ms. Fontina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontia snapped out of her fantasy, throwing the book in her hands up into the air, \u201cGARGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Daydreaming again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s face was a bright crimson as she realized that standing in front of the desk was a relatively handsome older man, dressed in a bright red leisure suit. He had tanned skin and bright, golden blonde hair that was tied back into nine long pony tails that he had a few draped over his shoulders while others were left to hang freely behind his back. The man raised an eyebrow behind his red tinted glasses at the sight of the younger woman\u2019s flushed face. \u201cSorry for scaring you Ms. Fontina\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Not a problem, Mr. Sunny!\u201d Fontina yelped as she bowed slightly towards the Ninetails Moemon that stood before her. \u201cI\u2026 I just got caught up in the\u2026 Heat of the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all have those moments, Ms. Fontina,\u201d Mr. Sunny chuckled as he held up a book. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve known you for about three years now Ms. Fontina, as your Vice Principal, I know what makes you tick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Mr. Sunny was the current Vice Principal of this fine Gijinka Academy, he was set to become the principal this year\u2026 But\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, r-right,\u201d Fontina muttered as she rubbed the back of her head. \u201cSo, c-can I help you today Mr. Sunny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, just hoping to get some quiet time before I have to deal with the new headache of a principal,\u201d Mr. Sunny growled loudly as he crossed his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of problems to him and he seems to be underestimating the job. And frankly\u2026 With freshman orientation going on today\u2026 Gagh. I picked a good time to give up cigarettes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d Fontina chuckled nervously. \u201cWe can only hope that he\u2019ll be good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fat chance,\u201d Mr. Sunny sighed loudly. \u201cIn any case, thanks for taking the librarian position\u2026 I guess it beats hanging around the dorms during the first two class periods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoy this work,\u201d Fontina answered back, smiling at the books around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep up the good work then,\u201d Mr. Sunny replied as he began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed in relief, Mr. Sunny was normally a nice person, but ever since he learned that the principal position was given to a \u2018Don Tanner\u2019, he seemed to be a bit more on edge recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Where\u2019d the book go?\u2019 Fontina questioned as she looked around, trying to find the book she had just thrown.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She scattered tomes delicately if not just a little haphazardly, \"Ohh...\" Fontina moaned as she bit the curvature of her index finger, \"Where is it?\" she whined, not finding her somewhat lusty tome of literature anywhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she <i>was</i> pretty startled when Mr. Sunny interrupted her. And, quite familiar with her own habits and excitable nature, it wasn't a stretch that the feeling of launching out of her own skin was actually just her book flying out of her hands and landing somewhere in the library. Realizing this, Fontina soon grew red with embarrassment and started looking in the other aisles. \"I hope I didn't hit anybody...\" she said quietly to herself as she searched the rows in front of her. Finally finding it, three rows down the line, Fontina just smiled and let bygones be bygones, quickly thumbing open the book back to her previous page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she skimmed through the words, Fontina found it noticeably harder than before to get as lost in the literature. The elements were all there; a quiet library, the musty perfume of time-worn pages,  the lusty yet swashbuckling adventures of Pirate Captain Raymundo the Lucario moemon nestled firmly within her grasp. Yes, it seemed like the perfect way to start anybody's first day of senior year, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud grumbling noises emanating from her stomach were far from soothing and did little to contribute to the overall mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina grumbled as she looked down at her waist, rather what she could see past her blossoming breasts. Puberty had hit her like a ton of bricks, it seemed, and felt it necessary to \"bless\" her with breasts the size of melons. Not only were they cumbersome, but it was kind of hard to get close to anybody... both emotionally and physically. They, along with her full hips and supple rear, were just the unwanted gift of growing up. There were plenty of days Fontina wished that she could just go back to being that cute little Eevee moemon. But those days had their downsides too, namely one that she was <i>still</i> trying to rid herself of: baby fat. Even at her age, Fontina still had a small layer of chub present from her childhood days of yore. It wasn't all too bad... but it did get to her at times. Namely now, when the pudge demanded to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a low whine as she touched her relatively flat stomach; \"Skipping breakfast is never good...\" she grumbled, resigning quite easily to the whims of her appetite<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking her watch, 6:45, and deeming it plenty of time before class started and she would be required to stay in the library, Fontina decided that a little pre-duty breakfast would do her some good. She grabbed an armful of books and walked out of the spacious library. Even more exciting still, this would be the first time since last year that she got to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fontina!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the serving counter of the school's cafeteria, there was a large staff of various breeding that tended to the school's menu for breakfast and lunch, usually even whipping up a little something for dinner, considering the large majority of students who couldn't cook. In charge of that whole staff was Blaire, one of the most talented culinary prodigies in Kanto and Fontina's biggest sister. Though once only determined by age, the years of sampling her own cuisine had certainly given a new meaning to the title \"biggest sister\". In the short years after graduation, Blaire's waistline had expanded from itty-bitty to exponentially wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaire's short red hair just barely scorched the already golden brown of her forehead, though most of it was hidden by a required hairnet. Her face was innocently cherubic, with a set of matching chins and full, round cheeks that dimpled as when she smiled. Her breasts, humongous being the only words to describe them at this point, hung heavily atop the fleshy foundation that was her draping stomach; said stomach so large that even now, standing a good two feet away from the counter, was deeply cut by the long silver handle of her tray. And while it wasn't visible, Fontina knew her sister. If she had to guess, Blaire was probably wearing some hot-pants right now. She never really <i>did</i> accept that whole \"fat girl\" fashion very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blaire!\", Fontina greeted her older sister enthusiastically. Her family had always been close, and it really upset her that she wasn't allowed to come home after school ended last year. As such, she felt a sort of hole that needed to be filled with Blaire. Maybe she should invite her back to her dorm once in a while to make up for lost time? \"How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just <i>awesome</i>!\" she said excitedly, getting that little wrinkle on the bridge of her nose as she smiled emphatically, \"Mr. Sunny signed the school up to deal with some new ingredients from Orre. My crew and I have been working with them all summer!\" the massive moemon giggled as she lifted the metal lid off of a piping hot bin of oatmeal. \"Oh, really? Is that why you couldn't come home?\" Fontina asked, inquisitive nature taking predominance over appetite. \"Yeah, Sunny paid us overtime for it, so I guess I don't mind too much.\" she said nonchalantly, turning apologetic quickly, \"But I missed you guys <i>so</i> much! How's Mom? Did you tell her I said hi? Ooh, what about Miyu, she's supposed to be enrolling this year; I'm so excited!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina laughed, Blaire always did her best to keep up with the family. \"She's great, yes I did, and I'm pretty excited myself.\" the water-type said casually, \"Maybe entering school will finally get her off her butt and doing something.\" they shared an innocent laugh at the absent Leafeon sibling. \"So how about some food? I'll bet you're starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read my mind, sis.\"</span></div></div>",

Then again, knowing that if a member of the faculty (and her BIGGER sister Blaire) invited a student, they were allowed to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrrrrrgggggggglllllllleeeeeee\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s light face was now peppered with a healthy blush as she ran her hands to her stomach, trying to prevent the relatively flat (if not soft) belly from sending complaints about being empty. However, Blaire\u2019s keen senses had caught the growl and red on her little sister\u2019s face, \u201cHeh, looks like your stomach answered for you! Now, this is a request from your older sister, just come around the counter and I\u2019ll give you a free sample of what we\u2019ve got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Alright,\u201d Fontina chuckled sheepishly as she walked towards the opened end of the counter where kitchen staff was allowed to enter and exit the counter in front of the kitchen. Fontina sighed to herself as she slowly began to pass the counter, she knew that she couldn\u2019t say no to Blaire, which was partially some of the reason why her figure was so\u2026 <b>Va-Va-Voom</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Time for Fontina\u2019s super secret sampler breakfast!\u201d Blaire giggled as she turned from the counter and began to disappear into the kitchen, Fontina closely following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Fontina was able to confirm something \u2013 Blaire was wearing a large pair of black hot pants that hugged her massive tush and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TTTTTTTTT</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving Fontina a spare hairnet, the large Flareon Moemon led her curvy, younger sister into the kitchen. The inside of the kitchen was nothing short of impressive as the rest of the academy, brush steel as far as the eye could see with several stoves, fridges, ovens, counters, hanging cooking utensils and other things anyone would find in any other kitchen \u2013 Albeit this one was about five times larger than a home kitchen, especially in the kitchen back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Fontina noted was that it seemed that she and Blaire were the only two in the kitchen at the moment, \u201cUm, sister, where is everyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, probably on break,\u201d Blaire answered as she walked/waddled through the kitchen, trying to make sure her humongous girth or watermelon sized breasts didn\u2019t bump into something. \u201cWe just got done cooking a few minutes before you got here, Fontina. We usually let the other guys go out for a few minutes before the breakfast rush comes into play \u2013 Although, as head chef here, I have to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it get a little much to watch all this food?\u201d Fontina questioned as she looked into a mixing bowl that seemed to have pancake batter in it (along with what appeared to be humongous chocolate chips). \u201cI mean, all by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d Blaire answered as she turned over her shoulder, smiling bright at her little sister. \u201cI\u2019ve got my number one assistant in here with me! She\u2019s a freshman this year, but she\u2019s helped out over the summer\u2026 In fact, maybe you should meet her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that would be nice,\u201d Fontina replied with a warm smile, at least there was one person helping her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Ember!\u201d Blaire yelled out, making Fontina jump slightly (and making her bountiful breasts bounce at the same time). \u201cYou in here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeppers Miss Blaire!\u201d A cute, cherubic voice sounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina had to blink a few times when she saw Blaire\u2019s assistant walk out from behind one of the taller counters, seeing a girl who was roughly her new roommate Ali\u2019s height \u2013 She was even a fire type, a Vulpix Moemon actually, but unlike her short, petite Quilava roommate, this young girl was almost like a mini version of Blaire herself! The cute girl\u2019s curly, crimson hair was held above her head with a hair net keeping the curly locks out of her bronze colored skin and cute cherubic face. Her body type was almost like Blaire\u2019s save for the fact that she was about two feet shorter than her older, Flareon counterpart, so Ember\u2019s figure was actually wider. She was wearing a black skirt (Fontina: \u2018<i>How much fabric is that!?</i>\u2019) that brush over her meaty thighs and large rump, with a large apron that barely covered her expansive gut and bulbous breasts (which, if Fontina had to ballpark, were actually larger than her own!). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber,\u201d Blaire started holding a chubby hand to the slightly puzzled Fontina. \u201cThis is my younger sister, Fontina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Nice to meet you!\u201d Ember greeted with a slight curtsey. \u201cMiss Blaire\u2019s been telling me a lot about you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Fontina chuckled sheepishly as her face went a little red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Ember, did you get what I asked for?\u201d Blaire asked, garnering the attention back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Yep!\u201d Ember nodded, making her whole body jiggle like jelly. \u201cI got on the counter away from all the other food! But\u2026 Miss Ember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Ember questioned with her head tilted. \u201cIs something wrong dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t reach the juice in the fridge,\u201d Ember answered with a large blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaire chuckled to herself as she shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that Ember, I forgot I left it on the top shelf in the fridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the elder sister pointed towards the counter where Ember had come from, a smile on her face, \u201cFontina, I asked Ember to get some of the foods from Orre, so, you can help yourself while I help my mini me with the juice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Fontina replied as she watched the two fire-type Moemon waddle towards the line of fridges. As soon as they passed the counter, Fontina quickly made her way to the counter in question\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Fontina had to clean her glasses at the food on the counter \u2013 The shear amount was amazing! Meats, cheeses, premade food, fruits and vegetables \u2013 all of them of greater sizes that what they normally were in other regions. \u2018<i>This is amazing! I didn\u2019t know that peppers could grow that big</i>!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something else that caught Fontina\u2019s eye \u2013 There was a small wooden box that was opened up to reveal another weird fruit\u2026 It looked like an apple, but it was blue! A little curious, Fontina lifted the blue apple from its container and looked at it, \u2018<i>What kind of fruit is this supposed to be? Some sort of gag food or something?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina took a whiff of it. There didn\u2019t seem to be any paint smell\u2026 And it was with the other food that her sister and Ember had laid out\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be bad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fontina took another whiff; nope, definitely no spraypaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had detected was much more of an intoxicating aroma. Where the odor of apples was quite familiar to her as one of a relative smooth and fruity texture, the strange fruit in front of her had one that seemed to suffocate her nostrils. It was the same overall smell, just an overpowering dose of it mixed with something that reeked of onions. It wasn't a very compelling smell, Fontina would give it that. But somehow the harsh blend of perfumes that clung so desperately to only that bunch of blue fruits seemed to take her breath away. At once it sapped the energy from this excitable Vaporeon moemon, she almost felt the need to pull up a chair before she toppled over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, Fontina inched the odorous confection to her mouth, opening her lips and prepping her teeth for a big wide bite. Her pearly whites positioned themselves into a petite, ladylike bite around the cobalt surface of this mysterious berry before sinking them into its crunchy texture. All at once, an explosion of a sour bitterness was set off and carpet-bombed Fontina's unprepared taste buds. She liked it. Oddly enough, this foul mixture of sweet, fruity, sour, and gym socks seemed to work. If not just for her. She pulled the hand fruit away from her, checking it out for anything that might be wrong. On the inside, this fruit was more unappealing than its blue skin led it on to be. It looked more like apple <i>sauce</i> than the fruit it was actually supposed to resemble. Mushy and strange, this fruit's pungent aroma was definitely not the last of its worrying composition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew!\" she heard from her right side, Blaire had apparently retrieved the much desired juice box for her adorable little assistant and worked her way back to Fontina's sight. \"You actually like those things?\" she asked teasingly, crinkling her nose a little as she wretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know...\" Fontina said bashfully, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaire waddled up beside her little sister and started packing up ingredients for her breakfast sampler, since obviously her little sister had lost that sense of taste that Blaire had worked so hard to instill within her. \"Its a fruit native to Orre, just like all this stuff.\" the stout Flareon moemon explained matter of factly as she gathered up seemingly random articles of food, \"Its a traditional fruit though, only found in certain areas of that old ball of dirt and a few parts of Hoenn; we got it prepackaged and sent to us so that we wouldn't have to recreate the Wacan Berry sitting in Lax Incense for three weeks, but after we run out we'll have to start growing our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina wretched slightly as she looked over the fruit in question, \"Ew, like, <i>incense</i>?\" she repeated, \"Aren't you not supposed to eat that stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you're a Snorlax moemon looking to make some chubby little babies.\" Blaire joked, \"Its a real aphrodisiac to those guys, but it just slows a poor girl's metabolism down to near zilcho\" she said in an exasperated tone, laying out some Orre-grown tortillas and sprinkling on some scrambled eggs, \"Seriously, I ate like one bite and didn't feel like getting up for a whole week.\" The feeling really hit a home run for Fontina, she could really have gone for a place to sit down right about now. \"But that's just nuts, everyone knows you're not supposed to eat incense!\" the blue-haired belle said frantically. \"Don't look at me, I'm only supposed to cook this stuff.\" Blaire grunted as she blanketed the eggs with bacon, \"I said the exact same thing, but Mr. Sunny just won't listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorriedly, Fontina looked down at her stomach; dreading the fabled horror stories of this fruit's mystical sway into the ways of the laze. She really couldn't afford any more unsightly pounds or inches to her already voluptuous frame! She was already down to her biggest bras, any more and she'd have to replace all of them! \"Um, Blaire?\" she asked nervously as her fingers slowly pulled the hairnet off of her head, \"I-I think I'd better go, I shouldn't risk it. I mean, I ate a big bite of that fruit, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense.\" Blaire said dismissively as she whipped out the sour cream, \"I'm just teasing you, it's just like eating a cupcake or something- its not good for you, but its not gonna make you blow up like your big sister Blaire.\" she laughed, sending her entire body into a fuss as it jiggled wildly, \"It didn't do a thing to Ember, she liked it too! Now go siddown, I'll make ya some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Fontina was never really one for conflict, especially not with Blaire. Taking her sister's advice, Fontina decided to put the fruit completely out of sight and mind, disposing of the sapphire sphere in the garbage can as she stepped out from behind the counter. \"Hey, not in there!\" Blaire barked, reaching into the otherwise empty can and fishing out the berry, \"I've still gotta adhere to a budget!\" she blew on it and set it next to her, right where she could see it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Breakfast is served!\" Blaire cheered as she held a big platter of food in front of her, resting the silver tray in the crevice where her breasts met her spare tire, \"There's enough for you and me here, we can catch up like good sisters do!\" she said, happily plopping down next to Fontina on one of the cafeteria tables. She had gone all out with a myriad of options; a small stack of breakfast burritos, some oatmeal, bagels, a batch of muffins, where did she get the time to prepare all of this food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter, Fontina had never been one to pass up a good old fashioned meal courtesy of her big sister Blaire. She smiled cheerfully and thanked her sister kindly before grabbing a bagel and the butter. Blaire took two burritos for herself along with a muffin and pulled out some strawberry jam. \"So, Blaire, you're <i>sure</i> that fruit was okay for me to eat, right?\" Fontina said warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Fonty? You're still thinking about that?\" Blaire rolled her eyes, \"I told you its fine, and that <i>you'll</i> be fine. Seriously, when are you gonna grow up and learn to listen to your Big Sister Blaire. You know I've always been right about everything.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome on Fonty,\u201d Blaire pouted with her large eyes gleaming at her smaller sister as she munched on both of the breakfast burritos at the same time. \u201cYou\u2019re a growing girl! Ya gotta have more than just a bagel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes,\u201d Fontina sputtered as she pulled the half eaten bagel from her lips, which had curled into a slightly nervous smile on her face. \u201cBut, you k-know me, I\u2019m always trying to watch my weight and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fontina could continue, Blaire had placed her fingers onto Fontina\u2019s lips, making the dark blue haired beauty from speaking. \u201cNonsense! Fontina, you don\u2019t need to worry about such things! Heck, you\u2019re one of the prettiest things on this campus, and you have been for the past few years! One big breakfast with your big sis isn\u2019t going to ruin that figure of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina pulled back slightly with her cheeks a little flushed from what her sister had told her, and began to speak. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you mention that fruit again,\u201d Blaire sighed loudly as she crossed her arms under her meaty bust. \u201cThen I may just have to get Noir and Pamela in on this, and you know that you can never disagree with all three of us teaming up on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed loudly, both out of exasperation and fear, she knew that her older siblings were like second parents to her and sometimes they acted as good advisors\u2026 And if all three of them were working together on something then they were practically unstoppable when it came to convincing people. \u201cA-Alright\u2026 I guess a little more couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat to hear!\u201d Blaire gleefully laughed before she ripped into the remains of her two breakfast burritos. After polishing off the breakfast foods, the large Flareon Moemon smiled brightly at Fontina. \u201cAnd you need to relax Fontina, you\u2019re like those people who get bent out of shape whenever there\u2019s a new disease mentioned in the news, you think you\u2019ve got all the symptoms and you think that you\u2019ve got it \u2013 When in fact, your mind is tricking you into thinking that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fontina listened to Blaire\u2019s explanation, she did have to admit that Blaire did have a point about that \u2013 Combined with all the stress of her final year at the academy and her \u2018out growing\u2019 of her unmentionables, Fontina\u2019s mind could just be playing tricks on her. It was a reasonable explanation about Fontina\u2019s earlier thought processes for sitting down, and it was just a berry soaked in incense \u2013 That can\u2019t have any effect on her body, or at least not a drastic one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with her mind cleared of that little misconception, Fontina gleefully finished off her bagel and was reaching for one of those breakfast burritos that Blaire had eaten earlier \u2013 They did smell pretty good. And the fresh cut fruit platter that Blaire brought out as well was so cute \u2013 The apple slices were cut to resemble little rabbits, and they were also coated in cinnamon as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No wonder Blaire didn\u2019t come home much of the summer,\u2019</i> Fontina thought as she plucked one of the cinnamon apple rabbits into her mouth, allowing the taste to set in her mouth \u2013 A sweet if not zesty taste melted into her tongue as she chewed. \u2018<i>She\u2019s really gotten better!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fontina knew it, she had already eaten half of the fruit platter, a couple of muffins and about five of the remaining breakfast burritos, which was about three behind Blaire\u2019s amount. The Vaporeon Moemon was practically lost amongst the bountiful tastes that were mixing in her mouth, she had almost forgotten about how good Blaire\u2019s food was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at Blaire, it was apparent that she didn\u2019t forget how good her cooking was, she was eating more of the food she had gotten out (which made Fontina rather thankful, most of the food was going into her bigger sister!). In fact, if Fontina didn\u2019t know it, she could\u2019ve sworn that Blaire might\u2019ve put on quite a few other pounds over the summer break\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina would\u2019ve continued her train of thought but\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...a distinctly familiar sense of vibration traveled up Fontina's leg just as she was about to choke down whatever scraps had been left over so Blaire wouldn't have anything to whine about. Under normal circumstances, a call during a strictly family occasion was forbidden. However since her poor stomach felt like it was about to explode, Fontina chalked it up to fate and whipped out her cell phone. \"Ooh, now who could be calling my baby sister so early in the morning?\" Blaire teased, leaning into the table and resting a cheek in her softly padded hand playfully, \"Does little Fonty finally have a boyfriend to bug her?\" her statement was dotted with cutesy kissy noises and short chuckles, much to the addressed girl's dismay. \"N-No!\" she retorted in a heaping hue of red, \"I-I mean, I don't have a boyfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, caller ID revealed the mystery dialer to be Lynndelle Laurel; a sweet moemon known throughout the academy for her good looks and enamoring personality. It seemed fitting that she and Fontina get along so well, all things considered. Fontina's thumb flipped the lid open and she pecked 'TALK' with her index finger. \"Hello?\" she answered cheerily, always the morning person. \"Hi Fontina, its Lynn.\" the voice on the other end answered gracefully, \"I, um, just wanted to see if we could hang out a little before classes start; I haven't seen you all Summer, and I wanted to catch up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...\" Fontina turned to face Blaire's cherubic countenance, who simply smiled in the way that fully-grown sisters do when they realize that their younger siblings have been offered a chance to hang out with friends in lieu of spending time with them. \"Blaire, I um, really don't mean to be rude... you're my big sister and all, but...\" the hefty Flareon woman simply waved dismissively at the worrysome sister in front of her. \"Go on, its cool, I'm not going anywhere.\" she said laxly, \"Tell you what; we'll meet up at lunchtime.\" Fontina's eyebrows flexed upwards frettingly, \"Oh... but, you cooked so much.\" However she was defeated by a hearty laugh from her older sister, \"Go on, get outta here. I'll just split what's left over with my Mini-me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina smiled widely as she turned her attention back to the phone. \"Yes, I'm still here.\" she said gently into the speaker, \"Gardening Club? I can be there in like, five minutes... alright, see you then. Bye!\" she clicked the phone shut and slowly rose to her feet with some labored difficulty. Her stomach, taut and stuffed, was just barely noticeable from underneath her top, and while it was all but inconspicuous, it seemed to pain Fontina greatly. She brushed it gently with the back of her hand and nearly wretched at the slight pressure. \"Oh...\" she said quietly to herself. \"Hm?\" Blaire asked, still in her playfully flirtatious position, \"What was that?\" Fontina snapped back to reality, \"Um, just that... I'm sorry, I've got to go meet Lynn at her Gardening Club.\" she said quietly, \"I mean, I know I haven't seen either of you all Summer, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop worrying, my feelings ain't hurt!\" Blaire said sternly, \"Now go on, I'll catch up with you at lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Blaire.\" Fontina half-apologized-half-thanked her bigger sister as she started towards the cafeteria's exit. \"Hey, hold up a sec!\" Blaire called after her, struggling to heft her heavy body from her seat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not leaving your poor sister all alone without even a hug, are you?\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nAnd what a hug it was. But that's almost completely trivial. Currently occurring, Fontina was making a long venture down a previously unvisited hallway that she wasn't even aware existed. She was fluent in all areas of the school, having been a vital part to the student body through her sophomore and junior years, and knew just about where everything was. The busty Vaporeon girl could have <i>sworn</i> that she had been down every hallway at least once in this expansive school- and that in itself was an accomplishment. Maybe they did some remodeling during the summer? She couldn't imagine why, the school was already big enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter. Room 563 was upon her; within sight and smell, Fontina could tell that the Gardening Club was close by. The overpowering aroma of dirt and a myriad of flora wafted up and about Fontina's delicate nose, irritating her sensitive capillaries. It was a hot, thick scent that filled the hallway. It was an absolutely intoxicating smell that unfortunately had proved strong enough to leak through the sealed doors of Lynn's Gardening Club. The ghastly aroma was so powerful, in fact, that it belabored Fontina's breathing. It left her panting, struggling for air. Her forehead grew heavy with sweat, and her glasses fogged. Yet, it seemed so familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fontina!\" a familiar voice rang throughout the hallway, seeming to come from the very source of the smell. \"Hey, Fontina, over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was relieved to see that Lynn had found her, rather than the opposite. It would have taken her forever to lug herself over to the Gardening Club at this rate. It honestly felt like her feet had been encased in concrete; she was so slow! \"Oh, hey...\" Fontina said meekly, letting out a big yawn as she plodded over to her friend, \"...hey Lynn.\" The younger girl quirked her head, \"Are you alright?\" the Bayleef moemon asked, concernedly placing a hand on Fontina's forehead. \"You don't have a fever, have you been getting enough sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in the spirit of the currently absent Quilava moemon Ali, Fontina couldn't help but notice Lynn's surprisingly enhanced gazongas. \"Holy crap!\" Fontina shouted, temporarily awake due to shock. \"What? What's wrong?!\" Lynn asked, whipping her hand back. \"Y-Your breasts!\" Fontina mumbled, \"I mean, I knew they were always pretty, um, just... wow!\" she seemed even too bothered to dip into her expansive vocabulary. What was wrong with her? More importantly though, how did Lynn sprout such gigantic boobies?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... these?\" Lynn asked in a flighty voice as she looked down at her endowment, \"I guess they sort of popped up over Summer break.\" she said in an embarrassed tone of voice, \"They're really not so great... I don't see how you do it, Fontina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Fontina's already red face turned even darker. \"Oh, wow, that's... well, I guess you get why I'm always complaining about them, huh?\" she giggled. Lynn seemed unaffected by the strange odor in the hallway. Perhaps it was just Fontina? \"Anyway, I kind've have an ulterior motive for inviting you down here... I mean, I really want to hang out, but there's something I need help with...</span></div></div>",

You okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty Vaporeon shook her head slightly when she realized that Lynn was speaking to her, making Fontina\u2019s face turn a bit more red \u2013 Even more so than when she was gazing at the Bayleaf\u2019s surprising increased chest size. \u201cS-Sorry, I\u2019ve been zoning in and out all morning\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Hmm, lemme guess,\u201d Lynn snickered with a warm smile on her face as she stood alongside Fontina, gently placing her hands on the Vaporeon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cPirate Captain Raymundo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s face was so red that steam was flying off of her face and steamed up her glasses\u2026 Or maybe that was the muggy atmosphere of the green house? Either way, Fontina was embarrassed, was she as easily readable just like the books she loved so much? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like she could take it back. \u201cS-So\u2026 Who\u2019s this n-new member?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUm, some Leafeon girl,\u201d Lynn stated as she began to gently push her friend through the greenhouse. \u201cAt first I thought she\u2019d be a real great help, but like I said, ever since she\u2019s gotten here, all she does is laze about and munches on some of the berries that Mr. Sunny gave us to cultivate. And I\u2019ve gotten so much stuff to move around that I won\u2019t be able to finish it all before class starts\u2026 At least, not on my own. So, what do you say Fontina, can you please help out a good ole friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lynn, you don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d Fontina replied as the two rounded a table that was filled to the brim with various plants. \u201cI would be more than happy to help out a friend, I wouldn\u2019t be much of a friend if didn\u2019t help right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Besides, if this Leafeon girl is who I think it is\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the two reached the other end of the table, which was effectively at the other end of the room, there was a large pile of boxes with Unova\u2019s marking on the sides of them. The sun was gleaming over them and onto the floor in between them\u2026 as well as the pair of hams stuffed into a pair of khaki shorts that almost looked painted on. Fontina\u2019s eyes went a little dull when she saw that, it wasn\u2019t the first time she saw those thunderous thighs\u2026 At least they had pants on during school hours, thank goodness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPst!\u201d Lynn whispered to Fontina. \u201cThat\u2019s her, that\u2019s\u2026 Uh, w-what was her name again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiyu,\u201d Fontina sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! That\u2019s it!\u201d Lynn cheered slightly as she pointed towards the large hams stuffed in the khaki shorts. \u201cWait\u2026 How\u2019d you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiyu, get up,\u201d Fontina sighed again as she tapped her foot against the khaki clad bum. \u201cStop lazing about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud groan echoed through the greenhouse, making the legs and buns push themselves onto their feet, and slowly the body that was connected to those chunky thighs and bum stood up straight and turned around. \u201cFonty? Is that *yawn* you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in front of both Lynn and Fontina was indeed a Leafeon Moemon, with long cascading forest green hair that looked to be leafy with quite a few strands popping atop of her hair. She was dressed in a black belly shirt that was a little short around her bulging belly and as mentioned, she was wearing a pair of khaki cargo pants, which, now that she was standing up, showed that they weren\u2019t painted on, but were still tight enough to show her chunky rear and thunderous thighs. In all honesty from her cute face, chest, and arms \u2013 she looked like a slim girl, but as you traveled downward, her body began to widen out, giving her a pear like shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyu yawned loudly, as she revealed a small blue stain around her mouth that she quickly wiped away with her arm. \u201cWhat are *yawn* you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d Lynn questioned blinking a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Fontina explained with a smile, albeit there was a little bit of embarrassment as evidenced by the blush on her face. \u201cMiyu, you never said that you joined the gardening club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d Miyu questioned with her head tilted slightly. \u201cOh yeah, I joined the gardening club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina slapped her head as Lynn walked past her and examined one of the boxes that was on the ground, \u201cMiyu\u2026 Did you open another box of these things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to be a bit more specific,\u201d Miyu yawned again as she turned towards Lynn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Wacan Berries,\u201d Lynn sighed loudly as she turned the box upside down, showing that there wasn\u2019t any more berries inside the box. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep eating them, we\u2019re supposed to grow them for Mr. Sunny, otherwise we\u2019ll never get the extra funds that we need for our club!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Mr. Sunny\u2019s growing plants here?</i>\u2019 Fontina thought to herself, blinking a few times behind her glasses. With a shake of her head, Fontina turned her attention back to Miyu. \u201cAnyway, Miyu, you joined the club, so you gotta help out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Whatever,\u201d Miyu yawned loudly. \u201cFine, what do you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll we gotta do is move the boxes to the other side of the room,\u201d Lynn explained, motioning to the large amount of boxes that were around her. \u201cIf all three of us work together and get this done, then we can get it done quickly and maybe just hang out before classes begin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Fontina stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Miyu yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uuuuuugh!\" Miyu's groans of protest were an absolute constant during this stressing ordeal; made even moreso by said complaints, \"This is so haaaaaard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one were to simply overhear her complaining, you'd think that the lazy leafy lass had done the work of ten strapping young men; one obviously being misled. She had actually barely touched any of the Unovian crates aside from the flapping tops, while the set of busty upperclassmen did their best and toiled their way into a slow, steady succession of moved boxes (revealing that amongst them all were once desks, lost to the Summer's sudden acquirement of berries and incense) onto the other side of the room. All the while, Miyu had touched maybe three or four of the twenty-five or so crates once the job was said and done. Leaving ten for Lynn to haul and Fontina with eleven. Of course, while the laziest girl in the room was the most vocal in her displeasures, Lynn and Fontina weren't exactly having the times of their lives either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boxes were heavy and cumbersome, loaded to the brim with berries upon berries that while small were certainly a very heavy classification all their own; a two-foot cube of them must have weighed about thirty or so pounds. That alone was nothing, but the awkwardly robust carrier crates were the real problem- being a challenge to load and unload- combined with the twin set of aching backs that belonged to the more well-endowed ladies in the classroom. After all was said and done, things had gotten finished. After school, Lynn would surely lead her gardening club out into their designated pastures and start planting these babies; earning that extra funding through hard work as it should be. Oh how Lynn adored the toil of the commonwealth, something so foreign to her own sheltered childhood. It made her feel warm inside knowing that she was helping Mother Earth in the natural cycle of plant-replant-plant. Plus, the extra funding would certainly help her all-but-dud of a club...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud plopping sound in the corner of the room. Miyu, who had been tasked with delivering the last of the crates over to the cubic mountain in the corner, had finally allowed her pathetic muscles to give out. She doubled over herself, tired and far beyond winded. The bottom-heavy moemon's package fell to the floor and her bum soon atop that, her apple bottom forcing the box's sides to flare out very much like her own hips. \"Ahh...\" she blissfully sighed, leaning back until her neck touched the uneven exposure of the front of a desk, \"I'm beat.\" Fontina and Lynn, just as tired from about triple the work, could only shake their heads in shame; but feel a certain sense of comradeship with the lazy Leafeon girl. They too, would kill for a place to sit down right now. Fortunately, since St. Gijinka's was such a generous institution these days, there were plenty of comfortable chairs to rest one's bum in; including a very nice loveseat in the back covered in anti-soil fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should go without saying that Lynn and Fontina decided to rest their pert rumps in said loveseat while Miyu sat on a nearby armchair- dragging the box full of berries over near her for a footrest. \"Well, that went by a lot faster than expected.\" Fontina said cheerfully as she took somewhat labored breaths, \"Great job girls.\" Lynn smiled warmly while Miyu gave a thumbs-up, \"No problem Fonty.\" Both sets of eyes turned to face the current bane of activity and shot her a somewhat upsetting look. \"You touched, like four boxes!\" Fontina admonished, \"You whined almost as hard as we worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the situation was turning ugly, ever-peacekeeping Lynn decided to play mediator with everyone's favorite subject; \"Who wants something to eat?\" she asked in a flighty voice, \"We all worked up such an appetite that I'm sure we've earned a little dip into the supplies here!\" she said nervously, gingerly rising to a leaning position and plucking the footrest from underneath Miyu's feet. \"Hey!\" she whined, \"That was my box!\" <br>\r\n***<br>\r\nNow a little explanation is due to completely understand the meaning behind the mysterious Lax-Wacan delicacy. Supposedly, somewhere in the desert continent of Orre, the Wacan berries grew just as heartily as they did in Hoenn. They were harvested by local farmers and sold on the market for kabillions. This, aside from being generally rare to begin with, made them exceedingly popular. Eventually, don't ask how it happened, a single berry fell into an open thurible of Lax Incense and went unnoticed save for the gradually-changing odor. It stayed for almost a month before it was discovered to be still edible and, while oily, quite deliciously revolting. Seriously, most people hate to love this dish. As the mixture took the best of both components; amplifying the natural insulation powers against electricity and slowing the heartrate of any moemon who eats it, it was originally going to be sold to the Marines (lol, type joke XD) of Orre for faking one of their agents death during capture or times of high crisis. However, as it soon became apparent that this specific berry amplified the mellow conditioning to anyone who inhaled it, the idea was dropped immediately in favor of watching paint dry and pots boil. To this day, this section of Orre is recognized as the largest belt of nonproductivity in the known world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically, this special mixture was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it was in the hands of three inexperienced students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyu was the one who insisted on lighting the incense, and Lynn was the one who got the censer. Fontina was initially against it, but found that for some reason she was just too tired to stand straight. Her back ached from a combination of lifting all those heavy boxes and having such thick curves. Maybe a little relaxation wouldn't kill her, she thought at least she deserved a break. And so as Lynn sat back down, the both of them sank into the deep loveseat like rocks. The verdant girl in the skirt had a heavenly smile on her face, perfectly sculpted facial features beaming elegantly as she and her blue-haired buddy lost themselves to the ocean of relaxation that slowly permeaded them with their Lax waves. Again, it was Miyu who first brought out a handful of berries and began popping them into her mouth like bonbons. Hazy-minded, Lynn and Fontina decided to follow suit. Their natural inhibitions thrown aside by the temptations of tastiness and amusement. They dimwittedly chuckled at everything, sometimes for no reason at all! They just sat there, the Lax incense doing its magic on yet another non-Snorlax victim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of course, as we all know, it made those guys hornier than a Nidoking on Viagra :D</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was rather relaxing, the sounds of the school and students echoing through the background were drowned out by the effects of the incense \u2013 creating an aura of total relaxation around the three girls. Fontina\u2019s earlier troubles were almost melted away as she breathed in more and more of the incense filled air and as for the two grass types\u2026 Well, Lynn was simply giddy as she popped another berry into her mouth and Miyu was already opening up a second box (within the first few minutes they seemed to have been able to clear out a box that was filled with a dozen of the berries).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although her troubles were melting away, Fontina\u2019s dulled logic knew that they were still there in the back of her head. Subconsciously, the Vaporeon girl rubbed her slightly softened stomach \u2013 Not noticing that the big breakfast that she had with Blaire had already digested itself through her stomach \u2013 and moaned slightly. \u201cMiyu\u2026 Y-You should eat t-those\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFontina\u2019s right, Miyu,\u201d Lynn yawned loudly as she leaned over in her seat and pulled the box of berries from the lazy Leafeon, however, the grassy girl had already plucked a few berries from the box and was already munching on them. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat those\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Blaire told me that\u2026 That they\u2026\u201d Fontina muttered loudly, placing her other hand on her chin, trying to gather all of her thoughts. Although, with the incense seeping deeper and deeper into her system, the Voluptuous Vaporeon\u2019s thoughts were getting lazier and cloudier. \u201cWhat did she s-s-say again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno Fonty,\u201d Miyu replied as she tossed the last of berries she grabbed into her gapping maw. \u201cI wasn\u2019t with you when you Blaire said that. All I know is that they\u2019re tasty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe smell\u2019s off putting,\u201d Lynn admitted as she lifted up one of the berries and squeezed it in between her fingers, not realizing that as she squeezed it, a good portion of the juice inside the berry dripped from it and splashed right in between the valley that was her cleavage \u2013 The only instance was that she shivered slightly at the surprisingly cold berry juice contacted with her skin. \u201cBut, after lifting all of those boxes, I\u2019m so tired and hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn gingerly placed the berry into mouth, and slowly chewed it between her teeth a few times before she swallowed it. \u201cAnd for some reason, I can\u2019t get enough of these\u2026 I\u2019m sure two boxes of these little guys won\u2019t change the request that Mr. Sunny asked for. But no more after this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Lynn held the box up to Fontina, making the Vaporeon girl grimace slightly at the sight of the berries. In addition to the one bite that she had from before Blaire had given her breakfast, Fontina had accidentally downed two of the previous berries from the last box, Miyu had eaten a majority of those berries (it was the same box that she had opened before they had moved boxes) while Lynn had eaten more than what the Vaporeon girl had sunk her teeth into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the other two were eating more of them! Fontina didn\u2019t know if the effects of those berries were real or not, but she had been feeling more sluggish from when she took a simple bite from one of them\u2026 But even then, she had already eaten two more! If what Blaire said was true, then Fontina would become a blimp by the end of the\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURK!\u201d Fontina yelped when another berry was pushed into her mouth, almost making her gag as she quickly chewed the berry to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t gag on it. When she looked down, she saw that Miyu\u2019s hand was pulling back, some of the berry juice smeared over her fingers. With a loud audible gulp, Fontina took a few deep breaths before she pushed up her glasses and leered at her younger sister. \u201cM-Miyu!?! W-What in the world are y-y-you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to relax Fonty,\u201d Miyu snickered with a large grin on her face. \u201cIndulging once in a while isn\u2019t going to thicken the thighs or blow up your boobs\u2026 Not that they don\u2019t need any more padding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s face went completely red when she heard her sister say those things, normally Miyu was lazy and not this forward with her opinions. She preferred to just enjoy lazing about and munch on whatever Blaire would serve. Maybe this Lax Incense was having a different effect on the usually lazy Moemon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just relax,\u201d Miyu yawned loudly as she sat back, allowing her cushy behind to seep into the cushioned seat. \u201cAnd take a load off\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hours later\u2026~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 What if they made a car that runs on water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a boat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was practically seeping with lax incense, making the three girls almost slipping from their seats, quite a few emptied boxes of wacan berries scattered amongst the floor \u2013 And yet, there were almost another countless number of the boxes back where the girls had packed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the girls themselves, it was a miracle that they were even awake at this point in time \u2013 Miyu was giddy and snickering to herself as she rubbed her softened stomach. Lynn was trying to clean up the mess with her feet, kicking the boxes with her feet, knocking them to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Fontina\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina slowly lifted up her cell phone, grimacing at the time that was displayed on the phone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:59 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had skipped the two first classes of the semester! And inside, she was feeling horrible about that but there was also that feeling of eating quite a few of those berries that she had hoped to avoid the rest of her life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to make things worse\u2026 Fontina was actually hungry now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">*GURRRGGLLE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GRROWL!*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the sounds of it, she wasn\u2019t the only one hungry in the room\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Fontina was very much aware at how seriously behind schedule she had allowed herself to fall. Or did she allow herself? Was it at all possible to blame these berries? Or maybe it was Miyu's fault; when they were kids she was always getting the whole family behind in their plans due to her strong habit of getting a 12 hour sleep every night. She had missed more school buses that way. Anyway, who ever's fault it was or not, Fontina had seriously failed to keep track of the time and had somehow lost it for almost four hours. And again, somehow, in those four hours she and her two cohorts had gone through an entire box of those Wacan berries- ie the ones that were meant to be planted, harvested and plopped into Lax Incense so that the whole school could eat them! Oh no! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the effects of both components had not left her busty body all too willing to comply with any foolish ideas of \"moving\" (ha, moving. who does that anymore?) As she squeaked out the single word her voice was found to be soft and unassuming- curt and a little raspy. Fontina's throat felt full of sandpaper, a probable side effect of so much grainy-soggy-squishy indulgence combined with the suffocating aroma that filled the room. Her head was swimming, her thoughts fluid and mentally intangible. All at once everything seemed like a brilliant idea even (and especially) forgetting class and simply enjoying more time on the couch with her friend and sister. No doubt they were experiencing the same sapping of motivation and will; but who really gave two flying Squirtles about motivation and will? It seemed to be a general consensus that everyone should just lay around and be lazy. They could <i>totally</i> live off of those Wacan berries, and these chairs were sooooo comfortable... could they drink Lax Incense? And where would they make? The corner? No, that required standing. Some sort of bedpan device-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn's voice, despite the despair that was intended so as to instill shock and a little bit of sensibility into her gorgemates, came out whimsical and only slightly disappointed in an extremely adorable fashion. \"Miyuuu!\" she said lazily, \"Fontiiiinaaaa!\" she yawned again, \"I can't believe you ate twoooo whooooole boxessssss... Mister Sunny's gonna... yawn... be, like, really upset with me.\" Again, despite the severity of the situation, her usually pristine posture befitting a girl bred into the upper class was uncharacteristically lacking. She had literally sunk into the loveseat with Fontina, finding a nice spot between the cushion, armrest, and padded back to nestle herself into. She didn't even get up as she cried out in lackluster despair, \"Oh nooooo... now Mister Sunny's gonna cut our funding... this is terrrrrrrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyu snorted from the other side of the relaxation center. \"You ate some too, Melon Boobs!\" she said with a remarkable amount of energy in her voice, \"In fact, I think you ate the most!\" All throughout the experience, the Leafeon girl had shown remarkably different symptoms than her two cohorts in overindulgence. For starters, while their general attitudes consisted of a lack of tenacity, Miyu's was given a long-needed recharging; filling her with a slight vigor in her actions. She laughed differently, and more often. From her lazily dimwitted chuckle, a fully blossomed giggle emerged as successor. She laughed so much that her cheeks had creased with her smile. She was apparently, what one would call, a Happy High. Just as Fontina was a Lazy High, and Lynn a Flighty one. However, while these new attitudes seemed to be just as different from eachother as their non-incense goaded counterparts, they all seemed to share something in common with one another:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnstewed, of course. It took approximately twenty five days for Wacan berries absorb enough juices to gather the full effect of the Orrenian delicacy. However, like all berries, most moemon could eat these raw without hesitation. Water and Flying moemon especially preferred them- as it introduced a natural insulation good enough for one sharp jolt of electricity- an unintended side-effect of the mixture. So naturally, members of either class (should they not mind the taste) would find these very beneficial. The Lax Incense, which smelled a bit like a burger joint, was what made them so dangerous. As we all know, incense is not to go into your mouth, but waft gently into your nostrils. When you mix these particular orifices up regarding Lax Incense, its quite possible that you could die. Which is why the mixture doesn't sit for too long. Home-grown Wacan berries are thick as rocks, and it takes a long time for the juices to penetrate the crunchy exterior without rupturing the glands inside. So, again, it won't kill you. It just alters the taste of the berry... and smell, while we're on that subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in short, the fruit gets you a little buzzed thanks to the foreign element introduced to the berry. Its not quite addictive, at least not physically, due to the horrible taste and putrid smell. However it <i>does</i> introduce what might as well be Concentrated Slothlyhood into your system. And the effects, while not permanent, certainly make the next hour or so after consumption a major trip. Suddenly everything's profound; the breeze in the air is just for you, the loud noises of your surroundings become a beautiful orchestra, and every food is delicious... namely those berries in the box- as our three couch-bound heroines have no-doubt learned by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, like, watch yer mouff Missypants.\" loopy Lynn said with wavering influx, \"I could, like, kick yer butt and take your wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just say 'Mouff', Lynn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, did I?\" her dainty face grew red as a tomato as she burst into wild laughter, \"Ohohoho, silly me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. They're totally out of it. Y'see, on top of being extremely expensive and hard to come by, the remarkable thing about Lax Incense is that it only takes so much of it to fill a room. Discovered in Ancient Sinnoh already in thuribles, the archeologists in charge (after a long session in a hole that mainly pertained to contemplating String Theory) set to work on recreating these containers so as to keep authenticity. Aware of the many effects that different incenses might have on people, they saw to it that this one be as extremely limited as possible in its dosage. So, to relate to our setting at hand, these girls' three-hour long pigout on berries was only a 1/10th fraction of what an open container could do. This basically meant that anyone in the garden club, Lynn Miyu and whatnot, were going to be surrounded by at least ten of them going at one time as they stewed the Wacan berries for the cafeteria. Do the math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys, we should really get going...\" Fontina said weakly as she pointed to her watch, \"Its lunchtime and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, Lunch!\" Miyu said, eyes glinting greedily as she pat her already full belly, \"I promised Blaire I'd meet her in the cafeteria. I better skeedaddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But wait, I said that I'd-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds <i>FUN</i>!!\" Lynn squealed, \"Let me come too, Miyu?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was already going to-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly energized Leafeon girl contemplated for a second, \"Well, alright!\" she said merrily, much to the delight of the ecstatic Bayleef girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miyu, I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fonty, you should totally come too!\" Miyu said, shimmying up to a standing position and grabbing both girls by the hand, \"I know Blaire'd love to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than fight, and insist that she was planning on having lunch with her older sister anyway, Fontina decided to give in and let her littler (however only in name if that butt got any bigger) sister have this one as she struggled to pull them both up with her atrophied muscles...</span></div></div>",

Right!\u201d Lynn nervously chuckled with a large blush on her face. \u201cI dunno where my mind is today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally when the three were beginning their trek through the hallways, it was Fontina who was helping her busty friend and bootylicious sister through the hallways by allowing them to lean on her shoulders \u2013 Despite the fact that her body was questioning why she was even bothering to help the two with their own walking \u2013 Not to mention why she was walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was by that logic that Fontina\u2019s body followed suite, and almost sent all three of the girls to the ground \u2013 Forutnately, all that happened was that the three girls stumbled into two other Moemon girls (one seemed to be a stuck up Snivy girl and a Frosslass that was dressed up as a Maid?) and both Miyu and Lynn took that chance to drag Fontina away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to this moment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah, your sister\u2019s here,\u201d Lynn continued talking with some of her original personality starting to peak out from the effects of the Lax/Wacan combination. \u201cI mean, you two are siblings, and you\u2019ve got another one here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Fontina mumbled loudly, the fresh air (well, the clear air) in the halls starting to reach her and clear her mind, although her body was still yawning about how it didn\u2019t want to move \u2013 still the stomach was the one in complete charge at the moment. \u201cBlaire works here, as do two of our other siblings\u2026 And I think Jin and Kay are here too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh,\u201d Miyu yawned with a shrug of her shoulders. \u201cI dunno.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it looked like Miyu\u2019s lazy nature was starting to reappear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TTTTTTT</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMIMI! FONTY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn was genuinely surprised when the three got to the kitchen, and there were several reasons why she felt that surprise \u2013 One, the mix of wondrous aromas was enough to instantly make anyone\u2019s mouth water within a few seconds. There was a mixture of seafood, sweet fruits and grilled meats that wandered through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first reason was enough to dilute Lynn\u2019s senses to almost make her miss the other reasons for her surprise \u2013 The second was the large Flareon Moemon that was manning most of the stations in the kitchen (of course there was other help), and how fast she had spotted and walked (waddled) towards the other two Eevee evolution Moemon girls. It was almost hypnotic to see Blaire\u2019s massive body jiggle with each step, her breasts barely confined in that small black top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third reason was that said Flareon girl immediately wrapped her meaty arms around both Fontina and Miyu in a large hug that mashed the two smaller girls into the expansive cleavage and billowing belly of the tanned fire-type girl. Even more surprising was that despite how out of shape Blaire looked, she was clearly able to lift both of the slightly smaller girls (and it wasn\u2019t like they were as light as a feather). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m SOOOOOOOOO glad that you both came!\u201d Blaire squealed with delight with a large smile appearing on her chubby face. \u201cI was beginning to think that you wouldn\u2019t show up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Blaire, we\u2026\u201d Fontina sputtered, starting to get crushed from her sister\u2019s larger breasts getting smooshed up against her own smaller (but still quite healthy) bust. \u201cWe w-w-wouldn\u2019t b-break a promise to\u2026 To you\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, w-what she said,\u201d Miyu added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you two,\u201d Blaire sighed with joy as she released her siblings from her death hug. It was then that Blaire noticed Lynn, which made Lynn slightly nervous. \u201cAnd I see you brought a friend too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not intruding,\u201d Lynn stated with a slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Blaire replied with a wide smile. \u201cGood food tastes great with more company! Now, come on you three! You got here just before the lunch rush, we can enjoy a good meal together before I have to get out there and serve the students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the group of curvy girls were seated at a table inside the cafeteria, which had a few other students in it at the moment, but for the most part, it was mostly them. And at the table they were seated at were several dishes of food that came from Italian backgrounds \u2013 With pasta, pizza, salads, breadsticks and other kinds of foods that created a small cloud of steam that floated over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, dig in!\u201d Blaire announced with her plate lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyu and Lynn were more than willing to obliged and began to reach for the foods with the silverware that was in them. However, Fontina was a bit more concerned about this, and while it wasn\u2019t for the fact that there was a large amount of fatty food in front of her\u2026 Well, in a sense it was, but it wasn\u2019t the calories she was concerned about, \u201cUh, Blaire?\u201d Fontina questioned, realizing that both Lynn and Miyu were already digging into some of the pasta. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to pay for this? I mean, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina didn\u2019t get a chance to finish, Blaire had taken one of the breadsticks and popped it into Fontina\u2019s mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that, Fonty, since I work here, I get a real good discount on my meals, it\u2019s a bit of a bonus\u2026 Besides, even if that weren\u2019t the case, you\u2019re family, and money shouldn\u2019t come between family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, hurry up and eat! We shouldn\u2019t let this stuff get cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina bit down on the breadstick she was eating and realized that there was gooey mozzarella cheese stuffed inside of it, and it was pretty tasty. But still, there was that gnawing thought in the back of her head \u2013 Mostly with the Wacan Berries she had eaten nary even an hour ago, what Blaire had said (even if it was a joke, it still worried the Vaporeon girl), and all this food that was dripping with calories\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 She didn\u2019t want to outgrow her clothes again, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel as though her already tight bra was beginning to feel a bit tighter than it did earlier this morning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Blaire, her older sister! She didn\u2019t want to hurt her bigger (both in the familial and literal sense) sister\u2019s feelings, and to be honest, the food was smelling quite delicious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Fontina began to reach for the salad, at least that was the healthiest of the foods there \u2013 Even though it was dripping in ranch dressing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blushed profusely and almost ended choking on the baked good in her mouth as she saw that she had consumed a plethora of pastries, a bunch of burritos, and more than enough fruit to feed about two or three other moemon. In short, she was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>B-but I don't even feel full...</i> she thought, furrowing a brow in concern while pressing a hand to her stomach, which was now a bit bloated due to the meal she'd just finished. <i>Could this have been due to that berry I ate before?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe I overdid it a litte\u2026\u201d Fontina squeaked, her face a tomato red as she surveyed all that she\u2019d consumed. Blaire however, simply let out a good natured chuckle and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Fonty lighten up! Indulging once in a while isn\u2019t going to kill you!\u201d Her portly sibling said while patting her on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Fontina muttered begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFonty-yyyyy,\u201d Blaire chided with a mock glare, \u201cremember what we just talked about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Fontina couldn\u2019t help the small smile that found its way onto her face from her sister\u2019s words. Her siblings always did know how to ease her concerns about things like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d Blaire chirped, handing Fontina a sack, \u201cnow I packed a lunch for you since you\u2019re a little short on time! All sorts of good stuff in there!\u201d the rotund Flareon turned and began to walk away, \u201canyways, I better go find my little double of a vulpix, so I\u2019ll catch you later Fonty!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright see you later!\u201d Fontina waved as her sister left. Now the lovely vaporeon knew there was only one hassle left, getting to class on time. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, as Fontina prided herself on being punctual and early to classes, but this time around she found that due to the way she stuffed herself she was feeling quite lethargic, and couldn\u2019t seem to find the will or the motivation to even get up from her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on\u2026</i> she groaned to herself, letting out a belch due to the digesting food packed into her gullet, <i> I can\u2019t be late to class on the first day! That\u2019s just lazy!</i> Fontina knew something was up, she was never not motivated to going to class, however, she couldn\u2019t help the fact that her body was just not feeling the action of going to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that this was due to the work of the Wacan berry, already doing its duty of sapping both her metabolism and her will to even perform the smallest of actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fontina was never one to make a bad habit if she could help it, and so her fortitude was being tested against the whispers of the wacan berry\u2019s lax properties. On one side, her mind told her that she should really get to class, on the other hand, another part of her was saying that she could afford to miss the first couple days of class since they were really just the introductory period to the subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes rested on the couch that Blaire owned. It was quite large, and it had to be to fit a frame such as her sister's and still manage to be comfortable. At the sight of the plushy expanse of furniture the vapereon's eyes lit up in approval. <i>Sounds good to me!</i> She thought happily as she trudged lazily over to the couch, promptly collapsing on it once she had made her way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, her eyes were closed and she fell fast asleep, two hours passing by in the blink of an eye. After that nap, she woke up with a large yawn and finally sat up, rubbing her eyes groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! I needed that!\" She said happily, feeling refreshed from her nap. She looked over at the clock and her eyes widened, \"two hours?!?\" she gawked, \"it only felt like I was asleep for a couple of minutes! I need to-\" Suddenly, a loud rumble from her stomach cut her off. \"B-But I just ate a huge meal a couple of hours ago...\" she told the offending organ, \"how could you be hungry already?\" Her stomach didn't heed her words, though it was still a bit bloated from breakfast, as it simply rumbled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiiine.\" Fontina sighed in exasperation as she slowly got up and walked into Blaire's kitchen. Looking around, her eyes settled on the primary cause of her actions thus far. The box of Wacan berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know...those weren't actually that bad...</i> Fontina thought to herself. <i>Sure the taste was a bit off, but it wasn't really as horrible as Blaire made it out to be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Fontina know that this was a property of the Wacan berries. Once you ate one, if you weren't careful you could begin to eat another, and it would simply keep stacking until the user's metabolism slowed to a snail's pace, leading to increased weight gain and lack of movement, as well as sleeping much more frequently. This was a staple of a Snorlax's body and personality, and so this was the preferred snack for them, but for other Moemon species? Not so much. However, since Fontina had already fallen prey to the first berry, and seeing so many within arm's reach, she couldn't help but want another, especially since she felt the call of hunger, which was actually just another property of said berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the Wacan berry was quite a crafty berry indeed, for having no actual sense of intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise at that point that Fontina found herself grabbing an entire box of them and then grabbing a couple bags of family sized potato chips as well as some snack cake boxes that Blaire had, though even with this hefty amount it seemed like Fontina hadn't even made a dent in her sister's supply of food. Heading back over to the couch she sat down and popped open a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well...Bon appetite I suppose.</i> She thought with a shrug as she popped another Wacan berry into her mouth and began eating as all thoughts of productivity began to flow out of her mind...</span></div></div>",

That's not what a Wacan berry looks like.

Problem? Bite me. Also, I feel I should say that a Lax Incense does not make its holder lazy; it makes it easier to dodge attacks in battle. But, I digress.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fontina watched her big sister eat, she figured out exactly how the Flareon got so big; she ate like there was no tomorrow! If Fontina didn't know any better, she'd have thought that the girl sitting beside her was just a Snorlax in disguise. Whatever food was in front of her vanished in less than 10 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" the curvy Vaporeon said, trying to start a new conversation, \"what exactly was that berry I ate?\" Blaire looked at her sister and chuckled. \"Are you STILL worried about that? Let me ask you something; if a berry would cause harm to any student at this school, why would we be allowed to have within 50 ft. of the building, let alone in the kitchen?\" Fontina put a hand to her chin. \"I... guess that makes sense. Still... would it kill you to at least let me know a little bit about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaire playfully patted her little sister on the back and said, \"Alright, you win. It's called a Yache berry. If you eat it, it cuts the damage of one super-effective Ice-type move in half. There are 18 berries like that in total; one for each type of move, even Normal-type moves.\" \"Wait,\" Fontina said, \"Normal-type moves aren't super-effective against anything; they can't devastate an opponent.\" Blaire chuckled again. \"Oh, trust me, I saw a Delphox boy take a Giga-Impact in gym class during my freshman year; that is so not true.\" Fontina cringed at the thought of seeing someone get hit with a Giga-Impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Blaire continued after finishing a mouthful of muffin, \"apparently, those kinds of berries only taste good if you have a weakness to those types of moves... generally, anyway; there are a few exceptions here and there.\" She was about to put what she thought was a strawberry into her mouth, but stopped when she noticed that it was actually a Chople berry. \"Oh, here's one of those berries. Here', I'll show you what I mean.\" She then turned her head to the kitchen. \"Margaret!\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, a rather pudgy-looking Weavile girl walked up to Blaire and Fontina. \"Yes, Ms. Blaire?\" The Weavile girl asked. \"Well, Margaret,\" Blaire started, \"I'm explaining to my little sis how these types of berries work. You know, the ones that weaken super-effective moves?\" Margaret nodded. \"And I just so happened to find a Chople berry here with my breakfast,\" Blaire continued. \"I was telling her about how these berries generally only taste good to someone if they have a weakness to such types of moves. Would you like to help me demonstrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed the Chople berry over to Dark-Ice type girl who happily ate it. \"Yummy,\" Margaret said, rubbing her chubby belly. \"That's all I needed, thanks,\" Blaire said with a smile as Margaret went back to work. \"Now then, where were we? Oh, that's right.\" With that, the two eeveelutions resumed their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes, both girls finished their breakfast and rubbed their overfed bellies. \"That was good,\" Fontina said. \"I just hope I don't put on too much weight from all that food...\" Blaire laughed and patted her sister on the head. \"Now, don't worry your pretty little head about how you look. You're beautiful no matter how big you are. Hell, I think you'd look great being even bigger. Imagine how good you'd look if you were as big as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina's grew wide at that idea. Strangely, she didn't know how to feel about it: on the one hand, she wasn't very happy about being as chubby as she normally was, so the thought of being bigger scared her a bit; on the other hand, Blaire seemed to enjoy her size - which was likely to increase after she finished digesting the mountain of food she had just eaten - and wore it very well, so maybe she'd look pretty good too.</span></div></div>",

She keeps her bangs short, framing her pretty face, and wears the rest of her long, viridian locks in a low bun at the back of her neck. She wears a leaf themed choker around her neck.<br>\r\nPersonality: Despite being born into a wealthy family Lynn is incredibly down to earth, if not a little naive and unsuspecting. She's kind hearted hopeless romantic and has been friends with Perry since she was a Chikorita moemon. On a side note, she's the only one of her friends with any cooking talent.<br>\r\nExtra: She's prone to culture shock, usually flipping out over some of the strange foods or customs in a new town. But she's always willing to try something new and usually ends up completely absorbed in it. She\u2019s also the president of the gardening club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Student No. 5</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Perry<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nMoemon: Poliwhirl <br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nClass: Sophomore <br>\r\nDescription: A moemon of average stature with a relative hourglass figure who wears her blue hair in an almost boyish fashion sweeping across her face. Her bangs sweep left, and always have since she was a Poliwag. She tends to dress in cutoff jeans and sleeveless tops tied at the shoulders<br>\r\nPersonality: For what she lacks in intuition and general common sense, she makes up for in optimism and passion. No matter what she does, she always gives 100% and never backs down from a challenge. She's the group's self-appointed leader.<br>\r\nExtra: She wears a King's Rock as a bracelet, fashioning it as a lucky charm, completely unaware that it could divert her from her desired evolution: Poliwrath.

She wears a small purple hoodie with a shared white pocket over a tank top and skinny jeans that conceal a rather fit and agile figure<br>\r\nPersonality: To completely contrast her outwardly innocent appearance, her true personality is devilish and caniving. Often seen with a sneaky twinkle in her eye and something that isn't hers in her hands, she has gotten her friends in more than their share of trouble. But despite that the bond between them is strong and she is always willing to go without so that one of her friends might feel better.<br>\r\nExtra: Her appetite is huge, especially for sweets. Fortunately for her, an active lifestyle of climbing trees and running from agitated plunderees has granted her a lightning-fast metabolism. But now that she's on the straight and narrow, what will become of her teensy-weensy waistline?

She usually wears a large flowing skirt that wraps around her huge waist (and is usually successful in covering up the hams that are her backside), a white shirt and pink vest that usually struggle to keep her large belly and melon sized breasts in check. <br>\r\nPersonality: Despite her body type, Ember doesn\u2019t seem to care about her weight (in fact she seems to be more interested in getting bigger (both vertically and horizontally)), and in fact can be very bubbly when someone talks to her. She always wants to be helpful to others, but often makes things worse off than they were originally. <br>\r\nExtra: Despite her large body, Ember can move as fast and as quick as a Moemon half her size. She usually has snacks hidden on her person and will often offer (stuff silly) others if they\u2019re hungry or not feeling well.

This usually elicits some people to resent her. She usually acts calm and cool, but can easily snap if someone insults her seriously. However, when she\u2019s stressed, she usually turns to a bag of chips.<br>\r\nExtra: Lilian has a personal maid who attends classes with her. Her name is Suzu, who\u2019s a curvy Frosslass Moemon who wears a blue maid outfit that contains her impressive frame (which usually catches quite a few people\u2019s eyes). Lilian herself is also the Freshman Class President and often tries to organize events (often gets her family\u2019s money involved to hype up her popularity).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what a list of characters,\u201d Don Tanner muttered under his breath. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 I think I should look at the next group\u2026 WHEN WILL THIS EVER END?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I think I need a burrito\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, there were a number of people who were awake, trying to burn what little sunlight appeared \u2013 one of which was a certain Vaporeon librarian, but there was another in the same location of the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sigh echoed through the air followed by the swift sound of a book closing, sending a splash of sound to echo through the nearly empty library. Although it was early, a young Moemon found the peace and quiet of the library a lot more calming and relaxing than her stuffy dorm room with her dorm mate exercising in the early morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she needed this time to think before her classes began \u2013 a chance to relax and write some poetry in her book. If the previous year was any indication, she\u2019d need all the chances she could take to relieve her stress. <i>\u2018\u2026 Well Rhodes, you certainly got your quiet location\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moemon in question was a young Absol girl, with long white hair that caressed the shoulders of her grey hooded sweatshirt, save for the lone, long bang of purple hair that was sprouted from the right of her head of silky white hair. There was no doubt that the girl in question was a student of the academy and that she was the one who was more preoccupied with her own hand written literature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her poetry, Rhodes the Absol turned her attention towards front desk of the library, eyeing the curvaceous Vaporeon Moemon that was seated at the front desk. It wasn\u2019t because Rhodes was attracted to the blue haired, glasses wearing girl (if anything, Rhodes was still in that one phase where she was still trying to figure out whether she played for the same team or not) but rather, the normally red eyed Moemon had green eyes of envy of the water moemon\u2019s curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes subconsciously placed her hands on her stomach, flinching as she managed to grab onto a good portion of flab that her hoodie had hidden \u2013 not that there was much mind you, but Rhodes had a paunchy body that she gained over the summer, chunky thighs, a pot belly and a little extra padding around her face. She couldn\u2019t believe that the librarian was actually stressed out about her curves, some people just got the good parts enhanced while Rhodes was left with her bottom heavy frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as long as Rhodes had her poetry, she could get past her envy\u2026 She\u2019d only write about it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut writing poetry and pushing down secret envy did pass the time, the time before classes truly was boredom incarnate, and even doing something that you love can\u2019t cure that curse. Heck, maybe she would get some breakfast, the cafeteria food was pretty good last year\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it was because of that food that gave Rhodes her paunchy figure in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Rhodes should try to find someone else to talk to, maybe even that busty Vaporeon librarian girl? But what the heck would they talk about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes sighed again, as she looked at the small notebook she had on the desk before her, knowing that she had just finished writing on the final page of her notebook. For over the summer, she had spent countless hours writing in that little black booklet and now that it was full, it was time for a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that did give her an excuse to do something else with her morning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just didn\u2019t know what. Heck, her roommate was probably burning away whatever little calories she had eaten the previous night \u2013 That girl practically had a metabolism that was electrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Rhodes muttered under her breath. \u201cWhat the hell should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Just a little mind you, keeping in spirit with her grudge against every part of her anatomy that bulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing what was probably her eighth composition notebook since enrolling with a sigh, she looked upwards towards the beautifully endowed librarian. How she wished to be like her; large chest, full hips, but still maintain an air of intelligence. But it seemed to be a pipe dream, she would always be Rhodes. And that was a little too much for her to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting her notebook back in her messenger bag, the young student quietly rose from her seat and went about her business to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh!\" came a voice from behind her, sitting amongst a mountain of books waiting to be shelved, \"Come again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes took a glance towards the library's not-so fabled Blue Rose, or so she'd heard her been called by her classmates, and let out a small smile that hid her envy. She nodded her head slightly in affirmation and pushed the door open, putting her in the middle of the first-floor rotunda. Taking a left and heading down one of the many halls, Rhodes knew that eventually she would find herself at the cafeteria...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands in the pockets of her hoodie, Rhodes trekked forwards. It wouldn't matter just how much room there was left to fill inside this big bulky ensemble. To her it would still be too little. Looking down, she could see the folds of what were no doubt her belly inflating outwards underneath her jacket. Panicking, she made sure that it was just the fabric of her sweater. A little sigh of relief escaped her thin lips before she went back to brooding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light tapping of her trainers' rubber soles against the linoleum floors kept tempo for her thoughts. They were all timed with the rhythmic sounds of her slow steady gait. It wasn't a sexy saunter, she'd never have the courage to parade herself around like some of the girls at this academy, nor a straight-legged stride of confidence, as she simply lacked the essential <b>confidence</b> to pull something like that off. Her steps were quiet and unassuming, as was she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head sank as she fell deeper and deeper into her own thoughts, letting waves of despair hit her over and over again. With her freshman year come and gone, Rhodes was certain that the year could have only gotten better. However in the three months living at home in lethargic practice, the non-athletic Absol moemon had neglected doing much of anything. As a result, several pounds crept their way underneath her misleadingly athletic attire; said pounds attaching taking it upon themselves to swell her once rather slender figure outwards slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather excited about having Gym this year, until she realized that she would have to parade her paunch about like the freak show that she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a small whimper to voice her discontent, Rhodes found that she had most assuredly arrived at the very center of what she was trying to avoid: food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from the outside, Rhode's dainty sniffer picked up on very familiar aromas. Belgium waffles cooked to perfection, french toast sopped in syrup, stacks of pancakes and breakfast sausage in all manners. The thought of such sinfully delicious food sent two reactions through the diet-conscious girl. On one hand, her stomach churned in disgust and anticipation. She was never really one for much self control, and a good majority of her bad habits had been picked up during her freshamn year in this very cafeteria. However she found herself salivating slightly at her return to professionally made breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Rhodes pushed the heavy doors open and walked inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike everything else in St. Gijinka's Academy for Bright and Talented Youths, the cafeteria was only the epitome of class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the few ranging students who had dirtied up their spaces with surprisingly messy eating habits, the cafetorium was a picture of perfection. Clothed rectangular tables ran in ten long rows that stretched towards the back of the room, leaving a little bit room to the left where the food was prepared and brought out by the help. In the middle, where the eleventh row of tables used to sit, a new tiled tapestry of various legendary moemon of ages past was revealed in an uncoiling fashion as if they were being called to action. The corners of the room were decorated with various plants and gargoyle busts of Sableye. And in the back was where the teachers sat, in their own table that was much wider and turned horizontally so as to set it apart from the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes looked absolutely tiny as she stepped into the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never really quite remembered it being so large, but considering the renovation budget that forced most students to go home for the Summer, she wasn't really surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly taking her place at an unoccupied table, Rhodes was left to herself for a few minutes before she was greeted by a School Service girl, dressed in a cute pink waitressing garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning valued student!\" she said in a too-perky tone, \"Can I get you started with something healthy? Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so why not make it count with one of Mr. Sunny's personal favorites?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Sunny had his own menu? That was a laugh. She hadn't been to his office yet, but from what Rhodes had heard the Vice-Principal, a bearded Ninetails moemon, took himself way too seriously. She would have declined, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me...\" Rhodes said softly, \"But there isn't another option than what Mr. Sunny would reccommend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young moemon giggled, \"Yes ma'am, Mr. Sunny and Principal Tanner felt that some students had been taking advantage of the lucrative ordering process in the past, so we here at St. Gijinkas have implemented a one-to-two choice range. Don't worry though, you're still getting your money's worth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Rhodes said sadly, \"D-Don't you think that kind of defeats the purpose of breakfast? Not letting us eat what we want, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily I don't get paid to think!\" the chipper waitress said in a ditzy tone, \"Now, your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I guess I'll have the Sunny Special Number One...\"</span></div></div>",

At the very least, the specials told what the meals consisted of \u2013 This one was actually quite small when compared with the rest, and the meal consisted of a stack of pancakes, a bowl of fruit and a beverage of choice. \u201cJust a glass of water will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditzy waitress nodded before she walked away, sashaying her hips with each step. Even the waitresses here had a better figure than Rhodes, and slowly her envious thoughts began to slip into her mind once again, <i>\u2018I\u2019m willing to bet that the reason they got the menus was to accommodate the ditzy waitresses\u2026 Nothing more than eye candy for the masses.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her thoughts were strong and shot through the quiet moemon\u2019s mind, they were slowly being clouded by the massive aroma that lofted through the air. Warm syrup, sizzling bacon, and grilled vegetables all began to invade Rhodes\u2019 mind and began to make her stomach grumble slightly. How often had the dark-type Moemon hated to hear that sound from her paunch? She had lost count over the summer, each time when she had to keep the beast inside her stomach from becoming noisier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of dieting had definitely crossed Rhodes\u2019 mind countless times, heck, she\u2019s tried dieting even more times. As she placed her hands on her soft paunch through her hood\u2019s pockets, Rhodes sighed loudly, there was more of her to grab then there was before the summer had come. It wouldn\u2019t have been bad if the weight had gone to the right places, but no, it had to conglomerate all in her middle for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Rose of the library, Rhodes\u2019 thoughts returned to that curvy librarian again. The Absol girl closed her eyes and thought back. This morning wasn\u2019t the first time Rhodes saw the blue haired girl, after all, the library was one of Rhodes\u2019 favorite places to write her poetry, so she saw the girl a few times before the summer \u2013 and decided to compare some mental pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it seemed as though not even the Blue Rose was immune to calories \u2013 Rhodes recalled that the Vaporeon girl was a little bit smaller, and not just in the T and A department, Rhodes remembered that the Blue Rose wasn\u2019t as soft around the middle before the summer. It wasn\u2019t as bad as Rhodes\u2019, but it was still noticeable if someone had a memory like Rhodes\u2019, but no one would notice thanks to the other ample curves that the Vaporeon girl had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sigh escaped Rhodes\u2019 lips as she slumped again in her seat, she\u2019d probably be able to stand this paunch of her if she had curves like that Vaporeon girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Too bad she doesn\u2019t know of Fontina\u2019s own problems lol)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, Rhodes would be content to have a slim figure with barely any curves, anything would be better, anything to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t feel so down about her body. No curves seemed better than to have one slope of a curve to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Maybe I should go on those jogs like my roommate,\u2019</i> Rhodes thought to herself, trying to fight off the wondrous smells that were invading her nose. \u2018<i>At least then I\u2019d might be able to slim down\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Rhodie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes\u2019 eyes snapped open, and she almost jumped from her seat when she realized that she was looking at a large pair of blue eyes that were too close for comfort. \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes pulled back her head and grimaced when she saw that the two large blue eyes belonged to a grinning tanned and cute face that was topped off messy, electrified yellow hair. \u2018Speak of the devil.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grinning face pulled back to reveal that the owner of that face was a slim young girl with bright skin and spiky blonde hair that was combed out of her sharp (yet oddly cute) face. Her slim petite figure was covered with a pair of white shorts and a black tube top that showed her almost curve-less figure. With the electrified smile on her face, it was easy to see that she was a Jolteon Moemon\u2026 But she was not just any Jolteon Moemon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I asked you not to call me that, Kay,\u201d Rhodes groaned as she felt her soul slowly clamber back into her body after being scared by the Jolteon girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, where\u2019s your sense of fun?\u201d Kay pouted slightly with a fake sad look on her face. Almost immediately, the fake look melted away and her charged up smile reappeared on her face. \u201cCome on, Rhodie\u2019s a good nick name for ya! It\u2019s cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes sighed again. This Jolteon, this ball of living energy, this girl named Kay \u2013 Was her roommate. One of the stronger sources of Rhodes\u2019 insecurities and envy (only being topped by that Vaporeon\u2019s curves) with a body that Kay was able to show off without a second thought. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that, I have to put up with you waking up at five thirty in the morning to go for your jogs, the least you could do is call me what I want you to call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay pouted again, but then changed her expression again as she reached into her white shorts and pulled out a small\u2026 Candy bar? Within moments Kay had already opened the wrapper and had sunk her teeth into the bar, \u201cMu dunth haff m bae tu meef.\u201d*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*(Translation: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so mean.\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slap to her forehead, Rhodes lowered her head slightly. That was another reason why she wasn\u2019t too much of a fan of her roommate \u2013 Kay seemed to be able to eat anything without worrying about adding a single inch to her non-existent waist! Sometimes Rhodes thought that most of her bad eating habits came from Kay herself \u2013 She never seemed to gain any weight last year and ate the worst of foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such, Rhodes only seemed to eat the worst of foods during the summer, and thus, anyone could see what the results were. \u201cWhat in the world is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay gulped and smirked as she held up the wrapper, \u201cIts some sort of energy bar that I got from one of the new vending machines \u2013 They\u2019re really tasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly didn\u2019t look like an energy bar, and Rhodes was certain that anything covered with chocolate wasn\u2019t good for you. But Kay finished off the bar and placed the empty wrapper on the table, \u201cAnd they\u2019re cheap too! Every time I passed one of the vending machines, I couldn\u2019t help but stop and buy another one of these bars!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes blinked a few times, \u201cHow many did you buy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost count after the first ten,\u201d Kay stated nonchalantly as she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes tilted her head and was dumbstruck. How in the world did this Jolteon girl manage to down more than ten of those bars?! Rhodes would have to check out one of those bars some time, but something was bugging Rhodes. \u201cWait, then why are you in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Kay questioned as she held up the menu card up. \u201cWhy does anyone come here? For breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes blinked a few times in confusion as she looked at Kay. Where was this Jolteon girl putting all of that food?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A good question indeed, one that had bothered Rhodes since the beginning of their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay seemed to eat constantly, and only for her to maintain the size 0 shorts that she so easily wriggled her way into even today. Her figure, despite all the incessant nibbling on heavy breakfasts, munching on afternoon snacks, or somehow managing to eat ten energy bars and still have room for more, remained chiseled and firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay's metabolism had yielded all overeating fruitless. She never ate right and she never dieted. All Kay ever seemed to do was jog and practice her battle techniques (though despite her lightning-quick body mechanics, she never really seemed to use anything other than Agility and Quick Attack). Her teeny-weeny belly shirt didn't contain even the teeny-weeniest of bellies; instead sporting a tanned, toned four-pack that was very much the envy of her roommate. Her thick calves were hard like rock, and her rear small yet perky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just simply wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kay sat down across from her, jabbering on about this that and the other, Rhodes couldn't help but think that she had been dealt a bum deal in life. Here she was, not exactly overeating per say, feeling like a blimp where ever-hungry Kay felt so in place and comfortable with herself! Deep down inside, Rhodes began to fester (as feelings of slighted revenge were quite common for her species) and suddenly it came out-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna get really fat if you keep eating like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, she said it. She had completely caught Kay in the middle of her sentence, interrupting her and leaving that chiseled face with a contorted look of confusion. It felt good to get some of that out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay snorted, \"Believe you me, girl, you're not the first person to tell me that.\" she continued, undaunted by her roomie's sudden burst of social awkwardity, \"Noir and Mama are always getting onto me about that-\" here she giggled again, mimicking who was probably her mother- \"Kay, if you don't stop stuffing your face, you're gonna blow up! I did <i>not</i> struggle giving birth for eighteen hours just so my baby girl could blow up like a balloon, and your last name is <i>not</i> Lax, so put those ice cream cones down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost it, chuckling to herself, rather bemused by the throaty rendition of her mother's voice, \"But I didn't, so it's totally cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes' slump relaxed a bit, she couldn't help but laugh at Kay's impersonations even if they all did sound the same. \"Y-Yeah...\" she snickered, \"But really I don't see how you do it, Kay.\" she said calmly, the Feelings dying down a bit now that she had a good laugh with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightning-quick metabolism!\" Kay said with a thumbs up, \"Always had one, ever since I was a pupster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice.\" Rhodes said rather dourly, realizing that there was no way to emulate one's metabolism. Again, it just simply wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA split-second later Rhodes' waitress reappeared with her modest meal in hand, what looked to be a matching set of pancakes with a sliver of butter, some miscellanious berries chopped up in a bowl, and an empty glass in hand. As she exited the kitchen, Rhodes could see that she was glancing around the mostly-empty tables, trying to place her no doubt, when suddenly she spied just who this plate was meant for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait!\" the waitress said merrily as she sauntered up to her end of the long table. She placed the meal down in front of her and filled her glass before a cute little curtsey, \"Thank you for your service, and if you need anything my name is Millie. Just holler, 'kay?\" and with that, she was off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence as Rhodes readys herself for a light breakfast, not noticing Kay's glances towards her plate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that looks really good.\" Kay said eagerly, \"You should totally let me have some of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have what?\" Rhodes asked, eyebrow raised, \"Kay you can't have my breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not the fruit.\" she said laxly, removing the bowl from the plate, \"Or the water, I'm more of an OJ person myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay's slender fingers grabbed at the edges of Rhodes' plate, trying to pull it within her grasp. Rhodes of course fought back, pulling back at it. \"Kay, knock it off!\" she growled, \"I already said you can't have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can keep the fruit and the water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine!\" Rhodes huffed, \"Just take it, ya fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay smiled, \"Thank you\", before sliding the bowl of fruit back over to Rhodes. Nimbly, she sliced into the flaky golden griddlecake, only stopping to reach for a packet of syrup and drenching the poor thing before continuing. Her gusto made apparent, she attempted to continue her conversation with Rhodes, despite her full mouth- much to the latter's disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasty thoughts filled her pretty little head about Kay. Again, it was just natural to her species to hold contempt. She found herself thinking horrible thoughts, feeling guilty for it of course, but not enough to really stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could picture Kay, an ideal Kay for the moment, sitting across from her. No doubt if she kept eating like this, that pretty diamond-shaped face would bubble outwards, a second chin hanging heavily between her chubby cheeks. Wide arms that would jiggle every time she lifted something to her greedy mouth, but breasts to big that they impeded her feast. She would have to struggle over her own bulk to feed herself, already having to sit a whole foot away from the table because of her massive stomach that cut so painfully into its surface. And her chair? More like chair<i>s</i> as they struggled to keep whatever massive rear end that this ideal Kay would sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No more jogging for Kay, no more early mornings, but plenty of eating whatever she wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, that was all just fantasy. Kay would never gain weight, or at least that's how it seemed. But that didn't mean Rhodes had to be that \"fat one\" out of the two of them, did it? It just didn't seem fair to think that Kay, who ate literally everything that came to her mind remain so slender while she only indulged modestly and felt so... so... so fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last thought, the bell rang. Apparently they had both gotten here just a little too late to enjoy a full meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Rhodes spat unto herself as she looked woefully at her lack of a breakfast...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d Rhodes spat unto herself as she looked woefully at her lack of a breakfast\u2026 And sighed under her breath when she remembered what her first class of this semester was, and it was the worst class that she could possibly have\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Education, or A.K.A. Gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far this morning was taxing on Rhodes\u2019 mental state, might as well go the extra mile and add a physical beating to her as well. Although, before she left, Rhodes couldn\u2019t help but notice that despite the fact that the bell had rung, Kay was still just sitting at the table, stuffing her thin (fat) face as if she hadn\u2019t heard the bell at all. And while Rhodes wanted nothing more than to see that skinny little Jolteon of energy blow up like a Driftblim, she didn\u2019t want to see her roommate be late to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould you really be stuffing your face?\u201d Rhodes asked as she stood up from the table, grabbing a few pieces of fruit from the bowl (Might as well get something in her stomach before dealing with the <span class=\"clblue\">Cobalt Coach</span> of the Academy). \u201cClass is going to begin in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw, don\u2019t worry Rhodie,\u201d Kay replied as she lifted up a forkful griddlecake, with syrup dripping from the buttery breakfast food. Before Kay spoke again, she shoved the fork into her mouth and began to chew/talk. \u201cMah\u2019ll doff fis, un piff to dass!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Translation: \u201cI\u2019ll down this, and zip to class!\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last look at her skinny roommate\u2019s slim figure (save for the small bulge where her four pack was (which was more than likely from the fact of being stuffed with who knows how many energy bars and this breakfast that she was already downing) which caught Rhodes\u2019 eyes quite easily), Rhodes popped a few berries into her mouth and began to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater Rhodie! Don\u2019t work too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes sighed under her breath when she heard Kay call out to her, and slowly raised her hand up to wave back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile gym class was rather arduous (thanks to the Cobalt Coach\u2019s idea that every student should have the ideal body), it was the dreaded locker room that really took its toll on Rhodes\u2019 mind. All around her were a number of other moemon girls, each of them stripping from their clothes and revealing their flesh. Kay and the blooming rose of the library main have been a good source of Rhodes\u2019 insecurities\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that almost every other girl in the locker room had a better body than Rhodes, tight behinds, toned stomachs and overall sleekness made Rhodes look down at her own body in disgust. She had already removed her hoodie and undershirt to see the damage of what the summer had done to her \u2013 the two breasts that she had concealed in a simple black bra were starting to overflow the modest cups, with the straps cutting into her flesh each and every time she took a breath. But, as she looked past her slightly grown bust, Rhodes\u2019 eyes landed on the one thing that seemed to plague her no matter what\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pale dome of flesh that was her belly, that drooping example of moemon gluttony that rose like dough again when she took a breath. She could feel the roles of flab oozing off her and jiggling with every movement she took to change into her gym clothes\u2026 Speaking of, Rhodes wrapped her fingers around the waist of her sweatpants, a little wary about pulling down the last shield of hers to block people from viewing her chunky body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since she didn\u2019t want to get yelled at by the Cobalt Coach, Rhodes slowly wrung her hands around the fabric and began to pull them down past her bulbous behind and chunky thunder-thighs-in-the-making, feeling the tight matching black panties she wore today clung tighter to her pudgy posterior. Rhodes couldn\u2019t bear to imagine what damage that took from her binging over the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here came the other portion of the locker room experience that Rhodes despised \u2013 Putting on the gym clothes. First came the short sleeved black shirt that Rhodes had chosen for her gym clothes, they were from her gym class before the summer began and she had neglected to purchase bigger workout clothes (it wasn\u2019t on the top of her list of things to buy). But with that gnawing on the back of her mind, Rhodes slowly slipped the black fabric over her head and as she slipped her arms through the sleeves, she could feel the tight sleeves get stuffed with her arm fat, and even feel the sleeves sink into her skin. With a grimace on her face, Rhodes began to pull down the rest of the shirt, feeling how tight the fabric was as it clung to her breasts and stomach like a second skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the shorts, sweatpants were only allowed in gym during the winter months, so Rhodes was stuck with a small pair of black workout shorts, which like the shirt were from last semester, before her gain over the summer months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Rhodes wasn\u2019t looking forward to wearing the shorts\u2026<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n-------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Move it, move it, move it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the large gym, the students were all jogging around the expansive room with the gym teacher jogging in front of the pack, running backwards to keep an eye on his students as they jogged behind him. The gym teacher \u2013 the Cobalt Coach \u2013 was accurately named for he wore a deep blue tracksuit that hugged his highly muscular frame and had a few yellow streaks at the shoulders. The Cobalt Coach had a rugged face with the beginnings of a stubble on his face and had short dark blue hair that was glistening with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Coach <span class=\"cblue\">Athos</span>, a <span class=\"cindigo\"><span class=\"cviolet\">Cobalion</span></span>, a man who was concerned for not only his own health, but the health of his students. People believed that he was nothing more than a man trying to push people in fulfilling his athletic dreams. \u201cAfter the summer, you all got lazy! So we gotta kick that life back into you! And the best way to do that is by running! Keep it up! One more lap ladies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, a majority of the class was men and prompted them to run faster, the ladies in the class moaned loudly \u2013 They\u2019ve already done ten laps around the large gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, our attention was drawn to the back of the group of jogging students, with Rhodes a few feet behind the rest of the students \u2013 going back and forth from trying to adjust the shorts that kept riding up her posterior every few steps she took and pulling down the shirt that kept revealing her pudgy stomach.<i> \u2018I\u2026 Can\u2019t\u2026 Do\u2026 This\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Miss Rhodes! Get yer head in the game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes jumped when she realized that Athos was behind her suddenly, yelling at her to keep going faster and faster.<i> \u2018How did he get behind me?!\u2019<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cDo your best!\u201d Athos roared loudly as he proceeded to jog past the Absol moemon. \u201cCome on! You can do better than this! Moveitmoveitmoveit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes groaned loudly as she pushed herself even more, feeling her clothes riding up on her chubby body, she could feel her body getting heavier and more sluggish, despite the fact that she was speeding up\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her most frequently worn outfit consists of the academy skirt and blazer combo, perfectly following the standard uniform save for being a size too small. <br>\r\nPersonality: Energetic and outgoing by choice, she shuns the more academic and sedentary side of things. Instead she pursues sports and other physical activities, with a drive to prove herself as an athletic force to be reckoned with despite her youth, gender and her own biology.<br>\r\nExtra: From a long line of truly immense women, her active lifestyle is as a way of keeping her weight under control along with obsessive calorie counting. Despite her continued efforts, a recent series of growth spurts have been making it more and more difficult to keep in shape - For every inch added to her height, twice as many seem to go elsewhere. While she appreciates the added height, especially since it helps distribute the pounds a little more evenly, the growth spurts also bring more and more intensity to her already immense appetite and her greatest fear is it spiraling out of control and turning her into a mindless eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I wish her luck but...\" The Dragonair Principal mused to himself, jotting down a small note. \"Better make sure there's plenty of up-sized uniforms around and keep the cafeteria well stocked, just in case. Can't have other students going hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait, that's not right. Some idiot must have just copied the profile and forgot to replace this part.\" Don frowned at the profile, crossing out 'Junior' under class and scribbling in 'Freshman' next to it. \"Shame you can't just edit a page after the fact, but it'll have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!\" The digitally shrill voice rang out loudly from a small bedside table, accompanied by the not quite as loud rumble of plastic vibrating against the wood with a buzzing rattle. A pale arm snapped out from under the covers, slender fingers snatching the cellphone from it's place and pulling it back into the depths. The alarm was silenced a moment later, shortly followed by a cascade of pillows and blankets tumbling to the bottom of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple gray phone clutched in one hand, tugging the charging cable loose and discarding it, the newly awakened Alexis stretched her arms over her head with a yawn. The action thrust the teal-haired girl's chest out, straining the buttons of her pajama shirt and revealing patches of pale flesh between the gaps. Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, she sluggishly pushed herself to her feet as she rubbed the remnants of sleep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been waking up at five in the morning for her routine for awhile now, but she always woke up with the strong desire to roll over and go back to sleep. It actually didn't matter how long she slept or not, the urge to sleep longer coming from deep down in her somewhere. Glancing blearily at the phone in her hand to confirm the time, she gave another yawn and not for the first time regretted the necessity of such an obnoxious alarm just to get up on time in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding over to the bathroom, an unintentional sway to her hips, she pulled lightly at the waistband of her just a tad too snug pajama pants in a vain effort to get a little more give around her rump. Pausing only to flick on a light, she stepped on a scale tucked in the corner first thing. Stifling another yawn, she glanced down only to blink as her chest and proximity to the wall impeded any chance of glancing at the scale's reading without messing it up in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling lightly to herself at the hassle, she stepped off the scale and scooted it away from the wall with her foot before trying again. Feelings of apprehension started to kick in, warding off her drowsiness as she pushed her chest down as best she could to get a clear view of the verdict. The frown that tugged her lips downwards made it pretty clear that she wasn't happy with it, stepping off the scale and somewhat roughly kicking it back into the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a short height of five feet and two inches, a weight of a hundred and fifty-nine pounds was a lot higher than she was comfortable with. Lifting her shirt up the voluptuous moemon revealed a fairly flat stomach, her abs only visible on the edges where a small layer of soft pudge hadn't obscured them. Pressing a hand against her tummy was met with only the briefest amount of squish before coming to the hard resistance of muscle, eliciting a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her examination to her lower body was met with a lot more squish than her stomach, but the hard layer of muscle underneath was just as firm as it ever was. Casting a glance towards the mirror, she didn't bother examining her chest in any detail. Until these growth spurts of hers stopped, she'd resigned herself to the fact that her already troublesome chest was going to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muscle has weight, you're not too heavy. Muscle takes up space too, you're not as big as you look.\" Lexi stated with a firm tone to herself, an often repeated mantra as she tried to be objective about her observations. While both statements were certainly true, the reassurance she felt from them seemed just a tad less every time she said them. Tomorrow her scale might read a hundred and sixty, and she wasn't sure she could handle such a... round-seeming number as that, even if that extra pound might be muscle and not fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured enough all the same for the meantime, the teal-haired girl set about tidying herself up for her morning workout. Hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, pajamas replaced with an equally snug sports bra and pants that hugged every curve of her lower body, she slipped on her running sneakers and was out the door into the chilly morning air. Bouncing lightly from foot to foot as she glanced about the area outside her dorm, her body jiggling in it's softer places as a result, she considered her options for her morning run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't had as much time to plan a route as she would have liked before her first day of attendance, which would mostly be taken up by orientation and other wastes of time like that. Even so, she hardly wanted to miss or be late to anything as a result of getting lost, no matter how little she actually cared about it. She knew there was a track, as well as other fields, around the main building as well as the general direction. On the other hand, a jog around the marketplace could help get her familiar with the area and provide an opportunity to grab breakfast on the go and save some time before orientation started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gave a rumble at the thought of breakfast, bringing a frown to her face. She knew enough about how the body worked to know that skipping breakfast would be counter productive to her weight management efforts, but at the same time she was always concerned about giving in to any demand her incessant appetite made. Not that refusing really helped, as it just made it worse when she finally did cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi considered her options again in light of that. She could A, head out into the fields and track where there was surely no food in sight, only grabbing something to eat once she had finished her workout and gotten ready for orientation, with the hopes of being strong enough to not pig out at the first opportunity. Or B, she could risk the marketplace, trying to placate her hunger with something light and healthy that wouldn't impede her exercises, and hope she didn't just end up snacking the entire time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her stomach let out another hungry rumble, the Munchlax Moemon steeling her resolve as she began to jog off towards the track and fields. If anybody else was out and about as early as she was, she didn't see them on her way there. Not that she took the time to really look around, rigidly locking her gaze forward to her destination. Falling into a rhythm, chest and backside bouncing in their constrained garments, the cool and peaceful air about the island helped to ease the weight-conscious girl's concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light jog to the track was enough to get her blood pumping, bring a feeling of energy to her body and banishing the sluggish lethargy that she always woke up with. Prying her phone from her pants pocket, keeping her momentum going by jogging in place as she did, the teal-haired girl pursed her lips in thought as she math'd out what to set her alarm for. At a slow jog it was half an hour from her dorm to the track, so it'd probably take a bit under an hour to get back to her room to shower and get dressed. Getting breakfast afterwards could take anywhere from an easy ten minutes to another half hour, depending on if she could find something suitable to eat and didn't get lost or stuck in any lines or anything like that. With orientation starting at eight, and accounting for the time to get to the main building...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi gave a small nod to herself as she set the timer for an hour, stuffing her phone back in her pocket where the tight fabric clearly outlined it against the side of her thigh. Taking a few slow, deep breaths as she bounced from one foot to the other, ignoring the twinge of discomfort form her sports bra as she threw herself forward into a run. Feet pounding on the well-packed dirt of the track, the girl slipped into a mechanical trance - Focused only on running, keeping her breathing even, and the track ahead of her. So it was a great shock to her when she suddenly became aware of bright blue eyes and neon yellow hair right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reflex she jerked back, messing up her footing mid-step and sending her stumbling. Flailing her arms to try and keep her balance, nearly bent half over as her feet fumbled beneath her. The effort was futile though, and feeling herself going down she composed herself enough to twist her body around and land heavily on her backside instead of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, nice save.\" A cheery voice complimented, the voluptuous girl shaking off the mildly dazed feeling and turning her gaze towards the source. A lean girl, with pale but lightly tanned skin. The blue eyes and yellow hair immediately clicked in place as the reason for her tumble down onto the dirt. Clad in white shorts and a black tube top, the girl was the definition of a stick. An athletic stick, with nicely chiseled muscle definition across her flat stomach and slender legs, that Lexi realized had been keeping pace with her while jogging backwards of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd...\" Lexi paused to catch her breath, a sheen of sweat on her pale skin and the tingle in her legs telling her she'd been at it for awhile before this strange girl surprised her. \"What'd you do that for?\" She spat out with a scowl, but the girl seemed completely unconcerned as she just laughed and smiled down at her. It struck her that this might be some form of freshman bullying about to take place, that kind of thing being far too common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried calling out to ya, but you didn't hear me I guess. You were really in the zone there.\" The girl shrugged, offering a hand to help her to her feet. The Munchlax Moemon hesitated for a moment, having to admit to her own obliviousness at the time, shaking her head to dismiss the offer and pushing herself to her feet. The girl probably didn't mean anything by it, but if she ever needed help getting on her feet then she'd utterly failed to keep her weight under control. The girl just raised her hand up some instead, offering a handshake as she introduced herself. \"Names Kay. Don't think I've seen ya before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexi, this is my first year.\" Lexi took the offered hand that time, giving a brief but firm shake before turning her attention to dusting the dirt off of her mildly sore backside. Pulling her phone out of her pocket to check that she hadn't damaged it in her sudden fall, she was pleasantly surprised to find her timer only had ten minutes left on it. She'd managed to get through most of her run, so she didn't have to worry about her schedule being completely thrown out of whack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so!\" Kay gave a self-satisfied grin, before bending over and poking a slender finger right into Lexi's tiny amount of belly flab until meeting the hard resistance of the abs partially obscured underneath. The Munchlax Moemon froze up, bewildered at the sudden violation of personal space. If Kay noticed, she clearly didn't care as she continued speaking with her finger where it was. \"My first guess was one of the bookworms trying to lose some summer weight, but then I noticed you were way too good at keeping your form and pace even for some nerd and up close it's pretty obvious you've got a lot of muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcessing all that, the teal haired girl's expression shifted from offense at the weight comment and poke to her stomach to flattered at the compliment on her athletic ability and musculature. Beaming proudly as Kay finally pulled her finger away and straightened up, Lexi took a moment to try and make a guess about Kay in turn. She was obviously very athletic, talked about students returning for the summer... But the Jolteon girl didn't strike her as being much older than her, either. With some slight hesitation she finalized her guesses by verbalizing them. \"You're... a sophomore, and in a track club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay tilted her head to the side in what Lexi could only assume was some kind of amused surprise given the grin still on her face, putting her hands on her slender hips and striking a confident pose. \"That's right! Star Runner of the entire school and only in my second year! I'm aiming to break the old records to pieces this year, and the year after that and after that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi stared at the... Frankly admirable amount of confidence and ambition on display. It didn't hurt that the sophomore had the sort of purely athletic figure she wished she could have. At least, as Kay had said, a lot of her bulk was muscle. She might not be slender, but she was certainly fit. That was enough for her to feel good about herself. A thought struck her then, that this energetic if slightly strange Jolteon Girl would be an excellent friend and role model to have around and help keep her active and motivated. Someone as sleek as her had to be a good influence on her quest to manage her weight, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight start as she realized she'd spaced off for a second there, lost in her own thoughts. \"That's amazing.\" She replied with earnest awe, not bothering to hide any of the admiration she felt. The widening of her grin on her narrow face made it pretty clear to Lexi that Kay didn't mind basking in praise in the least, adding another thought to try and cement their potential friendship. \"I'm not especially fast,\" She admitted honestly, the small nod from the Jolteon showing that she agreed with that assessment. \"But I want to bust records into dust and be a star athlete too! I just need to figure out what sport to aim for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lexi trailed off, Kay just peered intently at her. Then, quick as a wink, the yellow-haired speed demon was all over her personal space again. Rapidly poking at her, the action tickling her in some more sensitive spots and provoking an involuntary laugh. In the brief moment it took the teal-haired girl to reflexively back away, the blonde had already finished observing whatever it was she was observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My professional opinion is...\" Kay trailed off for dramatic effect, Lexi perking up as the sense of anticipation welled up within her. She tried to predict what the girl was going to suggest, but she'd already puzzled the choices to death on her own and gotten nowhere with it. Seeming to decide she'd delayed long enough after a few moments, Kay loudly and firmly declared...</span></div></div>",

Welcome to this new story! Moemon\u2026 Set in a School setting! Now, before we can begin, a few ground rules\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Only female weight gain/expansion, that isn\u2019t to say that there won\u2019t be male characters in the story, but keep the growing to the girls.<br>\r\n2) Unless you're offering a different choice, please make the posts at least a paragraph long and literate.<br>\r\n3) At the beginning, there will be three original students for you to follow, but there will be more students for you to follow, and you can make your own as well, but, they must go through a style of expansion.<br>\r\n4) Unless magic is involved, please don't make the gainning too overboard (Like no, OMG I gained 500 pounds in ten minutes!).<br>\r\n5) Other forms of expansion (inflation, fruit expansion, water inflation, etc.) are allowed, and in an academy with curses, evil professors and the such, that can be expected to happen<br>\r\n6) Have fun. And for good posts, I will offer a good number of Gift Points!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner smirked as he pointed towards the link down below, \u201cNow, how about you click on that and get this story rolling?\u201d<br>\r\n</td>",
