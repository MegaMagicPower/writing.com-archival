For the first time in a long while he was genuinely happy and had not a care in the world. That is until he took notice of something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he thought the train had merely stopped, but upon looking out the window he saw a bird frozen in mid flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Ed turned to the other passengers and saw they were all frozen in time as well. Standing up out of his seat, Ed was on his guard until a familiar voice declared within his mind: \"Edward Elric....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth?! What do you want? I didn't perform Human Transmutation!\" Ed snapped angrily, though he was unsure how Truth was doing this...just how powerful was the otherworldly being?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a proposition for you...come.\" Truth's voice echoed, and with that Ed found himself in Truth's domain standing before the grinning 'deity'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright..what gives?!\" Ed clenched his fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I wanted to make you an offer to get your alchemy and limb back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes widened but he was still suspicious, \"I'm not going to do it...if I can have Al then I don't care about alchemy or a lost leg.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alphonse is out of the equation, he's irrelevant to what I'm offering.\" Truth assured the blond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fullmetal Alchemist crossed his arms and fixed the entity with a glare. \"Go on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another dimension if you will...where alchemy is nothing more than mere myth. In it's place humanity has advanced technology far beyond what you've encountered. I know your little brother was a fan of those little colorful books that depict costumed heroes...sold at newspaper stands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd raised an eyebrow, \"You're telling me I need to go to a place with superheroes? Where there's no alchemy? Get real!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much to believe...but he'd already seen so much that would fit that category...it was quite confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you accept, I will send you to this place with your leg and alchemy returned. There's one individual who I think you'd get along with quite well. You are to assist him in any way you can.\" Truth still wore that toothy grin of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd sighed, \"Fine...but for how long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, time will remain still in your world.\" Truth explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth lifted its hand and a sphere appeared that appeared to be completely see through. It floated over to Ed and showed him visions of a young wealthy boy named Bruce Wayne who watched as his parents were shot dead in an alleyway in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy undertook extensive training and taught himself every science known to man, it wasn't unlike Ed's situation with their own Teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy soon grew into a man who donned a frightening costume and dealt out justice to the corrupt and the underworld of Gotham City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of Truth's fingers, Ed found himself gone from the void..and in a vast foggy city that held buildings taller than any Ed had ever seen, with advanced vehicles going down the streets.</span></div></div>",

He seem to be at the entrance of some alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd found himself jumping as a loud roar rang out on the road passing him. The loud mechanism lacked a roof and had a group of young teens laughing as they speed down the street. The alchemist concluded that the mechanism must be a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Truth was right, the technology is more advanced not to mention LOUD!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling came as Ed had jumped from the noise. Pulling up the trunk of his pants, Ed stared stunned as just as promised his organic leg had return. Slowly, he unconsciously backed into the alleyway while getting use to having his legs again. Truth was serious in his bargain, so that means Ed must be able to do alch-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little late to be dancing bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was brought out of his thoughts as a raspy voice called out. From the deep darkness of the alleyway a sluggish man came out with a smug grin, spinning a pocket knife. Ed immediately put his guard up as he felt the hostile intent spew out. The man stopped his spinning and pointed his knife at Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok bud give up what you got. No noise or resistance or I'll skew you like a fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd frowned, this definitely wasn't how he wanted to get introduced to this new world. Then again from what Truth told him about Bruce Wayne, criminal activity must be a recurring problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't keep me waiting, empty those pockets!\", The mugger moved his knife closer intill it was a inch from Ed's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, let me give you something.\", Ed said before he suddenly delivered a hard kick and throwed the mugger back with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever a better time to try his restored alchemy then now, Ed quickly clapped his hands and placed them on the ground. The familiar crinkle of energy occured and Ed grinned as the ground morphed into a staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mugger growled as he recovered and brandished his knife charging at the alchemist. Ed swiftly dodged and striked the man in the back with his created staff, making the mugger fall face first into the alley wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the mugger got up and readied another strike, a sudden spinning blur struck his head making him groan before falling down unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stared surprised before looking at the source of the blur. Up on the roof of the building stood a figure, it's cape flapping as the white eyes looked at Ed. The figure leaped down and landed in the alley, having the build of a muscled man and dressed in a black bat like costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's Bruce Wayne, that's Batman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman glanced at Ed before walking over to the mugger and tieing him up. The hero soon turned to Ed with a apathetic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put up a strong fight against him, are you a meta-human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiled. \"Not really...but I can tell you this. My name is Edward Elric and I was wondering if we could talk?\"</span></div></div>",

The Alchemist didn't like how the vigilante was ignoring him like this, it made him feel...small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as The Batman shot out his grappling hook and swung up onto a rooftop, Ed was right there on street level tailing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward noticed a bright light being shone onto the cloudy sky, it had the outline of a bat symbol. Ed smirked, all he had to do was go to the rooftop where this spotlight was being emitted...and he's pretty sure that was where Bats was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman landed on the Gotham City Police Department's rooftop where the recently installed Batsignal was shining from. Next to it stood a ginger haired and mustached man in glasses and a brown trench coat. Commissioner Gordon was smoking a cigarette when he noticed the dark figure approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had begun to rain and Ed crouched on the fire escape as a raindrop dripped from his blond bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mutual friend certainly isn't shy..combined with the theatrics and wacky appearance I'd almost say he's trying to outdo you.\" Gordon said, Batman clearly didn't find it funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ed peeked over the edge of the rooftop, he saw Gordon produce a joker playing card in an evidence bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each victim had one of these on or somewhere near their bodies. The newspapers got wind of it and have taken to calling him The Joker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got security detail at Henry Cladridge's house, he's his next target.\" Gordon took a drag on his cig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any changes?\" Batman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...same old announcement that his target will die at midnight. If the last two are anything to go on...he's not going to just stroll up to the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last two victims were poisoned with some kind of unknown chemical. You should've seen the bodies...it's messed up.\" Gordon sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Batman asked, they were desperate for clues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever he poisoned them with appears to be something he made himself. Witnesses said that the victims just started laughing uncontrollably...most likely suffocated from lack of air. The bodies are still smiling.\"</span></div></div>",

Gordan narrowed his eyes at the stranger, a curious figure with long blond hair and golden eyes.

Henry himself sat in an armchair twiddling his thumbs nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His targets seem 'ta be random...what's this crazy's deal?\" Bullock asked roughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Influential people...from high up Gotham's social class.\" Gordon said as he rubbed his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have no connections other than the fact that they'd get a lot of attention...He even announces what he's going to do.\" Batman stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone in the corner rang, startling Mr. Cladridge. Gordon picked up the phone and answered it, \"Hm? It's uh...it's for you..\" Gordon handed the phone to Cladridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who is it?\" Cladridge asked warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secretary at the bank...\" Gordon stated. Mr. Cladridge was a banker, and he appeared relieved when it wasn't that horrible Joker person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'd love to talk to someone...even about my work!\" Henry rushed over to the phone and practically yanked it out of Gordon's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman stood by Cladridge, as did Ed...everyone was on guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Henry asked. He suddenly jolted, causing everyone to jump slightly. \"Ow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Mr. Cladridge?\" Ed asked warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh..he..hehehehhe...hehehheehhehhehe...hahahahaha..hahaahahahha!\" Henry started giggling uncontrollably as Batman grabbed him to prevent him from falling on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's horror, Henry's eyes bulged and tears streamed from his eyes as he had an unnaturally large grin on his face as he kept laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET THIS MAN TO A HOSPITAL!!\" Batman roared as the laughter slowly stopped and Cladridge went still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is he..?\" Ed asked in shock. A sudden jovial and maniac laughter came from the telephone which had been cast aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! OOO HOO HOOO HOO! HELLO? HELLO OPERATOR!? I BELIEVE MY PARTY'S BEEN...DISCONNECTED! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA!\" The Joker's voice cackled before the dial tone was heard after he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman went over to the telephone and saw a tiny needle poking out of one of the holes in the receiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's some sort of needle in here...\" Batman pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make sense!

Hence his request to reassess, in English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanner seemed to far fetched on the idea of simplifying whatever magnitude this was, but Tony seemed far more compensating. Sarcastically.\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shits about to go down.\" Tony simplified with that typical charismatic sarcasm, but his face was far more contorted to seriousness...like usual. \"In a matter of seconds from now...\" he snaps his finger, \"All this shit is gonna be mashed into another universe..\", <br>\r\n\"Dimension\" Banner corrected,\u200b<br>\r\n\"Universe, dimension, all the same shit. It's gonna a** &amp;@\u00b6\u00a3 our dimension, and become one. So all this....\" He spreads his arms out, \"We'll be sharing it with our next best neighborhood\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanner then cut in, using his glasses that were folded neatly within his grasp as a pointer, \"And that's if...\" He pointed his glasses all about the room, \"...all of this stays intact. Stable. Our universe might not even be able to handle this...convergence\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, pressing his fingers against his mouth as he leaned back against a desk with his other arm crossed and supporting the other, motioned his hand as he inquired, \"So how do we stop it\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve barely understood, but he understood enough. However his initial thought of preventation was no likely feat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony took a deep breath, and with his deadpanned, concerned face, looked at Steve with unfortunate news. <br>\r\n\"We can't....\"\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve pinched his brows and straightened his posture, his stance far more stern, \"There must be a way Tony.\" Unresolved with the solution that nothing could be done. <br>\r\nTony shook his head, Banner reaffirming, \"We can't Rogers...it just doesn't work that way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve shook his head this time, \"There's always a way. What about Doctor Strange?\" He asked, Tony giving a slight chuckle of amusement, \"Oh, you mean the Wizard? He's probably off doing Wizard shit, besides, even if he knew, he would have been here by now or way before yaking our ear off about some Multiverses crap and how it's getting threatened\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we contact him.\" Steve urged, \"We call him....ask him, figure this out\" his eyes drew to Banner again, almost pleading for such possibilities, but Banner shook his head again. \"Even if we did...\" With a slow pause, Banners face shifted into unwavered worry, fear, and acceptance, \"...We wouldn't make it in time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve shook his head, \"So why all this. Why the chat!\" he pressed, drawing his stern features of mixed desperation with frustration to Tony, \"So I could warn\"? <br>\r\nTony's face nodded, feeling the weight himself, \"Yeah...\" He finished, backing away as his face drew farther to the ground, full of disappointment, <br>\r\nAnd regret.\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the cards fall...\" \u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the shift had occurred.....\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world on both sides began to change, twist, contort into strange proportions that were exactly as stated. <br>\r\nMerging....\u200b<br>\r\nFirst, the air grew stale and still before the sudden sensation of a rumble reverberated and shook the world like it was merely about to rupture. <br>\r\nFragile constructions such as glass began to shatter from all the quivering, cascading upon the ground and bouncing as it broke into fine grains. It's material becoming a blanket of dust that moved along with the shaken earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings slowly began to appear, such as buildings, strangers, plants, cities, life. Everything combined into one and almost everything that appeared that hadn't been there...or existed, before, had just made a nice squeeze. It almost fit perfectly....<br>\r\nThough it wasn't meant to. \u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe and world shifted into a new entity, but all awareness of what once was had still resided, but the additions would leave distortion and confusion. <br>\r\nA slow adjustment into the merge and shift of the Multiverses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo places becoming one....\u200b</span></div></div>",

A new world, and everyone's first experience is being in space at the headquarters of this world's heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'onn smiled. \"When you are ready everyone will be waiting to greet you. Intill then, I hope you find your stay here pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Martian left the room, class 1-A held a silence even Bakugou had a look of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think it be best if we meet with this world's heroes.\", Iida said adjusting his glasses. Kaminari scratched his head nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, what if we're not getting the full truth.

There was still a fear though, as Mineta was shivering in his thoughts and Kouji was fiddling with his fingers. Tsuyu was helping Urakaka recover from her faint spell. Bakugou suddenly let out a grunt as he marched towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'm going to chat with this league, if they intend to screw with our asses then I'll blow thier asses the fuck up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku yelped as Bakugou exited the room, palms smoking. Before running after him. \"KACCHAN, wait we need to make a good impression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as two of their classmates were now heading off, everyone followed and prepared to meet this Justice League.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the futuristic halls, everyone eventually walked at an even pace to ensure they could introduce themselves at once. Izuku, Bakugou, and Todoroki walked near the front with Iida and Kirishima close by. The sound of adults talking soon reached their ears as they walked into a open room with a large monitor and a colorful group of superheroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall well built man in a blue and red costume with a large S on his chest soon took notice of the class. He seem to be the leader and gave a friendly grin before his colleagues took notice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, it's good to see your all well. It was quite the scene when you all arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku's eye's scanned the hero. His mind was racing as flashes of All Might occured at the sight of the man. Spandex costume and cape, large built, American colors. Wait was All Might American? Did he take inspiration from someone, did this hero as well? Oh was his quirk the-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenete blinked as Iida tapped him on the shoulder. The heroes in front of him were looking at him confused and his classmates had a knowing look. Izuku's face turned red as he realized he'd mumbled all his questions. A sudden gust of wind hit Izuku as a man in a red spandax suit with a lightning bolt suddenly appeared before him looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida furiously nodded. \"Ah yes, Midoriya simply has a habit of mumbling. I must say your quirk seems similar to mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speedster suddenly vanished before appearing next to Martian Manhunter. \"Hey J'onn what's he mean by quirk?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass 1-A were surprised to say the least at the question. Bakugou clenched his teeth. \"Oi why the hell you acting like you don't know what a quirk is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could explain what this quirk is your talking about is, then we can settle down.\", a black man in a green and black costume said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka now fully awake slowly stepped forward. \"It's um...the name of superpowers where we come from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader nodded in appreciation at the round faced girl. \"Thank you for informing us. Now how about we make introductions to ease the air ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As J'onn explained we are the justice league, my name is Superman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku hesitantly rised his hand getting a nod from Superman. \"Umm...is your qui-power super strength?.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman nodded. \"Yes one of my abilities is super strength, though I can show you the other later.\", the hero smiled as Izuku eagerly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenete felt new excitement, he could fill out more pages of his notebook. Heck he could maybe start on a new analysis book! Smiling Izuku turned to the hero next to Superman, walking forward and introducing himself in a gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Batman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone felt a chill at the dark hero's voice. Izuku nervously smiled. \"I-if you don't mind me asking, what's your power?.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any powers.\", Batman replied in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku's eyes widened at that. A hero with no power was alongside the top heroes of this world. He remembered before he inherited One For All and how not having a quirk made him a source for ridicule and pity. He never heard of a quirkless hero yet one was right in front of him. Possible scenarios ran through Izuku's head, could he had been a hero like Batman?</span></div></div>",

What instruments of darkness does he carry, are Dark Shadows levels on par with his?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend hasn't moved since he looked at me, is he alright?\", Batman asked as he looked from the bird headed boy to his class. Before anyone could elaborate, a small dark bird head with glowing eyes peaked over Tokoyami's shoulder and surprised the heroes as it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dark form intrigues him.\", Tokoyami broke from his thoughts as he noticed Dark Shadow speaking his thoughts. Batman's gaze remained the same and Tokoyami quickly looked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is my quirk Dark Shadow. The darkness surrounding you...is impressive.\", Tokoyami quickly went back to the group as he could feel his beak heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the last to introduce themselves was Kouji. The rock boy was nervous as is meeting new people, now he was meeting heroes from a new world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the nervous look on his face, Jirou was about to introduce Kouji before he surprisingly touched her arm and shook his head. Stepping forward, Kouji brought his gaze up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm....Koji Koda. My quirk.....let's me co-command animals.\", the large boy slowly spoke. He'd rather sign but he didn't want the potential embarrassment of finding out the heroes couldn't understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was relieved when the majority of heroes gave him a welcoming smile.

Ciel while a lover of tradition, felt the need to at the very least change locales after a few hundred years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuntom was already established in America and a new mansion was built discreetly via Sebastian's magic. However, the new servants were a tad off-put by the young boss' dislike and refusal of technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wifi, no cell phones, no computers whatsoever. The servants were quite shocked at the seemingly young lad having such an aversion to modern tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, the boy was strict and seemingly possessed the intellect and business acumen well beyond his appeared years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid was required to wear what was essentially a Victorian era maid's uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants were required to leave their cells at home or at least with Sebastian. If they had a call to make they would use the ancient antique phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the young head of Funtom not having a cell phone or email address left him quite frustrating to deal with to potential business partners. Sebastian had no doubt his master had missed out on many potentially lucrative opportunities due to his stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one evening after his master had been put to bed...Sebastian recruited the other servants to assist with setting up wifi and helping him purchase a high end laptop and making all of Ciel's paperwork 'digital'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next morning, Sebastian wheeled in the young demon's morning tea and opened the curtains. \"My lord..it is time to wake up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel yawned and stretched a bit, Sebastian was expected to give Ciel his morning paper and prepare the tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Ciel got instead was a smartphone with a news app opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian had a very basic idea of how the things work...it paid to keep up with the times...regardless of his master's refusal to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Sebastian had met with someone who could 'tutor' his master in the finer things of computers...and if Ciel didn't want to play ball...Sebastian knew his master was curious about those video-game things.</span></div></div>",

So I have taken it upon myself and the servents to modernize the Funtom corporation.\", Sebastian explained as he began to set up the contraption on his master's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel red eyes widened at the words. \"You WHAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servent simply hummed as he looked over the manual and within a few seconds began to assemble the computer. Soon the IMac was assembled. Sebastian turned to Ciel who had dropped the phone and was staring irritated at him. The butler however smiled as he walked to his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord I didn't just intend to modernize the buisness. If I recall when we where out you took quite the interest in those video game consoles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel's angry soon subsided as he remembered the devices. He seen children holding them in their hands and much larger ones in shelves. The earl's interest was peaked with them and made him consider adding some technical practices to his corporation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg...fine I will try these new buisness practices, after you purchase me one of these consoles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian grinned and bowed. \"As you wish my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, Ciel began making his way to the dining hall to have breakfast. After being seated by Sebastian the door opened and another servent came out with a cart of dishes. The servent was a shortish teen with spiky blond hair, with two spikes resembling that of cat ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your breakfast my lord.\", the servent timidly said bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian rubbed the spiky head and got a purr in return as a sudden pair of cat ears popped out of the boy's head. \"Well done Nelson, you've adapted to this duty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNelson was one of the new servents to Ciel. A cat demon without a master who was taken in by Sebastian, luckily he didn't trigger any allergies with the earl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nelson please lower your ears.\" Ciel ordered getting a nervous apology out of Nelson before he hurried back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast the earl and butler made their way to the city. Ciel couldn't help but get a sense of astonishment as the tall building rose into the sky and the modern cars drove down the street. Even after settling in America for years the scope of everything still was a garner for attention. Soon they arrived at a store with multiple cardboard cutouts set up in front with colorful characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly who dresses like this?\", the earl spoke as he passed the cutouts and entered the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cash out desk sat a young man, long bleached hair under a beanie and a piercing in his nose. He took his attention from his phone as the two walked up his desk, blinking at the attire of the two before clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel took a quick glance around the store. \"I've come to purchase a...video game console.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier fiddled with the ends of his hair. \"Well what kind of console? We've just got in the shipments of Xbox 1's if your looking for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel narrowed his eyes. \"Is that the best you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier was looking weirdly at them now. \"Some will say so... but look kid I've only played on the Switch so I can't give you what's the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll have this X...box, and I want to play games that will test my strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier soon stood and made his way to a aisle across the store. Soon he came back with a green box and a stack of book like cases. The one on top read Call of Duty and beneath it read Halo, the last one made Ciel squint as he thought of beings with halos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so these are what I could find. From what my friend said you need a good amount of strategy to play this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time Glenn.\", Sebastian said as he gave the appropriate money and began leaving with Ciel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn gapped at the two. <i>\"H-how did he know my name?! Oh wait I'm wearing my nametag.\"</i></span></div></div>",

This maid was Elinda, or Elen for short. She was a fierce female demon known as a succubus. She had a fiery temper and flirtatious nature and was sort of Sebastian's second-in-command. Her outfit consisted of a rather revealing version of a traditional maid's outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!

Muttering \"about why you needed to waste money on something that just looked better\" while Sebastian looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the door the servents watched thier lord and his butler walk out of sight.

Ciel was stubborn as he stated that it wasn't neccessary, though that was ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female employee with a short ponytail was placing various items on display when she saw the well dressed boy and his...guardian passing through each aisle. As they passed by she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me.\", Ciel and Sebastian turned to the employee. \"Do you need help looking for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel was going to decline, when Sebastian stepped forward and placed a hand on his chest. \"Ah yes, thank you for offering your services. Me and my lord are in search for a television that is high definition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee lightly flushed at the voice, before shaking her blush. \"Oh um...yes right this way please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the earl and butler were brought over to a section and offered a variety of choices. The employee was confused that that they desired a T.V best suited for a Xbox, but soon gave the suggestion for the LG OLED C8. Ciel was confused at the name but quickly rushed to make the purchase as he wanted to play his games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian thanked the employe and surprised her as he effortlessly lifted the box and walked to the check out. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
