She was blindfolded and gagged, and her wrists and ankles were tied to the chair. She didn't know where she was. The last thing she remembered was a burly arm from behind her clamping a rag against her nose. The smell of chemicals was still strong in her nostrils. Fear sent an involuntary jerk through her muscles and she began to shake. She also remembered gunshots. She hoped desperately that her friend Camille, who had been walking with her, had not been hurt or taken or killed... She squeezed her eyes tight to stop great hot tears from rolling down her face.<br>\r\n         Megan's heart quickened; Had she heard footsteps? Yes, someone was coming! Options raced through her head like lightning. She could struggle and make all the noise she could to try to attract attention. If whoever was coming was a friend, they might notice her and rescue her, but if they were the people who took her away, They might hurt her. She could also sit still and hope nobody bad would find her and wait for the police to come. Or she could stay quiet but try to worm her hands out of the knots. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

A heavy hand struck her across the face, and she fell still.  Rough hands pulled at the blindfold, and it tore away, revealing a dark, dingy, public bathroom.  The man who had hit her was large and unshaven and smelled badly.  He grabbed her face and leaned close enough for her to feel the heat of his breath on her own face.<br>\r\n\"Listen up, sweetheart,\"  he growled.  \"You're gonna' shut up and sit still now, or else, understand?\"<br>\r\nMegan shook in terror, and the man released her from his vice-like grip.  He went behind her and refastened the blindfold, then untied the cords around her wrists and ankles.  The man held her by the neck and guided her roughly out of the door.</span></div></div>",

They stopped, then suddenly rushed toward her.  Hands unfastened the blindfold in her hair and pulled it away.  The room was dark and its features indistinct, so Megan focused on the face before her.  The light was bad and she strained to see the man clearly.  Did she know this person?</span></div></div>",

An air of superiority seemed to hang above him, and even his sharp features spoke of a well-off upbringing. In total, he looked like a wealthy hitman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just stood silently for a few moments, looking at Megan with cold indifference. Still scared, the young girl couldn't help but wonder just what the heck was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who a-are you?\" Megan asked, fear dripping off of her words. The man smiled a cruel smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your momentary host, my dear girl. I must apologize for the surroundings,\" he paused, scanning the non-descript room. \"I fear that my operations require a significant increase in cash-flow. Fortunately, I know just the place where that cash-flow can be found...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan did not like the sound of that, and pulled against the bonds that held her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you can ransom me, I hope you've got a better plan than that,\" the woman sneered, trying to find courage in her voice. \"I'm sure there are tons of people looking for me, like...my... parents, and um, the police...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head. \"I am a professional at this little game, my dear guest. No one in this world knows you are here. The police are worthless, and your parents would not dare risk trying to rescue you. But there is someone with us that you may know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stepped aside, and a figure appeared in the doorway. Megan squinted to see who it was...</span></div></div>",

Miss Pennyworth was a woman in her early fifties, she was skinny and was likely quiet the bombshell back in her day.  Megan shivered as she realize she stood before these two people in just her dark red bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan.\"  She said smiling and looking Megan up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\"  Megan asked worried as Miss Pennyworth came around and put a hand on Megan's smooth and toned waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making a business transaction.\"  Her teacher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what does that mean?\"  Megan replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"  Pennyworth says.  She looks at Megan.  \"You see I work with a company.  They make a lot of money trading the most valuable commodity.\"  Megan gulped as she paused.  \"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- no.\"  Megan said shaking her dark brown hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you.\"  Miss Pennyworth replied.  \"And I supply this company.  That stupid school, wasted so many years of my life there.  But so many pretty girls to get me money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be saying what I think your saying.\"  Megan said shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes indeed I am.  Recently my clients have been wanting something exotic.  Yet they also love American girls, all clean and safe.  So her you are; a puerto rican bombshell with your luscious brown skin and curvy figure.  The fact that you're athletic and an A student will only raise your price at auction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please Im not a slave!\"  Megan pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you weren't, but you are now.\"  The man says darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm here to transport you into that life.\"  Miss Pennyworth says smiling at the young latina.  </span></div></div>",

Her fingernails were cut short, but she managed to loosen it a small amount.  When she finally pulled her hands away, she yanked off the blindfold.  She was in a small room containing brooms and cleaning supplies, a boiler, and a folding metal chair, which she immediately set to freeing her ankles from.  The door was locked, but she found a paint scraper and pried the bolts from the hinges.  The door was heavy, and it fell with a loud bang.  Megan sprinted down the hall.  There were two doors at the end, and she could hear running feet from the other end of the corridor.  She had to run or hide now, but she didn't know which way would lead to safety.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan pressed herself against the wall in the dimly lit corridor breathing heavily more from panic than exertion. She looked back down the corridor but could no longer hear the footfalls of whoever had been coming; hoping that the person had not heard the crashing sound of the heavy door that she had pried off its hinges. The door itself was lying in the middle of the hall so Megan knew that it would not be long before her escape was discovered. She had to get out of here - wherever here was. She bit her lip as she considered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back down the corridor again she could see the banister of a stairwell leading down. She was obviously on an upper floor and cursed herself for going the wrong direction in the initial panic of trying to escape. Now at her end of the corridor she had few choices as to where to run; a door to her right, one across the hallway and a window at the end. Through the window she could see that it was dark outside. A quick look and she could see that she was indeed on the second floor at least of some building. There was a porch light shining at least thirty feet below illuminating what appeared to be a large back yard surrounded by a tall wooden fence with trees beyond; a park of sorts at the very least. She could see the dim glow of a street lamp far in the distance and the lights of a city even further. Wherever she was, she was no longer near home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan returned her attention to the corridor and the two doors. She saw light peeking through the bottom of the door to her right; flickering flashes like a television might make. Listening she could hear the low volume of talking; some monotonous drone of a talk show or the late night news. Not good as odds were that someone was in that room. Across the hall the other door was only a little better prospect. She saw another similar sliver of light at the bottom but heard nothing. Her best bet then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan eased quietly across the hallway and swallowed a sudden lump in her throat as she grabbed the knob and turned it, pushing the door open. She sagged as she saw a small bathroom within, surprisingly clean and white with the usual accouterments of a tub, toilet and sink along with a cabinet on the wall and a mirror over the sink. She sagged however at the sight of the tiny, sliding frosted window over the bathtub. It was open to let in some air on this hot summer night but Megan immediately realized that it was far too small for her to crawl through and like the window at the corridor's end it was probably a long drop to the ground below outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly backed out of the bathroom and pulled the door closed returning the hallway to the dimness of before. She bit her lip as she stood considering trying the other door when she again heard footfalls down the corridor. She glanced towards the stairs and saw shadows flickering along the wall growing in stature as someone ascended the stairs. She had a momentary spark of hope thinking that maybe it was her friend Camille looking for her or a way out. She quickly shook that off however knowing Camille. Camille was a good friend but her first instinct Megan thought would be to run if she had been kidnapped; run and get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille was petite, small and thin and hardly up to fighting off kidnappers. not that Megan was much better suited but Megan was a bit more adventurous than her younger, 'Girly-girl' friend. Megan wondered then just where her friend might be in this house; probably tied up in some closet just as she had been, alone and afraid. Megan wanted to search for her but knew that it was better that she get out and get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan heard the footsteps getting louder and closer on the stairs and had to make a decision. Either run back down the corridor and maybe push past her approaching captor or try the door opposite, and the room beyond which was probably occupied. The unknown threat on the stairs was the greater of two evils so hoping for the best Megan stepped across the hall and opened the door hurrying inside. She barely got two steps through the doorway before she was brought up short to an abrupt halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bedroom she saw, a large corner room with huge paneled windows lining two walls. A widescreen flat television hung from the wall to her left providing the eerie flickering light but her eyes focused on the big king-sized bed across the room from where she stood and the two women propped up by pillows against the headboard and laying comfortably. two women Megan was shocked to see that she recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman on her right was named Kathy who she had known back in university just a few years ago. She was pretty even in jeans and a casual three-quarter length sleeved shirt with big dark eyes and long brown hair. Kathy was more an acquaintance than a close friend though they had hung in the same circles since school and even gone out together certain weekends in group gatherings at one of the local water-holes in the city. Megan was surprised to see the young woman there relaxing on the bed just a few yards from the broom closet where she had been tied up just minutes before. That surprise grew into shock and then almost understanding as she focused on the other woman lying atop the bed. It was Camille!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan!\" Kathy said her wide eyes blinking in wonder it seemed. \"How...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I heard something,\" Camille said even as she slipped her legs over the far side of the bed getting to her feet. Camille was dressed as Megan had seen her last in hip-hugging blue jeans and a tight tee shirt; casual wear for going to the movie they had seen earlier. \"AND I told you you didn't tie her tight enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the two women and those last words froze Megan in her tracks. She watched in almost surreal fascination uncomprehending at first as Kathy hopped off of the bed as well and dipped her hand into a knapsack set on the floor beside. Megan saw a long coil of rope in her friend's hand as she withdrew from the bag, both women suddenly converging on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't make that mistake again!\" Kathy said as she came forward wearing a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was not stupid but the scene was just so bizarre it took her a moment to get moving again. She had no idea why her friends had kidnapped her off the streets and tied her up, but she was not about to let it happen again. She was just starting to back away turning towards the door when she thumped into what she thought was the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick almost burly arm suddenly snaked about her midsection and pulled her back tight. She yelped in surprise as the arm locked around her pulling her briefly off balance and off of her feet. Just as sudden a hand flashed before her face and clamped over her mouth stifling the scream that had been building within and about to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph!\" Megan cried but barely any sound got past the hand that muffled her protests. she started to struggle as she saw Kathy and Camille drawing closer, the latter now sporting a wad of cloth and a thick roll of silver gafting tape. Megan felt warm breath blowing on the back of her neck as she uselessly shook her head from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, Miss Houdini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's eyes went wide again as she recognized the new voice. It was another friend in their little group named Becky and Megan understood why she could not so easily fight her way to freedom. Becky was short but she worked out, chubby but with a lot of strength in her arms and legs. Still Megan struggled kicking and thrashing as her other two friends descended on her...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
