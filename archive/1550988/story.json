            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the rather impromptu nature of it, this slumber party did have a fair bit of thought behind it. The inn's staff made sure the <i>onsen</i> was clean and stocked up on snacks, Nanako had volunteered to make breakfast for everyone to pay them back for the meal they made during the cooking contest - had it been anyone but Nanako saying this, the three ladies that might burn water would have insisted on a different breakfast - and Yukiko brought out every board game and movie the inn contained, though that didn't stop the others from bringing their own. At present, the girls had taken their baths, and with breakfast and the end of the party hours away, the girls were left only with recreation. Chie had managed to force them all to sit through <i>Trial of the Dragon</i> while they all snacked, but afterwards she was a bundle of energy, attempting to act out her favorite scenes as well as wear on her teammate's patience. It suddenly seemed that only Chie's movies would be played tonight, and that Chie wouldn't stand for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had half a mind to let Chie tire out and mess with her while she was sleeping, but Naoto's coercion was enough to retire that idea and go with another one, one that she hoped would make Naoto wish they humiliated her while she rested. After making Naoto and Yukiko agree to back her up no matter what she came up with, so long as it met Naoto's condition of it being a game, Rise dashed out of the room, and returned holding her arms behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Rise called over the loud <i>kiai</i>. \"How about using that energy on a game with the rest of us instead of the movie's villains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proposition wasn't enough to stop Chie from bouncing on her toes, but it did stop a punch that may have very well knocked over a lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What game were you thinking about?\" Nanako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto spoke up, \"It would most likely be something physically demanding if the intention is to debilitate the spirited fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Yukiko added. \"To knock Chie out, it needs to be a thinking game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Rise announced, \"It's a little of both and more, actually.\" Rise brought her arms around to her front and revealed a box that all of her friends recognized instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Twister</i>?\" Naoto asked. \"That may enervate her, but I don't see much thought in the game of <i>Twister</i>. And what 'more' could there be? The game itself is already fairly straightforward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the game is very simple. A white mat dotted with circles of green, yellow, blue, and red in rows (in this order for the Amagis' copy of it, and they were columns of six circles per color) and a spinner were all that came in the box. The pieces that moved along the board were the players themselves, and the spinner told the players where to put either a hand or a foot. Anyone that fell or placed themselves on the wrong color, on the wrong limb, or both, was declared the loser. Many players go in turns, where each spin applies only to a single player, while others have everyone move at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Naoto and Yukiko found most interesting about this choice of game was Rise's plan. These home versions usually had enough room for only four players, but Rise implied all five of them would be playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a couple twists to this <i>Twister</i>,\" Rise continued. \"First, since there's five of us, one of us will be the spinner instead of a player and we don't need the spinner in the box. If you're the spinner, you're going to try to make the moves impossible and uncomfortable to make the players fall. Like, if it's Chie's turn and she had her left hand on yellow and her right hand on blue, I could call 'Left foot red' to contort her and hope she falls over. The spinner could use the real spinner if she wants, but she doesn't have to. We'll go for 10 turns each and we each go separately, so that's 40 calls for the spinner in a full game. If all four players last the full game, the spinner loses. If anyone falls before that, that person loses. Also, if a loser lands on someone else and that person falls as a result, that doesn't count as losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the second difference...\" Rise trailed off to form her mouth into a grin. Chie and Nanako recognized the intimidation on the singer's face, but only Naoto and Yukiko felt a sinking feeling in their stomachs. \"We play <i>Strip Twister</i>. Every time someone loses, that person takes something off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-What?\" Only now did Chie stop bouncing, so the redness that suddenly filled her face after the fact couldn't have been a result of the exertion. \"'Strip'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's face wasn't the only one that turned red. Even little Nanako was noticeably flushed. Sure, they washed each other's backs and shared an <i>onsen</i>, but that's totally different. Their bodies were turned away and the water hid them from the neck down during the bath, plus their scrubbing efforts served as distractions. This was total exposure, close contact rubbing, and included moments of holding still. Sure, Rise was bold enough to show them a dead-man float, but this is an idol who's been shown in skimpy bikinis and even had her shadow flash her teammates (though Shadow Rise may have changed into her colorful form before anyone other than Rise saw either nipple - and that could have only been in Rise's mind, she did pass out in the middle of the transformation). How were the others supposed to suddenly gain the courage to keep up with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie continued, \"I-I don't know about this. How about we watch another movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a movie,\" Nanako added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dawning a dark, intimidating glint, Rise says, \"Let's put it to a vote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in Rise's eyes was mostly unnoticed by Nanako and Chie, but Naoto and Yukiko got the message loud and clear: keep your promise and vote for <i>Strip Twister</i>. While Yukiko was the type to never break her promise, Naoto wasn't above reneging for such a case. However, she figured she could later turn this back on Rise in someway - players could work to sabotage each other after all, and some say turnabout is fair play. The result was Chie and Nanako stared in awe when three hands shot up to vote for <i>Strip Twister</i>, though they raised no objections to the very weak excuses offered by Yukiko and Naoto to justify their votes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we decide the spinner and the order of the players?\" Naoto asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie adds, \"And socks count as two items, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Yukiko yelled. \"I'm wearing nylons, my socks are one item by design!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your problem,\" Rise adds while setting up the mat. \"Besides, weren't you watching during our bath? Nanako has less clothes than us. She needs a little boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that gives all of you more clothes as well! That's hardly an advantage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind socks being one item,\" Nanako said. Her voice said that anyway, her eyes made it clear she wanted her socks to be two items. It was more than enough to guilt Yukiko into abandoning her claims, though only since she knew Nanako wouldn't do that specifically for that reason. She hoped. Regardless, Yukiko took the handicap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise concluded, \"And for our positions, I prepared these.\" Remaining in the box was a cup holding five chopsticks, calling back the school trip for Naoto and Chie, the only two with a memory of The King's Game. Certain guests had taught Yukiko the game when Yukiko needed to serve them, and her toes instinctively curled at the sight of those chopsticks, which caused her to recall what Chie told her about that night in Tatsumi Port Island. The four older girls quickly figured out how they were deciding each person's role. However, since Nanako didn't come with them she needed an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl draws a chopstick out of the cup, and then look at the previously hidden bottom of the sticks to learn their position. Four of the sticks have a number on them (1, 2, 3, and 4, obviously), and the ones drawing these sticks are the players, and their playing order is decided by their number. The fifth stick had a red mark at the end, that chopstick signified the spinner. Since this wasn't The King's Game, they no longer needed to be quick or conceal their numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That approach seems fair to me,\" Naoto noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get to it!\" Rise called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise placed the cup on the couch the spinner could relax on and called the girls to draw. Before looking down at her own chopstick, Chie happened to observe that Yukiko's had a 2 on it. Rise was also happy to announce that she was Number 3, leaving high odds Chie would make it out of this first game with all of clothes on. And even if she wasn't the spinner, she figured she could handle any pose they threw at her - that kung fu does make one rather flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka-<br>\r\nClothing: socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Chie's position?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't let Yukiko see any sort of weakness, or she'd take advantage of it, and then it would all be over.  Rise couldn't let that happen.  She may have been used to being seen or even photographed in swimsuits, striking all sorts of risque poses for her adoring fans, but parading around her in undies?  Or worse, butt-naked?  Way more embarrassing; especially if it was in front of all her friends.  Heck, she'd even worn a towel into the bath with them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she couldn't afford to shed too many layers.

That was the only explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in reality, Rise was just psyching herself out, as she was prone to doing when she felt she was under pressure.  Yukiko was no slouch when it came to rock-paper-scissors, but neither was our favorite idol.  She could still pull herself together and stop her nerves from causing her to lose even more clothing, of course.  But would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she'd throw rock, just as her senpai had.  That seemed like a safe bet.  Yukiko might expect paper to counter the rock she'd just thrown, so she might throw scissors to counter that, and when that happened, Rise would tie up the game again.

Rise couldn't help but giggle as Chie shyly uncovered her bare skin, once again forced to expose herself for her friends.  Another coy wink at her upperclassman caused Chie to blush even more brightly, obviously feeling utterly mortified.  Rise didn't want to make her friends <i>too</i> uncomfortable, but making them a little embarrassed...well, really embarrassed...was actually kind of fun.  Nanako made it even funner, in fact.  Her childish innocence and glee at being a part of something so risque seemed to make any exposure all the more humiliating, which made it all the more fun for Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just had to hope that <i>she</i> wouldn't end up having to stand butt-naked in front of a little kid.

Throwing rock twice in a row might be something Yukiko could predict, but who in their right mind would anticipate their opponent throwing it three times?

This was the chance Rise had been hoping for; clearly Yukiko couldn't read her as well as she thought, and it was entirely possible to trip her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I suppose everyone gets lucky once in awhile.\" Yukiko said, appearing calm as she kicked of her shoes, still fully confident that she'd defeat her opponent. She still had more articles of clothing left than Rise, so she could spare a few losses and keep her dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish it was just luck, Senpai!\" Rise taunted, a teasing tone in her voice. \"I just wanted you to get a false sense of hope. Now it's time to crush you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't true at all, and Rise knew that she was putting on a show of bravado more than a show of real confidence and skill. But Yukiko didn't need to know that. Rise had finally received the confidence boost she needed, and she knew she could turn everything around and leave Yukiko as the exposed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere in the room had changed. Everybody could feel the tense air of competition settling in, and they all grew quiet as they looked on in anticipation. Everyone was eager to see how this game played out, and just how much the winner would even have left by the time one of the two competitors was naked. In a way, it was entirely possible for both of them to be losers, just one slightly less than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright, Senpai, let's see what you've got\"</i> Rise thought to herself. <i>\"You're thrown off, you probably think I'm gonna do rock again, or you think I'm planning on that. Scissors is too risky in that case, you're probably thinking rock yourself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding firm, with a new sense of resolve, Rise threw out her next play:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa-<br>\r\nClothing: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">sailor tie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">stockings</span>, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\nDemeanor: Calm, but slightly nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko Amagi-<br>\r\nClothing: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Shoes</span>, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\nDemeanor: Seems to be perfectly calm</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her upperclassman's face remained the picture of collection, even as she had to remove a piece of her clothing.  Still cool and composed, Yukiko slipped off her sailor tie, letting it drop unceremoniously next to her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just more luck, Rise-chan.\" Yukiko said, her hand once again raising up in preparation for the next round.  \"You won't be so confident once you've got less left to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise fumbled her smile ever-so-briefly.

What was that you said about luck?\" Rise teased. \"Looks to me like you're in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had a point. The game was now tied, and Yukiko had to be reeling from three straight losses. However, Rise was also a little worried; with both girls tied at five garments to go, there would be three more rounds at most before some serious skin was being showed. Rise just hoped it'd be Yukiko's skin, and not her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, just a bit more luck than I had anticipated, that's all. You'll be stripping again before you know it\" Yukiko retorted, her calm tone taking on a sharp edge. As she slid her black nylons down her legs, kicking them off to join her discarded shoes and sailor tie, she entered her ready stance once again. \"Come on, give me your best shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wasn't sure how to feel about Yukiko's tone. On the one hand, this meant that Yukiko was angry and nervous, both good for Rise's chances- she'd be more likely to get sloppy and make bad throws if she wasn't calm and focused. On the other hand, that tone also meant that Yukiko was done playing around, and Rise just might be in trouble again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my best? Alright Senpai, just remember when you're stark naked that you asked for it!\" Rise shot back, hoping to press the advantage she (hopefully) had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two contestants squared off, and Rise made her choice.

She just needed to keep this up and she'd coast to victory in no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko couldn't hide her worried frown any longer; not after a losing streak like this.  As her senpai slipped her cardigan off her shoulders and threw it down on top of her otherwise neatly-ordered clothes, Rise could see the cool, collected demeanor of the Amagi heiress cracking and faltering.  She was ahead!  She was ahead for the first time in the game!  What's more, she only needed to win once more to make Yukiko start showing quite a lot more skin!  Things really seemed to have turned around for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only just begun to fight.  You'll see.\" Yukiko threatened, now dressed in her skirt and a plain black tanktop, leaving her arms uncovered.  It wasn't much in the long run, but Rise knew her senpai would be worrying about that for the rest of the game.  That's just the kind of person she is: Get her undressed, and all of a sudden, even her fiercely-competitive side can't hide how shy she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you shouldn't have asked for my best, Yukiko-senpai!

No matter, just makes the game closer, more tense. It's more fun that way, if you ask me!\" Rise shot back, enjoying the feeling of having Yukiko on the defense. \"Now neither of us can afford to make a mistake. Every throw from here on means more skin being showed off! Exciting, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo. Rise really saw the fear flicker in Yukiko's eyes at that statement. The gravity of the situation was setting in, and Yukiko was starting to buckle. She might get a few more lucky throws in, but Rise was starting to feel confident that she could end the game with her still at least somewhat dressed. Pulling her school jacket over her head, Rise casually discarded it alongside her other clothes, giving off an air of nonchalance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you find it so exciting, just go ahead and strip.

She'd underestimated Rise, it seemed, and gravely.  It was only now, however, that Yukiko's calm, composed demeanor began to crack, and her true colors began to show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it off, Senpai.  You're just stalling now.\" Rise smiled slyly, and with that, Yukiko slowly unzipped her skirt, letting it pool around her ankles to reveal a pair of lacy, white panties, which to her embarrassment turned out to be far skimpier than what the others might have expected.  For the most part, they were semi-transparent, allowing glimpses of pale, smooth skin underneath, with the exception of the crotch of her panties, which was only barely covered by a small fluff of black lace, very much standing out against the pure white surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow, Senpai, those are some pretty exciting undies you got there.  Who were you hoping to show <b>those</b> to?\" Rise teased as both Yukiko's hands quickly shot down to shyly cover the front of her panties.  This just made Rise's teasing smile grow even wider.  She knew she had her senpai right where she wanted her this time.  Standing there in nothing but her tanktop and lacy panties, Yukiko was far too flustered to play properly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- n-no one!  I just...th-these are easier to cover up, so that's why I took off my skirt first!\" Yukiko stammered, quickly moving on to answer a question no one had asked.

Rise knew she still needed to be careful not to lose even more than her senior, but she was feeling good about her odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, didn't I, Senpai?

Her bra, much like her panties, was far more provocative a piece of attire than the other girls had expected. Matching the panties, the bra was thin white lace, transparent across most of her body. The only thing that loaned the bra any sense of modesty was a dash of black lace strategically sewn over where Yukiko's nipples must have been hiding. In a sense, Yukiko was essentially naked already, with just three small pieces of black lace hiding her most intimate spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rise could tell Yukiko wanted to ignore the embarrassment, she just couldn't resist. Letting out a long, low whistle, Rise started to tease her senpai further. \"Wow! You know that's quite a set, senpai. You certainly couldn't get those in a normal department store. You must have gone shopping at a lingerie specialty shop, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yukiko didn't verbally respond, the deepening red in her cheeks was all the answer the other girls needed.

Putting on a carefree smile, Rise casually unbuttoned her blouse and dropped it with her pile of lost clothing. With a caricature of embarrassment, Rise crossed her arms across her chest and let out a light squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no~ I'm standing in front of everyone in my bra! How embarrassing, huh, Yukiko-senpai?\" Rise asked, her voice dripping with mocking sarcasm. Her bra might not have been the most modest thing in the world, but it was still less embarrassing than Yukiko's attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know embarrassing.\" Yukiko muttered, her cheeks reddening at Rise's teasing. \"Not yet.

She was still practically naked, but now she wasn't the only one feeling modest and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's carefree attitude didn't hold out quite so well, however.  While she was still smiling as she zipped her skirt, the others could see her cheeks slowly turning red.  Still trying to play up an attitude of nonchalance, Rise modestly pulled her legs together, holding an arm over her lacy pink bra, while her other hand slipped between her legs to cover her tiny thong, letting out another light squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek~ I'm down to my undies and everyone can see me, Yukiko-Senpai!  But I can't possibly cover up everything!  I'll bet you can't even imagine how embarrassed I am right now.\" Rise teased, her voice once again hoisting up an air of sarcasm and confidence.  In reality, however, Rise's embarrassment was, while exaggerated, entirely genuine.  No one had ever seen her in anything this skimpy before, and the fact that she was in front of all her friends - the very same friends she'd been embarrassing and teasing all night so far - made her even more conscious of how little she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still anyone's game, Rise-chan, and that \"anyone\" is going to be me.\" Yukiko muttered, now attempting a similar stance to the one Rise was trying to pass off as sarcastic.  Neither girl could hope to cover anywhere near what they'd need to in order to quell their embarrassment, however.  As the two stared each other down once more, red-cheeked and only barely hiding what little remained of their modesty, neither felt confident of their chances of walking away with her dignity intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise couldn't resist the chance to demoralize the Amagi heiress one last time, however.  Anything to try and get an edge, even if it meant raising the stakes.  Of course, if she won, this would only help solidify her win...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make this a little more interesting, Yukiko-senpai.\" Rise grinned, moving away her hands to reveal her frilly pink underwear once more.  <i>Just think of it as a swimsuit, Rise...just think of it as a really skimpy swimsuit that lets everybody see your butt and that you might need to take off- no!  No, no, no, focus!  You can't lose now!</i> she thought, cheeks reddening a bit more as she heard Chie tell her she was just digging a hole for herself.  <i>We'll just see about that, Chie-senpai...</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once one of us loses and has to show ~everything~ off...\" Rise continues, emphasizing just the right word to make Yukiko squirm.  \"What if we kept playing?  Once you lose, you wouldn't have any clothes to bet, but each time you lost, you could always do a forfeit.  I'd choose what it was, of course.  Unless you're scared, that is...\" she teased, knowing that would be enough to provoke her senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was absolutely right.  Yukiko would have been willing to refuse, and even as she accepted the terms, she began to wish she hadn't, but she couldn't admit to being scared of Rise; not after this, and certainly not if Rise managed to win.  Besides, this could end up giving her some more leeway should she lose.  The fact that it gave Rise the same potential advantage failed to occur to her until after she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not scared.  Of course I'll keep going if that happens!  But <b>you're</b> going to be the one who ends up having to accept <b>my</b> forfeits, Rise-chan!\" Yukiko stammered, squirming as she tried not to think about the sorts of things Rise might make her do if she were to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding across from her, Rise began suppressing the same kinds of thoughts.  Both girls wondered if they were getting in too deep, but as she was able to hide her embarrassment much better than her opponent could, Rise put on her bravest face (a brave face with cheeks deepening in redness) and declared that time was up.

It seemed as if her nerves over her half-dressed state had taken the edge off her game, and she was hoping that a single choice would see her to victory. That didn't seem to be the case, however, as Rise was standing victorious once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm soooo sorry, Senpai!\" Rise whined in mock sympathy. \"It looks like you lose again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's blush couldn't seem to get any deeper as, unable to even muster up a response, her hands fumbled behind her back to unhook her bra. Yukiko could feel everybody's eyes on her as her bra fell away from her chest, giving her audience an unobstructed view of her small pink nipples before her arms quickly crossed over her chest. Rise was internally celebrating that she was safe once more, and just one more win would mean she kept her underwear on. Given her slight advantage, Rise just couldn't help but rub it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like all the boys in school had the right idea going after you, Senpai! I'm <i>almost</i> jealous of what you've got going on there. Bet a lot of people would kill to see you like this, huh?\" Rise teased, noting with pleasure how much her words made Yukiko squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-they'll kill to see you in a few more turns, Rise-chan.\" Yukiko stammered, her defiance popping up once more. \"You're not out of the woods yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not. How confident are you really that you'll win the next round?\" Rise deflected. \"Think about it. One more loss and there won't be any secrets between you and the rest of us! Exciting, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was feeling cautiously optimistic. She'd just need one more win to have her Senpai at her mercy, after all, and she seemed to have gained the advantage in the throws. Rise just hoped her luck held out for one more turn; her victory would feel a lot more complete if she wasn't gloating over Yukiko while wearing nothing but her barely-there thong...

Against the odds, Rise had managed to win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And rock crushes senpai!\" Rise cheered, her teasing nature giving way in the face of unabashed happiness. Not only had Rise defeated Chie, now she had defeated both of her senpai! They'd never live this down, Rise would make sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was, understandably, reluctant to remove her last article of clothing. Knowing that it would be pointless to try talking her way out of it, the raven-haired beauty slowly began to shimmy her panties down her legs with one hand. Deciding to remove her arm from her chest and let her breasts hang free, Yukiko kept the hand not removing her underwear in front of her crotch, but not before Rise got a quick peek at the immaculately groomed landing strip of hair between Yukiko's legs. Rise knew she could remind Yukiko that covering herself like that was against the rules for a loser, but she decided to let her senpai have this one small mercy for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her dainty panties falling to her ankles, Yukiko reluctantly kicked them to the side where they joined the rest of her clothing. Looking to Rise with pleading eyes, Yukiko was almost a pitiful sight. The cool confidence of the Amagi heiress was shattered, replaced by shame and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you win, Rise-chan.\" Yukiko said, her voice wavering. \"I'll go sit down now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yukiko could make her way back to the couch, Rise grabbed her by the wrist, wagging her finger like a disappointed parent. \"Now now, Yukiko-senpai, you know that's not what we agreed on. You've gotta keep playing, and since you're naked now that means your losses result in forfeits.\" Leading Yukiko back to where she had been standing, Rise stood proud, almost able to ignore her own barely-dressed nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm gonna go easy on you for this first match, senpai.\" Rise said, savoring the way Yukiko squirmed as she spoke. \"How about, if you lose this next match... you've gotta take a lap around the outside of the hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!\" Yukiko nearly shouted, doing her best to keep her voice from being too loud. \"You can't be serious! That's insane, I mean, what if somebody sees me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got only yourself to blame, senpai. You didn't have to agree to the forfeit idea.\" Rise countered, knowing she had the upper hand now. \"Besides, don't you want a chance to even the score? If you win, I'll have to take something off, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Rise wouldn't let her talk her way out of it, Yukiko entered her ready stance.

Who did Rise plan to show it too? In a town as small as Inaba, word gets around fast. If this video got out, she could never show her face around her classmates again.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not just her classmates, everyone in town become subject to her display of humiliation. What would happen to the Amagi inn? A news story about the young Amagi heiress without a stitch of clothing  would only shame her family and may even ruin their business. It was too much... But being potentially seen in public was also not something she was looking forward to doing. How could she get out of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was brought out of her conflicted thoughts by the sound of Rise's voice.<br>\r\n\" Don't worry sempai! This video will only be kept between us girls of course, we wouldn't want to ruin your chances at inheriting the inn now would we? Doesn't that sound a lot better than having to run out there where e <b>everyone</b> can see you? Besides, you said you would agree no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko flushed, and weighed her options. After a brief second she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine..... We can make a video, just please let me in!\" Yukiko pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then a brief click was heard and the door swung open, revealing a very smug looking Rise with a camera in her hands.<br>\r\nYukiko wasted no time heading back into the inn as soon as the door swung open. As Yukiko walked past Rise, the teen idol gave the heiress a playful smack to the rear eliciting a yelp from the heiress  and giggles from the other girls. Yukiko's face burned red at being on the receiving end of such a humiliating gesture but felt herself warm up despite it and her heart beated a little faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later they found themselves away from the entrance and back in the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sempai...\" Rises said in a sly tone, her camera trained on the nude form of her naked senior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to do <b>whatever I say</b> while we're recording alright?

Then,at once, her face turned a deep shade of scarlett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a minute! We already bathed earlier, I shouldn't have to bathe myself in front of you now!\" Yukiko stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rise responded, the smile never leaving her face. \" Why senpai, don't you think you're a little dirty after your  adventure outside? I think we need to get you cleaned up.\" She paused for a moment and turned to face everyone \"Does everyone agree?\"<br>\r\nSounds and giggles of agreement resonated from the others causing causing Yukiko's heart to drop. It started to sink further as Rise continued talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way sempai, I think you have the wrong idea here... You're not bathing yourself, we're going to be bathing you!\" Rise chimed, enjoying the power that she had over her senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     If Yukiko could turn anymore red she would have. She flushed once again and felt her heart flutter. This was much more humiliating all of the other forfeits! If she had not been so prideful and had not continuously attempted to beat Rise, she could have been running laps naked around the hotel instead of this! Now it was far too late and Yukiko had no choice but to comply with the idol's orders. Yet, to Yukiko's further embarrassment, she found herself getting aroused at the notion at being subject to something so shameful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feeling completely humiliated, and with her head hung in defeat, the group headed towards the bathing room. There was a bit of good fortune on Yukiko's part however, as they found the baths to be completely unoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Alright!\" Rise cheered, then turned to Nanako and asked \"Nanako, can you do me a favor and hold the camera? Just point it over to Yukiko and keep it there, you know how to work a camera don't you?\"  . Nanako smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Good girl!\" Rise praised as she handed her the camera. She then turned to Yukiko and in an overly sweet voice, she instructed.<br>\r\n\"Now Yukiko- chan! Why don't you sit on the bath stool over there!\". With her face crimson, Yukiko sat on the stool, with one arm across her breasts and the other covering her nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now now senpai \" Rise tutted. \"You shouldn't be so shy! Put your hands on your head and spread your legs so we can wash you properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Humiliated and mortified beyond belief, the raven haired beauty placed her hands on her head letting her breasts hang free. Swaying slightly, with her nipples erect at exposure . Shakily,  she spread her legs apart reluctantly giving everyone a view of her most private area. Her neatly trimmed public hair and her crotch was in full display and upon closer inspection, one could see that her clitoris had poked it's way out of it's hood.<br>\r\n To her horror, Yukiko noticed that she was getting the seat wet with her fluids. Her  \"lips\" were gaping, opening and closing with each nervous breath she took.<br>\r\nJuices leaked onto the seat from the \"lips\" like a thin line of drool.  This did not escape anyone's attention, as the girls giggled at Yukiko's very apparent arousal. <br>\r\nYukiko was further shamed as she heard Nanako innocently questioned the wetness of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oooohhh how naughty senpai!\" Rise teased \" I didn't think you would get off on all this! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were losing our game on purpose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The heiress tried to defend herself \" N-no I.....\" she started but was interrupted when a stream of lukewarm water hit her. Yukiko gasped and turned to see Chie pointing a showerhead in her direction. Her attention was brought back again to Rise as she started to rub her body with a bath towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm going to need you to stay still alright Yukiko-Chan?\" Rise  said playfully. Yukiko voice had left her and she just nodded as Rise began to work her hands around her body. Chie operated the showerhead and Rise washed Yukiko as Nanako and Naota stood on the sidelines and watched. Yukiko felt the towel and Rise's hands explore her body. She felt it gently caress her shoulder, and made it's way all across her body. In between her toes, legs, arms, armpit, stomach<br>\r\nnothing was left out of Rise touch. The idol then started to massage her breasts with her towel.  It felt good, <b>too good</b>, Yukiko had been trying to hold in her moans but let one slip out. Rise heard the and snickered, much to Yukiko's chagrin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yukiko felt Rise's hand on her butt she yelped. With a face of crimson she question <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling Rise responded \" I have to wash <b>everywhere</b> sempai! Now bend over stop resisting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Yukiko tensed, got off the tool and bended forward so everyone can get a view of her rear end. She gasped as she felt the showerhead  hit her behind. Rise gently rubbed both cheeks delicately. After a while, Rise grinned devilishly and began to wash the area between the cheeks.<br>\r\nYukiko gasped, and moaned loudly as she felt the fibres of rise towel become acquainted with her crack. Her mortification had hit new heights, having to bend over and having to have her crack washed  inf ront of all of her friends greatly shamed and excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt Yukiko's sphincter clenching and relaxing as she continued to wash  her anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!, now sit down on the floor and spread your legs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turning around and with her back against the wall, opened her legs once more. Her eyes unable to meet any of her friends as they gathered around. <br>\r\nThen she felt it, a sudden burst of pleasure as a stream of water mercilessly assaulted her pussy. Realization dawned as she realized what was next to be washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" Yukiko exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sempai! We're almost done!\" Rise squealed with mirth in her eyes. Yukiko started to protest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no wait, If you wash there I'll definitely.....\" She was cut off as the shower head hit her most sensitive region. Rise, the towel abandoned at the point, rubbed the heiresses folds with her fingers as the showerhead continued to stimulate her. Yukiko, couldn't hold back her moans anymore. She started to gyrate her hips as she felt the pop stars soft hands invade her flower. She felt the pressure building up in her nether regions.  She was about to cum in front of her friends! This was way too humiliating! Too embarrassing! They were about to witness something that no one else was supposed to see!<br>\r\nYukiko groaned and tried desperately not to cum. Her pussy was quivering with her attempt and her buttocks were clenching and clenching. Yukiko's concentration was broken and was shocked to find her clitoris between Rise's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm I wonder what this is senpai? Don't worry I'll clean it for you!\" Rise giggled. Rise was having a lot of fun at Yukiko's expense and took pleasure at seeing her senpai, humiliated, horny, and close to orgasm. She'll never let her live this down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll restraint Yukiko had was now gone as she felt her clitoris being rubbed between Rises two fingers. Her moans began to get increasingly louder in volume and she could no longer contain herself. Rise used her other hand to massage the Yukiko's \"other\" entrance, causing Yukiko hips to buck wildly at the sensation.<br>\r\nLust fogged the young Amagi's mind and she could hardly believe the humiliating situation she was in.  Her, the proud Heiress of the Amagi inn that was normally so reserved and collected was now nude,moaning and gyrating on the bathroom floor! What's worse, her pussy was being toyed with by her junior, someone who she was supposed to be an upperclassman to, in front of her closest friends (one of them who was still a child). The humiliation of the situation<br>\r\ncaused Yukiko to get hornier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise continued to play with both her entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's thoughts were a jumbled mess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God. It's happening, I can feel it. This is too embarrassing! Everyone's watching, me. Please don't look. Oh God......<br>\r\nOh GOD... I'm going to cum!!!!!!.

Less, in fact. Recalling the obscene display she had just been put through. her face burned red with shame and anger. That was meant to be the price she paid INSTEAD of being locked outside naked and exposed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sexual frustrations, her humiliation, and her anger fueled her actions even before she had come down from her near-orgasm high.

The imperiled princess, cursed to walk the land without a stitch of clothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that makes you the hag that's secretly a witch.\" Chie muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in every story, the curse can always be lifted...by the kiss of a handsome prince!\" Rise said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What are you getting at?\" Chie asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are her Prince, right? That's what she said, isn't it?\" Rise asked smuggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?\" Chie and Yukiko squawked in horror and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh. Let's just say that Teddie gets really talkative if you stroke her fur the right way.\" Rise said. \"So that's your out, you two. The prince will give a kiss of true love to her princess...right on the lips. And no pecks either! We're talking five minutes, lots of tongue action, and plenty of groping action for the camera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko and Chie were completely aghast. Glancing at each other, they both turned pale and looked at the ground. </span></div></div>",

Her senpai would probably expect her to throw rock, after all, so with scissors she could defeat the expected paper.  What rise saw, however, was a ruthless Amagi fist.  Rock beats scissors, once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, Rise-chan.\" Yukiko taunted, her voice mercilessly teasing the teen idol as she won yet again.  \"That wasn't the last thing you'll lose.  We've still got two more rounds to play after this one.  Don't worry, though.  It'll be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I haven't lost yet...\" Rise insisted weakly.  She hadn't even managed a proper comeback this time.  Swallowing dryly, she slowly unbuttoned her skirt, letting it drop until it rested around her ankles.  The whole room stared, glimpsing far more naked skin than Rise had ever shown on camera, and she could feel every single pair of eyes on her.  Rise's cheeks were already turning bright red from embarrassment as her skirt dropped, revealing just how little she had been wearing underneath it.  There she was, standing in her undies in front of all her friends, and there was nothing she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to her frilly pink bra, Rise's tiny pink thong was now on display for the whole room to see.  Instead of frills, her panties sported a little white bow at the front waistband, but besides that, there was hardly anything to it.  Rise's small, tight butt was totally uncovered, and due to how little fabric there was covering her front, it was rather obvious that the idol maintained (at the very least) a perpetual bikini line.  In reality, however, Rise Kujikawa was clean as a whistle between her legs, and that was one thing she most certainly did <b>not</b> need her friends teasing her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh geez, no, no, no!  Rise, come on, you gotta pull it together!  You gotta salvage this!  I can still do this!

Yukiko had beaten her again, and Rise was down to her final piece of clothing. Her hands trembling, Rise reached behind her back and unhooked her bra. Quickly placing her left arm across her chest, Rise pulled her bra off her arms with her right arm, reluctantly dropping it on the pile of clothes she wished she could put back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better be careful, Rise-chan. One more loss and you've got nothing left. Not that you've left a lot to the imagination anyway.\" Chie teased. Chie! She of all people was feeling upbeat enough to start teasing Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-at least I've still got something, Senpai!\" Rise snapped back, trying to re-establish herself as above being teased by Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long.\" Yukiko said, pulling Rise's attention back to the game. \"Now hurry up and make your losing throw.

Paper covers rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or in this case, I guess paper makes you <i>un</i>cover.  You're finished!\" she announced triumphantly, clearly relishing her sweeping victory.  Rise, on the other hand, felt her cheeks turning redder and redder as she stood there, still wearing nothing but her tiny thong and a mortified blush.  This was it.  There wasn't any avoiding what she had to do, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room suddenly swelled with laughter and mocking chants for her to \"take-it-off! take-it-off!\"  Well, not filled.  Yukiko-senpai was still being silently smug, and Naoto-kun wasn't chanting; she wasn't a chanter.  Chie had started it off, now feeling upbeat and vindicated enough to start teasing Rise right back, and realizing that it was apparently okay to sing a loud, fun song, Nanako-chan had happily joined in.  Chie and Nanako!  Chie had even forgotten her own earlier embarrassment and begun teasing Rise's own incumbent nakedness, but it was the sound of a little girl teasing her that was making Rise feel all the sillier for having lost all her clothes like she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...I just have to keep it together...</i> Rise told herself, swallowing dryly as she hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her skimpy panties.  <i>Try and make a joke out of it...sh-show 'em Risette's not afraid to show a...a little skin...</i>  They could see her bare breasts now, small and pert with little nipples the color of cherry blossoms.  They felt a bit tight as she pulled her arm away, and a nervous glance downward showed her that they'd gone slightly stiff.  Must've been the cold, she decided.  It couldn't be any other reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get it out of the way as quickly as possible, Rise yanked her tiny pink thong down to her ankles in one swift tug, resisting the urge to screw her eyes shut in embarrassment.  From head to toe, she was stark naked, and they were making quite a show out of staring.  Naoto cleared her throat and averted her eyes, clearly feeling uncomfortable herself, but the others weren't nearly so merciful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko giggled mockingly, finally murmuring a cocky \"Well, well...\" as Rise's panties dropped.  Chie wasn't quite so subtle, however, and her reaction was somewhat more vindictive.  She giggled a bit louder, adding in a \"Wooooooooow, <b>really</b>, Rise-chan?\" in what had to be an attempt to get her junior back for the merciless teasing she'd been given earlier; it was working, too.  Rise knew what they were both referring to, and her utter humiliation was plain as day, but it was Nanako's innocent question which <b>really</b> clenched both Yukiko's victory and Chie's revenge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Chie-chan?\" the Dojima daughter inquired, lowering her head shyly.  Talking about naked bodies wasn't exactly appropriate behavior as far as she was concerned.  \"Um, well...see, when you got naked, um, you had hair...um, down there...so I thought grown-ups had that, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako trailed off sheepishly, and rather than answer right away, Chie took a moment to catch Rise's eye.  It was only a couple seconds' pause, but it agonized Rise all the same.  \"Well, you're right, Nanako-chan.  Grown-ups <b>do</b> have hair down there.  \" Chie answered, now feeling just a little more self-conscious as her own nakedness was brought up again; not nearly as self-conscious as Rise, though, who had taken to shyly squirming with her hands locked behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Nanako murmured, trying to steal another glimpse at Rise's bare, hairless privates in hopes of getting a better understanding of why the teen idol's lower lips were as smooth as hers.  She didn't even have to ask another question, and she didn't.  Her confusion and the implied follow-up were enough.  Rise felt her whole face go bright red with embarrassment.  Yukiko and Chie's teasing hadn't even had the effect Nanako's curiosity had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked, on display, and clean as a whistle between her legs, Rise had never felt more vulnerable, exposed, or embarrassed in her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to scrape up the last dregs of her dignity, Rise tried to smile.  She was used to smiling through unexpected flops, and she was good at making them look easy and natural.  Not this time, though.  The naked idol was so flustered and feeling so completely humiliated that all she could manage was a sheepish, embarrassed grin as she continued to shyly squirm, still showing everything from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd lost, and badly.

Rise was glad that the game was over, at least, but she had a worried feeling that she wasn't out of the woods just yet. Her suspicions were confirmed when Naoto decided to speak up for the first time since the game began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, Yukiko-senpai, I'm assuming you plan to challenge me?\" Naoto theorized, addressing the Amagi heiress with her own calm demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Naoto-kun.\" Yukiko replied, fixing the young detective with a predatory grin. \"Hope you're ready to join those two soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto wasn't phased by Yukiko's taunt. She knew she had an edge in just about any game Yukiko could come up with, and she had an advantage in clothing, since Yukiko had managed to lose a few items in her game with Rise. Completely secure in the idea that she wouldn't fall to the same fate as the other two, and that it would in fact be Yukiko cowering naked next, Naoto stepped forward and returned Yukiko's challenging look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no intention of losing, senpai.\" Naoto said coolly. \"I'll soundly defeat you in any game you choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very glad you said that.\" Yukiko answered, piquing Naoto's curiosity. \"I've already got a game in mind.\" With that, Yukiko stepped away briefly, rifling through one of the drawers in the room. Soon enough, she returned with a cup and a set of dice. \"It's very simple. I shake the dice in the cup, you guess whether they equal an odd or an even number. If you guess wrong, you take something off; you guess right, I take something off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto felt a pinprick of worry. The only way to be \"good\" at a game like this was to use loaded dice, and that would only benefit Yukiko as the one shaking the cup. Of course, Naoto doubted the dice were rigged in any way, but it was still bad in any case. Rather than the ability to use reason and deduction, Naoto would have to rely entirely on luck; she couldn't even try to anticipate Yukiko's way of thinking to gain an edge. However, she had said she'd win whatever game Yukiko chose, and her pride wouldn't let her back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge accepted.\" Naoto said, stepping forward to face her senpai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hungry smile, Yukiko loaded the dice into the cup, shook it vigorously, and then brought it swiftly to the ground. Staring straight at Naoto, she asked plainly. \"Even or odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi-<br>\r\nClothing: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">sailor tie</span>, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto Shirogane-<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, shoes, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties</b></span></div></div>",

You lose, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping calm, Naoto deftly slipped off her footwear and set it aside. Perhaps not the best start, but a trivial loss considering the stakes. Naoto was still the most dressed, having one more loss before she was tied with Yukiko, and with her odds being pretty much 50/50 the odds made it entirely likely to get Yukiko naked before Naoto was fully knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first roll might be impossible to predict, senpai, but each turn gives me a better understanding of the potential pattern. I'll be calling them with complete accuracy far before I'm showing anything embarrassing.\" Naoto said, her voice giving off an air of complete confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a complete lie, of course. However, the others didn't know that, and if any of them could find a pattern in such a random game it'd be Naoto. Naoto just hoped that her bluff actually turned out to be true, rather than make her look like an even bigger fool. Yukiko, to her credit, didn't seem too impressed by Naoto's bluff, though Chie and Rise showed piqued interest. Of course, it could also be due to the fact that Naoto's figure was the one mystery she didn't want people to have answered and this game could very well solve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolved to keep herself from losing more than one or two more matches (though she had no idea how to guarantee that), Naoto got ready again. Watching Yukiko's hands with rapt attention, Naoto watched the cup shake up and down, side to side, then finally come to rest upon the ground once more.

So long as she could keep at least one article of clothing ahead of Yukiko, she'd be safe. Of course, that didn't mean Naoto liked the idea of being reduced to her undergarments, or just her bra if things went poorly. While the other girls might have gladly shed their bras before their panties, Naoto was much more adamant about keeping her chest hidden than her lower regions. So far as everyone was aware, Naoto had a slim, boyish figure, and the Detective Prince had no intention of that perception changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'd work out a pattern.\" Naoto said, her air of confidence shining through. \"I'd suggest you do the smart thing and back out now, senpai, lest you find yourself joining Chie-chan and Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!

With a deft movement, the black fabric fell into a pool around her ankles, leaving the Amagai heiress in her nylons and panties below the waist. Embarrassing as it was, Yukiko could at least take solace in the fact that her black nylons kept her legs and panties mostly obscured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As can I, senpai.\" Naoto said, smiling as she watched Yukiko kick her skirt over to her slowly growing pile of lost clothing. \"And my math tells me you only have four losses left, while I have seven.

After all, another loss for Yukiko meant she'd start showing some serious skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eventuality.\" Naoto countered, reaching down to slip her socks off. \"I can't predict the results every time, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't predict the results, period.\" Yukiko replied. \"I told you, those initial wins were just luck. Now that your lucky streak is over, the game is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naoto was just a tad bit worried. She was, of course, bluffing about her ability to predict the rounds. Still, she had hoped the odds would be on her side, if only for the sake of her reputation as the Detective Prince. Still, she wasn't going to let this minor setback defeat her. She still had plenty of buffer clothing, after all. Yukiko would start to get more irrational if she lost more clothing, and that just might help Naoto. Perhaps her dice shaking would get sloppy, or she'd accidentally reveal the roll results before Naoto had to guess the result. At least... that was what Naoto hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had won again, Yukiko had returned to her showmanship, making a great deal of shaking the dice in the cup. Holding the cup above her head, Yukiko twirled around and gave a look around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather 'round everyone! The Detective Prince is about to meet her match, and I can guarantee you don't wanna miss this!\" Yukiko said in her best announcer voice.

That was the last piece of clothing she could afford to lose. All that was left now was her shirt, pants, and undergarments. There was no way Naoto was going to let the others see her in her underwear. Just no way at all. Heck, she'd refused to even be seen in a swimsuit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she'd agreed to the game, and now her confidence was coming back to bite her. If her luck didn't change, the self-conscious young woman wouldn't have much say in the matter. She had to win, even if it meant reducing her senpai to her birthday suit. Naoto knew she wouldn't be shown any mercy, so she couldn't afford to feel sorry for Yukiko should the tables turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, the worst case scenario flashed through Naoto's mind. Dropping her bra to the floor, exposing herself completely to the rest of the girls. Naoto's chest was her biggest insecurity; the stupid thing was just so big! She'd been able to hide it with binding and specially made brassieres before, but nothing could change the truth of their size. Ever since Rise had looked at that medical exam chart and seen her measurements, Naoto had been careful to avoid giving any hints as to the accuracy of what the idol had read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would they do? Rise would tease her, Yukiko might be embarrassed for her, little Nanako would probably be fascinated and confused, and Chie would probably share Yukiko's sentiments. At least none of them would be envious... at least Naoto didn't suspect they would. After all, none of her friends would let something like that threaten them... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Yukiko's snapping fingers brought the Detective Prince back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun! Pay attention, it's time for the next round! You've got another piece of clothing to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto didn't even try to give Yukiko a confident retort.

They were snug on her shapely rear end and hips. She had been meaning to buy bigger ones, as a few months back her lower body had unexpectedly filled out to more feminine proportions. Her shirt mostly hid her undergarments, but it could do nothing to hide her long legs and creamy thighs.

She was safe again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can count.\" Yukiko said sharply. Clearly this loss bothered the Amagi heiress. \"Let's just... get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further ceremony, Yukiko hooked her thumbs under her nylons, sliding them down her slender legs and exposing her fair, smooth skin to the room. Naoto surveyed the room as Yukiko stripped, trying to get an idea of everyone's state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise seemed to thoroughly enjoy the spectacle, simply reveling in watching the competition. And, of course, there was likely a bit of schadenfreude in knowing that there'd soon enough be a third loser on the couch. Chie was trying (and largely failing) to look like she wasn't drinking in the sight of Yukiko's body as it was revealed bit by bit. If Naoto didn't know any better, she'd figure the two pronounced bumps on Chie's chest were simply a sign of a cold room. Nanako, the most naive of them all in regards to everything going on, simply seemed to enjoy being around the older girls and treated like a big girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Yukiko, Naoto had to admit to herself that she couldn't entirely blame Chie for staring. Standing there in nothing but her lacy black-and-white bra and panties, the lace almost transparent in areas that didn't cover the important bits, Yukiko was a sight to behold. Why she had chosen to wear such risque undergarments for a sleepover with friends was a mystery that Naoto somewhat wanted to solve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could wait. For now, she had to secure her own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better be careful, senpai.\" Naoto said. \"Just one more loss and you'll be giving us all quite a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's cheeks burned crimson, almost matching her trademark sweater. \"S-silence! Nobody is seeing any more of me tonight! Hope you're ready to lose that shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for Naoto to point out that she'd already used that line, Yukiko threw the dice in the cup. Shaking vigorously, the normally kind and reserved girl slammed the cup down once more. \"Choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi-<br>\r\nClothing: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">sailor tie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red cardigan</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">skirt</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tanktop</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black nylons</span>, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto Shirogane-<br>\r\nClothing: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Hat</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">school coat</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">pants</span>, button up shirt, bra, panties</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The genius detective had never permitted anybody to see her in such a state of undress for obvious reasons, and now here she was without much choice in the matter. Nervously, Naoto began to unbutton her shirt with shaking hands. Each undone button revealed more and more skin, and Naoto's cheeks burned redder and redder as she progressed. Finally, the last button was reached, and Naoto reluctantly shrugged out of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first response from the other girls was a giggle from Rise. \"Heeheehee! I knew it!\" the starlet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've... never seen a bra like that before.\" Chie said softly, a bit confused and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's bra looked more like a small tank top rather than a proper brassiere. This was due to the nature of the garment, being specially made to simulate the effect of bindings without the hassle of having to wrap them. That and the modern materials used to make the garment allowed for Naoto to hide her chest so long as she had it on. Sure, there was a bit of discomfort from wearing such a thing, but a little discomfort was a small price to pay for concealing Naoto's ample assets. And now everyone could see it, and her secret was now known without having to even remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Seems you really go the extra mile in holding up that 'Prince' charade, huh?\" Yukiko teased. \"Can't understand why. Your body is way too feminine, Naoto-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto couldn't bring herself to speak. Between her embarrassing bra and the panties that clung far too tightly to her feminine hips, the blue-haired beauty felt more exposed than she had in her entire life. Even worse, another loss would mean losing her panties! The game was down to a maximum of three rounds now. Each combatant could only afford one more loss, and even that one loss would have a heavy price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! Next round and we get to see the good stuff!\" Rise cheered, seeming to be a bit more comfortable with her own nudity, though still blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's smile had returned. \"Two rounds to go, Naoto-chan. Hope you've come to terms with your fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get me naked, senpai. This I swear.\" Naoto said, doing her best to keep her voice even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko simply smirked and tossed the dice into the cup. As the cup was slapped against the floor once more, Naoto reminded herself that she could NOT afford to lose again. Even if it was all luck, she couldn't afford to let hers be bad.

Exposing her trimmed snatch wasn't much of a concern anymore. They'd see it in a few moments, anyway. She'd need both her arms free to conceal something more important. It was a vain hope, but her one of her last. With a groan, Naoto rolled to her stomach and reached behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" Rise called. \"Sit up straight and face us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Rise-chan and I had to do it that way!\" Chie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super sleuth returned to her knees, this time with her head hanging low and scarlet. The rules never actually stated she had to disrobe where everyone could see her, but she was in no condition to argue. Slowly, she returned to the task of getting rid of her bra. Her heart was racing, and her hands were trembling. And hers weren't the only ones. Everyone wanted to see what was under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nowhere to hide anymore. All she could do was draw it out. She couldn't whip it off. She's not fast enough. She'd be seen. And she couldn't cover up. It had to be slow. Slow and steady. There just might be a way to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's thoughts raced on like this, leaving her body to autopilot through the task at a snail's pace. It drove her friends <i>crazy</i>! The big secret was about to be revealed, yet it was being held just out of reach. It wasn't even fooling anyone. The normally stoic Naoto was suddenly wearing her emotions on her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teens exchanged a look. It started off with simple frustration, until Rise grinned. The message soon carried. Yukiko rose to her feet and crossed the room, well aware of what she had to do. Caught in her predicament, Naoto didn't notice a thing until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all her physical exercise, Naoto's arms gave no force against Yukiko. The strength was evident in the next moment, however, when Naoto's arms froze straight above her. Maybe the absence was just the surprise of having her bra yanked over her head so suddenly. Regardless, Naoto froze in place, giving her wide-eyed friends a show the boys would envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke or moved in what felt like an eternity. A clock on the wall showed it had only been 30 seconds. Sense finally returned to the great detective, and her arms dropped down in front of her, ending the show and starting the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were those F-cups*?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So says her medical chart,\" Rise said. \"I couldn't believe it either. Seeing really is believing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely a full hourglass figure,\" Yukiko added. \"Most girls would kill for a body like that, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the comments continued to rain down, Naoto tried to analyze her friends' voice tones. Were they sincerely admiring her, or was this sarcastic jeering? Yukiko's last comment drew her thoughts to an old story of a monk who fixed his bulbous nose, a monk who was latter mocked for caring about it to the point he fixed it. Was the whole thing a moment of mockery? She was the newest member of the group, and didn't exactly come off friendly before that. Could this be retribution for her rough treatment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's head was spinning, the thoughts flying around chaotically. It was the formula for bad reasoning. And that bad reasoning was made manifest in her next move. She'd figure out it was just playful ribbing in hindsight, but she dug herself into hole for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This is an estimate based on Japanese bra cups. A Japanese F is equal to an American and Australian DD, or an E in the United Kingdom.</span></div></div>",

Naoto knew that if she didn't redirect this flow of action soon, she would be right at the dead center of a Naoto grope party, and she didn't know if her body could take the attention. She had a brief mental image of herself lying down helpless as the three girls lavished her body with attention, unable to do anything but writhe and moan.

If I'm right I win and if I'm wrong then you win.\" Naoto thought this was a good game. It gave Nanako an edge. All she had to do was be right two times and then Yukiko would be done.

Nanako stood up obediently, reached behind her and pulled the zipper down on her dress. She shrugged her shoulders out of the loops and the dress slid gracefully down her body to the floor. Her simple white sweater met a cute pair of white cotton panties on Nanako's pelvis. The panties were emblazoned with the face a cartoon cat.

She couldn't lose any more or they'd start seeing her private places! Plus, she if lost completely then Yukiko would win and Nanako had a feeling that she had plans for the losers should that happen. She wasn't exactly sure what girls did with other girls when they were naked (and maybe she was a little curious), but Yukiko was definitely acting devious.

Rise did not like where this was headed. She was an idol, and was no stranger to entertaining a crowd. She had performed in concerts, on stages, for TV programs and it had been long since she had felt nervousness at taking the spotlight. However, now the notion of putting on a \u201cshow\u201d completely naked for her friends made her mouth dry. Yukiko began to speak again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour shadow never did get to show us <b>all</b> of Risette secrets hmm???? Why don\u2019t you help us with that now? Do a little dance for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise cheeks flushed bright red.  <i>N-no way You\u2019ve got to be kidding.</i> She started to protest but the look in the Amagi\u2019s eyes held no room for argument. With great reluctance, Rise gave a shaky smile and tried to play off the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c There\u2019s no way I can\u2019t do something like this! I-I\u2019ll show you what an idol can do\u2026\u2026\u201d Everyone in the room could see through her false bravado and smiled knowingly. Yukiko grinned and turned to say something to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Alright everyone! Let\u2019s form a circle around Rise so we can enjoy the show!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gathered around Rise in circle leaving the naked pop star the center of attention.  Rise\u2019s face was burning as she felt all the eyes of her friends on her voluptuous body. She was frozen, she didn\u2019t make a move as anxiety overwhelmed her. After several minutes of inactivity, Chie started to chant with Nanako and Yukiko. \u201cDance! Dance! Dance! Dance!\u201d. Naoto did not partake in this, but silently observed the situation with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With no other choice, Rise swallowed her pride and began to move her hips. Rise was extra aware of her nude figure and never felt more embarrassed. She couldn\u2019t stop the sway of her breasts as she continued to move back and forth to the music and felt conscious about the direction she was facing. At all times, someone was getting a view of her backside and her shaved nether regions,  something which made the teen idol very nervous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>C-Come on Risette, it\u2019s just another performance\u2026You\u2019ve been in worse situations right? N-nothing you can\u2019t handle. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even more embarrassed to hear cat calls from Chie and Yukiko as Nanako began giggling at her exposed state. Rise\u2019s face was now completely crimson and began to few hot, her nipples began to tighten more than before as she felt all eyes on her. Rise started to take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wh-What! No, I can\u2019t be! I can\u2019t be getting excited by all this, I must just be cold!.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to Rises horror she began to feel a wetness growing from below. As she was dancing, she quickly glanced down to see her pussy glistening with her own juices. It was very apparent and Rise tried desperately to divert attention from it. However, eventually her fluids began to trickle down her legs as she continued dancing, staining the carpet as she continued her movements. To Rise\u2019s dismay, this did not escape anyone\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cStop! \u201c<br>\r\n Yukiko suddenly commanded. Rise, completely humiliated at being caught ceased her movements, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDon\u2019t tell me she noticed!  <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of character, Rise responded meekly \u201c W-What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko smirked \u201c Are you <b>aroused</b> Rise-chan?  You\u2019re ruining the carpet of my inn!\u201d <br>\r\nRise instantly paled, and looked down. Her lack of public hair made the status of her arousal incredibly obvious as her fluids dripped on to the carpet slowly. The thick gob of fluid hanging from her pussy like a thread, swaying back and forth as she continued to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise scrambled to explain herself  \" N-no!...I was.... It's..errrr....It's not!......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko interrupted the idol's stammering, \" Well, that won't do at all Rise-Chan, I'm afraid going to have to punish you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had barely processed what the heiress said as she began to.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t think an idol like yourself should be this dirty don\u2019t you! I  think we need to get you cleaned up!\u201d With that, Yukiko continued to wipe Rise\u2019s most sensitive area! Rise could hardly believe it,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s touching me on my\u2026.. Uggghhhh no way! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait!\u201d but it was too late. She was being wiped down by her senpai right in front of her friends!\u2026. The idol only felt humiliation at this point. Yukiko was taking her time to be extra thorough in her \u201ccleaning\u201d and took her time to wash between her juniors folds.. To Rise\u2019s shame, the idol found herself to be getting incredibly aroused. The cloth had began to get wet from the idol's fluids and Rise let out a moan, which she instantly regretted. Yukiko gasped and tuttet \u201cWhy Rise! Are you getting excited by all of this?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> No!!! No one has ever touched me there\u2026. Besides myself. \u2026.. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise turned even redder than she already was. She was an idol of Japan! The object of desire for many males all across the school,\u2026.No, all across the country! Now her friends were about to get a glimpse of her most intimate areas, something that no one else had seen before. Rise had never been shy to show a little skin, but now she was baring it all! Her confidence now completely gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, with  smug authority then asked \u201cWhy Rise-chan\u2026. would you kindly lean against the wall and spread your legs so I can clean you properly?\u201d <br>\r\nShocked by the order, and already completely shamed from her earlier display. Rise leaned against the wall and drew her legs back so that she was in an M position. The other girls huddled around the pop star to inspect her entire body. Rise was completely mortified, her pussy was still dripping with her fluids to which all the girls took notice.  Her clit was completely engorged and was poking it\u2019s way out of its hood. Her folds bloomed open like a flower revealing the secrets to her most precious region. At this close range, Rise noticed the very lewd smell of excitement her pussy was emitting. She almost died as she saw Yukiko crinkle her nose and commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to have to do a more thorough cleaning!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blushed and merely held her legs apart, feeling very vulnerable, but also incredibly excited as her shaved pussy continued to be on full display.   Why did I have to shave ALL my hair down there !!  She inwardly cursed her choice, then yelped as she felt Yukiko\u2019s cloth come in contact with her labia. Yukiko wiped Rise very gently and with great care causing a moan to escape the idol.  No\u2026No\u2026. This feels good? No\u2026. If this keeps up\u2026 No Risette can\u2019t come here!!! I can\u2019t I won\u2019t give senpai the satisfaction! But it was a wasted effort as Rise began to shiver at her impending orgasm. Yukiko had begun to dive in Rise pussy and began to finger her g-spot! Alarmed Rise squealed \u201cSenpai!!!\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn high spirits, Yukiko chided \u201c Now, now Rise I have to make sure you\u2019re completely clean don\u2019t I?\u201d She paused for a second, <br>\r\n\u201cHmmm this place looks especially unclean..\u201d With that being said, Yukiko peeled back the hood of Rise\u2019s clitoris, leaving her hard clit fully exposed to the air! Rise groaned at the new sensation and was completely red-faced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mortified, and exerting all of her will power not to cum she nearly screamed \u201c SENPAI!\u201d Yukiko grinned and began wiping her fully exposed clitoris with extra vigor. Rise moaned loudly and felt her grip on reality slowly fade. Her pussy was now fully agape twitching in her efforts to not spray her juices right then and there. Rise breaths were getting shallower by the second and was panting . Drool was running down her lips in anticipation of the climax that was to come. Her anus, exposed to the world was twitching uncontrollably  as she nearly reached the height of her pleasure. The teen idol knew she was a miserable sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t believe it, I\u2019m going to do it here, no one has ever seen me naked until now\u2026.. I can\u2019t believe it, I can\u2019t!! I have to hold onn!!!!! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Rise failed to notice, was Yukiko\u2019s fingers slowly creeping towards her other hole. Taking a sudden interest in her twitching asshole, the heiress innocently stuck her elegant fingers  deep into the idols anus. Rise\u2019s eyes shot open as she felt her  fingers wriggling inside her other entrance! Her face turned crimson and she began to get even more aroused by the humiliation she was put in \u201c N-NO Senpai!!! You\u2019re going , you\u2019re making\u2026. me\u2026. I\u2019m going to come!!!\u201d Her words fell on deaf ears as everyone began laughing. Rise was overwhelmed by the sensations. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all agreed it was game time, but they all had a different idea for a game, and each idea was overruled by a different suggestion. In the end, they decided to be fair about it, but also agreed democracy wouldn't help them this time. They each wrote their desired game on a slip of paper, threw them into Naoto's hat, and had Nanako pick one out at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko continued, \"<i>Monopoly</i> it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the grace of a kid on Children's Day, Yukiko set up the Inn's American set of the classic board game, pausing only to reassure Chie and Nanako that this edition is bilingual while also pointing out that it still uses American dollars instead of Japanese yen. However, someone took advantage of this pause to shatter Yukiko's good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko-senpai,\" Rise called. \"This is my suggestion, not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you wanted <i>Monopoly</i>, too?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you speak up before we drew lots?\" Yukiko added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only changed my mind after I heard your idea, Senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Naoto interrupted. \"How can you deduce your lot from Yukiko-senpai's? I've seen both of your hand writings, and they're too similar for an untrained eye to differentiate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko wanted regular <i>Monopoly</i>. I was a little more specific, and it's right on this slip. We're playing <i>Strip Monopoly</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls froze in place at Rise's revelation, the only change being a noticeable redness coming to their tightening faces. While Rise continued setting up the board, Naoto was the first to regain her composure and confirm the starlet's claim. The slip hadn't moved since Nanako put it down, and it was definitely Rise's handwriting. Nanako had selected <i>Strip Monopoly</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are <i>not</i> playing a strip game!\" Chie called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wasn't your original suggestion!\" Yukiko snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto added, \"And because we've now decided against strip games. The vote is four to one against stripping, therefore, we're keeping our clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" Rise began, \"we did not stipulate that we had to stick to our original games. I had every right to change my mind, and I did. Second, we didn't stipulate that any sort of game wasn't allowed. We were free to put down any game we wanted. Third, we drew lots because we agreed democracy wouldn't get us anywhere. You guys out-voting me means nothing. Last, and most important, we drew lots and agreed to play whatever Nanako drew because she'd be fair. She drew <i>Strip Monopoly</i>, so we're playing <i>Strip Monopoly</i>. And if you don't like it, then ask Nanako if anything I said was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls lowered their heads in defeat, knowing Rise was right and Nanako would be forced to agree with her. They just steeled their resolves, deciding to play carefully and not shed any skin until Rise was willing to go back to the regular game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this work?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's the same basic rules: go around the board, collect money, buy stuff, and try to not go bankrupt through selling and mortgages and smart strategy. A double stills mean roll again, three doubles in a row still means go to directly jail, chance and community cards are all completely the same. The main difference is our clothes are worth cash. We can use them to buy stuff like money, or we can sell or auction them off like property. A general etiquette is that if you have another person's shirt and that same person has your shirt, or anything like that, you're supposed to trade them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much are the clothes worth?\" Chie grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can debate this, but I was thinking socks and slippers would be worth $50 each, and they count as two items. Naoto's hat and our sailor ties can be worth $50 as well. We'll make our coats worth $100 and our skirts and blouses go for $200 dollars each. Then $300 for our bras and $500 for our panties. Any problems yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko speaks first, \"My nylons? They're one item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can be worth $100 instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Nanako?\" Naoto asked. \"That works for us since we all came here from school and remain in our uniforms even now, but Nanako is in civilian attire. Furthermore, we all saw during our bath that she wasn't wearing as many items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought of that, too. Her slippers and socks can be worth the same $50 each, and her panties go for the same $500 as ours. Since there's nothing under her sweater, that's sort of like our bras. But it's also part of her outerwear, so let's say $400 for her sweater. And since her dress is both top and bottom but also shares a role with sweater for a top, how about $300 dollars for her dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still leaves her short $150 compared to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll give her that in money,\" Rise said. \"We'll start with $1500 like normal, and Nanako can have $1650 instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls nodded, wry smiles spreading across their faces. They still weren't thrilled to be playing a strip game, but the promised amounts meant it should be a while before they lost any of their clothes. As such, Naoto began writing the prices for each garment on loose pages, ensuring everyone would know their values.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other differences?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just getting out of jail. Rolling a double still gets you out of jail for free, and there's the famous card, but there's more to it. If you want to pay your way out, you have to pay with an article of clothing. The only exception is if you're naked, in which case you pay in cash and have to do a forfeit at the end of the game. Also, if you fail to roll a double three times, you not only have to pay, you have to do a forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are the forfeits?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise grinned darkly. \"That's for the rest of us to decide, but it could be anything, especially if we have the same problems deciding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing this out of her mind, Naoto addressed Rise. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that covers it. So, for the banker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanako,\" the teens called simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bank was handed to Nanako, as was the four function calculator the Amagis kept in the box, just in case someone needed a little help. While Nanako counted out each players' starting amounts, the rest of the girls chose their pieces: Yukiko was the iron, Chie the Scottie Dog, Naoto the top hat, Rise the car, and Nanako the boot.

The game, as she had explained to little Nanako and three noticeably-flustered trio of other girls, was the same as Hide and Seek, but with one twist: For every five minutes the seeker is unable to find anyone, she must remove an article of clothing.  After a few minutes of squabbling over whether or not socks counted as a single item (they totally didn't, and she had their resident detective and her masterful debating skills to thank for that), they all finally agreed, with the added condition that anyone who remains hidden is allowed to put all of their clothes back on, assuming they are able to hide for ten full minutes, and anyone who was found would switch places with the seeker.  The previous seeker would then be given one minute to find a hiding spot.  Hiding players could move about as they pleased, but if the seeker caught sight of them, they were caught, no questions asked.  The players could hide anywhere in the inn, with the exception of the adjoining onsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her initial uneasiness, even Yukiko had to agree with terms like those, and within minutes she had set a recurring alarm - a loud, low bell chime made by a large digital clock - to go off every five minutes, which could be heard from anywhere in the Inn, at least according to the Amagi heiress.  It wasn't a perfect system, but it was likely the best they were going to be able to manage on such short notice.  By the time they had all set off to hide, Rise had to admit that she had felt almost giddy at the prospect of what they were about to do.  While no stranger to wearing very little in front of others, or even in front of a crowd, the added stakes still made for an exciting twist.  Even little Nanako had agreed to play, her cheeks flushed as the implications of their game only half-registering in her seven-year-old brain.  Rise almost wished Souji were playing as well, as she still had yet to get a straight answer out of her grey-haired senior when it came to what he thought of her during the previous day's swimsuit competition...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of the negotiation for the others' participation, Rise had volunteered to go first.  It had seemed easy enough, after all - Naoto may have been all-but-guaranteed to choose the perfect hiding place, but Chie and Yukiko were not exactly known for their finesse or subtlety, and as smart as Nanako was for her age, she was just a child.  How creative could any of their hiding spots truly be?  The answer, unfortunately, turned out to be quite different than the red-headed starlet had expected.  Now two and a half minutes into her search, and she hadn't found a single trace of any of them.  All the girls had removed their shoes when they'd arrived, but Rise seemed to be on the path to losing another article as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using my Persona would be cheating.\" Rise reminded herself, staving off the small, nagging temptation.  She wasn't about to cheat her friends, though, no matter how badly she wanted to win.  Besides, she was fairly certain she had just figured out what she needed to do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa-</b><br>\r\n<b>Clothing: stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Rise...</span></div></div>",

Rather, it <i>will be</i> completely searched, as soon as Rise goes through the closet. While a fairly obvious hiding spot most would have searched initially, its distance from the door to the hall led Rise to wedge a broom between the sliding door and the wall to which it slides, locking it until the broom was removed, and save it for last as she instead chose to start her search at the door to the hall and work her way outward. The door hadn't rattled and the broom remained in place. No signs of life, but any opponent could have been careful and simply sat there, hoping to not arouse suspicion and maybe Rise would forget all about the closet. Regardless, the broom slid out with a rough tug by the recovering starlet, fighting her all the way before she dropped it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was faint, and it stopped suddenly, but Rise was certain she heard them. Rhythmic thumping sounds were coming from the hall a moment ago. Someone was on the move, and maybe Rise could catch that someone in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was halfway to the door before the broom even hit the ground, her steps loudly announcing her presence and drowning out any noise that might indicate her target's location. Sliding to a stop, she swivels her head back and forth, looking down the hall in hopes of catching even the slightest glimpse of someone. Nothing, not even a shadow or sound. Being in the middle of the hallway left no clear indication of a direction to follow, and every room being unlocked offered more possible hiding places than shadows in The Midnight Channel. For no real reason, Rise bolted off to her left, mumbling prays she made the right decision rendered inaudible by her steps on the wood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even ten paces later, Rise swore she heard it again, that sound of someone on the move right behind her. She spun on her heels and looked again to an empty hall before grinding to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone was definitely like right behind me,\" she muses softly. \"And if they're gone, then they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise trails off as she enters into the adjacent room, 109, hoping to catch another hint of her target only to see a room that seemed untouched since the staff cleaned it. Regardless, the nearest chair was swiftly used to employ the same strategy of locking the closet. It wasn't as efficient, but going back for the broom was out of the question, especially with someone so close and the clock ticking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again!\" Rise called mid-stride, turning around once more to the foot falls from nowhere. However, this time was very different. There was no one there again, but this time Rise was practically in the corner. Had there been anyone behind her, that person shouldn't have been able to move more than a meter without passing in front of Rise. Her face crestfallen, Rise heavily stamps out the tune of her last song to test the thought. As she expected, the same stomping seemed to be coming from behind her. Stamping her foot once more and almost breaking the floor beneath her, Rise yells, \"An echo!\" Rise had been chasing her own steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting the chance to refocus her efforts and get back on track, another sound came with its echo, and it wasn't from Rise this time. It was that bell from the inn's clock, the description of which should have tipped off Rise to the acoustics of the inn before she began making a low snarling. Rise spent so long chasing her own tail she lost five minutes, and with it an article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Rise sighed. \"I'm still on optional clothing anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith speed Shadow Rise would have envied, the school jacket was quickly dangled off the end of Rise's fingers, waiting for its owner to figure out where to put it. On the one hand, Rise wasn't allowed to wear it anymore, and carrying it around would mean it was technically on her even if not as intended. On the other, there was a chance she'd get to redress. Apparently the game hadn't been thought out as well as the starlet had assumed, but she couldn't help but smile when she thought of what would happen when her teammates discovered this oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to come back for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to lose additional time, Rise unceremoniously dropped her jacket on the floor and took off once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa-<br>\r\nClothing: stockings, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, bra, thong</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Rise's next move?</span></div></div>",

While still fairly early in the night, the moon illusion had dissipated and most of Inaba was dark. It meant only one thing: game time. However, they were busy mulling over what to play. Rise made a valid point in this regard, that Naoto should pick the game since she's the newest member of the group and it would serve as a sort welcoming gesture, but it didn't seem to be helping them too much. All four girls watched Naoto, whose frustration was visible even in the low light of the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't to say that Naoto was without ideas, but she wasn't fond of any of them. Poker, <i>Janken</i>, and <i>Clue</i> gave her too much of an advantage (which was a tempting offer, but she would rather play something challenging), the Amagi Inn didn't come with too many video games, every one was a button mashers for boys around Nanako's age, and the remainder of Naoto's games couldn't be played by five players. There was one game they could all play on a predominantly level playing field and it was bound to excite Nanako since there weren't many chances for her to learn of this game, but Naoto was fairly certain that the other three didn't want to play that game. At the same time, though, Naoto had to admit that the only way to get rid of a sour taste that's been lingering in her mouth for a long while was to play this game, and she probably wasn't going to get another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Naoto-kun!\" Rise urged. \"I don't care what it is, we'll have fun! Just call something and end the boredom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the other girls offer their quiet agreement to play any game,  Naoto said plainly. \"As you wish. Please wait one moment while I obtain the necessary aids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost didn't do it. Naoto was almost certain she'd found another game they could all play, but Rise broke her concentration before she could piece together her fragmented memory. Therefore, they were going to play the first game, even if it means the rest of them get uncomfortable again. Additionally, it'd be easy enough to convince herself that this was a mere continuation of the previous game; say Souji and Yosuke dropped out like Teddy and Kanji while Nanako jumped in, and Yukiko and Rise sobered up enough to continue playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" Chie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto reminded her, \"The agreement was you'd play anything and be content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why The King's Game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Chie-senpai and I didn't formally drop out, we didn't complete the first game, we simply ran out of time. I contend that starting something without finishing it to be the same as discarding something in the trash, and I abhor throwing away anything. Therefore, in order to become content with the game, we need to continue. Allowing Rise-chan and Yukiko-senpai to return as well as permitting Nanako-chan to enter is sportsmanship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie wanted to press the issue much further, but felt Naoto's natural eloquence and quick thinking would stifle her attempts to weasel out of this game. Instead, the time and effort were refocused on explaining the game to Nanako. Certainly Yukiko and Rise didn't need to hear the rules again, they are the ones who explained it the first time. However, it was Nanako and her ignorance of the game responsible for instilling a new-found dread into Naoto and Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can just drop out whenever I want, but then I'm out for the rest of the game?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naoto and Chie were shocked and internally berating themselves for missing such an obvious escape, Yukiko answered in their stead. \"Nanako-chan, normally this is a drinking game. If you don't want to do a challenge, you wouldn't need to quit the whole game. Instead, you'd drink a shot of alcohol or something, and you'd only drop out if you got too drunk to continue or the game got too intense. Since we aren't including alcohol, we decided we have to complete every order, and can only drop out between draws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Rise continued, \"Although, there is supposed to be a penalty for dropping out of the game, and the original can be played another way that allows us to skip orders we don't like without drinks. Should we play it that way instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Nanako answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Chie answered. Finally, an out for certain orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose authentic would be appropriate,\" Naoto concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if everyone else is...\" Yukiko begins, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already knew this other way, having been called to rooms in the middle of such games. Unfortunately, the thought alone left her unable to vocalize the specifics and reveal Rise's plan in time to stop them. Rise's deceit could be used as a reason to invalidate the decision, but Naoto the debater was in no position to make that excuse and even nullified any such objections previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then here are the rules. The drop out penalty is one super order from the remaining players, and the way to skip challenges is to take something off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!?\" Chie and Naoto mumbled. They even had the same follow-up thought: This is a strip game, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, Naoto-kun,\" Rise said darkly, \"we agreed to play anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging her head in defeat, Naoto mumbled, \"Are slippers and socks one item or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one, but our ties and your hat count, too. Now then, let the games begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the high spirits and playfulness of Rise and Nanako, Yukiko and Chie were agitated shadows focusing on Naoto. Their looks were piercing through the joyous atmosphere created by Nanako and Rise, and they were beginning to make Naoto feel dizzy. Even Naoto was joining in this assault. Embarrassment was her objective, she wasn't about to lie any further, but she intended to do it with everyone remaining clothed. The choice even prevented her from specifically targeting Rise in an effort to make her end the game sooner, and that's before Nanako became ecstatic over playing an adult game, even with such a disadvantage in her clothing count. She could only hope it would be a short night.

She was this turn's Queen, and that meant she was safe from any challenges while the others were at her mercy. While she had no way of knowing who drew what number, the added mystery made every challenge more fun. Naoto's only real dilemma was what kind of challenge to put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, she could benefit from setting the bar low. Every subsequent challenge had to be more extreme than the last, according to Yukiko's explanation of the rules. If the challenges started tame, it would be easy to follow through with them rather than back out and sacrifice some clothing. On the other hand, if she set the bar high, she might be able to start knocking out her competition early. The latter option ran the risk of coming back to bite her, and that made Naoto nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Naoto resigned herself to a challenge of middling intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the Queen, I order Number 2 to dance for me.\" Naoto deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the command, Rise happily hopped up. <i>It figures Rise-chan would be the one I pick first.</i> Naoto thought to herself. Out of all the contestants, Rise was the most comfortable with putting on a show; as such, the challenge was completely trivial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Pretty tame for the first order of the game, Naoto-chan!\" Rise teased, dancing effortlessly as she did so. \"The next Queen better turn up the heat, or this game is gonna be really boring~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Naoto hated to admit it, Rise was right. If the game was going to get embarrassing, as Naoto had intended, the game would need to get much more intense before they died of boredom. Deciding that she'd make her next order as Queen one more likely to get somebody to back out, Naoto drew her next round's straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko Amagi -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise Kujikawa -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto Shirogane -<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, slippers, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako Dojima -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, dress, sweater, panties</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her normally calm demeanor, Naoto wasn't shy about her status this game. Fortunately, she remembered to conceal her number from the starlet's prying eyes. It wasn't hard to figure out who was Queen this time, even before Rise jumped out of her seat and flashed a red dot. The girls knew they were in trouble now. Yukiko and Rise knew the mechanics of this game best, but the former was more likely to play a tamer game, unless she got drunk (placebo or otherwise). And the glint in Rise's eyes only confirmed their fears: Rise wouldn't be as merciful as Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this!\" she said. \"Just give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the room a quick glance, looking for the box she needed for the order. Nanako and Yukiko had it earlier, and they couldn't have been done with it - the Amagis bought one of those big boxes that could feed a family of six, no way those two could have finished it off already. The trick now was figuring out what they did with it. The five of them cleared some space for the game, so it was just a matter of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha!\" Rise called. Now she could call her order. Explain it, she reminded herself. Explain the whole thing first, then call two numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresenting the box, she continued, \"All righty! I'm ordering two of you to play The <i>Pocky</i> Game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree faces quickly fell, while Nanako cocked her head. She loved the chocolate-covered bread sticks known as <i>Pocky</i>, especially when her dad made her a cup of coffee, but she'd never heard of a game using them. How would it even work? Is it like an eating contest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuttering and stammering, Yukiko managed to give Nanako a brief explanation, one that flustered the young girl a bit, but also got her excited. Two players take one <i>Pocky</i> and bite an end. The pair continue eating small bites of the stick until either one of them flinches. Naturally, should no one flinch, the duo wind up kissing. The person who flinches loses, while a kiss means it's a draw, or they could continue the game until someone does flinch. It's simple, occasionally short, and a standard for The King's Game, especially in one of those boxed versions with suggestion cards or as a penalty game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was an adult game, Nanako thought, even if I did bring up that puppy movie from America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just two little things to add,\" Rise continued. \"We wouldn't want anyone to cheat the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'll do the draw rule, but the kiss has to be held for three seconds to be a draw. I think Naoto-kun has a good watch for the job. And second, whoever flinches first has to...tell us how much she's done with a guy. We get to ask questions, if we can tell you lied you do another penalty game, and there's no easy way out of either penalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three high school girls quickly turned several shades of red, though they weren't entirely sure of the main cause. The <i>Pocky</i> Game would have been embarrassing enough if it had been called during the class trip with the boys around. Knowing up front that they were going to be playing another girl only intensified those feelings, even though this was a more private setting with a smaller audience. However, in the event they did flinch, was an empty act somewhat forced upon them really as bad as revealing something they did freely? Would attempting to lie be worth the risk of a worse penalty? And choosing to skip the task meant losing a precious article of clothing very early in the game, revealing a small weakness and risking major exposure later in the game, when the orders got more distressing. The only ones not even slightly bothered by this situation were the immunized Rise and the eager Nanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Rise called, piercing through the silence of her peers, \"numbers. How about...1 and 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break,\" Naoto breathed. First Rise ruins her order, and now she's ordered the super sleuth into this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss or strip, Naoto mused, before realizing her other option. Maybe all she had to do was fake confidence. If her partner had a shaken demeanor, then an air of acceptance, perhaps even a little faux anticipation, would be all she'd need to bluff her opponent right out of the game. In fact, starting now might just cause her opponent to strip instead of even try playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto happily stood, trying to be quick even though she paused after Rise finished. She flashed 1 on her lot straight to the group, feigning a partial smile and acquiring a look of restrained joy. At the moment her friends will probably find it rather suggestive, but a simple explanation later should be more than enough to eliminate this problem. Of course, that assumes they don't already know her strategy. If that happened, this would really be a game of chicken. Well, in one case that's possible. Chie hasn't once suggested that she'd be able to see through this feint, it would have to work on her. The primary concern would be Yukiko, Naoto thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's smile attempted to flee when she locked eyes with her opponent, but firmly locked into a more frightened grin. Starting at the 3, her gaze followed the upstretched arm lower and lower until she reached the euphoric face of Nanako. I needed a better plan, Naoto scolds herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naoto Shirogane</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, slippers, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nanako Dojima</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, dress, sweater, panties</span></div></div>",

How about...2 and 4!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo groans echoed across the room together, blocking out Naoto's sigh and Nanako's tiny cry. Before the room grew quiet again, the glint returned to Rise's eyes and the competitors blushed even deeper. Even Naoto was a little curious about this pairing. They were the only two who didn't address each other with honorifics, the closest pair in the bunch. There was always some wonder about just how comfortable they were with each other. It was definitely rooted in the perverted part of her mind, but that didn't stop the detective from pondering this like any other case. And that was even before she sat down with Teddie at Junes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo-hoo!\" Rise called. \"The princess finally scores a prince! Too bad it's the sadist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How...\" the duo replied. Both of them faced the red head, trying to find an answer to this conundrum. All the while, Nanako was trying to figure out why Naoto was suppressing her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto asked, \"Teddie tell you, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke-kun,\" Rise answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their underclassmen shared in a joke that excluded Nanako, the two players felt their faces contort. They stayed the color of Yukiko's cardigan, but the downward gaze shifted forward, following the course of the daggers in their eyes. A soft grinding came from Yukiko's mouth, while Chie could feel her body trying to shift into a fighting stance. The look they exchanged said it all: kill the bear, then the pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you two going to play?\" Nanako asked, snapping the pair back into the game and returning both faces to their previous state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm in,\" Chie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too early to strip,\" Yukiko mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the air, awaiting the coming sight, and the possible confession, or better. The two best friends rose and stood face to face in the center of the gathering,trying not to look at each other. Naoto crossed to Rise's side, knowing her watch and status as a neutral party would be crucial for her senpai. Nanako slid over a few step, hoping to find a spot to see the whole show. Last to move was Rise, who slowly drew the <i>Pocky</i>, hoping the added tension would make one of them flinch. It wasn't long before the biscuit's tips were resting between two rows of teeth, and slowly began to vanish with each light crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small bites they took did make it easier for both of them to control their treat, but it also prolonged their torture. They were hoping the other would cave under this pressure, but all they could focus on was their own racing heart, trying to remember it wasn't <i>that</i> kind of <i>doki doki</i>. And the heat on their faces was purely out of embarrassment, and the trembles were fear-induced. They were even trying to convince themselves that they need to speed up, just to be done with it, but all their only responses were harder shakes. Yukiko and Chie both made the same mistake, and Rise was loving every minute of it, especially once they realized the other problem in their method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so busy thinking about what was going to happen, neither girl noticed how close they had become until they began fighting for the last piece. Instinctively, they both looked forward, eye to eye for the first time since they started. The pair blushed even harder, hoping no one saw their little accident. Letting anyone know they locked lips was horrible, but they'd die if anyone found out they gave each other tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Yukiko both realized they'd come too far to back out now. Instead of pulling away before the longest three seconds of their lives had past, they slowly exhaled a breath neither knew they were holding. It helped them relax even in the face of this humiliation, but it also turned Rise's restrained chuckles into a full Yukiko-style laugh attack; in Rise's eyes, it looked like they were coming to embrace the embracer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Time!\" Naoto called through a flustered smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls quickly broke the kiss and stomped off to their seats, not even raising their heads to face their friends. They both tossed their stick into the cup, hoping to avoid the coming taunts, but to no avail. And it was even worse than they expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rise asked grinning, \"how was your first french with a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie chose to bury her head in her knees, Yukiko shot the starlet a sinister look and mumbled, \"Shut up and shuffle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Rise took the heat off of her, the detective was still a little nervous. She couldn't admit it aloud, <i>ever</i>, but she got a little caught up in her friends' predicament. While it was a little fun to watch them squirm and a clear sign she might be able to strip Rise quickly, it also meant she wasn't watching the time. She was hoping her friends wouldn't know that the three second time limit was over about six seconds prior to their separation. So long as they didn't know any better, the night wouldn't be too rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pierced through the silence, both by speaking and by slamming down the cup. \"All right, let's go again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naoto Shirogane</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, slippers, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nanako Dojima</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, dress, sweater, panties</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, it was Chie that had drawn the red dot this round, the athletic girl proudly displaying her status as the round's Queen for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since Rise thought that was just <i>so</i> funny...\" Chie said, her eyes taking on a vindictive appearance. \"Let's see how she likes this next challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being flustered, Rise simply flashed Chie her famous smile. \"I'm up for any challenge you can come up with, Senpai.\" Rise shot back in her ever-chipper tone. \"There's not a thing you can think of that would fluster me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto really wished Rise wouldn't taunt Chie like that. While Chie's vengeance may have been focused toward Rise, the nature of the game made targeting the starlet impossible. Whatever Chie came up with, it ran the risk of humiliating one of the other girls; Chie could very easily make herself as much of a target for revenge as Rise seemed dead set on doing to herself. Chie's next statement, in fact, cemented this status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about this? The number of my choosing has to take an upskirt shot, and text it to a guy of my choosing!\" Chie declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Rise was shocked at this turn of events. The young idol had never expected Chie of all people to be capable of an order so scandalous. With this one command, Chie had seeming set a precedent for the rest of the game; any further challenge would potentially be just as embarrassing as removing an article of clothing. Whoever was chosen for this challenge would not possibly take it well, Naoto reasoned, and would soon find herself set on the same kind of warpath Chie had embarked upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and what if you pick my number, Chie-senpai?\" Naoto asked, hoping to get out of the challenge on a technicality, as an upskirt shot was technically impossible in her state of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I pick you, then you'll just have to drop your pants and take a picture of your underwear. Simple as that.\" Chie responded. \"But come on Naoto, what are the odds I'd get you anyway. One in four, right? So, now that that's settled... I choose number four!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whitening of Naoto's face made it clear who number four was. While Chie stuttered out a half-baked apology, Naoto's mind paid her no heed, instead focusing on a risk analysis of the situation. Naoto had just been pushed into an unfortunate situation: either she would be the first person to take something off, or someone she knew was about to get a picture of her in her panties. Neither situation was anything Naoto wanted, but she really didn't have much choice at the moment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naoto stood and reached for her fly with a sigh. Partly to make someone else the first coward of the game, but the choice was primarily a result of keeping her senses and reasoning even in the face of this horror. Since Chie was genuinely apologetic, the picture would most likely be sent to someone they knew well and wouldn't seem the type to send it circling the globe a few million times. In all probability, she reasoned, my private garments and athletic legs are going to Kanji-kun, possibly Souji-senpai. Almost certainly not Teddie or Yosuke-senpai, and definitely not a random classmate or authority figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight shudder shook Naoto from the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji-kun. Soaking in every detail of my panties. And every curve in my legs. She could already see his face flushing at the sight. And the fit he'd have if Chie-chan signed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathe, she reminds herself. She needed to steady herself. Not just for the task, but also to block out Kanji's next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps I should fixate on Souji-kun. The enigma of our group. Who tried to record Rise-chan's Midnight Channel escapades, or so says Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're not going to share it! Hold that thought, Naoto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a soft zip echoed around the room. Naoto just barely managed to open her eyes and see her friends grinning at her discomfort. Even Chie, who moments ago was regretting this decision, was suddenly eager to get even this slight glimpse at Naoto's figure. All of them except Yukiko-senpai, she noted. And for some reason Rise was the most excited of the group. Thankfully, the mental efforts needed to figure out why distracted her from her own humiliation. Without her legs quaking, gravity made slow work of lowering her pants to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physical exercises that earned The Detective Prince her reputation gave Naoto legs that could probably overpower Chie's Galactic Punt. And in spite of wanting to embody her male detective idols, her legs were smooth, and had the shine and velvety look that came with skin moisturizers. Even hidden under the tail of her shirt, a distinct floral pattern was clear on a pair of sky blue boyshorts showing as much skin as a pair of athletic bloomers. Unfortunately for her audience, a rough size of her waist wasn't going to happen...at least, not <i>before</i> she parted her shirt and completed the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-senpai!\" Naoto called after several seconds past. \"Do you intend to take the picture, or should I continue standing here as the new entertainment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-On it,\" Chie answered, snapped out of her stupor by the words of the scarlet-faced sleuth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore photographer and subject made any coordinated move, Yukiko rose, her face extremely flushed and equally panicked. Conversely, Rise was scowling, and it sounds like she just grumbled. Confusion enveloped the remaining girls, hoping to establish what had Rise dejected and Yukiko frantic. Their first thought was it had to have something to do with this challenge, but what's the big deal? Certainly, nobody wanted this course of events and the pace the night would now follow, but the rules were clear. Either Naoto strips or she poses. The order won't go away, and the challenges get more intense than this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Yukiko-senpai!\" Rise whined. \"Let it go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" she answered. \"We're doing this the right way, not forcing it into the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forcing what into the game?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko continued, \"This order forces you to remove your clothes to comply. If you go through with it and make the order official, stripping becomes part of the game. Once that happens, the payments for refusing has to escalate, usually to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in!\" Naoto called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need the rest of the description, or the official discussion. The stripping was bad enough when she had some form of control over it. Leaving it to the discretion of the Queen was unfathomable. Once Rise made this a stripping game, Naoto made one resolution: her bra stays on. It was bad enough they knew she wore a chest suppressor, even without knowing what it was. But Rise knew all about it. Naoto's greatest stroke of good fortune was Rise's apparent silence on the matter. She wasn't about to risk it and finally explain that to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so the vote is one to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...four,\" Rise sighs. \"Fine, we keep our clothes on. We'll have to reshuffle the numbered sticks so Chie-senpai can give a new order. But first, this means she gave an illegal order. We'll have to give Chie-senpai a penalty order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chie called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this or our clothes come off,\" Rise said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Naoto continued, \"even if you wanted to change your mind, we still have you out-voted. You're performing the penalty either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" Yukiko said. \"The order was withdrawn before any of the hurdles were cleared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stood in front of all of you and dropped my pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the order was about taking a photo and sending it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was about an up-skirt,\" Rise noted. \"Dropping her pants was a workaround.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's comparable to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp whistling pierced through the discourse. The discussion was going nowhere, so Chie got proactive. With Naoto and Rise speaking out for a penalty against their objections, there was only one way to decide this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie asked, \"What do you think Nanako-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naoto Shirogane</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, slippers, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nanako Dojima</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, dress, sweater, panties</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nanako's head sank, trying very hard not to look at Chie. The announcement was only a formality at this point. Everyone knew how Nanako was ruling already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Chie-chan,\" Nanako started, \"but Rise-chan's right. You told Naoto-kun to drop her pants. It was part of the order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All right</i>!\" Rise declared. \"Now then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Naoto interjected. \"Since the order is only illegal due to my choice in attire, I believe that I should decide Chie-senpai's punishment unilaterally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that idea!\" Chie added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho could blame her? Yukiko may have been her best friend, but she could get wrapped up in the atmosphere again. Plus, their relationship meant they knew things about each other that would be a potent weapon in this game. Rise wasn't shy about her intentions, and she already demonstrated her knowledge of \"appropriate\" games. While she probably hadn't been exposed to something like this before, that inexperience made Nanako a loose cannon. She'd want to keep up with her friends, even if that meant calling an order that seemed bizarre to everyone. Even her vote against Rise was the last one. Her newest friend Naoto was the safest bet, especially after the tame order. And this ensured Rise couldn't interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun has a point,\" Yukiko noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing herself backwards, Rise mumbled out, \"You guys are no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rise in submission, Naoto pulled Chie on her feet and into the center of the circle. Normally, Chie's process would have been perfect. However, she failed to factor in her faux pas during the game, the one that led them here. The one that had Naoto standing in front of her friends in her panties. Furthermore, since this was a penalty, and not an official order, Naoto didn't have to worry about setting a precedent for the game. Although, Naoto wasn't cruel, and frequently found herself in a situation that required her to keep a level head. She would be fair, but in a harsh way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is extend your arms out to your sides, similar to how a fighter's reach is measured, but with your palms down and your hands open. Then you have to hold it for five minutes after I say go. No dropping them whatsoever. And, in the interest of fairness, after I say go, no one is allowed to make contact with you, either directly or through a tossed object. If you fail, we start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame!\" Rise groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowning out the starlet, Chie smiled to her now second-best friend. \"Five minutes? No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie made herself more limber, Naoto handed off her stopwatch. According to Naoto, she needed to ensure Chie took and maintained the proper pose, which would prove too much of a distraction. However, it seemed ludicrous to give the watch to Rise. Even if this wasn't very risque, it was likely Rise would pull something to make matters worse for Chie. Or it could be so boring for her that Rise may even call time sooner. For an undisclosed reason, Naoto was certain Rise wouldn't fast count, and they'd only go a second or two over five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were both set, two pairs of arms were guided up until parallel to the floor, each supported by one of Naoto's hands. Chie's arms were quickly straight and in position, and Naoto's intention seemed to be clear. Suspending her arms required significant strength, and that's with the light support by Naoto's hands. Five minutes was definitely going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to prolong this, Chie hastily declared, \"Okay okay I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in position. Even the apathetic Rise had her finger hovering over the button, eager to get this tedium underway. Naoto, however, didn't call for the start of the challenge. Not right away. First was the final preparation. The means to ensure Rise wouldn't try to hurry this along. The means to make Rise reverse her judgment of \"lame.\" The means of wondering if Rise would stop at five minutes without Chie's surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as lightning, Naoto reached forward and dropped to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" she called while rising and pulling out her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened so fast Chie didn't even have a chance to flinch. And she wasn't about to fix her skirt and start the challenge over again. Naoto would do it again. The laughter from her friends, however, was unnecessary. And she can't believe Naoto would snap a photo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice briefs, Chie-senpai!\" Rise teased. \"White's a good color on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I blame Naoto-kun,\" Yukiko said between laughs. \"You did make her do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto added, \"I once read the act of taking responsibility described as 'taking the pain onto yourself.' There's no more appropriate solution, wouldn't you agree Chie-senpai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't have your arms raised like Chie-chan does,\" Nanako said. \"You had your hands in front of you, and your shirt didn't come up above your panties. And she never took a photo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but the character in question stated that the appropriate replacement for ruined silver tableware was gold tableware. It stands to reason these allowances fall within this scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie tried to ignore it all. The skirt around her ankles. Her raised shirt. The chill on her legs. And the remarks from her friends. It didn't work. For all her praise and emulation of martial arts films, she hadn't quite mastered the mental lessons. The attempt to ignore their remarks only made her focus on them more. As the focus increased, so too did her blush. A faint hue to her cheeks was quickly redder than the sweetest apple, and washed over her body like the bath water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, fixing on her predicament allowed the searing pain in her arms go unnoticed. Naoto didn't have to correct her form even once. Chie made five minutes like it was nothing. If not for Yukiko calling time, she probably could have gone until her bones started to fracture audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it look?\" Rise asked, nodding to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto said, \"I didn't take a photo. My pain was only the threat of a photo. It wouldn't be fair to actually subject Chie-chan to a genuine photo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Chie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wanted to groan, but she stifled herself. The game wasn't over yet. She'd have her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko gathered up the four numbered chopsticks and shuffled them. While fanning them out, she looked to Chie and said, \"This time, remember to order everyone's clothes stay on unless they pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, green jacket, sailor tie, skirt, blouse, sports bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, sailor tie, red cardigan, skirt, tanktop, black nylons, lace bra, lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, stockings, sailor tie, school jacket, skirt, blouse, bra, thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naoto Shirogane</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Hat, slippers, socks, school coat, pants, button up shirt, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nanako Dojima</b> -<br>\r\nClothing: Slippers, socks, dress, sweater, panties</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naoto saw only one logical choice. It was time to swallow her pride and subject herself to a little humiliation. Her only salvation was a single thought: it can't be any worse than the other option. Silently, Naoto reached for her hat and tossed it towards the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a contingency imaginable to make Naoto disregard every thing she's learned about digital information and subject herself to something so potentially damning. Especially not after Rise's Shadow caused such a buzz. The truth is she didn't even need to inquire about that show for Inaba, the rumors circled to her first. Rise seemed to have recovered quickly, but most of that probably stemmed from both her disappearance from the public and the lack of online videos for evidence. Naoto's situation would not be so merciful. Losing an optional garment, showing weakness to her friends, and getting closer to revealing her measurements were trivial by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure why yet, but all of a sudden Naoto felt completely naked. It's just a hat, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the hat left Naoto's hand, Yukiko's jaw dropped. What she wanted to say became a whimper. She clutched for the hat. Anything to stop it. Anything to make it not count. Please. But it was no good. The hat touched the ground. Yukiko failed. And the game was officially much worse. All because no objected in time. How could Naoto of all people have missed it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrasting against Yukiko's terrified display was Rise's glowing smile. Naoto officially opened the door to their demise. Open discussions may have ceased, but there were still ample perverted looks across Inaba trained on the starlet. Each one was accompanied by the hum of Marukyu's music. Stardom may have had a variety of drawbacks, but any kind of incident as Risette could have forced her striptease to leave the stage, a plus she now severely missed. Without it, Rise saw only one option left to chase away her Shadow's work: make someone else the highlight. The confession from Shadow Naoto hadn't work any magic on her situation. She needed something bigger. She needed to bait the Queen just the right way to make it work, and Chie bit. Now was the time to make the girls the new legends. And hopefully end this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so counts, Yukiko-senpai!\" Rise called. \"She stripped, it's official!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't know!\" Yukiko protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Naoto-kun</i> didn't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if she did, it's supposed to be discussed first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when someone ends the turn like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would either of you care to enlighten the rest of us to this concern?\" Naoto asked, hoping to gain some idea of their discussion. What exactly did she \"not know\"? And why was it causing such a problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You removed your hat in response to Chie's order,\" Yukiko said. \"Rise-chan's trying to say that makes the order official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is this something that requires us to talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it was aimed at you, the order required you to remove your clothes. If that order is official, then the Queen from this point on can make us strip as part of our orders, without question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was practically certain the moment Chie gave the order. Even if it wasn't given to Naoto, the command was still about circumventing the clothing to get to the underwear. Although, she reasoned, I was the only one actually forced to move my clothing in such a contingency. The others would technically be photographing what could already be seen, even if they were trying to conceal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crimson blush filling her face, Yukiko continued. \"If the stripping is part of the game, then the penalties for refusal and withdrawing have to change. And usually the new ones deal with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko trailed off, but Naoto and Chie already got the message. They must have for their faces to go from sickly white to rosy red that quickly. If the order is official, getting out of an order would light a fire in their loins. And withdrawing from the game would force them to...they didn't even want to think about it! Both girls asked the same question: How could we have been this stupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now hold on,\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet and tried to take a commanding posture, but no one was falling for it. Not with her face still changing shades. Even she was doubting her ability to regain control of this situation, and her eloquence has frequently saved her from using any sort of physical force. But she pressed on. It was her only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"The stripping alone does not make it official. In sporting events, the officials and coaches can frequently protest a play or adjust the clock provided the game hasn't continued beyond the incident in question. We've yet to draw our new chopsticks, so the time for debate is still open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a sporting event,\" Rise said, crossing her arms under her breasts. \"In The King's Game, the order is official the moment the it's completed. Once completed, it can't be taken back, and that's especially true for this order. Or do you know a way to unring a bell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the still room, a fierce battle waged within Naoto. There had to be a way out of this. There had to be someway to withdraw her declaration to forfeit. Anything that would let her keep her secret. Maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large grown was coupled with a kick to the table. Naoto couldn't find one chink in Rise's armor. How could she? Rise used her time dancing to carefully word her argument, and drew from her knowledge of the game to figure out how to deal with possible counters. Naoto was playing on the fly in a game she didn't fully understand yet. Eloquence alone wouldn't help her here. She'd need Yukiko's help, but their hostess seemed to be relying on Naoto's eloquence to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Chie said, hoping to end the awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we move on,\" Rise said, presenting the chopsticks for another draw. \"This time with the new rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping wouldn't save them anymore. Orders could have the clothes come off, but no more than flashing or doing a mundane activity in such a state. Any worse was reserved for forfeits, while the most humiliating was reserved for a drop out. Or maybe there was no distinction. Whatever the case, the situation's changed completely. Between orders and forfeits, the least embarrassing choice is an order. For now. Maybe. Even so, in such a case, the choice isn't whether to do the order or pass it. The choice is whether or not to participate in the next round.</span></div></div>",

How about Blackjack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been mathematically defeated since the 1950's,\" Naoto-kun reminded them. \"Certainly I'm not the sole party-goer who knows basic strategy or the deviations to it in accordance with the count. Perhaps team charades?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked at her junior, flashing a look that made the genius look feel like replacing her hat with a white conical cap. \"With Rise-chan here? That's like asking for a fight with Kanji-kun. Besides, there's five of us here, one team would be short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's gotta be something we're all equally good at and wouldn't need teams,\" Chie stated, knowing that such a game must exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence spread over the room as the five girls racked their brains, hoping to find something that matched Chie's description. Unfortunately, the problems continued, only this time as an internal debate, with the only external sounds being a group sigh. It took Naoto's analytical mind to break this stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we're approaching this in the wrong manner. It would suffice to find something at which we're equally poor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Nanako exclaimed, much to the chagrin of her friends. She had to admit, an idea popping into her head immediately after Naoto's suggestion already told them Nanako's feelings. Then again, once she revealed her idea, they were bound to agree with her. After all, Yukiko had shared similar opinions last time they tried this. That didn't alleviate her fears, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began, \"I-I don't know about Naoto-kun, but the rest of us are about the same at cooking dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree faces quickly fell, and Naoto's was not one of them. Besides the statement's truth, all three of them flashed back to their cooking contest: three inedible omelettes while the boys teased them with each bite. Each of them were fairly certain they've made some improvement since then, but they weren't prepared to subject Nanako to a taste test again. Additionally, someone did mention that Nanako only knew how to prepare breakfast, which could make dinner about equal, but her successful breakfasts gave them the idea Nanako had a slight advantage. Worst of all, this time there was Naoto. She's never made a meal for them. For all they knew, she was comparable to Souji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll acknowledge that I'm not much of a cook,\" Naoto replied, making her schoolmates less apprehensive. \"However, even as a contest, that's not much of a game, Nanako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't necessarily have to be a game,\" Rise interrupted. \"We could use it to decide who picks the game. Best chef picks any game, no one can object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like a fair contest, but how do we ensure there's no bias in the scoring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make a five-course meal: soup, appetizer, noodles, entree, and side dish. We'll each draw one of these courses out of your hat. For the one we draw, we don't cook it. Instead, we're a judge, and we decide what the chefs make before anyone starts cooking. We'll arrange the dishes randomly with a letter in front of them in this room while the judge waits in the room across the hall. When we're done, we get the judge to score them while we wait in that room for her to get us. And the judge scores them in secret on a piece of paper until every course is scored. That way no one has any clue about everyone's standing until it's all over, and we have Nanako-chan read off the results. And let's keep it simple: every dish either passses or fails, the winner is whoever makes the most passable meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not really a five-course meal,\" Yukiko stated. \"It's a four-course with the fourth course divided in two. A five-course meal usually involves dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a dessert to this meal,\" Rise continued. \"In the event of a tie, the leaders make a dessert for the rest to judge, and the best dessert is the only one that passes. Unless there's three leaders, it'd be impossible to have another tie, and even then it's unlikely. The only problem would be a five-way tie, and we could make Nanako-chan the judge; we know she'll be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would be fair,\" Naoto concludes. \"Although, in the event the leader wants to play something physical, I propose we partake in a movie and digest before we jump into any additional games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Inn's kitchen can even be divided into four smaller kitchens, so I could close them to keep us from peeking and sabotaging. Throw in Naoto-kun's idea and I think we're golden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds all right,\" Chie adds, \"but there doesn't seem like much of a sense of urgency. What's a contest without that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know how we could fix that,\" Rise says grinning. \"To keep us on our toes and bring our best cooking skills, how about we add in a forfeit. Every time we make a dish that fails, we strip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" the other girls exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Doesn't that create greater motive to lie?\" Naoto asked, a blush spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you want everyone clothed or bare,\" Rise answered. \"There's no way to target one person. Even if you think someone's up to something, you can't get revenge without hurting everyone else. Plus, last time I checked, you were a human lie detector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not sure,\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all agreed it would be a good way to decide the real game, and we need a motive to push us. What other method is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other girls are mulling over this over, Rise's strip game got an approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it!\" Nanako jumped up. The idea of showing her body around the other girls wasn't appetizing, but this feeling was overruled by her own desire to play a game like this. None of my friends ever proposed a strip game, so this has to be an adult game, she reasoned. Nanako was overjoyed to be playing something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls had to admit it: this was going to be a strip contest. Rise was adamant during the school trip to play The King's Game, and she's practically an adult. Nanako's feelings to play something like this could only be stronger. Even the eloquent Naoto was fully aware that any sense of reason would be countered by an unintentional guilt trip. Instead, she tried something that just might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we make this fair for Nanako?\" Naoto asked. \"Based upon how she's dressed, it couldn't be a very fair contest with some stipulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters, we could take our slippers off and let her keep hers. Each slipper matches for our jackets and accessories. After that...I'm not sure. If we go with socks, it's not really a motive, so those are out. With no slippers and socks off limits, we'd be showing real skin. But the rest of us would still be covered while Nanako is either topless or bottomless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it doesn't work, after all!\" Chie commented, flashing a relieved smile before hiding it behind faux disappointment. \"Man, if only there was some way to keep it even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's condescending face returned, but aimed it at Chie this time. It was almost as if she completely forgot how the boys got them in swimsuits during the camp out, she thought. Even without this experience, Naoto was quick to join in the assault on Chie's unthinking remark. The contest wasn't officially closed, and for all they knew there was still a way to make it fair. Worst of all, there actually was a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could put on my night shirt,\" Nanako added. \"It's just a tanktop, it would fit under my sweater fine, and I'd show my arms like the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be perfect,\" Rise exclaimed. \"Okay, so we go without slippers and gamble our jackets, accessories, tops, and bottoms while Nanako gambles each slipper, her dress, and her sweater. If we need a tie-breaker, we'll let the winner decide what her competition takes off. I know Chie-senpai and Nanako-chan are in. How about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Naoto and Yukiko sighed simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the conversation that led the girls to their current position: around Nanako in a semi-circle awaiting the results. Even Nanako was noticeably flustered.

Her father had ordered enough to give her all the expertise necessary to judge and order side dishes, but it also happened to be her most successful project during Souji's cooking lesson. Losing this course gave her a bad case of the frights. Her only hope was that Chie and Rise were right, that the fear would make her cook her best meal in all of the other courses instead of bumble them into failures Souji would be applying to a fish hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First course,\" she began. \"<i>Miso Soup</i>, any kind, judged by Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of the game, both the simplicity and number of variants to <i>Miso Soup</i> led Rise to deduce at least one bowl would be edible. Each girl was bound to be familiar with one version of the practically legendary dish, so not restricting them to a single recipe was bound to help everyone. Unquestionably, her greatest hope was that this dish would convince everyone that she was playing fair, and to be fair with their dishes and judging. It'd be nice to have her honesty rewarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Nanako wasn't going in with much confidence either. The only recollection she had of cooking any <i>Miso Soup</i> involved a scallion, shiitaki mushrooms, firm tofu, and barley miso, all of which were diced and served in a broth of water. The only problem was how to prepare it; she wasn't worried about the amount, only the order of operations. She wasn't sure, but she followed her first thought.

Almost immediately she figured out she did something wrong. A strange, smokey smell came wafting from her pot, prompting her to quickly add the water and mix everything together. Unfortunately, her taste buds confirmed her fears: it was too little too late. Everything was obviously overcooked, but the water didn't look or taste like a broth. Only mercy from Rise would give her a passing meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowl A: Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the chefs for this round became significantly more relaxed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past few months had been an eye opening period for the members of the Inaba Investigation Team. Not only had they learned a great deal about themselves, the entire existence of another plane of existence within their televisions had been revealed to them. More importantly though was what they had learned about the female members of their group. Whether it was Rise's unconscious desire to dance and strip before large audiences, Yukiko's strong desire to find her perfect prince, Naoto's own sexual confusion, or Chie's oddly strong feelings towards her best friend, Souji and the rest of the guys had gotten a rather revealing look into the ''adult'' sides of their female friends personalities. Being the young, virile teens that they were, it was no surprise that when they heard that the girls were going on a weekend retreat that they immediately began planning on ways to crash the secluded event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around ten at night when the group of guys finally arrived at the backside of the Amagi Inn. A warm fall air permeated the small town with sticky dampness; a strong, rolling layer of fog was sure to form tomorrow. Luckily for the team no one had been spotted on the midnight channel, so there was little to worry about. Even better, the recent murders had cleared the late-night streets of all pedestrians, allowing the four boys to plan their strategy without fear of being spotted. Taking advantage of the situation, Yosuke spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, looks like we made it here without any trouble,\" the brown hair boy said. \"In that case, I officially call the first meeting of the female investigation team to order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!\" the often-excitable Teddie said, \"I can't wait to finally score!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT? We're going to d-do stuff with em?\" Kanji said, unable to hide his terror. Though he liked women, he held a deep seated fear of most things sexual. It had been nearly impossible for the guys to convince him to come with, but the last minute promise of a \"looking, no touching\" policy had been enough to assuage his worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Kanji, Ted's just being an idiot,\" Yosuke said, \"The plan's the same as it was before. We go in, we hide, and we enjoy the view. That's it. No taking things, no interaction, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie replied with a disappointed grimace, but even he knew Yosuke was right. Getting caught was more likely to result in an ass-kicking than any sort of scoring. Not to mention the awkward atmosphere the next few investigation meetings would have if they were actually caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's begin. Souji, since your the leader of us all, you should probably choose where we enter, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji replied with one of his solemn, silent nods. The leader of the team rarely spoke, but his words often held enough meaning to inspire confidence in the rest. Tonight it seemed was no different. Souji turned and looked at the foreboding fortress of an Inn behind him. Of the countless windows lining the wall, only about five rooms seemed to have lights on, all on the ground floor. Even better, the heat had made leaving the windows open a necessity, giving the group a perfect opportunity to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no real info to go on, Souji picked the center window at seemingly random. After quickly popping his head in to check if it was empty, he slowly pulled himself through the ancient wooden frame. After one more brief surveillance of the surroundings , he ushered in the rest of the group, helping the other three get in without so much as a peep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Yosuke whispered, \"We made it in. Looks like we're in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright,\" Yosuke whispered, \"We made it in. Looks like we're in one of the common rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group recognized the room in an instant. The normal investigations team had met here during the rare occurrences when Yukiko was too busy to leave the inn. The place was a small, hidden spot; one that was usually empty due to its awkward position at the back end of the establishment. It contained the typical Amagi Inn furnishings: a pair of richly-decorated oak armoires, three soft loveseats embroidered with ancient Japanese art and small silver table laden with overseas fashion magazines. Other than the light being lit, the room looked virtually untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks empty in here, guys.\" Kanji said, breathing a deep sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Teddie whined, \"I was hoping we had crawled into Chie-chan's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down,\" Yosuke snapped. \"We just got in. Don't go messing it all up by overexciting yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. But what should we do now, Sensei?\" Teddie asked, turning towards Souji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji stood silently, glaring aimlessly ahead as he always did when faced with a decision. There were more than a few ways the group could tackle the situation, but as he thought about it, he came to realize that traveling as a pack of four was unfeasible. Only a small group, perhaps two at the largest, could even stand a chance. He explained his reasoning to his three cohorts. They agreed with his conclusion, surrendering to his greater wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Yosuke began, \"In that case, Souji and I will form the first group. Kanji, you and Ted can go on your own. Just don't anything stupid, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji gave a nervous nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Souji and I will take the east hallway. You two take the west one. We'll meet back here in half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the two groups turned and parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During a lull in the investigation to find the mysterious killer that has been plaguing Inaba, the ladies of the investigation team decide to have a night to themselves at the Amagi Inn. No boys allowed. Yukiko's parents are away, and the building is closed to the public temporarily, so the girls have the place to themselves. They decide to invite Souji's young cousin Nanako too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take on the role of one the girls attending the slumber party, or Souji Seta, as he leads the not so intrepid group of male investigation team members to the inn, so that they may finally see what their female colleges look like naked. As a girl, your goal will be to get through the party with your modesty intact while competing in the various games and other activities which try to rob you of your clothing. You will also try to make sure your fellow attendees don't end up as modest. Your goal is to be queen of the party, after all. As Souji and boys, your goal will be to see every girl naked without getting caught, and who knows...you might just get lucky too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Rules For Additions</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral don'ts- No death, torture, violent rape (a little shy unwillingness and eventual succumbing is okay), or yaoi (boy/boy). Also, though I know they're big here, please no shrinking, growing, or body swapping. This is simple stuff here. If you want to add characters, you need to email me, same goes if you want to create a real, non \"game over\" ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. General understanding of the source material- Please make sure you are somewhat familiar with these characters before posting. In addition to my character list, I would recommend doing some research, such as watching clips on YouTube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. This is a choose you own adventure story- Most of the interactive stories here have the reader in a god position. They choose what happens in the story next. Here the reader is more of a player in a game. The actions won't always have obvious consequences. So instead of saying \"this happens\" your character will make a choice based on what they know, and you write what happens. The reader/player is not supposed to know where this road will take them. So please keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Game overs- As this is a \"game\" of sorts, you can technically \"lose\" in that you get a game over or bad end based an certain choices. For instance, if you lose all your clothes as a girl. You might simply be embarrassed. Maybe they'll take pictures of you. Or they could make you masturbate, or possibly even have their way with you. That sort of thing. If you're playing as Souji, getting caught will result in a \"game over.\" The girls might chase you away, beat you up, or even humiliate you, something like making <i>you</i> strip and masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Plying as the girls- When playing as the girls remember that you can't lose your clothes all at once. Say the girls are playing a strip game, you can't make a choice that makes you simply lose everything and get a bad end. Think of the clothing like a life bar. Every time you \"lose\" a round or something, you take something off. As such, you have to keep track of that. I suggest putting your character's status at the beginning of every chapter like I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Playing as the boys- This is a little more simple. Basically you'll be making choices while sneaking around. Some choices will get you towards what you want, and others will get you caught. Obviously, there will be multiple ways to succeed, but the boys' story is less complex than the girls, at least in terms of mechanics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCast of Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Girls</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chie Satonaka-</b> Chie is a good humored, tomboyish high school junior. She is easygoing and gets along very well with both sexes. What she lacks in feminine qualities, she makes up for in spunk and a drive to help people. Chie is an avid fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, and practices kung fu regularly. Her favorite food is steak. Che is medium height with short brown hair and an athletic frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko Amagi-</b> The daughter of the managers of the town's famous Amagi Inn, Yukiko is something like royalty in Inaba. She is next in line to inherit the Inn. She is shy, intelligent and elegant, though she does let her lighter side show among friends. Yukiko is often easily amused by stupid jokes, and breaks into unstoppable giggling fits. Chie and Yukiko have been best friends since they were little and they are in the same grade. Yukiko is tall and graceful, with long dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rise Kujikawa-</b> Formerly Japan's top idol, Rise left her work in stardom after becoming frustrated with her life always being the center of attention and constantly being over sexualized by the media. She returned to her hometown of Inaba for an indefinite hiatus from show business. She is peppy, excitable and often flirtatious. She is a first year high schooler (in Japan, there are only three years). Rise has dark brown hair that she wears in two pigtails. She has the body of a starlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naoto Shirogane-</b> Naoto is the latest in a line of famous detectives. For a long time, she masqueraded as a boy, believing no one would take her seriously as a girl, and because of her own negative outlook on the subject, as all of her detective heroes were men. With the help of her friends, she is beginning to accept her feminine side. Naoto has short blue hair, and though she usually hides it under masculine clothes, a rather feminine frame. It is hinted at in the game that her assets may be the most prominent among all of the girls. Naoto is also a first year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nanako Dojima-</b> Often called Nana-Chan by the group, Nanako is Souji's cousin. She attends grade school, and the group as a whole tends to treat her like a little sister. Nanako lost her mom at a very young age, and due to her father's time-consuming job as a policeman, she has learned to be very independent and mature for her age. Despite this, she still likes to capture her childish side whenever she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Boys</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Souji Seta-</b> The protagonist. He is a transfer student from the big city, who's capabilities make him a natural leader. He is respected and liked by all of the members of the investigation team. His personality is a blank slate, and thus he is defined by the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yosuke Hanamura-</b> The perfect right-hand man. Yosuke is loyal, good natured and always quick with a joke. He has no problem not being the leader. In fact, he prefers it that way. He is sometimes very clumsy, but nevertheless he usually ends up no worse for wear...at least...not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kanji Tatsumi-</b> A tough guy hooligan who actually has the heart of a teddy bear. Kanji enjoys knitting, sewing, dance and other non-conventional male activities.Though he is often made fun of for this, and his sexual orientation is called into question, Kanji is 99% sure he actually like girls. He just also likes doing the things girls do. He has a crush on Naoto, as he feels her gender confusions mirror his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Teddie-</b> A mysterious being found while exploring another world. At first Teddie appeared to them as a giant stuffed bear, but later he shed his outer shell to show his new friends that he had grown himself a body just like theirs. Teddie has an immature and overly amorous personality. Though he never gets anywhere with the girls using his heavy-handed come-ons, they do find it endearing to a slight degree. He often sabotages the other guys' chances to make any progress with the girls, not that he makes any himself.</td>",
