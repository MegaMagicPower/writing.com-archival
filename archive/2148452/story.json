I was stuck between creating scenarios for readers to add to, or leave everything blank and let user creativity flow. In the end, i came up with a sort of compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow you are fie choices for the rest of the interactive. The first choice will direct you to stories pertaining to the Pokemon Anime, and will focus along the lines of Misty, May, Dawn and etcetera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second choice will direct you to stories pertaining about the Pokemon Core Games like Red &amp; Blue, Black &amp; White, and will focus around the female protagonists like Leaf or Hilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third choice will direct you to stories that revolve around the Pokemon spin off games like Colosseum, Ranger, or Conquest. Those stories will focus on the likes of the female characters like Summer from Guardian Signs or the Heroine form conquest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth choice will take you to chapters about the Pokemon Manga. I must confess, I don't have an extensive education of the Manga cannon, but I wanted to add this choice for the people who do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the fifth choice. This choice will direct you to stories solely based on the interests of the author.  Is the above options too constricting for you? Do you want a story based around a Nurse Joy, and officer Jenny, or a gym leader? Do you want to write something that\u2019s in the Pokemon Universe, but doesn't really fit with any of the cannon? This is the choice for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my Interactive. I hope you will come back for more  and add stories to this particular little niche.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere in Pallet Town, even though the night was already getting late into the evening, a young boy by the name of Ash Ketchum was still up and about in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy wore a cap that was red and white with an opened beak-like symbol. He donned a blue and white vest jacket with a black shirt and a pair of blue jeans. On his hand, Ash wore green finger less gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if right now, Ash was watching a Pokemon battle between two elite trainers. \u2018Now that I am ten, I can finally get my Pokemon License. I will journey to gain the wisdom of Pokemon Training, and I hereby declare to the Pokemon of the world, I will become A Pokemon Master!\u201d Ash thought in his head as he grabbed a clock that resembled a Voltorb and held it proudly in his hand as if he was holding a real Pokeball. That was until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh! Go to sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard that feminine balance, Ash lost his balance and his grip on his clock, accidentally tossing it towards the door. The door, however, was opened just in time for a pudgy hand to catch it mid air. The clock split open, showing the 12 numbers inside and a cuckoo pidgey. \u201cIt\u2019s eleven O\u2019clock and you should be asleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Delia Ketchum, the mother of the young Ash. Like most other women, Delia was an obese women. Her thick, fat, yet powerful arms were crossed over her bosom, making the impossibly large orbs that were already bigger than Delia\u2019s head appear even more bloated. The two mammaries rested on a yoga ball sized stomach that predicted several feet out from her frame. Her whole heavy body was supported by strong, yet pillowy pillars for legs, while her huge upper body weight was balanced out by two buttocks that smooshed both ends of the doorway she was standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh cringed as his mother entered his doorway. Males in society were often treated as weak toys. You couldn't tell underneath all of that blubber, but most women are incredibly strong, in some absurd medical condition where fat equated to muscle. Ash was more often than not berated and sat on by his mother, but he knew better than to get too uppity about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut tomorrow is the day that i begin my Pokemon Journey. I can\u2019t sleep\u201d Ash whined. One of the reasons he wanted to go on his journey so soon was that he wanted to get as far away from his home as possible. Being Delia Ketchum\u2019s son is a chore, to put it lightly. He couldn't wait until he could taste freedom and train with his Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia scowled and sighed. She stepped into her son\u2019s room, making the floorboards under the creak from the weight. She snatched the television remote from on top of Ash\u2019s bed and changed the channel on the television. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, you should at least get ready for tomorrow. Here, watch Professor Oak\u2019s lecture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe channel on the television monitor from the match that Ash was watching to the Pallet Town's Pokemon Laboratory with Professor Samuel Oak standing in front of the camera and a board behind him with pictures of Charmander, Bulbasaur and Squirtle. \"Good evening Pallet Town!\u201d He started. \u201dTomorrow's the big day for the newest class of Pok\u00e9mon students. I'd like to introduce you to Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.\" He pointed to the three pictures of the Pok\u00e9mon he just said and he continued. \"Each one is available for new trainees. Which one shall you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, when this is over this I want you to go to bed, understand?,\" Ash's mother reminded as she headed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, still engrossed with the show, grumbled. \"Alright. I'm going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother left the room with another sigh and continued. \"Make sure you change into your pajamas too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to do that,\" Ash replied as his door closed. An hour later, Ash was already on his bed, fast asleep, dreaming of the Pok\u00e9mon he would get the next day. \"Raising Bulbasaur...might be rather simple. It's perfect...for beginners,\" Ash muttered. \"Then there's Squirtle...\" At that moment, his Voltorb clock fell onto his hand. \"Choose it or lose it...hold on, Charmander...those in the 'no' say that's the best way to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning soon came as a Dodrio stood on the top of a house's rooftop and screeched (like a rooster).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose you, Charmander!\" Ash cried out unconsciously as he tossed his clock at the wall, while he's asleep no less. As soon as the clock crashed and broke, Ash instantly jerked up and gasped as sweat poured down his face. Then, he looked towards the window and his eyes widened. \"Oh no! What time is it?!\" The young soon-to-be Pok\u00e9mon Trainer scrambled out of his bed and fell onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no, no! I'm LATE!\" Ash shrieked as he got to his feet and rushed out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran down the stairs, jumping the last few steps to save time, before putting on his shoes and dashing out of the house. \"Oh...I hope there's still a Pok\u00e9mon left for me...Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander. Any of those will be fine, just save one for me, professor!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cA-Are you sure there are no other Pokemon?\" Ash asked Professor Oak looking down at the short, chubby rodent Pok\u00e9mon covered in yellow fur. Professor Oak nervously rubbed the back of his head as a bead of sweat made its way down his forehead. Ash made it a whole hour late to the Laboratory in his pajamas, and all the other Pokemon had been taken by the early birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu sitting down on the table in front of the two humans chirped curiously as it tilted it's had slightly to the left. It's plump red electric pouches sparkled with electricity as it eyed the ten year old Ash; was this supposed to be it's trainer? He looks like he's ready to go to bed, not care of the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ash, I would have given you a regular starter, if you hadn't overslept through the whole ceremony. You really should be grateful you are getting a Pokemon at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know!\" Ash almost shouted in defense. \"It's just...it doesn't look like it likes me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piiiiii...\" Pikachu growled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ash, you are a total stranger to it. You can't expect to be friends with every Pokemon you come across. It just needs time to get used to you.\" Professor Oak said sagely. Ash grimaced but reluctantly nodded. It was going to be tough, but he mentally promised himself that he and the Pikachu will be friends. He held the Pikachu's Pokeball in one hand while the other cautiously tried to pet the yellow rodent's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikaaaa!\" Pikachu growled as the human's hands gently stoked the top of his head. Soon, however, the growls died out were replaced with muted chirps of pleasure as Ash scratched his sweet spot near the base of his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? There's hope for you two yet!\" Professor Oak praised, not believing that he was able to calm down the Pikachu with simple petting. He was expecting the grumpy Pokemon to electrocute the young boy, and he even had a whole bad pun ready for it. \"Oh, before you leave, there are two things you need. First, your Pokedex.\" Professor Oak grabbed a red device out of his coat pocket and gave it to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, some advice. This Pikachu absolute detests going into its Pokeball, so you are going to have to find a way to carry him outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that doesn't sound too bad...\" Ash stopped petting Pikachu and put it's pokeball in his pajama pocket for later. He held out both hands in front of his abdomen, gently motioning to the Pokemon to hop in. Pikachu puffed his chest and looked away, but eventually was won over by Ash's pleading face. The slightly less moody Pokemon hopped into Ash's arms...and gave him a tiny shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youch!\" Ash winced in pain. \"What was that for?\" He looked down to the yellow rodent, who only offered a smug grin, satisfied with the expression in his new trainer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocking, is it not?\" Professor Oak chuckled at his own bad pun, happy that he was able to use his joke after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all hell broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASH!\" The three heard a shrill, deafening voice boom from the outside of the Pokemon Laboratory. Then, the front door to Professor Oak's home slash workplace busted out of its hinges as Delia Ketchum's fat body stormed into the foyer. Ash cringed as he shuffled nervously behind the Pokemon Professor, who also was visible afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell are you, ya little worthless shit?!\" Delia screeched as her fat body wobbled up and down and left to right, running into the main laboratory where Oak and Ash was. Pikachu growled angrily as he heard the upset women enter the room. He would have jumped out and attacked the women if it wasn't for Oak blocking the way,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA-aah! Delia, what a pleasant surprise!\" Professor Oak nervously meeped. \"A-are you here to see your son go off on his Pokemon Journey?\". The Pokemon Professor asked, hopeful that she would leave as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fucking fag isn't going anywhere!\" Delia screeched at the poor soul. \"He forgot to make me breakfast and left me all alone, waiting for my food!\" Ash deadpanned as he realized that he was in such a rush to get his Pokemon, that he forgot to make breakfast for himself, and more importantly, his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia pushed the professor aside and was about to grab his son by his hair all the way back to the house, when she eyed the yellow Pokemon sitting in his arms. \"Well...\" Delia smirked. \"It look like you got your Pokemon Ash~. Well, since you went out of your way to get me such a rare Pokemon, I'll let this slide just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even offer a peep of protest, Pikachu was snatched out of Ash's arms and held him up above her head.\" I don't think I ever had a Pokemon like you before! Well, it won't matter anyway, soon all you will be is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia was cut off in the middle off her sentence as Pikachu let out a powerful electric attack against her. Her whole body was covered in a plume of yellow energy, flashed from black to white as her skeleton shined through her charred flesh. At the end of the ordeal, Delia was left covered in burn marks, slowly collapsing to her feet from exhaustion. Not before Pikachu hopped out of her grip and into Ash's arms once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Professor Oak were in awe of what just happened. Usually, electric attacks were powerless against human females, because their fat was too thick for them to hurt. But Pikachu...this Pikachu was able to not only hurt Ash's abusive mother, but knock her out in one go. Pikachu merely licked his fur back in place from when the fat human gripped him so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Professor Oak offered to the situation. \"Why don't you two start your Pokemon Journey? Don't worry, I'll be fine! I'll find a way to deal with...this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh slowly walked around his still unconscious mother, twitching in her sleep, and walked out of the busted doorway of the Pokemon laboratory out to the beginning of his Pokemon Journey. It was certainly going to be interesting.</span></div></div>",

The yellow rodent he carried in his hands, Ash not even attempting to put him in his Pokeball, had electrocuted his mother to the point of collapse, no small feet for someone as fat as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu merely licked his paw as his human trainer carried him against his chest. He was starting to warm up to his apparent master. Granted, they were nowhere near friends, but Pikachu realized that he might have seized the kid up too quickly. At this point, most trainers would have tried to force him into his Pokeball, and he secretly sympathized with him for having to live with such a loud and vulgar women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh continued to hold Pikachu in his arms as they made it far past out Pallet Town. If he had known that a Pikachu this strong was with Oak this whole time, he would have slept in on purpose. It was a well known fact that women were stronger than most Pokemon, their fat and flesh absorbed all attacks and strengthened their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Pikachu knocked out one of the fattest women in Pallet Town with one attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt lucky to have Pikachu by his side, but he was disheartened that he still was abrasive towards him. Hopefully that would change soon. As they continued to trek along Route 1, they eventually made their way into its forested section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, this looks like a good enough place to rest.\u201d Ash notes as he examined a clearing near the path. Pikachu hopped down from Ash\u2019s arms and scratched his ear dismissively. Ash smiled and reached into his backpack to take out the lunch be prepared, only to realize he had made a grave mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his excitement to go on his Pok\u00e9mon journey, and in the confusion that transpired at the lab, Ash had forgot to pick up the free six Pokeballs provided to him. Ash gulped, coming to terms with the fact that he had no way to catch other Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChu\u2026\u201d Pikachu cried lowly, impatient for his lunch. Ash sighed and took out the food from his backpack: a thermos of stew and a bowl of Poke chow. However, the moment Ash had twisted the cap off to take a sip, the scent of cooked food alerted another being to their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Pikachu heard rustling in the bushes, and turned in it\u2019s direction to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No matter how far you go, no matter how much you distance yourself, they still have a hold over you for better or worse. Ash thought when he finally turned ten years of age and he would get his first Pokemon, he would be able to go on his Journey and be free of his mother\u2019s possessive abuse forever, leaving Pallet Town and never looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash was wrong because no one can ever really get away from family. And in his case, it was more literal than most. The well-aged foliage around his makeshift rest site was suddenly trampled down and parted as his mother, Delia, invaded it. Her body was now stark nude after his Pikachu had electrocuted the cloth to smoke, with some smudges of ash here and they're on her body. Her son was more or less accustomed to seeing her stark nude, but Pikachu uncomfortably averted his gaze as she revealed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Ashy~\u201d. Delia greeted her son with a smug smile, to which Ash dropped his jaw from shock. \u201cThat Pokemon of yours really packs a punch, huh? Well, it\u2019s no matter now. I hope you had fun playing trainer, because you\u2019re coming right back home with me, mister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN...N-no!\u201d Ash clenched his fists and started definitely at Delia with years pent up rage. Pikachu quickly made his way in front of his new master in an effort to protect him. \u201cI-I\u2019m not going back with you, because I have my own Pokemon now! I\u2019d rather die than spend another minute in that house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia blinked, a bit stunned. Ash had never stood up to her before, making for the perfect ragdoll and servant for her. At first, she was immensely angry that he had the fucking nerve to snap back at her, but then his words started to sink in. He would rather die than go back with her. The mother part of her took a blow to that statement, even if he was exaggerating it. She looked down at the scrawny Pikachu that managed to knock her out, and then back up at her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Alright, Ash.\u201d Delia sighed in defeat, eliciting a shocked gasp from Ash. \u201cYou want to go on a Pokemon Journey so bad...I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Ash questioned, not believing the words that were coming out of Delia\u2019s mouth. \u201cW-wow...thank you, mom, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Delia suddenly walked forward, closing in the distance between herself and her son. \u201cIf I can\u2019t stop you from going on a Pokemon Journey, then you can\u2019t stop me from tagging along~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what!?\u201d Ash exclaimed loudly as his eyes widened. \u201cNo no no, not a chance in-\u201d He stopped himself mid-sentence to back himself up a few steps and Delia kept walking forward with an evil smirk on her face, walking over Pikachu with ease. The yellow rodent starts to charge up his electricity in case of an attack, the sound of energy crackling in the air well present in his trainer\u2019s mother\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Delia just kept closing the distance, eventually pushing her son back into a tree as her naked, jiggly belly pressed up against his weak torso, only leaving him enough room to get some shallow breaths of air into his lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or coming home with me, sweetie-pie~\u201d. She cooed with icy venom, before suddenly pushing off his body to give him some air, only to slam back into him hard enough to skate the leaves off of the tree. \u201cWhat\u2019s your choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small puff of air from Ash\u2019s mouth is the only way Delia\u2019s son could protest such treatment. \u201cAlright, alright! You can come with me, just get off of me, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because you said the magic word.\u201d Delia purred before slowly getting off of her son. Ash stands back up on his feet slowly, stretching his shoulders back to rid the soreness that grew there. Inhaling and exhaling as his lungs returned to his normal state, he looked up to his mother Delia, casting an ominous shadow over him with her nude, fat body. He had grown relatively accustomed to the many crushing and squashings his mother dolled out, but it still left him in pain afterward. It was just routine, and to his dismay, it would STAY routine as she would accompany him on his journey throughout Kanto. Pikachu, having seen that his master was fine, went back to impatiently demanding some food for his hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPikachu!\u201d The yellow rodent Pokemon scowled and pointed to his belly for emphasis. Delia looked back at him, and then to Ash with a hungry look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I almost forgot. You didn't get to serve me breakfast earlier. How silly of you.\u201d Delia rubbed her bloated, wrecking ball of a gut. \u201cWell, I suppose you can make it up to me by making some for me now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fed Pikachu his well earned Poke-Chow, while Delia in her vast hunger devoured everything edible in her son's supplies. With no more food and her mother still hungry, Ash had to halt his Pokemon Journey to find more food for her in the forest. The woodland was actually quite crowded with wild Pokemon, but with no other Pokeballs, he had no way of catching any of them. Meanwhile, Delia helped herself to the apparent buffet the land provided for her by happily slurping down any stray creature that crept out from the tall grass. Ash grimaced as he watched her down a whole family of Ratata with ease and room for more, while Pikachu was just outright pissed. He was about to shock her into a comatose state once again, but Ash stopped him from doing so, knowing the full extent of his mother's anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all went on for a couple of hours more, until the trio came across a rather irate looking Spearow. \"Ooh!\" Delia drooled with a hungry gaze. \"That looks like the perfect little treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, don't you think you've had enough?\" Ash nervously asked, looking down at Delia's full stomach, even more, bloated than before. It squirmed and wiggled as the various Pokemon inside kicked and clawed, trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ash.\" Delia turned to her son, face turning serious. \"Don't EVER try to limit how much food I can have.\" She gave her son a scolding kick to the face for good measure, making him fall to the ground with a heavy thud. Satisfied, she turned around and proceeded to devour the lone bird Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry looking bird gave up a good fight, but it was no match to Delia's strength. But before it was doomed to her stomach, it let out a cry for help. \"Spearow! Spearow!\" It yelped as Delia slurped the last bit of it down her throat. Delia strode over to a downed log, before pausing and looking back at her son that rested on the ground, taking in the sight of Ash nursing a broken nose with an approving gaze. It served him right for trying to keep her from eating, and seeing him in pain that she caused warmed her soul and made her heart swell with love. She'll never let her son go, no matter how much he wanted to get away from her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled himself over onto his back; a seemingly simple process, yet he was giving soft grunts and growls with the effort of shifting his bulk, still sore from the squashing earlier in the day, breathing deeply by the time he\u2019d managed to get himself propped up with his back against a tree's stump. Delia nodded and sat her fat ass down on the dead log, creaking under her weight as she rested her arms on the upper shelf of a rotund, exaggerated, and still squirming stomach. Even after she\u2019d managed to get herself settled, the mother's figure remained in motion, the momentum traveling in sluggish ripples from the doughy rolls of her sides, up along her well-padded neck, and back down past her broad thighs and into the folded flab of her lazily-swaying buttocks. The spectacle of such gloriously-overfed women would certainly have been shocking to most trainers, thankfully there were none in sight save for Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ash. Just because I'm resting doesn't mean that you get to. Now-...huh?\" Delia looked up as she heard the telltale sound of Spearow crying, only more distorted and far away. She looked up in horror as a flock of those angry birds circled above her, swooping down for the kill. \"...oh no.\"</span></div></div>",

She was used to being the biggest girl in Pallet Town, but now she felt like a big fish coming out from a very small pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive bluenette giggled and grabbed her little brother by the sides with ease, giving Morgan a hug that threatened to envelop his whole body in her fatty breasts. He squirmed a little bit but reciprocated the hug as much as he could. \u201cThanks for looking after my lil\u2019 bro you two.\u201d Lucina addressed the mother-son duo. \u201cAn Officer Jenny gave me some trouble, and I was worried something bad might have happened to him while I was away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no trouble ma\u2019am!\u201d Ash grinned and adjusted his cap, to which Delia scaled and slapped him on the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was!

She could go back to how she was before, and he would be the one to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Delia\u2019s pot belly stomach gave out the loudest growl of hunger Ash had ever heard, to which she just playfully smacked it. \u201cMm\u2026 I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d she mused, still kneading and rubbing her tummy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel like I could eat a Wailord!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...h-hey mom? Why don\u2019t we head into the city and get some food at the Pok\u00e9mon Center?\u201d Ash offered, suddenly regretting he said so since her newly bought clothes were now nothing but shreds. But by then it was too late, and Delia nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Idea, Ash! I didn\u2019t know we were so close to the next city, but I won\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.\u201d Delia stood up, now twice her son\u2019s height.

Just look at how big I\u2019ve gotten!\u201d She wobbled her assets happily, making Ash blush against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where is that...oh, there's the Pokemon Center!\u201d Delia pointed out to a red-roofed building on the other side of the street. After a brief trek, Delia set her son and Pikachu down and entered the main atrium of the building, instantly making her way towards the cafeteria for trainers. \u201cPick up the pace, young man! There won\u2019t be enough food left for you if you don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did those pills do to her?

Inside the cafeteria, he instantly made out the massive bluenette and her younger brother, Lucina, and Morgan. \u201cHey, you two!\u201d Ash made his way to the brother-sister duo as Delia lined up in the buffet line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!\u201d Lucina waved as Ash rushed over. \u201cSo, how do you like your new mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?

But he needed answers, t was all just too much for him right now. \u201cHow did you do that, what are in those pills?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina just giggled at Ash\u2019s constant barrage of questions and fished out the pills from her bosom. \u201cI won\u2019t reveal my sources, but these little miracles turned me from a cruel sadist to the flower child you see before you. It works a little different on whoever uses it, but it looks like your mom's transformation was right what I was going for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...Is she going to be okay?\" Ash questioned. \"I know she's not the nicest person, but she's still my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, she'll be...uh...wow, that's a lot of food.\" Lucina gapped as she saw Delia with a tray underneath a veritable mountain of food making her way towards her son. \"I think those pills must have messed with her hunger. Well...don't worry, she's totally harmless now, probably anyways.\u201d She chuckled, but her heart wasn\u2019t into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, I see you\u2019ve made some new friends!\u201d Delia exclaimed with a hungry grin as she sat her mountain of foodstuffs on the table. \u201cHello there!

He was a good kid, and he was interested in what he had to say, but he found himself...entranced by his 'new' mother. When she had first gotten into the Pokemon Center Cafeteria, she was a foot taller than her new friend Lucina, but noticeably thinner, with all of her weight seeming to have transformed into height when she took those pills. But while he had no idea how the miracle medication actually worked, he began to notice that it had a clear effect on his mom's metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia was still stark nude from when she tore through her clothes earlier, so Ash had a clear view of her mother's body slowly but surely bloat outwards with plush flab. She was only halfway through her veritable mountain of food she had made for herself, but he looked like she was also halfway back to her original body shape; large, blubbery, and jiggling all over. She caught her son looking at her, and gave him a girlish giggle and a cute wink, cupping one of her boobs cheerfully. Normally this would have disgusted Ash, but he felt like his relationship with his mother was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she was a cruel and wicked mistress that delighted in seeing him suffer, but now he felt like she was an actual mother; loving, caring and understanding. How would it change next? Had everything about who she was before lost? Only two minutes later, Delia had finished her feast, and she was back to her old, fatty self, perhaps even bigger! Her gut pushed up onto the table and folded in two, and Ash couldn't help himself from wanting to rub it. \"Mmmmm...that was good...\" Delia purred as she rubbed her stuffed gut. \"Not as good as Pokemon, but still good enough, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement took everyone at the table by surprise. \"O-oh...\" Lucina paused with caution. \"You eat Pokemon, still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course, I do young lady?\" Delia tilted her head to the side a little, curious why she would be confused by this. \"A women can't get this big by just eating normal food, can she? Ask Ash, he's the one who fed them to me!\" Lucina looked as Ash, who was just as shocked as her and quietly mouthed 'no' to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a good boy, always willing to devote his entire life to me~\" Delia swooned as she suddenly grabbed Ash by the shoulder and scooched him to her seat. \"He practically begged me to come on his Pokemon Journey with him, and helped me develop a taste for red meat too! He's my pride and joy!\" Delia planted a kiss on Ash's forehead, inadvertently smooshing his face to her naked breast flesh.</span></div></div>",

The person who she was before she had taken the mysterious medication, had awoken to the sight of her sibling being dominated by Delia. A flood of memories began to surface back to her mind, memories of the bluenette bullying him, teasing him, squashing him within an inch of his life for the tiniest infractions\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happy memories they were! Lucina began to sigh wistfully as she remembered her old self. A smile crept to her face as Morgan struggled to breathe under the monumental torrent of Delia\u2019s boob flesh. These thoughts were interrupted, however, by a sudden pang of hunger and a deep growl from her gut. Blushing, she rubbed it gently. She had already finished her normal helping of food, so was she still hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLu-Lucina?\u201d Morgan pleaded quietly as Delia continued her assault of dominating affection. \u201cCould I get a li-little help over here?\u201d Lucina looked into her younger brother\u2019s eyes and gave him a big wide smile. But it wasn't the smile he was used to, the one that carried all of that sisterly affection. It was predatory and passionate, and Morgan immediately began to feel a sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Delia?\u201d Lucina rose from her seat at the booth and, to Ash and Morgan\u2019s surprise, but no one else in the cafeteria since the practice was common, began to strip down her pants. \u201cCould you put Morgan back down on my seat? I wanna show him how much I love \u2018em.\u201d Delia was confused by the request for a moment, but then understood exactly what she meant. She nodded approvingly and pushed Morgan back to his side of the table with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucina, what are you-\u201d Morgan\u2019s sentence was cut off as Lucina sat back down to her seat directly on top of him, directing his head into her passage forcefully. Ash looked on in horror, while Delia just smiled. She had completely changed from how she was a few moments ago! He wanted to look away, but it the sight was akin to a car crash; there was something about the devastation that was so entrancing that it needs your full attention. The bluenette moaned as she felt her younger brother struggle against his sudden confines, making her whole body jiggle and quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was over just as fast as it had come, and Lucina was sitting where Morgan once was, panting as she rubbed her now bulging, bouncing stomach. Ash wanted to say something, he really did, but his mouth was too dry to force the words out. Pikachu was just as stupefied and cautiously hid underneath the table for good measure. \u201cSorry if you wanted to have him, Delia.\u201d She shook her new belly, testing the feel. \u201cJust seeing him all defenseless like that...it really worked up an appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, my dear, I know all too well!\u201d Delia giggled and, once again, forcefully pulled in ash for another crushing hug. \u201cThe only reason I keep Ash around is that he catches me food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay...what do you say to have a traveling buddy?\u201d Lucina piped up, noting how similar Ash looks to her brother. \u201cI could use another boy toy since mine is a bit occupied at the moment, and even though just met\u2026 really like you, and I think it would be great if we could travel together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia, for a moment, was stunned by the offer, and then rose from her seat to pull the younger girl into a hug. \u201cOh, of course, Lucina! We\u2019ll have loads of fun, and Ash will be right there to help us get even bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt like his life has spun out of control. This morning had such a clear purpose, and now he felt like his life had only gotten worse. Not only was he stuck with his mom, even if she is a 'bit' nicer, but he also had to deal with this Lucina. How would he get through this? And why...why did he feel excited about it at the same time? He did not understand it, but the thought of these two women getting even bigger and fatter was intriguing, and as much as he was disgusted by the means for that to happen, he still found himself wanting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucina\u2026\u201d Ash spoke up hesitantly. \u201cIs Morgan...going to be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I would never digest my lil\u2019 bro...I mean, I would eat him, but never digest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen now?</span></div></div>",

She turned her attention to the three Pokeballs in front of her. Treecko, Torchic, and Mudkip. May, however i, really did not know a single bit of information about Pokemon other than that they test amazing. So, she was going to have to rely on her little brother for help. \u201cHey, which one of this morsels-I mean lil\u2019 guys is the best?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I\u2019d pick Torchic.

Well, you\u2019re the expert I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay shrugged, picked up Torchic\u2019s Pokeballs, and lazily tossed the special device into the air. The ball erupted into a stream of light which reveals the chick Pokemon to the world. It looked up at May, it\u2019s new master, and was slightly intimidated by her large stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Alright, introductions. I\u2019m May, that\u2019s Max, and you are now my property.

Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Torchic shivered in fear and nodded up and down, eager to not get abused by this callous eighteen year old. Satisfied, May opened the Pokeball again, this time spewing a red light that put the Pokemon back inside. She pocketed the ball in her purse and turned around to face Max with a determined smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get out of this boring town and start our journey!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bigger and fatter women become the stronger they get and more abilities they acquire regarding eating. There were three milestones when it came to being fat. The first milestone would be the ability to eat people, which May believes would be useful in a life or death situation, or if she was just having a very bad day. The second was the ability to control her digestion, May dreamed of the day she\u2019d be able to keep Max safe and cozy in her belly. The third milestone was to be able to selectively control her digestion, which means she could eat two people and can digest only one if she so wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were packed up, leaving their bags and camping supplies on the floor in front of the door they ate breakfast.

Letting out a long sigh, May fished out her Torchic\u2019s Pokeball and threw it in the general direction of the opposing Pokemon. \u201cGo torchic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay, shouldn't we try to catch it?\u201d Max implored, struggling a little under the weight of his sister\u2019s food. \u201cWe can\u2019t win many battles with just one Pokemon. We need diversity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want that mangy mutt on my team!?\u201d May focused her attention to her younger brother after ordering her Torchic to attack with Ember. \u201cNo way! That thing probably has rabies or something. I want cool Pokemon, rare Pokemon! Not the ones that I have for as a snack when you\u2019re not around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTorchic use scratch!\u201d May ordered her Pokemon to conveniently draw attention away from her last statement. The Poochyena fell down, knocked unconscious by May\u2019s Torchic. The Pokedex in her purse made a didning noise, saying that it had leveled up to LV. 8. With a confident smile, she took out it\u2019s pokeball to return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay, stop!\u201d Max pleaded. \u201cLook at it, it\u2019s hurt! It needs to heal or it might pass out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked at the small Pokemon in front of her. The little thing was definitely looking worse than it did this morning when she got it. But it could stand a few more hits, right? Begrudgingly, May took out her only potion and shoved it into Max\u2019s arms. \u201cHere, I don\u2019t know how to use it. And I don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax gave out a sigh, this was going to be a long journey...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She brought out her last Pokeball, as everything else in her purse was just a bunch of snacks, and threw it to the injured psych Pokemon. The Ralts was soon ceased in the shiny sphere. It shook for a few seconds, before it made a cheerful ding, signalling that it had been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up the ball off the ground, she proceeded to hand it over to Max. \u201cHere ya\u2019 go Munchkin! It\u2019s not as good as mine, that\u2019s for sure, but...I wouldn't have gotten it without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was silent for a moment, a little shocked that May would do something so nice for him. Eventually the younger brother smiled and graciously took the Pokeball. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone you ain\u2019t ten yet. We don\u2019t need the cops on our ass all the time.\u201d May added sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, May\u2019s chubby stomach gave out a loud gurgle, which made its owner wince a little in pain. \u201cGeez, battling Pokemon works up an appetite, huh? Alright Max, gimme my food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-a-are you sure? We just ate an hour ago, and the next town is only ten minutes away\u2026\u201d Max reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point stupid! It\u2019s been an hour since I last ate. A whole figging\u2019 hour! I\u2019m surprised I ain't\u2019 hungrier! I can\u2019t wait ten minutes to eat at the Pokemon Center, I\u2019ll starve!\u201d May counterred his brother\u2019s logic impatiently. \u201cNow hurry up, your big sister needs you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed and slugged off one of the food packs. May eagerly tore into the satchel and began to devour as much as she could. Max always kinda liked watching his sister eat. He liked seeing her big gut steadily get bigger with food, and how the next day she would look a little fatter all over. May noticed her brother\u2019s states, and teasingly smacked her belly making it jiggle like jello. Max blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, May had demolished at least half of the food in the bag. She handed it back to Max for him to carry. It was still heavy, but he appreciated the weight lifted off his shoulders a little. \u201cThat was a nice snack. A little light, but I think I\u2019ll manage until the Pokemon Center.\u201d May patted her gut, filled with food to turn into more fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon. Max and May had finally exited Route 101 and made it to Oldale Town. The small hamlet was beautiful, the flowering bunches of flowers contrasting nicely with the lush groves of trees. While Max was entranced by the villages beauty, May was looking at the place more practically. The town was a step up from Littleroot, but that was because that it had a Pokecenter and PokeMart. Other than that, they're was little to nothing of interest in Oldale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Max, stop lollygagging! We\u2019re going to the PokeCenter to heal up my Pokemon and get some more food.\u201d May grabbed her sitarcted brother\u2019s arm and took tugged it in the direction of the red building. Max was disappointed, but he realized he was being selfish when May reminded him that his Ralts was hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the Pokemon Center, the duo was greeted by a cheerful Nurse Joy. \u201cWelcome to the PokeCenter! How can I help-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay interrupted her by slamming her two Pokeballs on the counter, while Max carefully set his own Pokeball down as well. \u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s make this quick. My Pokemon need healing and I\u2019m hungry. Where\u2019s the cafeteria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Nurse Joy was taken aback by the abruptness of May\u2019s behaviour, but still put up a polite smile. \u201cWell, if you need a pick me up from your long journey, we offer free food in the Enrichment Center down below! If you\u2019ll just follow the-\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up, did you say that the food was free!?\u201d May widened her eyes in shock, believing she was going to be limited by how much money she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes! Al services for Pokemon Trainers are free of charge!\u201d Nurse Joy added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was silent for a moment before erupting into a fit of giggles. Before Nurse Joy could ask if hse was alright, she made a Beeline to the stairwell that lead to the Enrichment Center down below. Max shook his head and sighed. \u201cYou shouldn't have told her that. My sister has the stomach of a black hole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d Nurse Joy\u2019s smile faltered for a moment. The next shipment of food from Petalburg won\u2019t be for another week, and she needed to make due with what she had. \u2018Well, I-i'm sure she\u2019ll stop sometime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET OUT!\u201d Nurse Jouy angrilly pushed May out of the Pokemon Center. \u201cAnd take your Pokemon with you!\u201d She threw her Pokeballs at the stuffed girl\u2019s face. The sliding door of the Pokemon Center closed and beeped as a red light signalled that it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really have to eat everything that they had?\u201d Max asked his big sister with a deadpan tone. May\u2019s stomach was now sated, after stuffing it with enough food to feed a normal family of five. It bulged out heavily from her now ruined red vest, the sphere of flesh spilling over her waist heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I was hungry!\u201d May defended herself. \u201cAnyways, we're done here. C\u2019mon, let's head out!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the fact that May was rather disrespectful and...well\u2026.fat she was a surprisingly hard worker when it came to her chores and took hygiene rather seriously so she had a lot of money from her allowance. Max also grabbed a free guide and map of Hoenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way Max decided to let his Ralts out of its pokeball. \u201cMay already has a Ralts and it would be confusing if both of you went by Ralts. Maybe I can give you a nickname?\u201d Max said to himself quietly as his sister trudged ahead. A couple of minutes later Max thought of a name \u201cI\u2019ll call you Forrest.\u201d Max whispered, he then heard rustling noise behind him. Max turned around and slowly walked toward the source of the noise. He fell on his rear when something jumped out of the grass. A small blue pokemon with a green lily pad on his head and six stubby legs. \u201cLotad\u201d The pokemon said cheerfully, Max smiling a bit and laughing. \u201cHey there little guy, I\u2019m Max.\u201d The young boy greeted with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was walking ahead, defeating anybody dumb enough to go against her and getting money from them. \u201cHey Max, I\u2019m getting hung-\u201d May turned around and saw her brother was gone, \u201cCrap, I knew something was wrong when I didn\u2019t hear him. I swear if anybody hurts him they are in for a world of pain.\u201d May said before dashing off in the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was panting somewhat taking a break from finding Max, she perked up when she heard his giggling and dashed off to the direction of it. She was shocked to find Max and his Ralts playing with some random pokemon. \u201cMax what are you doing!?\u201d May yelled putting her hands on her wide hips. \u201cS-s-sorry May, I got distracted.\u201d Max apologized to the large girl. May pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I should of done a better job at keeping track of you. However that pokemon right there better be rare.\u201d May said pointing at the Lotad. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a Lotad, it\u2019s not necessarily rare but it\u2019s a lot less common than a Zigzagoon or Poochyena. Please can I have it? Besides it\u2019ll be very useful for the first gym.\u201d Max begged with puppy dog eyes. May sighed \u201cOkay, okay but the next pokemon that ends up distracting you better be super rare or I\u2019ll get ticked off.\u201d May said before digging through her bag and tossing the Pokeball at the Lotad. \u201cThere ya go Munchkin.\u201d May said waiting for Max to pick up the ball before picking him up and running as fast as she could to make up for lost time. \u2018I think I\u2019ll call you Dish.\u201d Max thought to himself with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole town\u2019s air was heavily laden with salt with the ocean being so close by. The name of it all was incredibly misleading: there were no petals in that burg because the maritime climate forbade it, and it could hardly be big enough to be called a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Max and May did not dwell on these factual thoughts for long, For there was something even more pressing at hand for their attention to be on. Petalburg City was the home to their first Pok\u00e9mon Gym, operated by the normal type specialist Norman Norman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and May\u2019s Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Norman family emigrated to Hoenn a decade ago, before Max was born and when May was only eight years old. Norman had been offered a Job as Gym Leader, and he couldn\u2019t refuse, no matter how much his wife protested. The move put so much strain on their marriage that they divorced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay has a mixed relationship with her father. She had picked up all of his bad habits, swearing, slovenly behavior, laziness. And she does love him and always liked it when she got to visit him. But she also resents him for putting their happy lives on the line just for some stupid job. For Max, it\u2019s even worse. Norman is like this kind of nice, kind of rude stranger in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, he would have preferred to just skip the whole ordeal of challenging him and just move on to the Pokemon Center, But May was already dragging him to the place. The two did not have to look very hard to find the man, as he was kicking out a defeated trainer out from his gym. \u201cDamn brat, wasting my time\u2026\u201d he muttered to himself. He took out a metal flask from the lining of his coat and took a swig of it, yellowish fluid trickling down his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill day drinking whiskey, Huh dad?\u201d Norman almost did a spit tank when he heard the incredibly familiar voice of his obese daughter. He turned around, still chugging the alcohol, to find May and Max staring at him. \u201cYou know, I tried drinking once. Tasted boring, plus, I think I\u2019m too fat to get drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay! Max!\u201d Norman tied the cap back onto his flask and quickly put it back into his coat pocket. He ran up and gave his daughter a hug, his form sinking into her flabby frame. \u201cWhat with the Surprise visit? I don\u2019t have custody in a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-were In our Pokemon J-journey\u2026\u201d Max stuttered, shifting behind her big sister as to distance himself from the normal type gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPok\u00e9mon Journey? That can\u2019t be right, you have to be ten to go out into the world, and you little man, are-...Wait\u2026\u201d Norman broke off the hug With May. \u201cDid I miss his tenth birthday?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, not wanting to get caught with forcing his seven year old brother into a Pok\u00e9mon Journey, quickly went along. \u201cUhh, yep! It was last month! We tried calling you, but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was probably too hung over\u2026\u201d Norman lamented, drooping his head in shame. \u201cArceus damnit, I\u2019m a worse father than I thought I was. Since your here, you might as well come in for a spell. Maybe I can whip up a present or two for the tyke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman headed back inside the gym, expecting his two children to follow. May felt a little bad to see Norman down in the dumps like that, but it was all for a good cause! Norman may not be the best dad of the year, but he was still a good one in her books. It was sad to see him so easy to accept that he missed out on three years of his son;s life due to his drinking habits \u201cCome on Max, let\u2019s head inside. And if dad asks what you want for a present, make sure it\u2019s food.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The liquid light spewed from where the metallic spheres opened, and two small Pokemon emerged from it\u2019s materialization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was a baby deer looking Pokemon with a pink upper body and a cream lower body. A yellow tuft of hair in the shape of a blossoming flower was placed on it\u2019s head. It looked up to Max and smiled, but cowered a little when it caught glance at May. The older sister rolled her eyes and huffered her puffy arms over her heaving bosom. She wasn\u2019t even trying to be intimidating yet! Maybe she needs to work on her people skills...or she\u2019s hungry. Yep, probably just hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Pokemon was a small, lizard like thing with a tapered tail, short arms and legs, and a pale yellow body with black frills. This Pokemon had a different reaction to it\u2019s new masters than the previous one. It looked up to Max, gave a polite smile and nodded it\u2019s head, almost like it had sized him up and gave the boy approval to take charge of It. But when it saw May, instead of turning away in fear, a low tinge of pink crept up to it\u2019s face as it eyed the human\u2019s thick, juicy curves. \u2018The poor creature must have a thing for bigger girls\u2019, Max thought as a bit of drool exited from its mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese two guys are called Deerling and Helioptile. They don\u2019t look like much, but with a lil\u2019 elbow grease and Rare Candies, you two will be the envy of Hoenn!\u201d Norman excalimned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pokemon were soon called back into their respective Pokeballs, to the Deerling\u2019s relief and the Helioptile\u2019s annoyance. Max pocketed them in with one of the food bags, making a mental note to take them out before his big sister gets hungry again. May has been good about not eating any Pokemon so far, but he\u2019d be lying if he said he trusted her completely. The two Pokemon could easily get lost in one of her binges, much less their own Pokeballs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman decided that May and Max should spend the night over in his gym, but May was eager to get back on the road. In another moment of soberness, the Gym Leader gave a sly smile and asked how his daughter liked sleeping on the ground in the cold outside. May realized in her eagerness to get her Pokemon Journey started and focus on food, she forgot to pack sleeping bags and tents. She reluctantly relented and agreed to stay the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax got to spend some time getting to know his new Pokemon, while May helped herself to the Gym\u2019s breakroom fridge. Norman, knowing how much of a glutton his daughter could be, didn't even try to stop her, and almost encouraged her by telling her that she missed a spot somewhere. It was a slow day at the Gym, so it was basically empty for the rest of the day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The place was just about to close, and someone just had to come now of all times? It was a green haired, sickly looking boy who was fidgeting his thumbs together as he nervously made his way into her father\u2019s Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey brat, whaddya want?\u201d May inquired curtly, not one for polite small talk. Or politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brat in question was started by the shrill nature of May\u2019s voice, and her dominating and huge figure was doing nothing to help his nerves. \u201cI-i-i-is Mr. Norman here?\u201d The fragile looking child stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not talking to him, your talking to me.\u201d May walked forward towards the boy, her fat gut jiggling hypnotically as she did so, only stopping until she was inches away from the sick brat\u2019s form, \u201cSo quit stammering and get on with it already! Wasting my time enough as it is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young child with green hair went bug eyed as he had to look past May\u2019s cleavage to look at her face. Perhaps coming here was not the best idea after all. \u201cI-I...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The boy lamented. \u201cI just...I was hoping Mr. Norman could help me catch a Pokemon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, May started to guffaw mercilessly. \u201cSeriously?! You want to be a Pokemon Trainer?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...y-yeah!\u201d The green haired kid defended himslef, his chest inflating a little bit with pride, only to be later deflated by a fit of coughing. \u201cWhat *HACK* is so funny *HicCUP* about that?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at yourself!\u201d May bumped her fat, heavy stomach into the boy\u2019s torso, making him fall to the floor like a glass figurine from a shelf. \u201cYou can barely stand a little nudge, let alone own a Pokemon! You\u2019re better off going back home and whacking off in your bedroom, punk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no!\u201d The boy felt s pang it anver go through him, giving him the energy to stand up again. \u201cI- I\u2019m tired of people telling me I\u2019m too weak to be a Pok\u00e9mon Tra-Trainer! I\u2019m f-fine, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was about to fail this kid about how he was obviously lying about being \u2018fine\u2019, when she was approached by a sudden flashback to when she was younger. When Max was just born, people always called her a fat freak, and was too obese and lazy to go on a journey. It made her bitter and resentful towards pretty much everyone save for her family. And look at her now, on a Pok\u00e9mon Journey! She would have loved to see the look on their faces now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay felt, for a rare time in her life, a little sympathy for the sniveling boy in front of her. If she can do it, he can do it to, right? Although, she still wasn't convinced on  going to help him catch a Pok\u00e9mon. Dinner was just around the corner and\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt May helps this kid get a Pok\u00e9mon, it would be an excuse to get away from Max. Now, May loved her little brother to death, but he was so adamant on the whole \u2018No eating Pok\u00e9mon\u2019 thing, that they're were times she needed some alone time. And this was the perfect cover! She would help this kid catch a Pok\u00e9mon, while she would be doing some \u2018catching\u2019 of her own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kid.\u201d May wiped some of the drool from her lower lip while fantasizing the feast she was gonna get. \u201cYou wanna be a Pokemon Trainer? Prove it. C\u2019mon, I\u2019m gonna help you catch a Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay walked past the sickly kid, purposely bumping into him on the way for a tease. He staggered, but held his ground, determined to get stronger in spite of his illness. He followed May out of the Gym and onto the next Route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey brat, what\u2019s your name anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s Wally.

Now stay right there while I go tell my dad that I\u2019m leaving.\u201d May said before running to where her dad was. \u201cHey dad, I\u2019m going to go help this kid catch a Pokemon you and Max can have dinner without me.\u201d May said quickly before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Wally borrow Torchic here and go find a Pokemon, I\u2019m going to go get something to eat.\u201d May said licking her lips before going off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay picked up a zigzagoon and stuffed it in her mouth and swallowed it. After that she heard several more zigzagoons crying out and running in the opposite direction but to no avail as May quickly caught up to the normal type Pokemon and shoved multiple down her through and enjoyed feeling the squirming Pokemon in her glorious gut. May continued on her feast and she wasn\u2019t even paying attention to the fact she was about to shove a ralts in her mouth. \u201cHey what the heck!\u201d May saw she was no longer holding anything and she looked down and saw a couple feet away Wally was holding a pokeball. \u201cYou have major balls to catch the Pokemon that I was about to eat.\u201d May said and Wally tensed up before May started laughing. \u201cGood job kid, there\u2019s not that many people that would do something like that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay stopped laughing and started thinking, Wally was a pretty cute kid, obviously not as cute as Max, but a close second. As well she could use him to carry food and that would help get him into shape. Also he could keep Max busy so she could eat more Pokemon. However Wally could end up creating a third wheel in the group which may cause problems. Wally could end up preventing May from getting extra intimate with Max. May thought of some more pros and cons before coming to a conclusion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May looked over the sickly looking child called Wally Sapphires. He really was a bit of a cutie. Even though he was ten, and taller than her brother Max, he was kinda of small for his age, which made it easy for her to order him around and get what she wanted from him. He was skinny and frail with messy, green hair and blueish grey eyes. After a few moments of thinking, May had come to a decision:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kid was just too good looking to pass up. Sure, it might create a third wheel situation later on, but she could use the extra hands to carry her food on her journey. Plus, Getting to know the brat better may not be so bad. She got up from the trampled grass she was sitting on and walked up to Wally, nervously clutching his newly caught Ralts in his hands as her shadow began to loom over his diminutive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, pipsqueak. Today is your lucky day! Pack your stuff, because tomorrow morning, you are gonna come with me on my Pokemon Journey!\u201d May beamed with a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ooh\u2026\u201d Wally replied with a slow stutter, trying to shift the gaze of his eyes, yet always coming back to May\u2019s huge gut still squirming with Pokemon inside. \u201cThank you for helping me catch a Pokemon and the offer, b-but...I only move here yesterday, and my parents\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s okay lil\u2019 guy.\u201d May replied sweetly, ruffling his green hair with a bloated hand. \u201cI get it. New town, sights to see and all that. Don\u2019t want to leave your mom and dad, especially on a day\u2019s notice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah! That\u2019s it!\u201d Wally\u2019s mood was brought up by May understanding the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough I am gonna have to eat you now.\u201d May continued casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Wally to comprehend what May just said. After a few seconds of pregnant silence, he finally spoke up. \u201c...I\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d May suddenly picked the poor boy up by his sides and lifted him up off of the ground. \u201cListen kid, one thing you gotta know about me, I hate it when things don\u2019t go my way. I want you to come on my Pokemon Journey. Why? \u2018Cause you're almost as fucking cute as my brother Max, and that is saying something. But since you\u2019re not, well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay ominously brought Wally closer to her massive chest, his frail body almost grazing the fabric of her bra. \u201c...your only good to me as food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Wally shouted, terrified beyond what he thought possible. He had just witnessed May eat dozens of Pokemon be doomed to her eternal pit called a stomach. He didn't want to end up in they're like the rest of them. \u201cI-I-I-I changed my mind! I\u2019ll come on your Journey! I\u2019ll do everything you say, just don\u2019t-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d May released Wally from her vice grip and let him fall back to the Earth with a thud. \u201cI\u2019m glad you saw reason. Now, run along home and pack your stuff, and be ready at seven o'clock in the morning at my dad\u2019s gym. Or else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes ma\u2019am!\u201d Wally nodded vigorously, and began to ran as fast as he could without aggravating his lungs towards his parents new house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay watched Wally run away, and when she thought he was out of sight, she began to chuckle to herself. What was a chuckle than turned into a fit of deep throated cackles as she couldn't believe she got away with what happened. May never really meant to eat kid. No, he was far too cute to get rid of. But he bought the act so quickly. It was hilarious to the eighteen year old, and it took her a good five minutes of this laughing to finally calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWally Sapphires,\u201d May wiped a tear from her eye from laughing too hard. \u201cI think the two of us are gonna have a beautiful relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, May walked back to her dad\u2019s gym. She had missed dinner, but that wasn't a major loss of her, at least tonight. The squirms in her belly had finally died down, and it was starting to process the creatures inside into more fat on her lovely frame. But Pokemon are a lot harder to digest than regular food, and she soon found herself drained of energy. \u201cTime for bed I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room Norman had set up for May and Max to sleep in, May found that her younger brother was already sleeping away in the mattress on the floor. Grinning slyly, May quietly got into the bed with him, her massive body taking up most, if not all, of the surface area. Max, still sleeping, rolled over to to where May was due to her weight. Gently, she lowered herself down onto his body, effectively smothering him in her own flab. With a sufficient pillow underneath her, May dozed off into sleep with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early in the morning, just after midnight, when Max began to stir awake from his slumber. Normally, he could never seem to recall his dreams, and he usually never had a problem with nightmares in the past. However, that was exactly the reason why he had woken up in the first place. Like how his life was slowly becoming more and more centered around his big sister May, know even his sleep was not free from his clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightmare was about May, so big and large she was basically a living, breathing apocalypse of gluttony and hunger. Her appetite was insatiable, gleefully glutting down on entire forests full of Pokemon and cities full of people. Yet the scariest things about it was how Max, from the safety of her shoulder, kept cheering her on and was excited to see his big sister get even fatter. The dream ended with May facing down Groudon, Rayquaza, and Kyogre before the first blow could be thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, now awake, yawned and raised his arms over his head to stretch. Or, at least he would have, had his mouth not been filled with May\u2019s sweaty back flab the moment he opened his mouth, and his arms not pinned down to the mattress on the floor by her incredible weight. For a few minutes, he didn\u2019t know what was going on, until he rationalized that May had fallen asleep on him. This was not the first time that May has done this, only this time it was much more intense, because unlike before, she had tripled in weight. Her blubber may have been soft and warm, and able to double as a blanket on good conditions, the weight was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax attempted to wiggle his way out of his fleshy prison, but it proved to be incredibly difficult. It was like swimming through a vat of molasses, and each movement only got him more stuck and drained his energy. But he kept on, slowly inching his way closer and closer the edge of the mattress, where May\u2019s pillowy fat spilled over. After at least a half of an hour of this, Max finally emerged from his meaty prison and fell onto the cold, hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax panted, now completely devoid of any energy, as he gazed at his slumbering big sister. \u201cI wonder how big she will get\u2026\u201d he pondered out loud, thinking back to his dream when she was the size of a mountain. He shook those thoughts out of his head as a new one just came in. May took up all of the mattress, but she was incredibly soft and wam. And perhaps if he crawled up on top of her doughy stomach, he would be able to appreciate those facts more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to disturb her, Max carefully crawled his way on top of May\u2019s fat torso, his arms and knees sinking into the soft surface that was her flesh. He ended up having his head nestled into the underside of her heaving bosom, doubling themselves as two great pillows. With warmth and comfort once again on his side, Max slowly drifted back into dreamland, this time hoping it would be more pleasant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Max was proven wrong as May wraooed her puffy, fat arms around his skinny waist and forcefully shoved his body into her mouth. He tried to yell, but all he got for his efforts was a big heaping of saliva of spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, in her dream world, now had half on the animated donut in her mouth. She took glee in hearing it\u2019s cartoonish, high pitched voice cry out for help, knowing full well that no one was coming. It tasted a little different than most donuts, but it was still super sweet, and it's flavour danced on her tongue. In fact, this had to be the best donut she ever had! With renewed vigour, she tried to force more of it in, the donut\u2019s \u2018shoulders\u2019 now in between her pouty lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Max was now flailing his legs on May\u2019s bouncy stomach as half of his torso vanished into his big sisters cavernous maw. However, the impact was so small on her that all he amounted in doing was give her a pleasant massage. His head was being sucked down her fleshy throat, pulsating around him and squeezing him down even further into her body. Max knew May loved him, but if she doesn't wake up soon, he was going to be her breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, May managed to get all of the Donut inside of her mouth. Her wailed and flailed around her tongue and pounded on her cheeks, tickling her from the inside. With an amused giggle, she swallowed the morsel in one gulp, through a hard one, and traced a pudgy finger down her throat to feel it sink to the bottom of her gut. When it finally landed, May let out a content sigh and patted it like a pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay! Get me out of here!\u201d The donut called out from her flabby belly, sounding a lot less like a cartoonish foodstuff and more like...and more like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d May suddenly awoke in a sweat, sitting up on the mattress to see that Max was no longer they're. She moved her head around frantically, looking for where he could have gone...when she felt something move inside of her stomach. May blinked, slowly looked down, and gasped in horror when she saw something bump and struggle through the layers of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...FUCK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay immediately began to regurgitate Max, though not an easy task. Most of the time she was sending things down her throat, not back up. Though she had done it once when Max saw her eat a family of Mightyena. She just had to focus on things that she didn\u2019t want to eat.  And right now, Max was all she could think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Max fell on top of his sister's dome of a belly, covered from head to toe in thick saliva.

She figured that she wasn't able to see him before because her belly is just so damn huge. Well, of course it would. If it can fit Max inside, of course it can hide him outside. May was about to lament further on how she almost killed his brother when she realized just what exactly Max was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was groping and rubbing both his hands and his face into the soft, pale flab of his big sister\u2019s belly. The grogginess of her sleep finally faded away when she saw this, and she could finally feel what he was doing to her. And by Arceus, did it feel gooooood. His diminutive, child hands massaged her empty stomach better than any masseuses ever could. If what had happened last night had not transpired, she would have been content to just let Max be and bask in her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did happen, and she had to talk about. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax?\u201d May asked inquisitively, tapping a pudgy finger on his messy head of hair. Max looked up and finally noticed that his big sister was now awake. In response, he jumped back in fear from the base of her pillowy gut, much to May\u2019s displeasure. \u201cDo you wanna talk...about what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yeah. Actually, I do.\u201d Max slowly crawled back towards May, this time opting to be by her side to get a better look at her face. May closed her eyes, trembled her lips, and braced herself for whatever comes next after she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCould you do that again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spoke at the same time, each one stunned into silence by the others response. The air around them was so thick one could slice through it like hot butter. Max was about to say something to break the silence, before May cut him off by asking her own questions first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you want me...to eat you again?\u201d May chose her words slowly, trying to understand what the distortion was going on in Max\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d Max rubbed his arm nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...but why?\u201d May rolled over to get a better view with Max, causing her bare naked breasts to flop onto his chest, causing him to blush slightly. \u201cI thought you were scared. You cried up a storm last night, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I know. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Max took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cI liked being in there, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was silent for a while, processing the information Max was unloading onto her, before a sly smile started to creep up onto her face. \u201cMax\u201d She asked coyly. \u201cDo you like my belly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Max was unsure of how to respond to such a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay sighed in mock annoyance. \u201cI said,\u201d She than proceeded to roll over again onto her belly, smothering her little brother Max in the process. As he was buried under soft, sweaty, creamy flab, May leaned into his face and repeated in a low voice, \u201cDo you like my belly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmhmm\u2026\u201d Max nodded his head slowly as a blush started to form under his eyes. He tried to look elsewhere, but all that was around him was more May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you like about it?\u201d May scooted her body up, giving Max a better view of her impressive sphere of a belly. It smothered his entire lower body and slightly reverberated with growls for food to digest into more plush fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels...soft.\u201d Max answered reluctantly. \u201cSofter than my bed back home. And it\u2019s warm like a fireplace\u2026I could hear your heartbeat inside, I could hear lots of things. It didn't look like how my books told me, it looked like...pink, puffy clouds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to get bigger and fatter, my little munchkin. All this belly, all for you~.\u201d May smiled and planted a sisterly kiss on his forehead, kicking Max\u2019s blush up a couple shades. \u201cMaybe one day I could you back in their, and you wouldn't have to worry about getting hurt...but now, we got a whole region to explore!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, with invigorated energy, got up off of Max and began to get ready for the day. It was an intense night, but she and him were all the better because of it. She felt that the bond between the two of them had solidified, somehow. In any case, it was time to get out and see the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and get some breakfast. She had worked up an appetite last night!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max tried not to look, but failed to not take in the ever growing assets his big sister had. Through the slightly see through bed sheets, the boy could see May\u2019s JJ bosom on full display, heaving up and down with every breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rear end had blossomed into the size of novelty beach balls, swishing and swaying in tandem with the movement of her legs. And as much as he honestly enjoyed seeing her like this, he realized the two of them were going to get into trouble fast if she kept wearing a bedsheet for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, May?\u201d Max walked a little ahead May as she drew nearer to the town\u2019s exit. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should get you some, you know, real clothes?\u201d. May rolled her eyes and looked down to give her brother an amused smirk. The younger of the duo noticed that he was having to crane his neck more and more to face her as time went on. She wasn't just getting wider, May was getting taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I? I kinda like wearing these, it makes me feel all loose and free~\u201d May raised her increasing puffy arms over her head and stretched her back. \u201cDo you really want to see your big sister in pain, all her beautiful bod stuffed tight into some ugly clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, I just\u2026\u201d Max looked around, finding a clothing store placed conveniently near the border of the town. \u201cThey're! Please, just go in and try something on. Maybe you\u2019ll like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay buffer and crossed her arms over her bulging boobs. \u201cFine, Max, I\u2019ll go in, but I don\u2019t want to hear you telling me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do after I come out, alright?\u201d With that, she spun around to face the store and began trekking to it, giving her younger brother an impressive view of her rear end sloshing away as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI um...u-uh...was that your sister?\u201d. Max heard a weak voice behind him. Taken by surprise, he turned around to see a pale skinned, green haired boy clutching onto his satchel tightly. \u201cM-my name is Wally. Your sister helped me get a Pok\u00e9mon yesterday, and now I have to go on a journey with her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Uh...well, welcome to the team, I guess.\u201d Max smiled. Someone to help carry all the food was a welcome change, even if it was sudden. \u201cI\u2019m Max. Yeah, that was...was my sister. She can come off as abrasive sometimes, but once you get to know her, she\u2019s not so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe threatened to eat me if I didn\u2019t go with her\u2026\u201d. Wally admitted, clutching his bag evan tighter. Max grimaced, remembering the events that happened last night. \u201cSh-she was probably just kidding! She\u2019d never eat you...on purpose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys waited around the entrance to the Clothing Store for a few minutes, before May finally came out, wearing...something very unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Max, I gotta say you were right about- Oh! Hey there, Wally! Looks like you didn\u2019t wimp out after all, huh?\u201d May walked over to the two boys, dominating them with her huge form, wearing absolutely nothing save for a two piece swim suit. Almost her entire, jiggling body was on display to the world, hiding only her groin and nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuh...\u201d Max drooled, not liking how small he felt under the shadow of her bigger sister, especially when she was dressed like this. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can go out like that, May.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I can!\u201d May slapped the top of her bulging, blubbery breasts hard, leaving them to wiggle and slosh on their own for a solid ten seconds. \u201cI cleared with the gal behind the counter, said that as long as I don\u2019t show the stuff they blur on TV, I\u2019m golden!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...your gonna wear that, for the rest of the trip?\u201d Wally interjected, pinching his nose to keep blood from falling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at that rate I\u2019m going, I\u2019ll outgrow this in a couple of days, so I guess after that it\u2019s gonna be R-rated from there on out.\u201d May shrugged, totally unfazed about the prospect of touring around Hoenn as naked as the day she was born. She highly doubted they made clothes for people as big as she was going to get, so the police won\u2019t have an excuse for her to cover up.\u201d Not that you pervs care, right? Come on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the three were on their way, with May showing off a whole lot more bare skin, and a stomach that was getting harder and harder to fill.</span></div></div>",

No one approached them to tell May to put on actual clothes. May felt giddy as Wally and Max got along splendidly becoming incredibly fast friends. Unknown to May, a part of Max saw Wally like a brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh May, the map says we were supposed to go the other way.\u201d Max said as they were walking through a forest. \u201cI know, I know but I feel like there\u2019s something cool over here.\u201d May said, Max looking over to Wally who shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio eventually made it to a clearing where there was a boulder that was bigger than May. \u201cThere\u2019s a scale right here, pretty weird.\u201d Wally said and then May stepped on it. It read 700 and to May\u2019s surprise the boulder opened up revealing an elevator. \u201cThat looks fun!\u201d May said and grabbed the two smaller boys and she went inside the elevator. \u201cThis seems like a bad idea, May.\u201d Wally said \u201cHe\u2019s right, for all we know there are criminals down there.\u201d Max protested but May ignored both of them. Thankfully the elevator was more than wide enough to accommodate the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes the elevator opened up revealing some sort of huge convention. There were dozens of women walking around. The most interesting thing was that May was the shortest person there. There were towering walking around about half of them being fat like May. \u201cHello, hello, welcome to the MWC you seem to be a newcomer. A Nurse Joy who was larger than May greeted not noticing the boys. \u201cUhm, thanks, what exactly does MWC stand for?\u201d May asked feeling somewhat intimidated by the large cheerful woman. \u201cWhy Massive Woman Convention of course! Most men want girls smaller than them so we have this convention everyday where women come and gather for various things. It seems that you need to change your wardrobe. The Nurse Joy said grabbing May\u2019s and rushing off. Max and Wally looked at each other and rather follow after May they went right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Wally found a massive arcade that, oddly enough had no one in it. \u201cStrange, no one\u2019s here.\u201d Max muttered \u201cNot quite\u201d Max and Wally screamed like little girls and turned around. There was a woman who appeared to be older and taller than May. She had blond hair and blue eyes was dressed jeans and a purple Crop Top. While she wasn\u2019t as fat as May she was definitely heavier than her due to extreme height. She was also rather chubby her stomach jutting out pretty far. \u201cHey, hey calm down I\u2019m not going to hurt you. In fact I have a gift for you.\u201d  The Woman smiled, Max and Wally looked at each other. \u201cW-w-why would you give a stranger a gift.\u201d Wally asked the towering woman. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a gift more of a prize, follow me. Just to let you know my names is Alice\u201d The Blonde said walking past the boys who decided to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the arcade was a small white table and a large jar of candy corn. \u201cEvery month for the MWC I host booth where I have bunch of one thing a container and I have them guess, the person who guesses closest to the number they get a rare pokemon. Normally people go crazy for this but this month we have Winoa visiting so everyone is going crazy wanting to see her. Shame because the Pokemon that\u2019s up for grabs is this little guy.\u201d Alice pulled a Pokeball from her cleavage and presses the button and out came a small gray Pokemon with a yellow nut shaped head. \u201cThis boys is Meltan, I found this little guy when I went to Kanto to visit my brother who just had a baby. If you want Meltan guess how many pieces of candy corn are in the jar. Here is some paper and pencils.\u201d Alice handed the boys some paper and a pencil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter studying the jar for fifteen minutes they both wrote down their answer. Alice read the papers and smiled. \u201cWow you actually guessed right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho got it right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I actually really like going around like this, the warn sunlight and cool wind on my skin, free and beautiful\u2026\u201d May trailed off as she struck a pose with her body, making it jiggle and wobble for the whole world to see, especially the trio before her. \u201cPlus, the stuff they sell down here is super stretchy, so I don\u2019t have to worry about outgrowing them, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove her point, May took her bra strap over her left shoulder and lifted it over her head as far as her arm would let it. It evan looked like it had more room to give! She let the piece of fabric go, letting it snap back to her meaty shoulder. \u201cSo, now that we\u2019re together again, let\u2019s get something to eat! I heard it\u2019s all free and crazy fattening.\u201d May began to walk out of the Arcade, expecting Max and Wally to follow her. Blushing, the young boys obeyed and ran up to keep pace with her. As they walked, they noticed that some of the other girls at the convention liked to go half naked also. None of them seemed embarrassed or ashamed, and no one else bothered them. In fact, some people complimented instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they all got to the buffet area of the convention, their jaws dropped as big as they could go at the sight of it. It was an entire room the size of a park, filled with tables piled high with food, food, and evan more food. The smells were intoxicating, lulling everyone into a state of hunger, evan Max and Wally. But while the blue may have been content to just one, maybe two plates of this delicious food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deep resonated inside May\u2019s stomach. It was more than gluttony, more than a want to stuff herself. At the sight of all this food, nearly limitless in numbers, May suddenly found herself walking up to a table and taking huge bites from the plates with her own two hands. Max and Wally immediately began to try and pry her away, but Alice, noticing the two boys from before, stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her, boys.\u201d Alice giggled. \u201cIt looks like your freind here has a case of the hunger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe...hunger?\u201d Wally echoed confused. \u201cWhat to you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something us bigger gals like to call what happens when someone gets possessed by their gluttony. Most new members get it when they see our lineup of food. It\u2019s alright though, she\u2019ll stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max was pretty sure no one would be able to handle a half ton May. What surprised Max was that May was already this fat and she hadn't even gotten her first gym badge. At that thought Max decided he had to do some damage control. \"Please tell me there is some healthy food here?\" Max asked Alice who laughed. \"Kid, healthy food here would be considered a paradox. Even if we did have healthy food here it would be impossible to move your friend to it. Your best bet would be to wait in the arcade so you don't get caught in the cross fire.\" Max and Wally didn't leave May behind again but if there was nothing they could do but watch what was the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice led the boys back to the arcade where they sent out their Pokemon so they could bond and such.

Weighing over a thousand pounds, The now ten foot tall older women towered over the two young boys oppressively, clearly enjoying the shocked expressions on their faces. True to her word, the bra and panties she wore stretched along to accommodate her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like someone had a good time~\u201d Alice chuckled, May now at her eye level. \u201cHere, take this.\u201d She handed May a pill she fished out from in between her folds, who looked at it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what the heck is it?\u201d May asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special pill us fat girl\u2019s created to get rid of any nasty health problems that might come from eating like you just did.\u201d Alice explained. \u201cGo on, pop it in. It\u2019s no fun to be big without it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, May accepted the pill and chucked into her mouth, swallowing it immediately. A ew moments later, her eyes widened. \u201cOh...oh wow I feel amazing!\u201d May slapped her gut as she felt healthier and stronger than ever. \u201cI haven't felt this light since I was a kid! When does it wear off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about it: never! But don\u2019t go out and telling everyone that, it\u2019s a fat girl secret understand?\u201d Alice warned. May nodded, which made her relieved. \u201cThanks, we can\u2019t tell the skinny folks until it's out of testing. It\u2019s safe for us, but not them. Well, if you folks want to get back on the Route, let me tell you about the nearest place to head to, Rustboro City. The Devon Corporation hired us from all over the world to work on that drug you just took, so you\u2019ll find evan more like us up above.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah...it\u2019s like I found my people down here!\u201d May exclaimed, suddenly feeling like she was apart of a community. Meanwhile, Max and Wally exchanged nervous glances. More girls like May? The two of them could barely keep up with one, and now Alice was saying they're was a whole City full of them? \u201cWhat\u2019s there to do there, anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you get hungry again, we got ourselves a nice buffet operation going on up they're. If you liked what you just ate, you\u2019ll love what they have on the menu.\u201d Alice patted May\u2019s stomach, eager to see it grow. It was always great to see another big girl like them come into the fold, especially one with this much potential. \u201cIf you want, head over to the Devon Building, they're always looking for test subjects. Don\u2019t worry, the stuff they put us through is pretty much harmless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the trainer\u2019s school?\u201d Max piped in, trying to focus May back to being a Pokemon Trainer. \u201cWe should go there, we could use the education to help us be better trainers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...ooh, sorry boys.\u201d Alice said with a sad smile. \u201cWe\u2019re shutting that place down. Remember what I said about some of us eating Pokemon? Well, by some, I meant a lot. There isn't enough interest anymore to keep that place open. In fact, we\u2019re converting it into a special live Pokemon restaurant. It should be open by the end of the month, but if you guys want you can go check on it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay licked her lips at the sound of an all Pokemon restaurant. These girls really knew how to live. While she promised she wouldn't eat Pokemon in front of her brother. Wally was a whole different story, and surely he wouldn't mind if she indulged just a little bit. Max and Wally, on the other hand were terrified, clutching their Pokemon defensively. \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that! I ain\u2019t gonna eat your Pokemon, just be sure to keep them in your Pokeballs and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Alice tried to console them. \u201cWe still have a Pokemon Center, but that slowly turning into a glorified hotel at this point. Don\u2019t be sad lil\u2019 guys, that\u2019s just the way the world works now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t be afraid of the future ya\u2019 pansies!\u201d May piped in, taking both boys into her arms as she bent down to grab them. Meltan cowherd and hid into Wally's satchel as the ten foot tall girl raised them up to her eye level. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s not exciting? A whole city full of big girls just like me, getting bigger and bigger?\u201d She wiggled her breasts around to stir up the two\u2019s emotions, earning an embarrassed blush from them. Max thought back to what May said this morning, about her getting bigger just for him. He wondered...how big would be enough for her to stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right boys. It may surprise you, but the two of us are actually really small compared to the others up they're.\u201d Alice explained. \u201cLike Roxanne, the Rock Type Gym Leader. I\u2019d tell you how big she is, but I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. You can go challenge her for a badge if you want, if she still offers them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, why not? I\u2019m still a trainer...for now.\u201d May shrugged her shoulders, indifferent. \u201cNow, let\u2019s head on up to Rustboro!\u201d To Max and Wally\u2019s surprise, instead of putting them back on the ground, May only set down Wally while Max was plunged in between her large breasts. She blushed as she felt him squirm around, slowly rubbing the tit flesh in little circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Wally recalled the Pokemon from the Arcade, the three headed up the elevator back onto Route 104. From there, it was as a short walk to Rustboro, and the first thing May did when she got there was...</span></div></div>",

But than it dawned on them that one thing that she took absolutely seriously was food, so she was telling the truth. The two young boys looked horrified at this revelation, to which May just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a glutton through and through!\u201d She smacked her belly hard, making the two boys on top stumble on her flesh. \u201cGrowing up, I always heard people talk about me behind my back about how was as big as a Wailord or a Snorlax. They were trying to make me feel bad, but instead it made me determined. I don\u2019t want to be as big as a Wailord, I wanna be so big I could eat one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-b-But May, you gave up on eating Pok\u00e9mon remember?\u201d Max stuttered, doing the calculations of what a Wailord consuming May would look like. An average Wailord was five times her current height, so the only way she could even think about eating one whole is if she was one hundred feet tall or higher! That\u2019s bigger than the Pok\u00e9mon Center they were in! Wally looked at Max with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you talking about, Max? Your sister eats Pok\u00e9mon all the t-time. I got my Ralts by wrestling it away from her.\u201d Wally interjected, surprised that Max didn\u2019t know about his sister\u2019s diet. Max opened his eyes wide and looked back at May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...is that true?\u201d Max asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay bit her lower lip. She knew the secret would have to come out someday, she just was hoping it wouldn\u2019t have to be today. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Max, but Wally\u2019s right. I still eat Pok\u00e9mon, and I absolutely love it too much to ever stop.\u201d May petted Max\u2019s head, trying to bring out gently while still being honest. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not the only one, too. There\u2019s a whole city outside that window that doesn't see anything wrong with it, so you guys are the outcasts here. I know you love Pok\u00e9mon for your reasons, lil\u2019 brother, and I love them because they make me big and fat taste amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sniffled, trying to not cry. He felt betrayed that May would lie to him about eating Pok\u00e9mon, and that she would never see the magical creatures he called his friends as anything more than walking food, but at the end of the day...she was still his big sister. He had to love her no matter how their views in things differ, and at her size they was no stopping here from getting what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, May.\u201d Max said, hugging May\u2019s nearly naked bosom. His hands were almost entirely engulfed by the squishy, pale flesh as he squeezed tight. \u201cJust...don\u2019t eat our Pok\u00e9mon, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiled and wrapped her arms around him and Wally into a hug, squeezing the two hard into her chest. \u201cNo promises, lil\u2019 bro. No promises\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three took their time to relax and rest in their room at the Pok\u00e9mon Center, they all decided that they should take the time to see the sights Rustboro had to offer. The architecture was so different and unique compared to the rest of Hoenn, get it still felt old and classic. Like Alice said, most of the population walking about on the streets were fat girls like her. Some of them fully dressed, others showing off as much as May. Some her size, and some much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl at a street corner was hawking fliers to pedestrians about how the Devon Corparation was hiring heavier women to test their newest breakthroughs in medicine. It looked a little sketchy, but it paid well and guaranteed no harm would come of it. They're was also numerous restaurants and bistros, chock full of women busy glutting themselves. The Pok\u00e9mon School was still half open, although half of it had already been converted into that Live Pokemon restaurant that Alice was taking about, to which May locked her lips while May hid behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, May was reminded that she was a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer when she heard about Roxxanne\u2019s Rock Type Gym. Alice said something about her being incredibly small compared to her, which she kinda wanted to see to believe. Of course, that would mean Pok\u00e9mon battling, and she would much rather go and stuff her face. She wasn't going to become as big as a Wailord by waiting, however, so in the, she chose...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Max could even point it out, he was already being dragged along by his big sister as she waddled her way towards Route 102.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 102 was known as where many Pok\u00e9mon Trainers liked to catch Pok\u00e9mon, but since May was out if Pokeballs, that wasn't In her agenda. And even if she did restock back in town, the Pokemon were, in her opinion, too weak and dumb to be on her team. She wanted Rare, strong, cool Pok\u00e9mon! Not another Zigzagoon that bred like wildfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I got my shiny Ralts!\u201d May exclaimned as she richer into her purse to grab it\u2019s ball, along with a chocolate bar. \u201cI bet this lil\u2019 guy will win me tons of cash!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust than, a young trainer around Max\u2019s age sprung out from the bushes like a madman, and landed his way too cool sneakers on the path in front of May. \u201cI challenge you to a Pok\u00e9mon battle!\u201d The aspiring lad pointed up his index finger dramatically as triumphant fanfare played in the background of his mind. May and Max looked at, from their perspective, the quite possibly deranged child for a few solid minutes, dead air filling the void between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...k\u201d May acknowledged the boy\u2019s request after a such an awkward silence \u201cGo Ralts!\u201d She threw the Pokeball she was carrying in her right hand right into the face of the opposing trainer, who was still pointing his finger at her up until that point. As the boy cried out in pain and landed onto the dirt ground, out came Jeff the Ralts from his Pokeball, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, did I just come out of a Pokeball?\u201d Jeff questioned himself as he looked around. He gazed up and saw May\u2019s intimidating and dominating figure look over his frail body. \u201cAw man...and I really liked being free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo Zigzagoon!\u201d The young boy, still on the ground and struggling to get back up, called out his Pok\u00e9mon as he threw it\u2019s Pokeball into the air. The Zigzagoon in question materialized in front of the psychic Pok\u00e9mon and greeted him with a cheerful and polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello! My name\u2019s Hobbes, my master\u2019s name is Calvin, and I\u2019m gonna pound you untill you faint from exhaustion!\u201d The Zigzagoon called Hobbes relayed what was going to happen to Jeff as if he had called customer service for help on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww man, today is just not my day\u2026\u201d Jeff lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRalts, use Confusion!\u201d May bellowed, not liking how her Pok\u00e9mon was conversing with the enemy instead of hitting it. Jeff sighed and obeyed his new master. The psychic attack was launched, making the Zigzagoon grimace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZigzagoon!\u201d The Pokemon Trainer named Calvin had finally gotten off the ground. \u201cUse Tackle!\u201d Hobbes the Zigzagoon heard his master, but did not perform it. The effects of the confusion made his vision blurry and his head a throbbing ache. After looking around, he finally found a target that looked vaguely like the blue of the shiny Ralts. Without thinking he charged head forward into the target, which happened to be the light blue shorts of his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d Calvin screamed as his own Pok\u00e9mon hit him right on his groin. He collapsed once again onto the ground, this time with both of his hands placed on his crotch in an attempt to nurse it back to health. Meanwhile, Hobbes the Zigzagoon awaited his master for further instructions, but it never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...cool! I won the battle, and I don\u2019t even have to anything!\u201d May cried out in joy. \u201cMax, go raid that dork for some cash, and give me one of those bags! I think I just earned myself a victory meal~.\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A boy who appeared to be older than Max but younger 5an May came out of bushes. \u201cI challenge you to a Pokemon battle.\u201d The boy said with a grin, confident in his abilities. \u201cOkay sure I\u2019ll be-\u201c May said before getting a finger shoved in her face. \u201cNot you fatty, I want to go against the kid.\u201d The boy said wagging his finger.

The other boy smirked. \u201cGo poochyena!\u201d The other boy said, throwing his pokeball revealing a poochyena. At this Max frowned, \u201cRalts, growl\u201d Max said, \u201cPoocheyna use tackle.\u201d The canine Pok\u00e9mon tackled the white Pokemon who made a weak growl in response. It went like this for a couple of minutes. \u201cMax, why aren\u2019t you attacking that stupid mutt, you\u2019re losing.\u201d May growled frustrated. \u201cWow, you must be stupid, Ralts is a psychic type, psychic type moves don\u2019t work on dark types.\u201d The other boy taunted. \u201cOh this little punk is going to get it!\u201d Much to both Max and the other boys surprise May picked up Ralts and threw it like a football, it even spiraled. Ralts ended up hitting poochyena, then bounced off it hitting. The other boy in the face causing him to fall over. The Pok\u00e9dex signed telling May that Ralts leveled up and learned fairy wind. \u201cWho\u2019s stupid now?\u201d May asked sarcastically and kicked the boy before taking his money and some other stuff.</span></div></div>",

May looked to Max. \"I think the Pokemon are this way.\" Max stated pointing towards a large white door labeled <i>\"LAB\"</i> May grinned before entering the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, look at all this nerd stuff, there's the Pokemon!\" May said noticing a glass container containing three Pokeballs. Despite it not being locked May smashed and took a Pokeball not checking what was in it. Now while May would started to take the other two Pokeballs an alarm went off causing May to panic and start taking a whole bunch of empty Pokeball's and potions. May and Max hurried out of the lab. Max went straight out of the house while May lingered to steal the food and money in Birch's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May, you know you could of just lifted up the lid, and not smash everything, May?\" Max looked around and saw that May was not with him. \"Oh boy\" Max sighed however he saw May running out with a huge sack filled with food. \"Did you really have to take his food?\" Max asked, May panting \"Yes, now let's get out of here.\" May said before running off to the first route, Max sighing wishing his sister could of been patient enough to not wake him up while everyone was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and May were walking through the route. \"Uh May, do you even know which Pokemon you picked?\"  Max asked tilting his head. \"Nope\" May casually said, prompting Max to stop walking. \"What? You want to check? Fine.\" May groaned pulling out the Pokeball and clicked the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground was a small blue Pokemon with a fin on its head. \"Mudkip!\" The Pokemon cheered not bothered by anything going on around it. \"There I checked, happy now?\" May asked looking over to Max, however his jaw was dropped and pointing at something behind May. \"What are you freaking out about?\" May turned around and saw a small owl like Pokemon which seemed to be communicating with Mudkip. \"So what, it's just a Pokemon.\" May said scoffing turning back to Max<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No May, that is a Rowlet, they are the starter Pokemon for people in the Alolan region. on top of that this Rowlet is a shiny.\" Max said, May's eyes gleamed, while she didn't necessarily know that much about Pokemon she was familiar with the concept of Shiny Pokemon. May turned back around and saw that it was flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay started to chase it, Max and Mudkip following close behind. Eventually they came across a really large tree. The Rowlet sitting on one of the branches. However May noticed a sleeping blue haired boy the same age as Max in a sleeping back under the tree. \"Ooh I wonder if he has any money.\" May said and started going through the boy's sleeping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\"RE DOING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay turned around and saw a blue haired girl her age scowling at May. But how big is she?</span></div></div>",

If Arceus had not been captured and forced into slavery, it would have made sure that no innocent, pure, loving child would ever have to go through such a horrible life, and they would all live in the Hall of Origin with the Legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly, this is not the case, and every suffering boys in the world can attest to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years ago, the Pokemon World was a happy and fun place where Pokemon and humans lived in harmony and worked together to better each other\u2019s lives. Than one day, a viral outbreak changed everything. Nobody knows where it came from, when it started, or even what it is called. But it exists. The female humans of the world were the only ones affected by the virus, and the effects were immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat once were kind, timid women turned into viscous, vile monsters who only care about themselves. They became incredibly strong, and soon found out that they could become even stronger and more beautiful by gaining weight. They became the essence of Gluttony and Greed, and the world payed for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the world is a former shell of it\u2019s lush green past. Entire forests have been bulldozed to make way for food processing factories and restaurants. Species of Pok\u00e9mon have been eaten into extinction. The sky is filled with smoke from the factory exhaust, and the Male humans of the world have been reduced to playthings, slaves, pets and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is in the former humble village of Pallet, now a medium sized city, that we find little nine year old Red Firestone on the eve of his tenth birthday. He sat with his legs crossed on his bed, twiddling with his thumbs as he dreaded what tomorrow will bring. His mother was eight feet tall and weighed seven and a half hundred pounds. She did not treat Red as her son like a mother should, but rather her servant. From a very early age, he was forced to make all of her meals, and was often the subject to many a squashing by her big, naked booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though Red was nine, he knew that life with his horrible mother was still better than going out alone on a Pokemon Journey. Although Pokemon are much more valued for the meat they carry, Pokemon battling is still around, although it is now far more brutal. Every child at the age of ten is required by law to go on a Pokemon Journey or suffer serious jail time. If you are a girl, you can keep your winnings. But if you are a boy, than all the winnings will transfer back to your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed considered praying to one of the Legendary Pokemon, but decided against it; they were already too troubled serving their new masters, the Pokemon Champions. That was Red\u2019s only hope; to beat the elite four and the Kanto Champion. Nobody knows who she is, or even if it is a she at all! But they all obey her will, for she has at her disposal two of the most powerful Pokemon of all time, Mew and Mewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Red can become the Pokemon Champion of Kanto, the Mew Duo would be his, and there could be a chance at fixing this broken world. He made promises to himself that he would never become evil or power hungry as champion; he would love all his Pokemon and treat them with respect and love. Than, he will take on the next region\u2019s league, and not stop until he becomes the master of them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut until than, Red sat in his bedroom, his bags packed and ready to go, with a battered Pokeball left from the late Professor Oak as a starter Pokemon. Before all of this, they were already rare, now, the Pokemon in Red\u2019s Pokeball was the last of its kind. He has been raising it for years, and wads the only ray of sunshine in the young human\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Pokeball was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just give me a Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d</b> Lyra pouts, her arms crossed as she sits on the scrawny Pok\u00e9mon professor\u2019s chest, looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is it possible for a teenage girl to pin down a grown man with such ease? Well, that\u2019s simple: in this world, for some reason, the more fat or muscle you gain, the taller and stronger you become. Sure, Lyra isn\u2019t nearly as huge as her mother, who\u2019s a veritable mountain of a woman... but Lyra wasn\u2019t anything to sneeze at, either, being about 210 pounds at 5\u201911\u201d, giving her a somewhat curvy, jiggly form. She definitely has the genes to rock this size, with large but still perky breasts, a soft but toned little potbelly, and the part she\u2019s most proud of; her flawless, pear-shaped booty, which her shorts could barely contain. Her thick thighs straddle his torso, and her weight on his chest is making it quite difficult for Elm to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung lady, please, get off of me,\u201d Professor Elm groans beneath her. This certainly isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had to deal with her annoying nonsense, but as she was getting larger and larger over the years, she was getting more difficult to deal with. \u201cYou are being extremely childish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cChildish? YOU\u2019RE the one being childish!\u201d</b> She retorts, angrily. <b>\u201cYou have all these cool Pok\u00e9mon stuffed in this boring lab, and you can\u2019t even spare a single one for a gal in need?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have told you this a thousand times! You need to capture your OWN Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d The professor replies, his frustration obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHow am I supposed to capture a Pok\u00e9mon without a starter, dumbass?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI HAVE provided you with a starter Pok\u00e9mon. You ate it!\u201d He shivers as he remembered the fate of that poor Rattata...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, because it was a stupid Pok\u00e9mon. Seriously, a Rattata? Those things aren\u2019t good for anything more than a light snack!\u201d</b> She huffs, rolling her eyes. <b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not getting off of you until you give me a super rare, super strong, super adorable Pok\u00e9mon! I want to go on an adventure!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElm was about to retort again\u2026 but suddenly, he freezes. \u201cWait... YOU want to go on an adventure?\u201d Elm almost can\u2019t believe it. Most kids went off on an adventure the day they turned 10, but Lyra was a young woman at this point and yet she still lived with her mother, watching TV and eating junk food. Elm had been almost certain she didn\u2019t have the ambition to go off on her own, and was just going to freeload for her entire life. \u201cAre you saying that, if I give you a Pok\u00e9mon, you\u2019ll\u2026 leave New Bark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra considers it, scratching her chin. <b>\u201cUhh\u2026 sure. This town is super fuckin\u2019 boring, anyway,\u201d</b> she eventually decides. <b>\u201cI\u2019ve just been sticking around for the free food. But sure, I guess it could be fun to just wander around Johto.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d Elm asks, a big smile suddenly dawning on his face. If Lyra goes off on an adventure, the professor will never have to deal with her again! \u201cI would be, uh, happy to support your adventuring prospects! In fact, I have three very rare, very powerful Pok\u00e9mon for you to choose from!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra raises an eyebrow, incredulous. <b>\u201cReally? You\u2019re not just going to give me another Rattata, right?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all! These three are such rare Pok\u00e9mon, you\u2019ll never find them anywhere else!\u201d He insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers it. <b>\u201cAlright. Show me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d</b> she said, climbing off of the professor and standing up. Elm sits up, gasping for fresh air. <b>\u201cBut they better not be disappointing, or I\u2019ll be sitting on your face, next!\u201d</b> Elm shudders as he stands up, brushes himself off, and shakily walks over to a big, incubating machine. He clicks it open, and grabbed the three Pok\u00e9balls set inside. He had been telling the truth when he said these Pok\u00e9mon were EXTREMELY rare, but parting with one would be more than worth it to get this bitch out of his hair for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the three Pok\u00e9balls, and Lyra stares in awe as the Pok\u00e9mon within were released onto the table before her. Soon, a Chikorita, a Cyndaquil, and a Totodile are looking curiously at her. <b>\u201cOh. My. Arceus.\u201d</b> She gasps. <b>\u201cThese three are absolutely ADORABLE!\u201d</b> She suddenly wraps all three of them in her arms, crushing the air out of them as he hugs them tightly against her flabby gut, squealing in excitement. <b>\u201cI could just eat them up!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, p-please, don\u2019t.\u201d Elm nervously raises a finger. \u201cLike I said, they are very rare\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, dumbass,\u201d</b> she rolls her eyes, eventually dropping the now dizzy Pok\u00e9mon back onto the metallic table. Her chubby body jiggles as she leans over, examining each Pok\u00e9mon closely. The Chikorita was cute, but didn\u2019t look all that strong. The Cyndaquil looked really strong, but wasn\u2019t as cute as the other two. Meanwhile, the Totodile seemed to fit right in between \u2018cute\u2019 and \u2018powerful.\u2019 It was almost difficult to pick one!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dizzy Cyndaquil watched in terror and apprehension as the chubby human that squeezed the air out of his lungs before picked him up again. Lyra smiled at the cute Pokemon struggling in her pudgy hands. He wasn't as cute as the other two, but in the end, she decided on the strong one, only because it would win her more battles, and in turn more prize money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, lil\u2019 cutie~\u201d Lyra greeted the fidgety Pokemon. \u201cD\u2019ya know what day it is today? It's the best day of your damn life, that\u2019s what! From now on, you're gonna be my Pokemon, got it? Your gonna win me lots of money and get me out of this crap-sack town for good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, Lyra?\u201d Professor Elm interjected. \u201cMaybe don't swear so much in front of the Pokemon. It\u2019s still very young and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up, old man!\u201d Lyra snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my damn Pokemon any way I fucking please! It\u2019s not like it can speak English anyway,\u201d Lyra turned back to HER Cyndaquil, \u201cIsn't that right little guy~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor Pokemon curled up his body in Lyra\u2019s grip. He nodded quickly as his whole body shivered in fear. He actually did mind, but this women seemed so volatile and explosive that was he was afraid of bringing her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww~. Are you cold? You\u2019re shaking like crazy.\u201d Lyra cooed, mistaking her Pokemon\u2019s shivers of fear for shivers of chill. \u201cOh, I know where to put you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, Lyra suddenly brought the little Cyndaquil to her chest and plunged him in between the valley of her bouncy, perky cleavage. The frightened Pokemon struggled against his new trainer\u2019s vice grip, but the flesh around him was too firm for him to get a hold on. All he ended up doing was give Lyra a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...see! The bastard already loves me!\u201d Lyra moaned in pleasure as Cyndaquil continued to rub up against her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well!\u201d Professor Elm stuttered at the display he was watching. \u201cThat is a very unorthodox way of holding a Pokemon, but if he...l-likes it I can\u2019t complain.\u201d He made his way to the other side of his laboratory. \u201cIf you are done acquainting yourself with your new Pokemon, your Pokedex, badge case, and free complementary Pokeballs are waiting here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cyndaquil hidden away from the outside world, Lyra made her way towards her trainer supplies, with Elm watching in slight disgust as her boobs wobbled from the small Pokemon trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, old man, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be needing those silly Pokeballs.\u201d She said as she set the shrunken Pokeballs back down on the table. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need this either!\u201d Lyra picked up her Cyndaquil\u2019s Pokeball, and smashed it down at the base of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little Cyndaquil would never ever leave me, that is if he knows what good for him ~.\u201d Lyra explained cheerily, scaring the poor Pokemon in her breasts once again. Professor Elm watched the chubby trainer leave his Pokemon Laboratory with her Pokemon trapped inside her mammaries. He wondered how on Earth she thought she was going to catch any Pokemon without any Pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that Lyra wasn't planning on catching much Pokemon at all. At least, not in Pokeballs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, lil\u2019 guy! Were gonna see my mom before I go. You\u2019ll love her, she\u2019s just like me, but bigger!\u201d Lyra patted her breasts affectionately as she made her way to her house near the Laboratory. Lyra\u2019s description of her mother once gain sent shivers down his back. Bigger than her? She was already huge to him! And there were people bigger than her? He dreaded meeting this woman, but Lyra was ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lyra made her way to her childhood home. She walked through the front yard, opened the front door, and shouted at the top of her lungs, \u201cMOM! I'M HOME!\u201d So loud that Cyndaquil\u2019s eardrums rang even though her voice was muffled through breast fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house shook as Lyra\u2019s mother made her way out of the kitchen. Professor Elm was not exaggerating when he said that she was a mountain of a women. She was 9\u20197\u2019\u2019, her head almost scraping against the ceiling, and 845 lbs, four times as much as Lyra weighed. Since she rarely ever led the house except to get groceries, she was stark nude with her massive, yoga ball breasts wobbled two and fro atop her wrecking ball stomach. Lyra, however, was completely unfazed, having grown used to her mother\u2019s nudism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, sweetie!\u201d Lyra\u2019s mother opened her puffy arms wide, and Lyra happily ran up and jumped into her massive mother\u2019s embrace. Although she was notable smaller than her mother, the two were never fazed by the size difference between them. \u201cSo you got, your new Pokemon? Where is the lil\u2019 shit, let me see him!\u201d Lyra\u2019s mom asked impatiently. She was so excited that her darling baby was gonna go on a Pokemon journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure mom! Come on on out Cyndaquil!\u201d Lyra stopped hugging her mother for a moment to fish out the little Pokemon trapped in her breasts. Cyndaquil\u2019s world was full of bright light as he was brought out from the dark depths of his master\u2019s mammaries, only for his field of vision to clear up and show an even more massive women looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Arceus he' fucking adorable!\" Lyra's mother exclaimed as she set her comparisonly puny daughter down so she could hug her new Pokemon instead. Like before with Lyra, her hug squeezed out the air from his lungs, but this time, his whole body was squashed and smothered by the motherly figure's pale titflesh. He also learned where Lyra got her vocabulary.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The poor little Cyndaquil had always dreamed about the day he\u2019d be given to a trainer. He had expected to be given to one of the adorable, young aspiring trainers in town, so they could go on their Pok\u00e9mon adventure, growing up together and getting stronger over the years, beating gym leaders and maybe one day working up to the elite four! All his hopes were dashed from his mind, though, when he was picked up by what he assumed must\u2019ve been the biggest, foulest, most abhorrent young woman in the world. The day he\u2019s been dreaming about was turning out to be the worst day of his short life\u2026 and, as if just to rub salt into his wounds, now he\u2019s learning that there\u2019s another woman so huge and foul, she makes Lyra look like a professional athlete!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it into perspective, not only was the woman taller than a Zekrom, she was also almost FIFTY times heavier than him. He didn\u2019t even know humans could get this large! He was shivering in fear as the woman roughly manhandled him, worried she might just accidentally squish him with the slightest touch. This was the first time he\u2019s seen a human without their clothes on, and it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. Her massive, flabby rolls jiggled with her every movement, and the Cyndaquil felt smothered as he was pressed up against her huge, saggy tits. Eventually, the mountainous woman hands him back to Lyra. Lyra stuffs him back in her cleavage, but this time she let's his head poke out from between her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t let my precious little fatass go off on an adventure on an empty stomach!\u201d The larger woman smiled before walking deeper into the house, wagging a finger to gesture Lyra to follow. \u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon. I just stocked the pantry, so you can just eat all you want, sweetie!\u201d The Cyndaquil's eyes widened when he laid eyes on the \u2018pantry\u2019. This room was huge! It probably took up about a third of the house! Everywhere he looked, there was thousands of snacks, junk food, and other assorted meals lining countless shelves. The only food items they seemed to lack was fruit, vegetables, or anything else remotely healthy. How did they even afford all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon strolling in, Lyra was like a kid in a candy shop. She immediately filled her big, chubby arms with as much junk food as she could carry, walking to the dining room, cooking some of it instantly in their seemingly magical oven, before dumping it on the table and going back for more. By the time she sat down to eat, her \u2018feast\u2019 looked like it was over 20,000 calories total! The Cyndaquil felt like he was getting bad cholesterol just looking at it! She wasn\u2019t really planning on eating all this at once, was she? She certainly didn\u2019t seem daunted by the size of her meal, instead just licking her lips as she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cyndaquil watched in awe and horror as she started devouring her feast at a seemingly impossible speed! She was capable of easing swallowing an entire hamburger in a single gulp, and tearing through over a half dozen donuts in a matter of seconds. She was stuffing her face full like a pig, bits of food dirtying her face as she sloppily devoured her meals. It was a disgusting display, but it was like a car accident; Cyndaquil just couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cSo what are you going to name this lil\u2019 guy?\u201d Lyra\u2019s mother asked, glancing down at the little fire-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHm?\u201d</b> She said, pausing chomping down on a slice of pizza to glance up at the huge woman. <b>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were supposed to give these things names.\u201d</b> It occurred to her that she didn\u2019t really know much about Pok\u00e9mon, other than the fact that they tasted good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you have to give him a name! He\u2019s your first Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d She insists with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be sentimental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</b> She taps her chin, looking down at the nervous little Cyndaquil. She decided to just name him the first thing that came to mind when he looked at him. <b>\u201cHow about\u2026 Snack? Do you like that name, lil\u2019 guy?\u201d</b> The Cyndaquil quickly shook its head 'no'. <b>\u201cWell, too bad! Your name\u2019s Snack now, pal!\u201d</b> She laughed an obnoxious, hyena-like cackle, as if she had just told the funniest joke of all time, before returning to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, she had already eating enough to stuff any normal person to the brim, and yet she was still going, undeterred. Eventually, she had completely cleared the table, leaving nothing but crumbs. Unleashing a thunderous burp, she leaned back in her chair, contentedly patting her big, round, full gut. Snack glanced down, seeing that her belly was now even bigger than he was! He shivered when he realized he could hear her belly gurgle and churn as it quickly processed the food inside. Now that she was full, she stood up from her chair, her round belly bouncing slightly at she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was standing at the front door, her purse slung over her shoulder as she was ready to take on the world. Her mother stood there, a sentimental smile on her face. \u201cSo\u2026 guess this is it, then. You ready to head out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYup!\u201d</b> Lyra smiled, before teasing her. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to finally get out of this dump.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? My household is a dump, huh?\u201d Her mother smirked. \u201cCome to think of it, shouldn\u2019t you have gone on a Pok\u00e9mon adventure when you were ten? Yet eight years later and you\u2019ve still been bumming around on the couch like some freeloading fatass, taking advantage of the kindness of your dear old mother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, fuck you!\u201d</b> Lyra shouted, and Snack's eyes widened as Lyra gave her own mother the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you too, you little brat!\u201d Her mother retorted, flipping her the bird right back. They were quiet for a moment, and Snack was worried they\u2019d get into a fight or something. However, instead, they both burst out laughing! Apparently, this was all just a game to them. Lyra\u2019s mother hugged her daughter close again, planting a big, slobbery kiss on her cheek. \u201cLove you, sweetheart! Have fun on your adventure! Stay safe out there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI love you too, mom,\u201d</b> she smiled, wrapping her arms around her mother\u2019s huge neck and hugging her back. Eventually, Lyra set off, hearing her mother slam the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood at the exit of the town she\u2019s lived in all her life, she looked back and hesitated. Did she have any other unfinished business here, by any chance? Who knew how long it\u2019d be be before she ever came back? Hmm\u2026 well, she didn\u2019t really know anyone here except her mother and the professor, and she\u2019d already dealt with them both. Most people seemed to avoid her, except\u2026 aha! Come to think of it, she did know this one kid named Ethan. He was an annoying little wannabe trainer, and she was tempted to go to his house and rub it in his face that her new Pok\u00e9mon was way cooler than his lame little Marill. Maybe she could even drag him along on her adventure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>New Bark Town was not a city of many sights, yet it was known throughout the Johto Region for being the least populated settlement in the area. There was literally only a population of under a hundred in the small, quiet hamlet. And besides being the home of the national Pokemon Laboratory, that was it. That was all the town had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the towns minuscule populace, there was a record only two kids in the town: Lyra, and a small, nine year old boy called Ethan, coming up on ten. Like most kids in the world, he wants to become a Pokemon Trainer, eager to go out with his trusty Marill into a brave new world of adventure. Unlike Lyra, He shows a lot of sympathy towards Pok\u00e9mon, usually helping and befriending them, which is how he caught his Marill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra hated the little brat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she loved bullying him. The small child was an easy target, gullible and naive. Ethan used to have two Pokemon, a cute little Furret he got from his late father as a birthday gift. She dropped it into her cavernous maw when he refused to give her his bag lunch. The way he just stood there mortified and than went screaming all the way back home\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Sigh\u2019, good times\u2026\u201d Lyra reminisced as she rubbed her gut, still digesting her huge feast from before. Her body was quick to absorb the calories from the massive meal and turn it into more pudge on her frame. It won\u2019t be long until an extra five pounds were added to her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lyra snapped out of her daydream and started to trot to one of the only other house in town, Ethan\u2019s. Besides her mom, Ethan was the only the only thing that would keep her coming back to New Bark. She wanted to be rid of this town for good, but he was just to fun to laugh at to leave forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnack!\u201d Lyra addressed the Pokemon wedged in her breasts. \u201cYou and I are gonna get ourselves a travelling buddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra violently swung open the gate to the Gold Household, a well decorated little house with flowering plants running up the side of the walls. Snack peered over the top of his trainer\u2019s titflesh to enjoy the view, but Lyra was pushed him roughly back down as she pounded on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan? Could you get that, please?\u201d An older woman's voice rang throughout the house inside. \u201cI think I have a headache\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Mom!\u201d An enthusiastic, young boy\u2019s voice answered in response. Lyra smirked as she heard the pitter patter of sneakers rushing down the stairs. The door opened to reveal Ethan Gold, wearing his trademark red jacket and cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly smile that was on Ethan\u2019s face melted away as he saw Lyra, the town bully, outside of the doorway. Nevertheless, he tried to keep up a smile and a welcoming persona towards her, like his father had taught him. \u201cH-hey Lyra, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Up, little shit, is this!\u201d Lyra pulled Snack out from between her breasts and held him in front of the little kid\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own Pokemon now, because I\u2019m finally leaving this Arceus forsaken town and go on my Pokemon Journey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny you\u2019re coming with me!\u201d Lyra pointed a fat finger at Ethan. The nine year old stood there for a moment, slowly coming to terms with what was just said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gave an exaggerated sigh and plopped Snack back in his \u2018home\u2019. \u201cArceus, do I have to spell it out to ya? You and I are gonna go on my Pokemon Journey, right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...Mom?!\u201d Ethan yelled back into the house, nervous if Lyra was actually being serious or not. \u201cLyra is here and she says-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, honey. Mommy\u2019s trying to sleep\u2026\u201d Was the response he got. He turned back to Lyra, who was eyeing the boy hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you heard her. NOW MOVE YOUR ASS!\u201d Lyra grabbed Ethan\u2019s arm and practically tore it out of his socket as she dragged him away from his home with speed you would not expect from someone her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynda-quil?\u201d Snack cried as the tight blubber around him suddenly began to shake and up and down violently as Lyra ran. He gripped the sides of her breasts as she began to sweat, making the surface around him slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra! Please. Stop!\u201d Ethan begged as he struggled to keep pace with the larger girl. \u201cI'm not ready to go on a Pokemon Journey! I\u2019m nine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m eighteen!\u201d Lyra shot back as they passed the laboratory. \u201cBut that\u2019s not stopping me. Is it!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Elm form inside his workplace briefly heard little Ethan from two houses down outside. He chuckled \u201cLittle scamp must be having a ball out there. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s having fun, and even more that the town bitch is gone.\u201d He took a casual sip from his cup of tea. \u201cHe\u2019ll be much more happy now that she\u2019s gone from his life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOww! Lyra stop pulling my arm it hurts!\u201d Ethan whined as Lyra dragged him from the only place he has ever known. They had made it pass the town\u2019s border, and were officially on the Pokemon Route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck it up! Come on, isn't this what you wanted? To go on a Pokemon Journey and make friends with all the Pokemon and all that stupid crap?\u201d Lyra said as she finally slowed down for the child behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but now with some meanie like you!\u201d Ethan said, finally pulling his arm away from her grip. \u201cYou eat Pokemon! You make fun of and you go out of your way to hurt others! There's no way I\u2019m going with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, for once, was actually caught off guard by Ethan\u2019s retort. She stood silent, stunned at the boy talking back to her. Snack peeked out from his trainer's chest and smiled. Maybe this was what she needed. Maybe she just needed someone to take a stand to her behavior for her to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you just say to me you little bitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stomped towards Ethan as he realized as he realized that he was in for a world of hurt. \u201cW-wait, Lyra! Let me explain! I didn't mean-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s pleas for mercy were cut off as Lyra bumped her heavy stomach into his torso, sending him to the ground with a thud. He rubbed his eyes as the dust around picked up from the impact, but when he opened the, all eh could see was Lyra\u2019s jean shorts hovering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan, Ethan, Ethan\u2026\u201d Lyra feigned disappointment. \u201cThat is no way to talk to your travelling buddy. It appears that your gonna have to learn your lesson the hard way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his mouth could even open to protest, Ethan\u2019s head was buried under Lyra\u2019s well endowed backside as the chubby trainer sat on his face. He struggled under her and attempted to push her off, but her weight was too much for his frail body to handle. He kicked and flailed his legs, but only ended up giving Lyra a massage, well needed after the feast she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, yeah keep doing that twerp. I might just forgive ya if you can last two minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this rate, he might actually run out of air down there before the 2 minutes were up. That thought was absolutely hilarious to her! Lyra had never actually killed anyone before, though she would certainly have zero compunctions about doing so someday. Hell, she licked her lips as she fantasized about the day she was big enough to be able to swallow brats this size whole, just like her mother could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted from that thought by a little blue figure approaching from down the route. She looked out and squinted, only to realize it was Ethan\u2019s marill, a pissed-off look on its face as it ran towards them as fast its little legs could carry it. She laughed at the sight.  <b>\u201cHey, look. If it isn\u2019t your little-\u201d</b> Before she could finish that sentence, the marill leaped through the air towards her, flipping around in mid-air and smacking her across the cheek with its tail!

What the fuck?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marill kept badgering her, each of its attacks feeling like getting punched by a tiny fist. <b>\u201cOw! Ow! Ow! Get away from me!\u201d</b> She tried to grab the marill, but it was too small, and moved too fast for the chubby woman to keep up. <b>\u201cEthan!

Damn it!\u201d</b> Suddenly, she remembered that she had a Pok\u00e9mon, too. <b>\u201cSnack, what are you waiting for? Get out there and get that thing!\u201d</b> The little Cyndaquil in between her tits had been disoriented by all the movement, but at her command, she jumped out and faced the marill, fearing being punished himself if he disobeyed. What followed was quite possibly the lamest Pok\u00e9mon battle ever. They were both only level 5, so they could only use Tackle on each other over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Snack won, being slightly faster and stronger than the marill was. With a whimper, the water-type collapsed onto the ground, bruised and incapacitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">Snack grew to LV. 6!</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snarl, Lyra walked over and lifted the whimpering marill up in the air. <b>\u201cAlways hated this fuckin\u2019 thing. Lamest Pok\u00e9mon ever,\u201d</b> she said. <b>\u201cI know how to put it to good use, though\u2026\u201d</b> She was already sort of full\u2026 but she had a point to make. So, Ethan and Snack could only watch in horror as Lyra lifted the marill up over her big, waiting mouth\u2026 and dropped it inside! Only its tail was sticking out, which she happily slurped up like a noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marill disappeared between Lyra\u2019s lips easily; all that was left was to gulp the small Pok\u00e9mon down her throat. Just as she was about to do so, though, Ethan jumped up and ran at her, shoving his hands in her mouth! \u201cNooooo!\u201d He cried, grabbing it by the tail and trying to pull the marill free. Lyra grimaced, but continued swallowing the marill, pulling the boy\u2019s hands down into her throat with it. He was whimpering, hanging on to the marill for dear life, even as his arms were pulled shoulder-deep into Lyra\u2019s throat. He couldn\u2019t compete with the strength of her throat\u2019s muscles, and Ethan eventually lost his grip on the Pok\u00e9mon, feeling the marill sink deeper. \u201cMarilll!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the marill had been fully sent to her belly, Lyra pushed Ethan back, tugging his arms from her throat and knocking him to the ground. There, he curled up in a ball, sobbing and bemoaning the fate of his currently digesting Pok\u00e9mon. She let out a belch as she patted her round, gurgling belly, feeling even fuller than before. <b>\u201cI warned you to call of your Pok\u00e9mon, twerp! Damn thing just almost knocked a tooth out\u2026\u201d</b> She cackled. <b>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, crybaby. It was just a Pok\u00e9mon. Not even a good one. We can just get you another one.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Ethan just lied there, crying and refusing to move. He was reacting as if his whole life had just been destroyed right in front of him. <b>\u201cOh, Arceus. Seriously? I was nice enough to bring you along on my first adventure, and this is how you repay me? How selfish\u2026\u201d</b> She called Snack to come nestle up in her cleavage again as she waited for Ethan to get up. Eventually, though, she grew impatient. <b>\u201cUgh! C\u2019mon, crybaby. I\u2019m not going to wait around here all day.\u201d</b> With that, she straight-up picked the boy up in her arms, and continued down the route. She rolled her eyes as Ethan\u2019s tears wet her overalls. <b>\u201cUgh. Crybaby.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the route to Cherrygrove city well. Her mother used to send her down here sometimes to get groceries, as there weren\u2019t any stores in New Bark. Eventually, Ethan had calmed down a bit, so she set him down and let him follow along after her. He was silent for the rest of the trip, staring at the ground as he walked, his eyes red. <b>\u201cMm, mm! Your little pet\u2019s really wriggling in there!\u201d</b> She taunted him, patting her belly and enjoying the struggles of the marill inside. With a sob, he clasped his hands over his ears, determined not to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they made it to the entrance of Cherrygrove city. By now, the marill has stopped moving, becoming indistinguishable from all the other digesting piles of meat in Lyra\u2019s belly. As they approach the town, Lyra spots an old man standing by the entrance, who seems to be staring shamelessly as her tits and belly. <b>\u201cWhat are you looking at, you old pervert?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed a little taken aback, but smiles as he steps forward forward. \u201cMy apologies, young lady. You simply reminded me of my dear, departed wife,\u201d he says, staring longingly at Lyra\u2019s round belly. \u201cShe was over a thousand pounds, you know, and taller than most of the buildings in Cherrygrove. Arceus, how I miss her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUm, okay, weirdo,\u201d</b> Lyra growls. <b>\u201cCan you get out of my way, please?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, actually\u2026 I am here to provide tours of the town to rookie trainers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are rookie trainers, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances over at Ethan. He was still miserable, but apparently, the old man didn\u2019t have good enough vision to notice his tears. <b>\u201cUh, yep. Just takin\u2019 my brother here along on our first Pok\u00e9mon adventure. Isn\u2019t that right, bro?\u201d</b> She smiled, quickly coming up with a lie, and wrapping her arm around Ethan\u2019s shoulder. <b>\u201cBut we don\u2019t need no damn tour. Just point us to the hotel around here, and we\u2019ll be set.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there\u2026 are no hotels in Cherrygrove,\u201d the old man explains. \u201cMost trainers set up camp outside of town for the nights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCamping? Fuck that!\u201d</b> She groans. She can\u2019t go camping! She needs a proper bed to sleep in. <b>\u201cThere has to be somewhere to stay in this dump\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man is quiet for a moment. \u201c... well, I do have an open guest room available,\u201d he offers, \u201cbut only to those who take my tour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at him, incredulous, before rolling her eyes with a sigh. <b>\u201cUgh. Fine, old man. Give us your damn tour\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows was probably the most boring tour of all time. Not only did he spout out a bunch of shit she already knew, he constantly looked for opportunities to ogle her chubby form. Eventually, though, they made it to his humble house. \u201cCome in, come in! Make yourself at home!\u201d He said, gesturing them in. He hadn\u2019t been lying about his wife; the doorway and the furniture was all absolutely huge, obviously made for a woman twice Lyra\u2019s size, and the ceiling was 11 feet up. The bed in the guest bedroom was more her size, though. \u201cOh! One more thing. My wife would\u2019ve wanted you to have these\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra raised a brow as he handed her a big pair of shoes. <b>\u201cUh\u2026 what are these?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRunning shoes! They\u2019re useful if you\u2019re planning on gaining weight. With them on, no matter how big you get, you\u2019ll still be able to run just as quickly, without getting tired!\u201d He happily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 thanks,\u201d</b> she said, before gesturing from him to go away. Ethan went over and crashed on the bed, obviously too miserable to want to go anywhere the rest of the day. Lyra glanced out the window, seeing it was about 7 pm. The sun would be setting in an hour, and she didn\u2019t want to be out on the routes after dark. Still, maybe she could get some training in before she goes to bed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Lyra heard the old man calling her from another part of the house. \u201cExcuse me, young lady!?\u201d He cried. \u201cCould you please come in here for a moment?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra rolled her eyes and gave a long sigh. She reluctantly followed the sound of the old man;s voice and came upon the room he was in: the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I did not sign up for this when I took your lame ass tour, old perv!\u201d Lyra called down as she stomped down the stairs. \u201cWhatever you want better be...worth...it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra stopped in the middle of her sentence as she came to the bottom of the stairwell, staring at the contents of the basement. Snack, still riding along in his master\u2019s cleavage, dropped his jaw at the sight of what lies underneath the old man\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA HUMONGOUS Pantry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra felt like she had died and gone into food heaven as she slowly walked through the basement. It was wider than the house above was, and filled to the brim with literally all kinds of foods. Canned goods, dry food, packaged meals, snacks, candy bars! The old man was not kidding when he said his wife towered over Cherrygrove; A Snorlax couldn't finish half of what was inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, isn't it?\u201d The old man suddenly appeared behind Lyra, who gave a yelp of surprise and a smack against the old man\u2019s face in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry\u2026\u201d The old man apologized. \u201cAnyway, i called you down here for something important. This may sound silly, but I actually have a business trip in Goldenrod City to attend to, And I was on my way to lock up the house when the two of you arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Lyra shouted. \u201cNuh uh! No way are you kicking us out just because your memory is shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, young lady.\u201d The old man raised his arms in defense casually. \u201cI'm not kicking you out. Quite the contrary, I\u2019m letting you stay here while I\u2018m gone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s rage had subsided, and was soon replaced with shock and surprise. She took another look around the basement, making sure the food was till they're and not some hallucination her mind brewed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you mean\u2026\u201d Lyra started off carefully. \u201cALL of this food\u2026?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s for you, your brother and your Pokemon.\u201d The old man grinned. Lyra was a little bit put off when he included Ethan and Snack, but that didn't stop her from giving the perverted old man a bear hug that squeezed the air out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Arceus, yes!\u201d Lyra hopped on her two feet, giving the old man a good view of her bouncing, shiny cleavage. He gave a dirty smile, believing that this and this alone would make up for a sizable dent in his food supply when he came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, Ethan, and Snack watch the old man leave the house, and than soon Cherrygrove City. Lyra gave a triumphant grin and slammed the door shut, happy to be rid of the old perv. She took a look at Ethan, still silent and miserable, but not as much as he was before. He just moped around the living room without making a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra frowned at the little twerp attitude. She finally decided that enough was enough and walked up to Ethan with a snarl. \u201cAlright ya little brat, listen to me. You being down in the dumps is making me annoyed as hell, so stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone\u2026\u201d Ethan mumbled under his breath, still torn up over the death of his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, is this still about your wimpy little Marill?\u201d Lyra put her hands on her wide hips. \u201cCome on, It was just a Pokemon! You can just get another one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there won\u2019t ever be \u2018another one\u2019!\u201d Ethan clenched his fists and raised his head definitely at Lyra. \u201cThere's never gonna be another Pokemon like my Marill!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my Arceus you are so pretentious\u2026\u201d Lyra moaned. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you skinny Mom and dead Dad didn't give you \u2018the talk\u2019 yet, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...talk?\u201d Ethan echoed, not understanding what Lyra was getting at. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gave an evil smirk at the poor boy. \u201cOhoho! This is gonna be fun.\u201d She grabbed Ethan by his arm and sat him down on the couch. She than proceeded to sit down next to him, her weight making the furniture creak, her flabby thigh spilling into his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Snack, you\u2019ll want to be sitting down too.\u201d Lyra fished her Cyndaquil out from her breasts and sat him down next to her and Ethan. The poor Pokemon was squished between the little boy\u2019s knee and his master\u2019s bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever think about where meat comes from, brat?\u201d Lyra asked with a smug smile on her face. Ethan widened his eyes and shook his head. He had always thought that meat just...came from the store like everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt comes from Pokemon, dumbass.\u201d Lyra rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? No they don\u2019t!\u201d Ethan crossed his arms across his chest stubbornly. There was no way that was true. Lyra was just lying to him to see if he would get a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for the love of\u2026\u201d Lyra grabbed a frozen burger patty packet from her pocket, who had taken it from the pantry downstairs in plans to microwave it for a short snack. \u201cRead this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grimaced, but slowly took the frozen patty packet from Lyra\u2019s pudgy hand. He began to read the writing on the plastic casing. He stopped, however, when he came across a sentence that shook him to his very core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c100%...T-t-tauros meat!?\u201d Ethan gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Lyra smiled. \u201cAnd the eggs that your Mom buys at the store to make you breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ethan wailed. \u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d He closed his eyes and shut them hard, not wanting to cry in front of Lyra, who would only make fun of him for it. Snack felt sorry for the nine year old Ethan. He went through as similar kind of reaction when he found out as well, and knew exactly what was going on in his head. With a grunt, he popped out from between the tight space he was in, and climbed up onto Ethan\u2019s lap to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, brat-...\u2019sigh\u2019, Ethan.\u201d Lyra sighed. \u201cAs much fun it is to see you like this, just...just look down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan reluctant parted his moist eyelids, and was greeted to the sight of Lyra\u2019s Pokemon hugging his abdomen, trying to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnack still likes you even though you eat Pokemon. He\u2019s dumb as shit, but he knows that you eat Pokemon, and he\u2019s still hugging you.\u201d Lyra offered, being almost kind to the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone eats Pokemon, Ethan. We need meat to live, right? I eat meat, Professor Elm eats meat, your mom eats meat, YOU eat meat. Hell, if we didn't eat Pokemon, than they will! It\u2019s not all daffodils and roses out in the real world kid. But that doesn't mean your a bad guy. Your just hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lyra finished her speech, Ethan and Snack were looking up at her in shock. Did she really just say that? Ethan didn't think she had the capacity to say anything more than taunts and insults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I\u2019m still mad at you for taking me from my home and eating Marill.\u201d He reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra shrugged her shoulders. \u201cFair enough. But what can I say, a gal gets hungry~.\u201d She smacked her belly affectionately, watching how it jiggled for a few seconds afterwards. \u201cBut can we at leasts say that we tolerate each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan closed his eyes and held Snack tight. Lyra was far, FAR away from ever being considered her friend. But he would be lying if he said that he hadn't learned something important from her. If she hadn't basically kidnapped him and drag him across to Cherrygrove, he would have still have Marill, but also not get such a life shaking revelation. His mom was...a frail thing, she would have never told him. Maybe Arceus had a plan in store for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ethan finally relented with a small smile. \u201cWere surviving together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Lyra smacked Ethan on his back, making him double over, forcing Snack to hop off from his lap. She definitely did not know her own strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Ethan moaned as he rubbed his back. \u201cWhat now?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra was quite a bit pudgier than most. Hell, she was the second largest person back in New Bark Town, rivaled only by her own mother. Still, she\u2019s always wanted to be even bigger; to a be a true mountain of a woman, just like her mother was! She shuddered, exciting by the thought of towering over people to such an extent. Unfortunately, her mother refused to let her eat as much food as she wanted until she started helping pay for the groceries, and she was far too lazy to get any sort of job, so for the past few years, her weight has constantly hovered at around 200 pounds. But no more! She was striking out on her own, now, and she was dedicated to being the biggest and best she could be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left Ethan alone for now, heading down into the basement and grabbing more big armfuls of food. After metabolizing her huge feast during her trek down the route here, her belly had shrunken to about half the size, so there was definitely room to fit more stuff in there before calling it a day. She shoves it all into one of those weird magical ovens, cooking it to perfection instantly. She licked her lips in anticipation as she spread it out on the table. This meal would only be half of the size of her lunch, but it would still be enough to stuff her again. <b>\u201cHey, runt! It\u2019s dinner time!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan walked out, only to stare in awe at the dining  room table. On Lyra\u2019s side, there was an assortment of every kind of food he could imagine, emanating the perfect mix of delicious smells that could make anybody\u2019s mouth water. On his side\u2026 there was a single bowl of mac and cheese. He sighed, wishing more than ever that he was back home with his mother, though he didn\u2019t have the energy to defy Lyra again tonight. \u201cUh\u2026 thanks, Lyra,\u201d he said, sitting down across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started slowly taking bites of his \u2018dinner\u2019... but soon, though, he was distracted by the sight of Lyra chowing down! He glanced up just in time to see her shove an entire donut down her throat, before reaching for another. He was instantly almost memorized by how quickly she tore through her buffet-sized feast. It was like a car accident; he just couldn\u2019t look away. One by one, food disappears easily down her stretchy throat, and she hardly even takes the time to swallow one thing before eagerly stuffing another thing in her mouth. He stared in awe as he realized he could visibly see her belly getting bigger and rounder with every passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only fifteen minutes, it was all gone. She leaned back in her chair and unleashed a loud, triumphant belch, having easily devoured a feast fit for ten people. Her belly was back to its maximum size again, and she patted and rubbed it while it got to work on digesting her meal. <b>\u201cMmm, mmm! That was damn good!\u201d</b> She sighed in relaxation, before opening her eyes and glancing at the boy. <b>\u201cHm? You didn\u2019t even try a bite? Your dinner\u2019s probably cold by now\u2026\u201d</b> As if woken from a trance, he looked down, only to realize she was right. Looks like he was going to bed hungry tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra watched television for another half hour, toying with and rubbing her gut as she laughed at stupid game shows. Eventually, though, she decided to call it a day. They only had one bed, so Ethan ended up getting cuddled like a teddy bear by the massive, slumbering young woman. It was a little weird, but he had to admit, her warm, plush, pillowy body was actually quite comfortable. Besides, even in her sleep, her grip was like a vice, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019d be any way for him to escape anyway. With that, he just gave up, falling asleep to the noise of Lyra\u2019s belly gurgling as it processed her meal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Lyra woke and giggled at the sight of Ethan sleeping peacefully in her arms. She gently let him go and snuck out of the room, immediately heading to the scale to see her new weight. Her height increased to 6 feet and her BMI increased by 0.5, meaning she had gained about 10 pounds. She was practically jumping up and down with excitement! Two inches in one day? At this rate, she\u2019d be 7\u2019 in no time at all! Of course, once you\u2019re over 7 feet tall, getting any bigger became exponentially more and more difficult. In order to gain weight at this rate, she needed to completely stuff her belly; thus, when she gets bigger and her belly\u2019s capacity increases, she wonders how she\u2019ll find enough food to fill it up. She\u2019ll cross that bridge when she comes to it, though. All she wanted to focus on now was getting to that 7 foot benchmark\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that thought, she has a surprisingly light breakfast. She didn\u2019t want to spoil her appetite, after all, in anticipation for what she had planned. She roused Snack from her slumber. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon, Snack. It\u2019s time to finally start trainin\u2019 ya!\u201d</b> She smiled, lifting the sleepy Cyndaquil up and stuffing him partway into her cleavage again. She left Ethan to get some rest as she walked down to Route 30, eager to explore the new route for the first time. She had a bit of a decision to make, though. At first, she figured she\u2019d just devour every single Pokemon she defeated\u2026 but maybe, before she started filling her belly, she should try to catch one? It\u2019d be nice to have a second little snack around, and it'd be nice to have a well-rounded team for the trials to come. She could also find a new Pokemon for Ethan, to replace that lame marill he had. Not to be nice or anything! Just so the little brat would stop moping all the time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra finally came to the conclusion that without any Pokemon, Ethan technically couldn't qualify as a Pokemon Trainer. And if he wasn't a Trainer, than he wasn't on his journey. And if he wasn't on his journey...people will start to question why he\u2019s hanging around her. As little as Pokemon training she does know, she is aware that, unless you are a trainer, you can\u2019t travel the region, even accompanied by someone else. It\u2019s considered too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, if Ethan had a Pokemon, she essentially had two Snacks to send off into battles for prize money and food! Sure, technically it would be his, but Lyra has so much control over the boy it might as well be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Lyra patted Snack on the head and set out into the tall grass, on the hunt for a strong, rare, and cute Pokemon to catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was about as much strong, rare, and cute Pokemon in Route 30 as there was humans in New Bark Town. Yes, the Johto path was teeming with Pokemon wildlife, but they were all so...terrible. Rattata, Caterpie, Pidgey, none of them were worthy enough to be Ethan\u2019s Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, all the Pokemon that Lyra deemed weak and or just stupid looking, was mainly used as a means for Snack to gain more experience, making him stronger, and than, after they faint, are sent into Lyra\u2019s awaiting maw, making her stomach rounder. By the first hour in of this grinding technique, Snack had leveled up to LV. 10, and Lyra\u2019s belly was as back at maximum capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra took the time to take a break, tired from watching Snack fight all those Pokemon for her and than eating the same Pokemon later. She sat down at the base of a tree and leaned back, sighing. It didn't look like there was any rare Pokemon on Route 30 at all, just the run of the mill shit you find rummaging through your garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this morning hasn't been a total loss\u2026\u201d Lyra lamented as she gave her body a once over. Right now, her stomach was bulging with the struggling Pokemon inside. She bit her lip as they punched her stomach wall. It was probably some poor Rattata trying to inflict some damage on her, but all it amounted to was an internal massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra shifted her focus from her massive belly to other parts of her body. All she could soon think about was how soon the struggling Pokemon inside her stomach would be nothing but goop and meat, ready to be processed into more fat to add onto her body. She cupped her breasts and fantasized how much they would soon grow. Sure, compared to her mother she was practically flat chested, but what would she look like by the end of her journey? Her boobs could be the size of her own house...or even bigger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack hopped up on the top of Lyra\u2019s curvy buttocks, distracting her attention from her chest to her ample backside. She smiled as the tiny Cyndaquil tried to stand on top of his master\u2019s butt flesh, only to slip and fall back down on his feet. She briefly wondered if he would like to be stuffed inside her butcheeks for a change, rather than her boobs. She kept herself clean enough, and Snack seems content resting there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lyra saw something out of the corner of her eye. It was a Pokemon, about ten feet away, picking berries from a nearby bush, not noticing the massive human who had about a dozen of it\u2019s brethren inside her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra leaned forward, squinting a little bit to get a closer view of the Pokemon blissfully eating away, only to find the Pokemon that she had spent so much time looking for! It was a orange, weasel-sea otter fusion with a yellow collar around his neck that resembled a swimming ring you would wear to keep from drowning. It had cream colored spots above each eye along with two blue fins on his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was without a doubt rare, Lyra wondered if it was even from a different region all together. It was cute, so cute it gave the Chikorita back at the Laboratory a run for its money. But was it strong\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnack! Get off your lazy ass as go beat up that adorable Pokemon!\u201d Lyra slapped her booty, shaking the fire type off of her rear end. Snack grunted and reluctantly ran up to the orange Pokemon picking fruit. He had been battling Pokemon all morning, and yes, he was much stronger, but he was just so tired and out of breath. He was hoping he would have some more time for rest, but apparently Lyra had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack stopped running up to the Pokemon and got into an aggressive stance, signalling that the battle has started. However, the Pokemon was totally oblivious to the Cyndaquil, still munching on some well deserved breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack sighed and got out of his aggressive stance and simply slapped a berry out of the Pokemon\u2019s paw. The rare Pokemon looked askance at his barren paw and turned to Snack with a frown on his face. In an instant, a Water Gun was flared from his mouth, directly aimed at Snack. Being a fire-type and already on HP, Snack took a one hit knockout and was sent into the air by the force of the attack, and down right back into Lyra\u2019s bouncy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...huh.\u201d Lyra noted, genuinely impressed. \u201cStrong AND a good aim. Welp, I\u2019ve decided, you're gonna be my brat\u2019s Pokemon.\u201d She sat up and began to walk over to the Pokemon in the hopes of catching it. Of course, she didn't have any Pokeballs to capture it with, and it wasn't weakened in the slightest. But Lyra had thought up of another way of catching Pokemon alive\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the small Pokemon was caught in the massive human\u2019s shadow, her form looming over him intimately. The rare Pokemon looked up and blinked at the big creature, before smiling and waiving it\u2019s cute little paw at her. \u201cBui~. Buizel!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s what it\u2019s name was, a Buizel. Definitely not one with Lyra had ever heard before. But that did not  matter now. What mattered was getting ii back to the old man\u2019s house in Cherrygrove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Usually, she just took what she wanted through sheer brute force, but she was going to have to adjust her tactics for this one. She knew from getting slapped by that marill that Pok\u00e9mon attacks, regardless of how weak they were, could hurt. She still had the bruises! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike that marill, though, this buizel didn\u2019t seem all that eager to attack her. In fact, he seemed downright friendly! She guesses he doesn\u2019t notice the occasional imprints of small pawprints bulging against the side of her gut, as over a dozen tiny Pok\u00e9mon squirm within. A buizel this stupid should be very easy to trick! Maybe she could try acting\u2026 nice, for a change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mustered a warm, friendly smile, as she bent over to face the little buizel. <b>\u201cAww! Hey there, little guy! Well, aren\u2019t you just the cutest thing I ever did see?\u201d</b> She said, slowly and gently reaching a hand forward to pat the buizel on the head, causing the buizel to cutely giggle. <b>\u201cOh, did that mean little cyndaquil bully you? Oh, you poor thing!\u201d</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her chubby hand to scratch the side of its neck, and it let out a little purr, closing its eyes and leanings its head into her hands. It seemed to enjoy her company, obviously not suspecting a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, it really liked having the fur of its neck around that little ring scratched. It must be uncomfortable to have that thing wrapped around its neck all the time. Soon, she had it wrapped around her finger, to the point that it started whimpering when she pulled her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou know, I have a surprise I wanted to give to a very special Pok\u00e9mon, just like you!\u201d</b> The buizel tilted its head for a moment, confused, but then started jumping up and down in excitement. <b>\u201cGo on, close your eyes. Don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise, do you? No peeking!\u201d</b> She giggled and wagged a finger, and the buizel relented, cutely covering its eyes with its paws while shivering with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug smirk, she turned around and bent over. At the same time, the buizel is unable to take the suspense anymore, and peeks through its paws\u2026 only to be confused by the sight of Lyra\u2019s massive booty looming over it! Before it could react, she leaped up into the air, and landed right on-top of the buizel full-force, smashing it against the ground with her butt! The young woman was over three times heavier than the little buizel, and she slammed all that weight down on it at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sadistic laugh as she ground her butt down on the helpless buizel, before lifting herself again to survey the damage. The buizel definitely seemed to be stunned, but she could tell it was down but not out. With a snort, she turned around, and slammed her butt down on the buizel again! She squished the buizel with her booty over and over again until it was half-conscious, with little spirals for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra cackled triumphantly, lifting the limp buizel up into the air by the scruff of its neck. What did she even need Snack for, when Pok\u00e9mon were already this easy for her to catch? Now all she needed to do was think of a fun way to transport the buizel back to town\u2026 and she thinks she has a few ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack sure seemed to think her booty was comfy\u2026 so maybe it\u2019d be the perfect place for the buizel to \u2018rest\u2019 a while. She was free-buffing like always, so when she pulled the back of her tight jean shorts down, the full might and splendor of her big, jiggling booty was revealed to it. Her rump was quite possibly Lyra\u2019s proudest possession\u2026 but the buizel didn\u2019t seem to appreciate it as much, wriggling against her grip as she brought it closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buizel let out a little yelp as, with a single moment, she shoved it right into her crack! Her big, soft, pillowy booty cheeks jiggled a bit as the small Pok\u00e9mon wrestled between them, but eventually settled around the buizel, smothering it in all that squishy, sweaty flesh. With a hyena-like cackle, she pulled her shorts back up, dooming the buizel to her crack. It squirms as much as it can between her cheeks, but all it accomplished is giving her a pleasant massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyra started walking down the route back to Cherrygrove, excitement fluttering in her chest as she considered the morning\u2019s accomplishment. Obviously, the buizel must not be native to Johto, since she\u2019s never seen it on the national Pokedex. It must be considered super rare and exotic around here! And now, it was right where it belonged...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buizel\u2019s struggles were desperate, but not nearly as desperate as all the Pok\u00e9mon in her big, round beach ball of a belly now that digestion\u2019s really started to kick in. She sighed at the sensation, rubbing and patting her bulging gut. This must be the most satisfying meal she\u2019s had\u2026 well, in her entire life! Sure, stuffing herself with food from the pantry was fun, but nothing compares to lively, squirming meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in New Bark, she was able to have the occasional Pok\u00e9mon as a snack, but not very often. Sometimes, she\u2019d come across a rattata sorting through her garbage, or manage to snatch a pidgey that wasn\u2019t paying any attention\u2026 but they were just that. Light snacks. The most filling meal she had before now was Ethan\u2019s furrets. But now? Mmm! She could feel each and every little movement the dozen Pok\u00e9mon inside of her made as her powerful stomach gurgled them all up. This is exactly what she had in mind when she went on this adventure! She hoped she could have a meal like this every day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat do you MEAN you can\u2019t heal my Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was standing at the counter of the Pok\u00e9mon center, yelling loudly and generally making a scene. The scrawny Nurse Joy at the counter had a frown on her face, feeling small in the face of the much larger young woman. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, but our machines only work if the Pok\u00e9mon are in their Pok\u00e9balls,\u201d she nervously confesses. \u201cIf you want, the Pok\u00e9mart next door sells potions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh! You\u2019re so USELESS!\u201d</b> Lyra shouts, slamming her fist down on the table. <b>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a Pok\u00e9mon center if they can\u2019t even heal my fucking Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d</b> The young woman was upset, but even moreso when she noticed the nurse start buzzing for security. <b>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t! Don\u2019t you dare call security on me!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo bulky security guards walked in stoically. Since size doesn\u2019t just increase when you gain weight, but also muscle, the guards were even taller than Lyra was, and were able to easily overpower her. <b>\u201cHey! Let go of me!\u201d</b> She says, wriggling futilely in their grips as they dragged her out of the store, and tossed her unceremoniously in the grass. Lyra coughed and sputtered as she pulled herself to her feet, indignantly. <b>\u201cWhen I come back here, I\u2019m gonna be 20 feet tall, you hear me? And then you\u2019ll all be sorry!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in front of the Pok\u00e9mon center for a while, stewing in her anger, before deciding it wasn\u2019t worth her time. <b>\u201cFuck it!\u201d</b> She growled, stomping loudly back to the old man\u2019s house. She always liked the feeling of overpowering little weaklings, but she absolutely hated being overpowered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, she walked into the house in an absolutely sour mood. Ethan was sat on the couch watching TV, and glanced at her when she walked in, only to blush and avert his gaze when she pulled the back of her shorts down. To his surprise, Lyra tossed a small, half-conscious buizel into his lap! <b>\u201cThere! There\u2019s your stupid Pok\u00e9mon! Happy?\u201d</b> She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too excited upon seeing the buizel to be put off by her aggression. He immediately lifted the water-type up in his hands, inspecting it with excitement in his eyes. \u201cOh my Arceus! These things are supposed to live all the way over in Sinnoh! How did you get this?\u201d He smiled. Of course he would immediately know the natural origins of a buizel. Little nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m just the best damn trainer in the world. That\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d</b> she shrugged, before bumping him off the couch. <b>\u201cNow, buzz off! I need some alone time.\u201d</b> Sensing how angry she was, Ethan hurried to his room, eager to escape her wrath. Now that he\u2019s out of her hair, she sits bitterly on the couch, still pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Pok\u00e9mon centers weren\u2019t going to help her, she was going to need to get her hands on some potions. But how? She certainly didn\u2019t have any money. Hell, Lyra\u2019s never worked an honest day in her life. But if she was going to make it as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer, she needed to make some dough somehow...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra rationalized that the Old Man had to have some money hanging around the house, or at least something remotely valuable. He had enough money to support a wife that was literally bigger than all the other buildings in Cherrygrove, enough to fill the underground shelter underneath his house with food, so his must have something of value lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra plucked Snack from out of her cleavage and tossed the unconscious Cyndaquil onto the couch unceremoniously. \u201cWhat? Still out cold? Ugh, your so useless...well, at least not as useless as that bitch Nurse Joy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra got her ample ass off of the couch and decided to take a more in detail look at the house the old man had left her. From the outside the house looked very impressive. It was built with crimson bricks with tall, wide windows to accommodate for the old man\u2019s late wife. What kind of job could even come close to support all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man\u2019s house came was equipped with a top of the line kitchen, complete with fancy cookware and high end appliances. It was, naturally, the first room Lyra thought to check for valuables. Unfortunately, as expensive as most of the stuff in the room was, Lyra seriously doubted if the Poke Mart would accept stainless steel coffee makers from Kalos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom had nothing in it as well, and only served to aggravate Lyra as she got stuck in the doorway coming in and out. It was the only room in the house that was built for someone around the old man\u2019s height, meaning Lyra was a tad too wide for the door to accommodate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lyra checked the master bedroom, figuring that it had to have at least something inside. Opening the door, Lyra was initially taken aback. Above the absolutely gargantuan sized bed, there was an almost life sized portrait of the Old Man\u2019s wife. She was HUGE. Her chest looked like two overgrown Wailmers on top of a stomach that even a Snorlax would call big. Her wide hips were leaning on the side of the house, while her big butt had smashed unforgiving into a grove behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stared up in awe at the picture of the huge women that was before her. Even though it was only a fake, she felt like the real deal was looming over her, her head brushing the already tall ceiling. \u201cSomeday,\u201d Lyra muttered under her breath \u201cI\u2019m gonna be bigger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lyra was tearing apart the Old Man\u2019s room in search of anything of value. She violently pulled out the drawers of the dressers and dumped the contents onto the floor below her. Nothing but comically oversized clothes, apparently having been grown out of, what with all the holes and stretch marks on everything. Lyra had a brief vision of what the Old Man\u2019s wife looked liked in clothes. Nipples pushed out against the tight fabric, her cleavage exploding out of rip in the front, panties struggling against her massive butt and thighs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only served to fuel Lyra search even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! That old perv has to have something lying around! He\u2019s gotta rich!\u201d Lyra said as she got on her hands and knees to crawl under the massive bed. As luck would have it, there was a little, grey box hidden underneath the bed frame, just when Lyra was about to give up. Eagerly, she snatched the box with her greedy hands and emerged with it in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLocked, huh?\u201d Lyra fiddled with the gold painted padlock with a smirk. \u201cThat never stopped me before.\u201d She sometimes forgot that the more fat you are in this world, the stronger you are as well. She gripped hard on the padlock and pulled with all her might, managing to snap it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right! Let\u2019s see what we have here\u2026\u201d Lyra cheered triumphantly, lifting off the cover of the box to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Million Pokedollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra swore she almost had a heart attack as her fingers went numb and the box dropped to the floor with the paper bills tumbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was silent for a moment before she shook her head and recounted the money inside. No doubt about it, there was a total of ten FUCKING million pokedollars inside that tint little grey box. This was amazing! She could do whatever she wanted! She could buy a house in Goldenrod and live the rest of her days in lazy bliss and-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to stop her Pokemon Journey just yet! She had practically just started. Lyra patted her still full belly, the Pokemon inside now reduced to unprocessed nutrients. She still remembers how good it felt to have them all squirm inside of her, the looks of terror on their faces as she swallowed them up. She couldn\u2019t give that up, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra decided to keep the money a secret, for now. The brat didn't need to know that hse was loaded now, he would only want to mooch off of her! And as a professional moocher, Lyra knows all about this. She stuffed as much money as she could in her pockets and a little between the fabric of her overalls and her breasts. However, at the bottom of the box when all the money was lifted from its possession, there lied something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rare candy, wrapped up in in\u2019s signature blue plastic. It was a medicine for Pokemon whose trainers wanted a faster way of leveling them up. On humans, it had totally different effects. The company that makes them prints out warnings on every candy for humans not to consume them, ever since the first reported case came out, where a woman had transformed into a Magikarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra curiously picked the small candy in between her fat fingers. Transformation was not the only thing rare candy did to humans. It seems that the change has something to do with the kind of person you were. For people like Lyra, meaning fat, rare candy could make people hungry like there was a black hole in their stomach. Other candies could make specific parts of their body explode with fat, while others still just made them more fat overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lyra could seriously consider whether or not to eat the potentially dangerous candy, she found herself already gulping it down with wrapper off. She looked down at her hands with the wrapper sill in her fingers, proof that her instinct to eat had overrided her core thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her blood ran cold as she felt the rare candy settle in her belly. Was she going to turn into a magikarp, and lose this glorious, pudgy body? For a while, nothing happened, and she began to believe the effects of the candy were all rumors. Suddenly, though, she doubled over on the ground, an unbearable tingling sensation attacking every inch of her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her body start to shift and mutate as it slowly transformed. Oh no! She was going to be turned into a magikarp for sure! She looked down at her form, expecting to see developing fishy features\u2026 but instead, she just seemed to be getting\u2026 fatter? She watched in fascination as her belly seemed to be growing bigger, her breasts growing rounder and her arms and thighs pudgier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched in a mix of awe and excitement as her body grew all on its own! Quickly, she started feeling her body strain against her clothing, as she feels her outfit become several sizes too small for her. Afraid her clothing would rip if she kept it on, any longer, she managed to slip out of her shirt and shorts right in time, just before she was hit with another burst of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her hands in awe as they become chubbier, and her potbelly grew wider. She slowly, shakily stood up, feeling her already pillowy ass cheeks balloon out as her hips grew wider. For the first time in a while, a huge, genuine smile dawned on her face! She imagined herself slowly growing to the size of a giantess, a 50-foot tall jiggling mass of sexy fat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she\u2019s not nearly so lucky. She sighs in disappointment as the weight gain slows to a crawl, and then stops altogether as she finishes digesting the rare candy. Still, she was satisfied with the results! Looking around, she had gained 50 pounds and 6 inches, leaving her at 6\u20196\u201d and 270 pounds. She had finally graduated from \u2018severely overweight\u2019 to \u2018obese\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra felt like a goddess already! Her proportions were perfect, and although she had grown so much in just a few seconds, there wasn\u2019t a semblance of stretch marks or cellulite anywhere on her body. Her old outfit, which fit so snugly around her old body, looked so tiny lying there on the floor. In the end, though, all that weight gain only left her hungry for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite how absolutely gorgeous and perfect she was, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted anyone to see her naked like this, especially not that kid. She was going to need a wardrobe change! She started digging through the old clothing, and found it seemed to all be different sizes, indicating that the old man\u2019s wife had gradually gained weight over the years. Maybe that old perv was some kind of feeder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she dug deep enough in the closet that she finally clothes that fit her. She slipped on a little red and blue vest and blue shorts, which roughly approximated her old outfit, and proved to be surprisingly comfy. Just as she was getting comfortable, the old-fashioned telephone in the old man\u2019s bedroom started to ring! She stared it for a moment, uncertain\u2026 before deciding \u2018fuck it, why not?\u2019 and answering the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gent? Hello? Listen, I hate to bother you, but the egg you\u2019ve requested is about to hatch!\u201d A seemingly elderly man said on the other line. \u201cIf you want the togepi to imprint on you, you\u2019re going to have to pick up the egg soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThe togepi?\u201d</b> Lyra raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... uh, excuse me, who is this?\u201d The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</b> Lyra said, trying to come up with something, <b>\u201chis niece! I\u2019m just taking care of things while he\u2019s gone on business.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone? Ugh\u2026\u201d The man groans, seeming a little surprised. \u201cWell, could you be a dear and pick up this togepi egg for him? I really don\u2019t want it to imprint on me. Once it does, it never goes away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, Togepis don\u2019t happen to be a rare Pokemon do they?\u201d</b> Lyra asks, trying to sound natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, extremely rare! There\u2019s not a single other togepi in Johto!\u201d He says, and Lyra perks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be right over!\u201d</b> Lyra smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic! I\u2019m right in the big house on the end of Route 30! Can\u2019t miss it!\u201d The man said, before hanging up. Lyra considered her newly-acquired task. She didn\u2019t know what a togepi was, but she knew she loved collecting rare Pokemon! She turned and slapped her expose ass cheek in the mirror, giggling as she watched it jiggle, before walking back into the living room, her Pokedollars hidden away in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was sitting in the living room, slowly nursing the unconscious buizel back to health, when looked up and gasped in shock when he laid eyes on Lyra! \u201cWhoa! What happened to you?\u201d He stuttered. In just a few minutes, she had gone from about the height of an average man to roughly the size of a Venusaur! \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra didn\u2019t have the energy to explain what had happened, so she just decides to insult him again. <b>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ve always been this big. Guess you\u2019re not just a dumbass, but you\u2019re blind, too,\u201d</b> she said, enjoying the hurt look on the boy\u2019s face. Bullying Ethan was like comfort food to Lyra. She could do it all day. <b>\u201cAnyway, we got work to do! Some guy on Route 30 wants to give me a super rare Pokemon!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? He does? Why?\u201d Ethan asks, tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJust because I\u2019m gorgeous, that\u2019s why! Now shut up and pack your things. We\u2019re never coming back around here,\u201d</b> Lyra says. She figures her time living in the old man\u2019s house is about through. She didn\u2019t know when he planned to be back from his business trip, but she knew she didn\u2019t want to be around when he returned, having stolen millions of dollars from him and all. Besides, with all her money, she can rent a place to sleep anywhere in Johto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ethan sighs miserably, being uprooted from his new home just as he was settling in. He started filling his bag with all his worldly possessions, while Lyra stuffed her\u2019s full of the old man\u2019s food and valuables. A couple hours later, and they were on the road again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the two Pokemon had regained consciousness, and Lyra had purchased a few potions to heal them up. Immediately upon waking up, the buizel seemed ready to attack Lyra, but Ethan whispered something to it about all the Pokemon Lyra\u2019s eaten, and the buizel seemed horrified and submitted. Now, the poor little water-type clings to the boy\u2019s shirt as he carries it down Route 30, following along behind the now unbelievably tall Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how many other their brethren Lyra was able to devour, most of the wild Pokemon stayed hidden from them as they walked down the route. However, when they were halfway there, they\u2019re suddenly attacked by another trainer!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan frowned as he walked along the trail behind Lyra, the skinny child\u2019s new water-type Pokemon in his arms. He was incredibly stubborn to ever admit it, but as abhorrent and repulsive his \u2018kidnapper was, he was starting to...like her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what she did to blow up to this size so quickly, but whatever it was, it certainly inflated her curvy assets as well. Ethan blushed heavily as Lyra\u2019s big booty shook and swayed from side to side with each heavy step she took, the skin tight clothes she had acquired only coming up halfway past her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was not helping that Lyra had decided to take off her red and blue vest to cool off even though it wasn't very hot at all. Ethan gazed at her giant bra band, groaning in mute protest as it expanded across her vast, flabby back. Her pillowy back fat billowed all over the straining bra band, almost disappearing as they dug into her blubbery shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra could feel Ethan\u2019s eye\u2019s burn into ass. With an almost sultry smirks, she pretended to swat a fly and smacked her left cheek hard, making the poor boy confused on so many levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, however, the relatively peaceful scene was interrupted one of the most annoying forces in the known universe: Youngster Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey came running out of the bushes like a zubat out of the distortion world. With an ear-piercing squeal he flew into the air and landed right in front of Lyra\u2019s path, making her stop suddenly and Ethan almost walking into her backside. Buizel blinked as the last thing he saws before he lost consciousness right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen two trainers make eye contact, they must have a battle! Go Rattata!\u201d The irritating child shouted as he tossed his Pokeball to the ground, which split open to reveal a purple mouse Pokemon. It looked up at Lyra and nervously gulped as she eyed at it hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what the fuck?\u201d Lyra finally mouthed in response to the situation that unfurled before her. \u201cLike, seriously, what the actual fuck? Were you just waiting in the fucking bushes for someone to walk by?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d The hyperactive youngster replied enthusiastically. \u201cRattata, use Tail Whip!\u201d The rattata looked back at it\u2019s master with a look of pain, before sighing and turning its body around to pitifully shake it\u2019s rump at the giant human. Lyra actually looked stunned for a moment, before a sadistic smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour rat is lucky that it\u2019s so small, otherwise it would be a light snack.\u201dLyra as she brutally kicked the small Pokemon at her feet back to it\u2019s master. Joey looked genuinely surprised at the outcome of this riveting battle. How could he be defeated? His Rattata was in the top percentage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, YOU on the other hand\u2026\u201d Joey soon looked up to find that the imposing women was licking her lips hungrily. \u201cYou look much more filling~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! It may look like I\u2019m running away now, but I swear, I\u2019ll meet you again, and I WILL win!\u201d Joey than picked up his bruised pokemon off from the ground and sprinted away at inhuman speed. Lyra, Ethan, and the Pokemon looked at the dust trail that the youngster left behind, confused and a bit miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, that idiot reminds me of you, twerp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two humans and Pokemon made it to the house that the elderly gentlemen on the phone said to come to, not that there was that many houses on Route 30 to begin with. There was a large, wooden engraving above the door spelling out \u201cMR. POKEMON\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of stupid name is that?\u201d Lyra asked to no one in particular, having put back on her blue and red vest. Ethan shrugged and walked up to knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What do you think your doing?\u201d Lyra tugged at the back of Ethan\u2019s shirt and pulled him back. \u201cThis geezer has an incredibly rare Pokemon that imprints on the first one it sees, and it\u2019s gonna be me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opened to reveal the elderly Mr. Pokemon, dressed in a fancy suit with pinstripe pants, a red bow tie, and a fedora. He was about to greet the two visitors at his doorstep with a friendly hello and an invitation for a cup of tea inside, but his mouth was left agape as he stared at the massive teenager in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra rolled her eyes at the old man\u2019s reaction. Were all old men horny pervs? She snapped her fingers impatiently in front of Mr. Pokemon\u2019s face \u201cHey buster, my eyes are up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pokemon was taken back by the voluptuous girls snapping of the fingers, but his face softened with a warm smile. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry young lady. You must be the girl I spoke with on the phone. I apologize, it\u2019s just that you bear striking resemblance to a women I used to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...okay?\u201d Lyra said, genuinely creeped out by how she was once again referenced to an old man\u2019s love interest. \u201cAre you talking about the old man\u2019s - I mean, my...aunt?\u201d Lyra corrected herself, just now remembering the lie she told this guy on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh yes! She had a lot of impact on all of our lives, really!\u201d Mr. Pokemon said wistfully, mostly remembering some bygone days of his youth. \u201cYou look so much like her. What with the hair and the...uh...well that doesn't matter!\u201d He stopped himself before he started talking about Lyra\u2019s assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what does matter is that super rare Pokemon you were talking about, right?\u201d Lyra was eagerly waiting for the old man to get on with his conversation and just give her the damn Pokemon already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I almost forgot! I\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d The old man chuckled. He dipped away from the doorway back into his house, only to reappear seconds later with the mysterious egg in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, tell you uncle that the Togepi is still in its egg, and it's gonna take some time for it\u2026\u201d Mr. Pokemon started, but stopped in the middle of his sentence as he felt something twitch in the egg. He looked down to be greeted with the sight of a rather large crack on the multi colored shell, with stubby arms pushing away at the pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hatching?!\u201d Lyra almost shouted. \u201cGimme!\u201d She gripped the egg and forced it away from the old researcher\u2019s hands. Soon enough, the top half of the shell popped off to reveal small, light yellow Pok\u00e9mon with a round body and horned head that is still encased in its eggshell. She expected the rest of the shell to come off, yet it didn't. Stubby hands and feet, however, popped out from the casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Togepi\u2019s eyes opened and looked at the face of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan seemed excited as the egg cracked, and the Pokemon within revealed itself. He seemed to know what a Togepi was, because of course he would, the little nerd. Lyra was a little confused. Was this little thing so stupid, it couldn\u2019t figure out how to get its egg off? So far, she didn\u2019t have very high hopes for this thing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe togepi glanced around for a while, dazed by its entrance into the world, but coincidentally happened to lock eyes with Lyra. Immediately, it let out a gleeful chirp, and waddled pathetically over to hug Lyra by the ankle. With a look of distaste, Lyra grabbed the little Pokemon and held it in the air, inspecting it while it smiled and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was eager to see what the rest of it looked like, but the togepi let out a distressed squeal when she tried pulling the rest of the egg off of it. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t try to pull it off!\u201d Ethan immediately stepped forward, insisting. \u201cThe egg is part of the Pokemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognition dawned on Lyra\u2019s face as the realization struck her. <b>\u201cAre you saying that this is supposed to be\u2026 some sort of eggshell Pokemon?\u201d</b> She said, looking severely unimpressed. <b>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the stupidest fuckin\u2019 thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</b> The togepi let out a confused murmur as Lyra tried handing it over to the boy. <b>\u201cUmm\u2026 here, you can have this one, kid.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it! It already imprinted on you!\u201d Ethan insists, pushing it back to her. \u201cIt thinks you\u2019re, like, its mother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not going to take care of this stupid thing for its whole life!\u201d</b> Lyra complains. With a sigh, she holds the togepi up again, analyzing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Lyra, just give it a chance!\u201d Ethan begged. He had seen enough Pokemon die at Lyra\u2019s hands, but this togepi was especially rare, and losing it would be especially tragic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra rolled her eyes. <b>\u201cUgh! Whatever. Fine,\u201d</b> she says, glaring at the togepi. <b>\u201cHey, your name\u2019s Omelet, alright? Now, don\u2019t make too much trouble.\u201d</b> With that, she shoved him down into her cleavage along with Snack, its chirps and complaints muffled by titflesh. Now that she was this big, it was very easy to fit both of them in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began their long journey up to Violet City. Having to walk up a hill was strenuous enough, but to make matters worse, a horde of dumbass kids challenged her to battles as she walked by. Each of them cried and ran away when Lyra punted their Pokemon across the route like a football, or even just threatened them. It was fun to be so much taller than everybody\u2026 but it only made Lyra wonder just how big she can get!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 31 was comparatively much more peaceful, and Lyra thought she could just relax and enjoy the scenery\u2026 at least until she was ambushed by some bug catcher kid! \u201cI caught a bunch of Pokemon! Let me battle with-\u201d He suddenly popped out of the bushes beside her, and almost by instinct, Lyra rears back and punches him in the face! He\u2019s sent flying backwards a few feet, and when he lands, he has a bloody nose and he\u2019s unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gasps. \u201cJeez, Lyra!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, on the other hand, just laughs like crazy, looking at her fist which now had a bit of blood on it. <b>\u201cDamn! Guess I don\u2019t know my own strength,\u201d</b> she cackles. At 6 foot 6, she was already significantly stronger than she once was. It only made her wonder how strong she was going to be at 7 feet\u2026 or 8 feet\u2026 or 10\u2026 or 20!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, once all that was through, they finally arrived in Violet City! It was exactly was Lyra had imagined it! Beautiful traditional homes, the gorgeous Sprout Tower swaying in the background, a sea of purples of every hue and shade\u2026 and, of course, the Violet City gym! Her eyes lit up when saw it. She would be dominating that gym in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city\u2019s inhabitants were a little weird, though. They kept offering to trade random things. Some guy even offered to trade an onix for a bellsprout, which Lyra was certain was bullshit. That guy just wanted to steal somebody\u2019s bellsprout. Lyra flashed him a dirty look as she continued on, looking for a place to settle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra wandered the town, asking around for anyone who knew a nice place to stay, but all the morons in this city seemed completely clueless. Soon, the two of them were growing frustrated as they aimlessly walked around the city. \u201cUgh\u2026 my legs hurt so freaking bad\u2026\u201d Ethan sighs, only for Lyra to suddenly stop in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWait\u2026 did you just \u2018freaking\u2019?\u201d</b> She turns to him, wide-eyed. <b>\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Suddenly, Lyra wrapped her big, pudgy arms around him, and pressed him painfully tight against her sweaty, pudgy body! He immediately started wriggling in her grip, blushing as he was lifted into the air and wrapped in a huge bear hug. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cEthan, say \u2018fuck\u2019,\u201d</b> Lyra demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go until you say \u2018fuck\u2019,\u201d</b> she frowned, squeezing him so hard he could hardly breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan let's out a little pained gasp. \u201cM-mom says I\u2019m not supposed to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, well, she\u2019s not here right now,\u201d</b> she rolls her eyes. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon. You know you\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d</b> Lyra\u2019s grip on him is insane! Slowly, the boy realizes there\u2019s no chance he\u2019s getting out of this one unless she does what she says. Besides, he\u2019s a little embarrassed being hugged up against her so tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201c... fuck\u2026\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra tilted her head, a smirk on her face. <b>\u201cWhat was that? I can\u2019t hear you!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked up into her smug face, and suddenly remembered all the times over the years she made him miserable. How she thought herself fit to swallow his best friend and steal him away from his home. In that moment, Ethan was overcome with rage! \u201c... f-fuck you!\u201d He yelled at the top of his lungs, so loudly that bystanders stared. \u201cFuck you, fuck you, fuck you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected her to be upset\u2026 but instead, she only smiled! <b>\u201cHaha! Nice!\u201d</b> She laughed, a big, warm smile on her face as she set him down on the ground. <b>\u201cSee? I told you you could do it! Didn\u2019t that feel great?\u201d</b> He left him there, blushing and embarrassed, as she started walking through town again. <b>\u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to hear any of that \u2018freaking\u2019 bullshit anymore, got it? Say what you mean!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan followed after her, staring at the ground, ashamed that she was able to so easily goad him into using such obscene language. What would his mother think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, it was time for them to finally find a place to stay during their visit to Violet City...</span></div></div>",

The tower itself was more than one hundred feet tall, and is held together by a giant, flexible pillar that sways from side to side, never falling over This flexibility of the central pillar protects the tall tower from earthquakes, which happen frequently in Johto. It was inhabited by isolationist monks who study diligently and teach visitors that all living beings, Human, Pokemon, or otherwise, can coexist through cooperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lyra, however, she was far more interested in the sign out front of the tower that read \u2018Free Lodgings!\u2019, than the spiritual beliefs of those who inhabited it. After an hour of wandering around the city, the two humans had finally found a place to stay at. It was far away from most of the town, but it was either Sprout Tower or roughing it outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra walked up to the front door of the, what she saw as, rotting, wooden tower that should have been bulldozed a long time ago to make way for a parking lot. She pounded on the heavy door, tired from the walk around Violet and impatient to relax for a spell. A young, bald man dressed in blue and black robes came to answer the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello young lady, little boy.\u201d The man bowed in respect, not deterred at all by the size and width of Lyra\u2019s body. \u201cAre you here to stay for the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra snorted. \u201cUh, duh! Why else would we come to such crappy building in the middle of nowhere?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balding man did not grimace in the slightest. \u201cVery well. If you wish to stay at our monastery, however, you should know that we only allow those who have a strong bond with their Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra grunted. She should have seen this coming. A bunch of hippie dip-shits who praise Arceus and live with Pokemon? Of course they would come up with something so stupid. Luckily, she had the perfect way to prove that Snack and Omelet were head over heels for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a strong bond? Well, look!\u201d Lyra spread her massive mammaries open and fished out her two Pokemon: Snack, who had by now gotten used to his fleshy home, and Omelette, who was still disoriented from the experience. \u201cMy Pokemon love me so much, I don\u2019t even need a Pokeball for \u2018em! They insist of spending every waking moment with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robed sage looked Lyra\u2019s Pokemon over, before nodding, convinced. \u201cAnd what of your Pokemon, small child?\u201d He addressed Ethan \u201cDoes it care for you the same way you care for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked down at the small buizel in his arms, who in turn was looking back up at him. The two had only really known each other for a day, which wasn't a lot of time to bond. Ethan had nursed the Sinnoh Pokemon back to health after Lyra did Arceus knows what to it, and the Buizel didn\u2019t see why he shouldn't like the small child. Besides, it was either him, or being handed off to the bigger human who had tricked him into getting squashed and stuffed in her ass. The water-type Pokemon smiled and cried happily to the Sprout Tower Sage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. The two of you are free to stay in any room you please upstairs. However, please stay off away from the highest floor. That is where our Bellsprout live, as well as the other Pokemon who have made this tower home. If you disturb the Pokemon, you will be removed immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balding man turned back inside the Tower, leaving Lyra and Ethan alone to follow inside. Lyra smirked and unapologetically shoved her Pokemon back in between her two breasts, while Ethan gulped nervously. The sage just had to mention the fact that they're was a plethora of Pokemon on the top floor, waiting for Lyra to gobble up. He could only hope that her want for a place to sleep would counter her want to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stepped inside the unofficial foyer area of the place. It was completely wooden, form the walls, to the floor, to the lattice ceiling that separated the floors, even the main support beam was wooden. Lyra shifted her boobs a little nervously. She had just remembered that Snack was a fire Pokemon, which meant that one spark form the idiot could set the whole place ablaze, and than were will she sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to move from floor to floor was a series of ladders, much to Lyra\u2019s irritation. As she grabbed on, Ethan bit his lip, not sure if the old wood was strong enough to support her weight. Fortunately, the ladder did not break, but it did mean that it was time for him to follow. He blushed as he found himself directly positioned underneath Lyra\u2019s sweaty, pillowy Ass as she climbed ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel, who Ethan was carrying in his arms still, watched the two spheres of shiny blubber quiver and jiggle just under foot away from him. Being squashed underneath all that ass was not pleasant...but it wasn't unpleasant either. Before her weight could catch up with the small Pokemon\u2019s body, for a brief second, buizel was smothered in the cuddly softness of Lyra\u2019s butt each time she sat down on him before. And when she put him inside of her crack, the blubber around lulled his battered body to sleep and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel beat red and turned his head into Ethan\u2019s chest. What the hell was he thinking?! Did he think that he would actually want to get sat on by that abhorrent human again? No! It was crazy, stupid, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, ya gotta be fuckin\u2019 kidding me!\u201d Lyra stopped climbing as her wide hips got stuck in the narrow opening in the ceiling that she was supposed to go through. She pointed at two passing sages. \u201cHey!\u201d She yelled angrily. \u201cGet over here and help me out of this thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, who wasn't paying attention, kept climbing up until Lyra\u2019s plush, massive ass brushed up against his head. Confused, he took another step and looked up, only for his whole head to be lodged in between her butt cheeks, making him freak out and struggle. Buizel was suddenly smashed up against Lyra\u2019s skin tight clothed ass, which he couldn\u2019t help but lean into with a shameful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey! What do ya t-think your doing, brat!?\u201d Lyra yelled, surprised. \u201cGet out of my ass right now or...or...mhmph.\u201d She mumbled as Ethan\u2019s surprised jerking scratched an itch that was bothering her for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-on second thought...why don\u2019t you just stay there? It\u2019s not like we're gonna move anytime soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of pulling, the sages on the second floor finally got Lyra\u2019s body stuck, freeing up the ladder again. She and Ethan finally got to their rooms, the closest one that wasn't occupied by someone else. Lyra, who was exhausted by the whole ordeal, decided to dig in to the food she had smuggled form the old man\u2019s house in Cherrygrove, while Ethan just lied down on the one bed in the room and curled up into a ball, trying to forget what just happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lyra was done eating her quote on quote snack, she got out her other snack and Omelette from the valley of her cleavage and tossed them onto the bed with Ethan. The two Pokemon shook their head and tried to start up a conversation amongst themselves, which soon included Buizel as he joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked at the trio of Pokemon chattering away and chuckled. Look at them! They think they're real people, talking to each other in that silly language that no one understands. What was even funnier was how some people claimed that the bond between their Pokemon was so strong that they could understand each other. Phht, fat chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra got up and stretched her puffy arms above her head. She had some time before the local Gym would be open for battle, so she could do whatever she wanted at the moment. Climbing up those stairs and ladder had let her rather tired, so she could just take a nap and join Ethan and the Pokemon on the bed. It was a bit small, but she could make due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan again, she was till a bit hungry. The sage from before told her about all the Pokemon that lived on the next floor. But he also said that if anything happened to them, they would be kicked out. Not a problem if she was sneaky, but at her size...eh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra also pondered leaving Sprout Tower to check out more of the town. Her legs were still fucking sore, but it could prove valuable later on if she got a lay of the land. Maybe she should even clear out a restaurant with all the money she had in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices, so little time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well\u2026 the day\u2019s still young! No point wasting it in this boring, stuffy old tower. The bellsprouts upstairs sounded like an opportunity for some mischief, but she didn\u2019t want to get kicked out of her only shelter, and besides, she preferred Pokemon with some meat on their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, she was hungry. She hadn\u2019t stuffed herself silly yet since she grew to her new size, and she was eager to see just how much her belly could stretch now. Maybe she could gulp up some random Pokemon off the nearby routes\u2026 but, eh, she\u2019d rather try the local cuisine. Sure, squirming, lively meals were nice, but she hadn\u2019t yet soured on traditional food, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let Ethan sit around the tower, to bond with the Buizel or whatever. These monks were annoying bleeding hearts just like Ethan was, so she was certain they\u2019d get along fine. Meanwhile, she decided to stuff Snack back between her tits and head out, asking around town for the best restaurant Violet City had the offer, and she usually got the same reply; the Ivy Basil. People tried to convince her that it was rather expensive, but Lyra smugly convinced them that money is no object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally made it there, she realized the restaurant wasn\u2019t\u2026 quite her scene. It was full of those sorts of pretentious fucks that admired food for its \u2018flavor\u2019 and \u2018texture or whatever, rather than just the full feeling you get when you stuff yourself full of it. Idiots! Food is food, though, so Lyra still took a step inside\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she stepped in, she was the center of attention, and she loved it. At 6\u20196\u201d, she was now taller than basically everyone else in Violet City, and this combined with her sheer weight made her a sight to behold for the shelter cityfolk. She smirked smugly at the gawkers as she took a seat at a booth, her seat creaking beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attracted further attention when she loudly ordered one of everything the restaurant had to offer. The waitress seemed stun, but reluctantly agreed to her order when she proved she had the means to pay for it. Soon, a small army of waiter and waitresses was wheeling out an entire buffet for Lyra. It was a dinner fit for thirty people\u2026 and Lyra was going to devour it all in minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other diners watched in awe and disgust as she started loudly chewing, slurping, and swallowing down her food, stuffing her mouth full like a starving pig. She wasn\u2019t used to eating out, so her table manners\u2026 left a lot to be desired. Still, it wasn\u2019t like she cared. Let those scrawny bastards stare at her all they like. While she swallowed down an entire Watmel Berry, Lyra idly fantasized about what she was going to do when she got even bigger. For example, what if she someday got big enough to swallow people whole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d definitely start with that nurse joy bitch in New Bark\u2026 but who next? Once she was that big, anyone was on the menu. Would she eat Ethan, for example? Ehh, maybe if he got really annoying. But overall, somehow, Lyra was starting to feel a strange sentimentality towards her companion. He was a useless little shit, for sure, but he was her little shit. Figuratively speaking, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lyra stepped out of the restaurant, every single kind of dish you could imagine stewing in her gut. The buffet made visible bulges in her belly, which was nice, but she wasn\u2019t quite stuffed yet. After all, it was always a good idea to leave a little bit of room for more, just in case she runs into anything tasty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed on a nearby bench, letting out a little moan as she leaned back and rubbed her hands over her big, round gut, which poked out from beneath her new vest. The restaurant was a little dull, but the food had definitely not been disappointing! Now that that was all digesting, it was time to take a good look around town, and see what else Violet City had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra wanders for a while, doing a bit of sightseeing, before finally coming across the Violet City gym. The moment she saw it, Lyra had stars in her eyes. Even to a girl as cynical and unambitious and Lyra, the grandeur of the Pokemon gyms was tantalizing. She knew she had to conquer it before she left the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact\u2026 on second thought, it couldn\u2019t hurt to step in an take a look around, right? Get a feel for what she was dealing with. In reality, she was almost giddy as she stepped into the gym, expecting to find an epic stadium spread out before a cheering crowd! Instead, though, the gym was\u2026 absolutely empty? <b>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanders around the gym for a while, confused. Was it closed today? She couldn\u2019t think of any reason that would be the case. Just as she\u2019s about to give up and leave, she steps on a wooden platform in the center of the gym\u2026 and it suddenly propels her up into the air at a terrifying speed! <b>\u201cOh, shit! Oh shit oh shit oh shit!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately drops down on all fours and hugs the platform for dear life, adrenaline rushing through her veins. Eventually, the platform rises to meet some scaffolding raised multiple stories in the air! Falkner and a couple bird keepers were standing on the various corners of the scaffolding, staring at Lyra curiously as she freaked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell kind of an idea for a gym was this? Don\u2019t they know some people are afraid of heights!? <b>\u201cWhat the fuck!? Get me down! Down, down, down!\u201d</b> She yelled loudly, her voice echoing off the stone walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-just press down the button again!\u201d One of the bird keepers called. Lyra\u2019s confused for a moment, until she realizes the circle shape carved into the center of the platform she was on was actually a giant button. Whimpering and shivering, she pressed down on the button with her belly, only to yelp as the platform rapidly lowered itself to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was stumbling out of the gym, dazed and exhausted, her heart still pumping out of her chest. Damn it! It makes sense that they\u2019d be so high up, considering it was a flying type gym\u2026 but Lyra was afraid of heights! How the hell was she supposed to get her badge now? She stood there for a while, fuming with anger, thinking she was totally fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless\u2026 what if she sends Ethan in to fight the battle for her? All she had to do was give him Snack and tell him her strategy, and then once he wins, she can just steal the gym badge from him. A confident grin dawned on her face as she considered her master plan! Of course, there was one problem; Ethan was a dumbass, and would probably screw up any strategy she told him to attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again\u2026 if she overleveled Snack enough beforehand, it would be impossible for even a moron like Ethan to lose, right? The cyndaquil was already quite high-level for the area, able to knock out the Pokemon on the nearby routes with a single move. Just another day or two of grinding, and the Zephyr badge would be her\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious solution would be to train him against wild Pokemon on Route 32. They were all quite low-level compared to Snack, so it would take a while, but at least it would provide Lyra with some more tasty treats. On the other hand, she could also get him some tutoring at the local Pokemon School. It seemed to be mostly attended by kids, though, so she might be out of place there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall she train?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBefore you start learning more about Pokemon as a student, it is important that you get to know the kinds of Pokemon you already have...don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said the Pokemon School Teacher with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...yeah! Yeah, totally! I...I love Pokemon with all my heart!\u201d Lyra lied through her teeth to the friendly adult in front of her. It was like a dream come true for the gluttonous eighteen year old. Right now, Lyra and Snack were inside the Violet City Pokemon Academy, a rather small, drab building in the middle of town that only had one room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra had thought that it might have a mistake to come here instead of fighting other Pokemon, and she stood out like a sore thumb when she realized that she was the only other person over ten years old besides the teacher. But thankfully, the teacher happened to be another old geezer like the ones in Cherrygrove and Route 30, meaning that he was a complete perv. His name was Earl Dervish, which Lyra thought sounded incredibly stupid, but she pushed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly teacher was so enamored Lyra\u2019s curvy assets that he basically agreed with every comment she let slide. The children of Violet City were now going to be taught that Pokemon are incredibly delicious and good for you, that stuffing your Pokemon in your breasts and ass was a great way to befriend them, and good little boys and girls should listen to whatever older and bigger people say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Lyra felt like she had done a good deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Dervish smiled warmly at the teen aged trainer in his class. Lyra was sitting in a desk obviously made for people much smaller than her, but she didn't seem to mind her gut spilling over the top and her lap burgeoning into the seat next to her occupied by a kid, who was much too afraid to speak up to tell her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Lyra. Which is why I am going to tell you more about your Cyndaquil, Now class, pay attention.\u201d Mr. Dervish addressed the class as he brought down a the projector screen in front of the room. With a push of a button, the lights went dim and the projector at the top of the ceiling sprung to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of a Cyndaquil came onto the screen. It showed various things, like it\u2019s circulatory and respiratory system, and the glands that made the fire come out from it\u2019s back. \u201cMany of you have Cyndaquil\u2019s in your care, given to you by our esteemed Professor Elm\u201d. Mr. Dervish taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotal pushover and whiny little bitch, am I right?\u201d Lyra asked slightly above a whisper to the uncomfortable boy sitting next to her. The kid didn't respond, but he did shift more in his seat as more of Lyra\u2019s thigh flab spilled into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Dervish continued, \u201cCyndaquils are usually timid by nature and often curl into balls when intimidated. They are capable of sprouting flames from their back, which they mainly use to defend themselves. They get bigger and hotter the more angry the Cyndaquil becomes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArceus, get on with it ya old fart\u2026\u201d Lyra mumbled as she rolled her eyes. True, she learned a few things about Snack that she hadn't known before, but she didn\u2019t come to school to learn about him, she came to level him up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I apologize Ms. Lyra, you have to forgive an old man rambling about nonsense.\u201d Mr. Dervish said, completely under the portly women\u2019s thumb. \u201cIf you may please take out your Pokedex, young lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...sure\u2026\u201d Lyra obliged, not understanding what he was going with this. She opened her Pokedex, constantly going to the Cyndaquil\u2019s info page, which was the last thing she was looking at before she shut it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, your Cyndaquil, or \u2018Snack\u2019 as you call him, is at Level 12. You should all take a page from Lyra\u2019s book, class. Her Pokemon is already at Level 12, and she only started her journey yesterday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, really!?\u201d The little kid next to Lyra suddenly peaked up, impressed at how she had leveled up her Pokemon so fast. \u201cHow did you do that? You gotta tell us how you did that! Please?\u201d He asked giving her his best begging face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was about to punch the obnoxious snot in the face, but Mr. Dervish intervened right before she could. \u201cActually Lyra, it is fascinating how you were able to get you Pokemon so close to evolution in just a day! We would all appreciate it if you could share your secret with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Lyra deadpanned, suddenly being put on spot. Honestly, the reason why Snack got to such a high level was become she basically worked the little thing like the slave it was, fighting until fatigue and than kept going. She was going to have to come up with a lie, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh...I used Rare Candies.\u201d Lyra finally responded, remembering the time earlier today she ate one that caused her figure to balloon to such ludicrous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes! A classic technique, very good Lyra!\u201d Mr. Dervish approved. In point of fact, using Rare Candies was considered a cheap trick to level up Pokemon, but his sexual libido was overwhelming his cognitive morality. \u201cYou hear that class, this is why Lyra\u2019s \u2018Snack\u2019 is so close to evolving into a Quilava.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d Lyra raised her puffy arm into the air for a cocky cheer. \u201cWait...Quilava?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, a Quilava!\u201d Mr. Dervish nodded and pressed the button on the wall again, changing the image on the projector screen from the familiar Cyndaquil to one that kinda the same, but overall a lot different. It was a slim quadruped Pok\u00e9mon with the top half of its body blue, and the lower half cream. It\u2019s ears were triangular with red insides, and possessed a rounded nose and red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour \u2018Snack\u2019 is at Level 12, which means it is only two levels away from evolving into the Pokemon you see here.\u201d Mr. Dervish taught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Lyra swore, making the other kids in the classroom blush and cover their ears. \u201cLook at that Snack, that\u2019s gonna be you soon!\u201d She finished her Pokemon out from her fat boobs and pointed a soft finger at the projector screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Lyra. Now\u2026\u201d the elderly teacher pressed the button on the wall one final time, and the lights came back on in full force as the projector died off. \u201c...since you have came all this way to help a humble class like us, I think it\u2019s only fair that we give you a little gift to help your Pokemon evolve sooner before you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lyra felt like a woman reborn. She had came into this pathetic little schoolhouse with low expectations, but not only was she showered with praise and adoration from the teacher, she was getting a free gift to make Snack level up even sooner than he would have if she had grinded on Route 32. It was like a grate weight was lifted from her shoulders, and placed on her boobs, butt, thighs, belly...you get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gasped in delight as the old man brought out his gift from the desk drawer, and was revealed to be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra\u2019s eyes lit up when the old man pulled open his desk drawer. It was filled with all the latest equipment, enough to make anyone a successful trainer! She was primarily attracted to a glowing, metallic little helmet thing that looked extremely high-tech. She was expecting him to give her that, but instead, he reached even deeper into the drawer! He must be planning on giving her something ever BETTER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was practically jumping with excitement when he finally pulled something out of the drawer\u2026 only for him to hand her a measly little egg. Not even a Pokemon egg, just a regular egg you\u2019d see at a supermarket. She holds it in her hands, analyzing it for any unique features, but finding nothing. <b>\u201cUmm, just what is this supposed to be?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Lucky Egg! Blessed with good fortune!\u201d The old man said, cheerfully. \u201cIt is said that any Pokemon that possesses this egg will find their training to be swift and free of obstructions!\u201d He was talking like everything he just said wasn\u2019t completely nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was serious, Lyra was almost outraged. He was obviously lying to her just to try and convince her to go away. Just how stupid did this old asshole think she was? She restrained herself from getting too angry, however, deciding to try diplomacy first. <b>\u201c... are you trying to bullshit me? This is literally just an egg,\u201d</b> she said, speaking a little louder, the anger evident in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her second cuss, the class reacted with even greater shock and horror, many kids covering their ears. Meanwhile, the old man looked nervous. He was starting to realize Lyra was an irredeemable annoyance, and while he was attracted to her, if she kept being obscene, some of his students were bound to complain to their parents. He had to do something.\u201cL-Lyra, please. This classroom is a bad language-free zone...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh, whatever,\u201d</b> she rolled her eyes. <b>\u201cWhat about that machine thing in there? The thing that glowed and beeped a lot? Give me that instead!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra, that EXP Share is an extremely valuable prototype! There is only one of its kind in Johto!\u201d He reacts, surprised she would even ask for it. \u201cThe Lucky Egg will provide plenty valuable all on its own, if you just give it a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, this was supposed to dissuade her, but instead, it only made it more tantalizing. Lyra always had a penchant for rare things, and so far, she\u2019s been collecting the rarest Pokemon in Johto. What\u2019s stopping her from collecting the rarest items, too? With that thought, she suddenly stood up. <b>\u201c... can I speak with you in another room?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the old man could even react, Lyra grabbed him by the arm and dragged him out of the room with incredible strength, taking him somewhere private. Once they were out of sight of his students, Lyra immediately pinned him roughly against the wall. He thought she was attacking him, so he was about to call for help\u2026 but he\u2019s interrupted when she leans forward and plants a big kiss right on his lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped, shocked by what the young woman had just done. She had a sultry smirk on her face, now, her entire demeanor having seemingly suddenly changed. <b>\u201cMm\u2026 sorry, I just couldn\u2019t help myself any longer! You\u2019re just so handsome\u2026\u201d</b> He was about to say something, but she presses a finger to his lips. <b>\u201cShhh. Close your eyes. I have a surprise for you\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Dervish\u2019s heart was beating out of his chest! This was like something straight out of one of his fantasies! He immediately obediently closed his eyes, expecting her to start undressing or something. Instead, however, she turned around, leaned forward\u2026 and leaped backward, slamming her huge butt right against his head with incredible force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer humongous booty hit him like a wrecking ball, and he immediately fell to the ground, knocked out by the force of the blow. Lyra let out an amused cackle as she stood over his unconscious form. Apparently, her booty was powerful enough to knock people out with a single blow! She only wondered how dangerous her backside would become once she became even larger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back into the classroom without a smug smirk on her face. The kids all stared at her expecting an explanation, but she just ignored them completely, and started searching through his desk drawer. The first thing she grabbed was, of course, the EXP Share. She didn\u2019t quite know what it did, so she revolved to just try it on Snack the next time she trains him. It couldn\u2019t hurt, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 well, on second thought, it was an untested, probably unstable prototype, so for all she knows it might just explode and blow Snack\u2019s head off. \u2026 eh, that wouldn\u2019t be that big a loss anyway, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searched through the drawer some more, until she finds a stack of a few rare candies. These would make her absolutely huge if she ate them\u2026 but rare candies are kind of boring way to gain weight, now that she thinks about it. Maybe, if some scrawny chick pisses her off, she can force feed her the Rare Candies and ruin their precious figure? Maybe even turn her into a magikarp or something? She cackled at the thought, tucking the rare candies away in her bag for future mischief\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids were all staring at her while she searched through the drawer, cackling and mumbling to herself all the while. Eventually, one kid worked up the bravery to speak up. \u201cUhh, Miss Lyra?\u201d They nervously ask, raising their hand. Where\u2019s Mr. Dervish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed a bit surprised as she looked up at them, as if she\u2019d completely forgotten about the class. <b>\u201cUmm\u2026 he had to take a nap,\u201d</b> she shrugged, quickly coming up with a lie. <b>\u201cHe\u2019s really old, you know. Doesn\u2019t have the energy he used to. Probably even gonna have a heart attack one of these days.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the class immediately cries out in distress, the students obviously being very saddened by the thought of their beloved teacher dying. Lyra rolled her eyes. <b>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just telling the truth! Jeez, you kids need to toughen up\u2026\u201d</b> She said. Suddenly, though, she got an idea. With a smirk, she sat down on the teacher\u2019s chair, which creaked beneath her immense weight. <b>\u201cIn fact, that\u2019s what Mr. Dervish sent me in for! You kids want to be trainers, right? Well, news flash; <i>weaklings</i> aren\u2019t allowed to be trainers!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students all seemed distressed by this. \u201cH-how do we know who\u2019s a weakling and who's not?\u201d One asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cFirst of all, you can tell how strong someone is by how fat they are. If someone\u2019s BIGGER and FATTER than you, then that means they are objectively BETTER than you in every way! And you should do whatever they say!\u201d</b> She laughed, kicking her feet up. She has to teach these scrawny little brats who the real trainers are, after all. <b>\u201cOtherwise, they\u2019ll eat ya!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir horror only intensified at this threat. Most of them hadn\u2019t known such a thing was even possible. \u201cE-eat us!?\u201d One cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMhmm! Hell, I ate ten weakling trainers just for breakfast this morning!\u201d</b> She proudly lies, kicking her feet up on the table while proudly patting her big, round belly, which peeked out from beneath her vest. At that, she received a few \u2018ooos\u2019 and \u2018aaas\u2019 in either terror or intrigue as all the students stared at her shiny round gut. It was a terrible lie, but these gullible brats fell for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra spent the next hour tainting these student\u2019s minds with her twisted, narcissistic worldview. All these dumb kids had been convinced that the world was all sunshine and roses, so they were both horrified and fascinated by Lyra\u2019s \u2018teachings\u2019. Eventually, though, the bell rang, and Lyra realized she had completely lost track of time. She had to get out of here before that old man woke up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, class over! Don\u2019t tell the cops I was here, or I\u2019ll sit on your entire families! Now, scram!\u201d</b> She immediately shouted, ushering the confused, disoriented students rapidly out of the room. With that, she smirks proudly as she picks up all the gear she\u2019s stolen, and starts walking towards the door. The lucky egg was completely useless probably, but with the EXP share, Snack will surely be incredibly powerful in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she stepped outside of the schoolhouse, though, someone poked her in the side. She turned to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBrat?\u201d Lyra looked down at the small boy in front of her. He was carrying Omelette and Buizel in his arms. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing out of the tower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well\u2026\u201d Ethan stuttered. \u201cI was getting bored waiting for you to come back, so I decided to check out the town a little bit. And I heard this town had a Trainer School so I brought my Pokemon-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa there ya little asswipe!\u201d Lyra interrupted Ethan\u2019s explanation, stepping closer to the young child to make herself more intimidating. \u201cYou mean...MY Pokemon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, y-yah Lyra! Your Poke-...your Togepi.\u201d Ethan corrected himself mid sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no! You mean, my. Fucking. Pokemon.\u201d Lyra bumped her belly against Ethan\u2019s frame, making him and the two Pokemon tumbling to the ground. \u201cThat pathetic little orange fur ball you got was a gift. A gift ya dickslice. And I can ,and will, take it back if you keep mouthing off to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay Lyra!\u201d Ethan pleated, scared that Lyra was seriously gonna take Buizel away. \u201cYour Pokemon, your Pokemon! I\u2019m sorry! Look, I\u2019ll go back to the tower, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, not so fast twerp,\u201d Suddenly, Lyra brought her foot down on Ethan\u2019s stomach as he laid down on the ground. He grimaced as she grinded her fat foot against his torso. \u201cYou actually ran into me that the best time. Snack needs some training to go up against the gym leader, and you are going to challenge him for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What are you talking abo- AUGGH!\u201d Ethan shouted in pain as Lyra put more of her enormous weight on the nine year old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t question it! I\u2019m too tired to explain shit to you. Here, take these.\u201d Lyra fished out the Lucky Egg and EXP. Share from her purse and tossed them to the ground near Ethan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake these things and Snack to Route 32 to train him. Don\u2019t come back until he evolves into a super cool Quilava, got it?\u201d Lyra commanded, while Ethan shook his head up and down quickly, wanting to get the pressure off from his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Lyra, whatever you say!...oh, but, how will I carry all three of your Pokemon?\u201d Ethan questioned nervously, careful to make sure that he said that they belonged to her. The two Pokemon looked at each other over Ethan\u2019s pinned down body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra rolled her eyes, \u201cUgh, leave it to you to ruin a good plan, Ethan. Fine, you know what, I\u2019ll trade you. I\u2019ll give you Snack,\u201d Lyra pulled the Cyndaquil out from her breasts and threw him to the ground with Ethan. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take this!\u201d Lyra bent down and grabbed the Sinnoh water type from his yellow ring and hoisted him up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-!\u201d Ethan protested, relieved that Lyra had finally lifted her foot off of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo butts, mister!\u201d Lyra mocked, hugging the poor Pokemon against her fat, naked stomach. \u201cI think it\u2019s high time me and him get better acquainted with each other. Now get going, before I consider re-gifting the little shit to my gut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened beyond comprehension, Ethan scrambled to his feet, picked up the two dazed Pokemon and experience gaining items, and ran off as fast as he could towards Route 32.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, pussy.\u201d Lyra smirked evilly. She eyed the little Pokemon in her grip, who looked up at the fat, cruel human with fearful eyes. There was a certain satisfaction to seeing the little Pokemon look so afraid and scared to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, I really need to get you a real name. I mean, I can\u2019t keep calling \u2018Buizel\u2019 or whatever.\u201d Lyra put a fat finger to her double chin and pondered over the subject for a moment, before coming up with a answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about...treat?\u201d Lyra offered. The Buizel looked stunned for a second. There was no way she was actually thinking of calling him that...right? Unfortunately, Lyra took the water-type\u2019s silence as affirmation. \u201cAll right than, Treat it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where to put you?\u201d Lyra scratched her head. Normally, she would put most Pokemon in her possession into her boobies, but perhaps...wait a minute, back when she was stuck on the ladder at Sprout Tower, she felt something brush up against the side of her heavy butt cheeks, besides Ethan\u2019s head. Could it have been\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTreeeaaat~\u201d Lyra brought the shivering Pokemon closer to her face. \u201cDo you like my ass, you naughty little boy?\u201d She teased, earning a heavy blush of shame from the Buizel, who tried to cover up his eyes to avert her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Treat reopened his eyes, he was met with a very familiar sight: Lyra\u2019s bare ass. She had lowered him to her massive behind and lowered her shorts, revealing itself in all its splendor and glory. It had grown since the last time Treat had seen it unclothed. What once was large bowling balls for cheeks, were now beach balls for cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small Pokemon did not have time to ogle at Lyra\u2019s ass for long, as Lyra forcefully plunged his body into her sweaty, pillowy crack. He gave a yelp of surprise as the pale blubber slowly smothered him from all sides, quivering and jiggling like jello before settling and trapped him. Treat couldn't help but use the limited mobility in his arms to run his cute little paws against the soft flab. As repulsive and evil the human was, her body just felt so goooood\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra smirked as she felt Treat nuzzle and snuggle up with her glorious butt. Fucking perv. At least he knows how to appreciate a real women. She hoisted her shorts back up around her ass, and the small Pokemon was completely hidden away from the world, totally at the whims of a sadistic trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra began walking in no particular direction. She was thinking of ways to spend the rest of her day. It had gotten kinda late while she was teaching at the Pokemon School. It was evening, and the sun was beginning to set. She considered going back to Sprout Tower to get some shut eye, built her stomach made a slight grumble that distracted her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s massive lunch had mostly digested away at this point, which left her not exactly hungry, but not full either. If she wanted to get some more food, it would have to be Pokemon from Route 30 or 32. That pretentious high end restaurant was probably not gonna let her come back, and hadn\u2019t eaten anything squirming in her teeth for a while now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun descending faster and faster in the horizon, Lyra had to make her decision fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She smiles to herself as she walks through town, glad she made the choice not to use Pokeballs. Sure, it was inconvenient in some ways, but nothing beats walking around and feeling your Pokemon squirm in the various nooks and crannies of her fat body. While Treat hated her, they had to admit, their surroundings were extremely soft, warm and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks, she fantasizes about the power she\u2019s going to obtain again. From what she heard, the general rule is that in order to easily squish somebody or fit them down her throat, she\u2019d have to be roughly twice their size. For example, she\u2019ll be able to swallow someone Ethan\u2019s size when she\u2019s somewhere over 8 feet tall, and she\u2019ll be able to swallow that Nurse Joy when she\u2019s over 10 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she\u2019s not going to cheat and use rare candies, though, she\u2019s going to have to eat a lot to reach those kinds of heights with any expediency! That\u2019s not a problem, though. Eating\u2019s what Lyra does best! That thought fills her with determination, and starts walking faster and faster towards Route 32. She thinks she\u2019s tasted everything the previous route had to offer, so this is the next best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was filled with excitement as she approaches the route! Unfortunately, as it turns out, Route 32 sucks. It\u2019s too long, and all the meals on offer are the same. Damn. Rattatas. She\u2019s gotten so sick of rattatas! When she started this adventure, it was largely because she thought she\u2019d get to taste all sorts of Pokemon, not just the same boring rats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still, while on the outskirts of town, she was constantly accosted by the boy scouts that seemed to be camping in these woods. They didn\u2019t even have any Pokemon worth eating. Lyra\u2019s getting so, so tired of all these damn kids everywhere! Luckily, once she moves on to the more higher-level routes, there\u2019ll be hardly any of them, so she just had to deal with these brats for just a while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she\u2019s tempted to just cut her losses and head back to the tower with her belly unsatisfied. Something caught her attention, though. On the west, there seemed to be the entrance to the \u2018Ruins of Alph\u2019. She had no idea what the Ruins of Alph were, but it had to be more interesting than this snoozefest, so she hesitantly made her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the moment she stepped in, she was almost blown away by what she sees! Even though she can only see their silhouettes from here, the ruins are truly staggering in their scale; and according to the pamphlets, they are just the tip of the iceberg, with huge underground passageways built below. It was a wonder humans were able to build these things all those centuries ago! The thought of such sheer human determination ingenuity almost warmed Lyra\u2019s cold, black heart. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered around the ruins, filled with wonder. Apparently people were able to walk anywhere and interact with the ruins however they wanted, which seemed kind of stupid and irresponsible, but Lyra wasn\u2019t complaining. She walks around, doing a bit of sightseeing, before finally finding an entrance to the ruins proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer immense weight causes her to stomp loudly against the stones as she investigates the ruins, running her hands across the ancient concrete walls. She wondered what it must\u2019ve been like to walk through these things in their prime, all those centuries ago. Eventually, she found a little plaque on the wall, and what seemed like some kind of\u2026 puzzle set?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed at the plaque. This Pokemon hides on the seafloor and watches the shore with eyes on its back. Well, that doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. The puzzle seemed straightforward, though. Laughably easy, actually, since every piece was already locked into place except four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt literally took her only a few seconds to solve the puzzle. When she completed it, she laughed triumphantly! \u2026 only for the thing to start glowing. She stared at it, curiously\u2026 only for the ground to suddenly collapse beneath her, plunging her down into the subterranean labyrinth below. <b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cOh shiiiiiii</font><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">iiiiiii</font><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">iiiiiii</font><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">iiiiiii{ /size}<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">iiiiiii</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">iiiiiiit...\u201d</font></font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire life flashes before her eyes as she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s doomed\u2026 only for her to land immediately. She had only fallen a single floor! Whatever damage that might\u2019ve done was cushioned by her pillowy booty. She stood up, grumbling and dusting herself off, thinking the floor must\u2019ve collapsed beneath her weight, when a man walks up to her. \u201cYou must\u2019ve solved the stone-panel puzzle! Wonderful!\u201d He smiles. \u201cNot many others have figured it out yet! You must be truly talented!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at him, as if not certain whether or not he was serious. <b>\u201c... really?\u201d</b> She asked, exasperated. <b>\u201cThat was the easiest puzzle ever. Arceus, I really am surrounded by morons, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-morons?\u201d He looks a little taken aback. As if to make up for what he had said, he holds out a little blue, electrnic tablet. \u201cLook, miss, I was just going to offer you an unown report\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes it in her tubby hands, inspecting it. <b>\u201cA what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn unown report!\u201d He repeats. \u201cIt keeps track of all the unown you catch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAnd unown are\u2026?\u201d</b> She glances up at him, a little incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, unown are fascinating Pokemon! It is believed that they are somehow related to the first systems of language ever developed by-\u201d He starts his spiel, only to be interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah,\u201d</b> she said in a mocking tone, holding a hand up to his face to silence him. <b>\u201cThe point is\u2026 are they tasty?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed disturbed that she would even ask that question. Eating Pokemon? Especially historical relics? Why, that was just madness! \u201cWell, I\u2026 suppose they\u2019re technically edible, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGood enough for me!\u201d</b> With that, she shoved him out of the way, staring at her new, fancy unown report as she descended deeper into the ruins. He seems like he wants to warn her about something, but stops himself. She was on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed happily to herself as she strolled through the halls, admiring the hieroglyphics on the walls. Eventually, she saw a beady little eye staring at her from the darkness. <b>\u201cUh, hey there, little guy,\u201d</b> she said, leaning over, expecting a regular Pokemon. Instead, however, a giant, floating letter A with an eyeball drifted slowly into sight. Lyra was taken aback. <b>\u201cW-what the hell?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed just as fascinated by her as she was by it. It just sort of\u2026 hovered there in place, completely unmoving. She had no idea how this weird fuckin\u2019 thing would taste\u2026 but hell, she\u2019ll try anything once. <b>\u201cTreat! I choose you!\u201d</b> She called, reaching into the back of her pants and retrieving her Pokemon. She rolls her eyes when she realizes the water-type is unconscious, lulled to sleep by the pillowy softness of her booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI said GO!\u201d</b> She yelled, literally tossing the buizel at the unown. The unown dodged easily, and the buizel landed flat on his face, yelping loudly. Dazed, the buizel pulled itself to its feet, its nose bleeding, glancing around the ruins in confusion\u2026 until it noticed the unown flying right towards him! Just before it got too close, Treat used Water Gun, and the unown fell limply to the ground, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over, picking up the unown and holding it in her hands, inspecting it. It was\u2026 without a doubt the weirdest Pokemon she\u2019d ever laid eyes on. But hey, it looked edible, so with a shrug, she popped it in her mouth. It tastes like the alphabet soup Lyra used to have as a child. Strange. Sort of nostalgic, actually. She savored its flavor for a few moments before swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling it come to rest in her belly, she turned around\u2026 to find Treat knocked out, and surrounded by dozens of unown! Before she could react, the unown all flew at her at once! She opened her mouth to scream, only for three of the unowns to shove themselves into her mouth before she could make a noise! They wriggled around between her lips, and she realized they were trying to shove themselves down her throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fall onto her back on the ground, confused, as the entire horde of unowns quickly forced their way into her mouth and down her throat. She realized they must be trying to rescue their consumed comrade, not realizing that by shoving themselves down her throat, they were only dooming themselves to the same fate. All Lyra can do at this point is lie back and weather the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually a little painful just how much her mouth and throat were stretched, as all of the unown try to shove their way in all at once. She gulps them down as fast as she can, but she can hardly keep up. Tears were rolling down her cheeks at one point as her jaw was rendered painfully sore, but all she could do was keep eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the entire horde has disappeared down her throat, and Lyra let out a thunderous bulge. She groaned, nursing her sore jaws\u2026 only to look down and see that her belly was the biggest it\u2019s ever been! She watched in awe as her absolutely humongous, round gut bulged with the dozens of unowns fluttering around inside, now all trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing stuffed beyond the limit like this wasn\u2019t an entirely pleasant experience\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t an entirely unpleasant one, either. She lets out little moans and gasps at the sensations as the massive amount of Pokemon within her get settled. Eventually, she knew she had to get up and walk out of here... but was that even possible?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a series of failed attempts, Lyra had finally managed to get back on her feet after rocking herself back and forth to build momentum. She put a hand on her bulging stomach, wincing at the pain caused by the pressure on her tight skin. It was like some kind of fairy tale, or the stories her mom used to tell her when she was younger. It was as big as a yoga ball, if it was a yoga ball filled with incredibly rare, ancient Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Lyra\u2019s stomach, the Unown were trying to escape from their fleshy prison. They fired attack after attack, but their hidden power simply bounced off of the stomach walls back into them. The heartless trainer squealed in delight as the weird Pokemon inside her pitifully tried to harm her, but only amounting to a pleasurable massage. It actually helped soothed the pain she was experiencing, giving her the second wind she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lyra huffed and puffed as she began to walk with her wrecking ball of a gut. \u201cThanks for nothing Treat! Your lucky those...stupid Pokemon just flew in my belly...damnit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unconscious Buizel was laying on the ground with a bloody nose. The Unown actually didn\u2019t land a single hit before he fainted after being thrown onto the stone floor head first. It was strange how ancient, probably legendary Pokemon were less dangerous to his well being than Lyra was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stood over the Sinnoh water type in disgust. \u201cFucking Arceus, you are so lazy! You fall asleep in my ass and your only good for one attack before you snooze again?\u201d She rolled her eyes as she slowly bent down to pick Treat up, careful not to fall back over with her massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put Treat back in between her two butt cheeks to recover, grunting as some of his nose blood got on her shorts. With that, she began to walk back to the entrance of the ruins, ready to get the hell out of this dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back, Lyra encountered the same man from before, only this time he was incredibly distressed. \u201cI...I just don\u2019t believe this!\u201d The man ruffled his hair in anxiety, \u201cIf the readings are right, all the Unown in the Ruins of Alph have just...just disappeared! Where could they have gone!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gave a slight gasp, but stifled herself, not wanting to give herself away. She slowly tiptoed away, going as quietly as a women at her size could. Could it be true? Did she just eat an ENTIRE Pokemon species?! It was extinction! It was genocide! It was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...a fucking aphrodisiac. Lyra shivered and bent her knees together as a tingling sensation her loins. She had done it. She had just consumed a Pokemon species from the face if the Earth! She felt so powerful, so heavy...She felt like she could take on the whole world and eat it raw! With a skip in her step, Lyra cheerfully walked out of the ancient ruins, no longer hindered by her stomach full of digesting Pokemon as he forgot all about the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, are you guys getting tired?\u201d Lyra cooed as she felt the Unown in her stomach settle down as digestion started to kick in. \u201cJust relax and close your eyes...or eye, or whatever. It won\u2019t matter soon, soon you won\u2019t exist!\u201d She cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra began to walk back to Violet City, random persons on Route 32 staring at her naked, bulging yoga ball of a stomach. She wondered what her body will look like after she digests her biggest meal yet. She\u2019ll need new clothes, obviously. The ones she had on were already skin tight. And to think, they fit just fine this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra finally made it back to Violet, the last bit of sunshine dropping over the horizon as stars began to appear in the sky, signaling that nighttime had begun. She got even more stares as pedestrians on the sidewalk were bulldozed over as her giant gut pushed them out of her way. She felt so in power, so dominating...and she wasn't even trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had got to Sprout Tower, she remembered something crucial about her free lodgings. They were on the second floor. The SECOND floor, that\u2019s only accessible by a flimsy built ladder that will surely buckle under the newfound girth. And even if it didn't, they're was just no way that she would be able to fit the opening in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lyra opened the front doors into the foyer, she began to feel...watched. The building was eerily silent save for the creaking of the swaying pillar in the middle. It felt like a bad horror movie to her, and it only got worse as she stepped deeper inside, the floorboards creaking under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just when things couldn\u2019t get any worse for poor. little Lyra\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaunter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra peeped as she turned around to face her attacker, only to find a floating Pokemon snickering to itself. It was a purple, gaseous Pokemon with a round head and a pair of disembodied hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s face turned red as seethed with anger at the snickering Pokemon. \u201cOh? You think this is funny? Well you won\u2019t be laughing when your on the floor with a black eye!\u201d She threw a punch at the laughing ghost Pokemon...only for her hand to go through the gaseous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Haunter continued to laugh at Lyra\u2019s misfortune, even going so far to stick it\u2019s tongue out at her like a 5th grader. That proved to be a mistake as Lyra suddenly gripped it\u2019s tongue, the only part of its body that non dead people could grab onto. It gave a sheepish grin as Lyra gave it an intimidating stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me one reason I shouldn\u2019t inhale you.\u201d She threatened. The Haunter looked nervous for a second, before regaining it\u2019s confidence and pointed a disembodied claw up at the ceiling. Lyra followed it\u2019s direction, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...are you saying...you can get my fat ass up there?\u201d Lyra questioned the prankster Pokemon. It nodded eagerly as the huge human loomed over it\u2019s diminutive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, get to it than!\u201d Lyra commanded, letting go of the ghost type tongue for it to roll back up inside. The Haunter shook its head and shifted its body to behind the portly human, reading the spell the spell...or hex...or\u2026actually Lyra didn't care. In an instant, its eyes turned bright white, and one of the disembodied hands grabbed onto Lyra\u2019s ample ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hands of the merchandise, buster!\u201d She warned. Soon, however, she started to feel light, weightless even, an looked down at herself to see that she was now see through. \u201cH-holy shit!\u201d She gasped as she began to float to the ceiling. The Haunter crackled similar how Lyra would as it gripped Lyra\u2019s ass even tighter, relishing how it was in control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s head soon hit the top of the ceiling, and before she even knew it she was on top of the second floor. The Haunter let go of her ass, and her body returned to normal. She grunted as the weight of her stomach caught up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh...thanks.\u201d Lyra offered to the mischievous Pokemon. The Ghost made a swirl and flourish in the air before bowing and fading away from the mortal plane entirely. All she could do in response was a mere shrug as she navigated the hallways to find her room. What a weird Pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lyra opened the door to her room, she found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra pats her now still gut as she wandered around, searching for her room. She still couldn\u2019t believe an entire species of ancient Pokemon was melting away in there! She fantasized about them existing for literal aeons and aeons, living for centuries and centuries, just to ultimately end up stuffing her humongous, gluttonous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little worried that Ethan might\u2019ve just taken her Pokemon and ditched her\u2026 but nope. When she walked into the room, she smiled to see they were all accounted for. If any of them tried to escape from her, they were dead, and they knew it. With a low chuckle, she approached the bed\u2026 only to notice a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just wasn\u2019t big enough for the two of them! Hell, it was hardly even big enough for her, at her new height! Her first instinct was to make them all sleep on the floor, so she could have the bed\u2026 but then she came up with another idea. She gently placed Snack and Omelet between her soft tits, at which they cooed in their sleep and got comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she lifted Ethan up in the air! His sleepy eyes immediately shot open as he kicked his legs a bit, a little surprised. \u201cW-wha-!?\u201d Without explanation, Lyra laid down on her back on the bed, which creaked beneath her weight. With that, she set the boy down on her huge, soft, squishy belly. It was just big enough for him to curl up on top of, and Lyra even enjoyed the feeling of his weight pressing down on her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThere you go. New bed,\u201d</b> she giggled, folding her arms behind her bed while looking up at the boy sitting on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not going to sleep on your-\u201d Before he could finish that sentence, she interrupted him by jostling her belly around a bit, almost knocking him off his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cC\u2019mon! It\u2019s comfy and you know it!\u201d</b> She insisted. He blushed, feeling her belly squish beneath his weight. She was right; loathe as he was to admit it, her belly was the comfiest bed he\u2019d ever felt. She patted the top of her gut before leaning back and closing her eyes. <b>\u201cNow get back to sleep, you have a big day tomorrow!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled a bit, wondering if she was serious. But, the way she was acting, it seemed she really did expect him to use her huge belly as some sort of makeshift bed. He curled up on it as best he could, feeling the soft, comfy flesh squish beneath him. He can hear gurgles from below, and he shuddered. He could only wonder what she\u2019s devoured over the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes for Lyra to fall into a deep, restful slumber. Ethan was kept awake a little while longer, listening to the gurgles of her gut and feeling the squishy skin, but eventually, he too slipped into the most relaxing sleep he\u2019s had in days. This was the best bed ever! Or, at least it was, until his slumber was rudely interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only got a few hours of sleep before it suddenly felt like his world was being flipped upside down! His eyes shot open, and he realized Lyra was rolling over in her sleep! He tried to let out a yelp, but before the sound could leave his mouth, it was muffled as her belly finally came to rest on top of him. Ethan squirmed desperately beneath her belly, being pinned down against the bed by her weight. He was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of her belly was incredible, and he could barely breathe as he was squished beneath it. Luckily, her gut was so soft and squishy, or else he probably would\u2019ve been crushed completely beneath her weight. He squirmed as much as he could beneath her, but Lyra seemed to be a pretty heavy sleeper, so all his wriggles amounted to was a relaxing bellyrub for her. She cooed a bit in her sleep, but remained otherwise still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, poor Ethan was squished and masticated beneath her huge belly for hours that night, not able to get a wink of sleep beneath her unconscious torment. Over the course of the hours, he could hear her digesting and processing her meals, and actually feel her gaining weight and growing taller. By the end, she had gotten so fat that Ethan wondered if it was even possible to survive this situation any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, now that the first hints of daylight were creaking through the window, Lyra was finally awoken from her slumber. She rolled over onto her back, stretching out and yawning with a smile\u2026 only to notice Ethan was flattened against her belly. With a cackle, she practically peeled him off. <b>\u201cWell, good morning! You\u2019re looking bright and peachy today!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked absolutely miserable and exhausted. His entire body was sore as can be, and he had bags under his eyes. He desperately wants to climb into the bed and go to sleep\u2026 but before he could even think about it, Lyra was lifting him up in the air and carrying him out of the tower. <b>\u201cBig day today! You\u2019ll be getting me my very first badge! Aren\u2019t you excited?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun stung Ethan\u2019s sensitive eyes as she forced him outside, having him follow along lazily behind her as she strolled through town. ventually, Lyra passed by a store window\u2026 only to be mesmerized by her reflection! She was absolutely huge! She had grown to 7 feet overnight, and was now roughly 350 pounds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of those unown had gone to all the right places, adding another layer of delightful cushioning to her tits, booty and belly. Even her face had been affected, now with rounder cheeks and doughier features. Still, while she was obese, she wasn\u2019t morbidly obese yet. She had to get bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she now towered a full foot over even the tallest of these scrawny little weaklings all over town, which amused her. She giggled at the passersby who couldn\u2019t help but stare at her huge, jiggling body as she walked down the road. Eventually, she stopped at a small restaurant to buy breakfast for herself and Ethan. She didn\u2019t eat much this time; she wanted to save the real feast to celebrate her impending victory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the gym, she informed Ethan of her genius master plan, which just consisted of letting all their strongest Pokemon spam attacks, and the spamming potions when their health gets too low. Unfortunately, there was one problem. While Lyra was full of energy this morning, Ethan was on the verge of passing out. She fears this might cloud his ability to battle\u2026 but whatever! Surely, her Pokemon were so overleveled that he couldn\u2019t possibly fuck this up, right? Or at least, that\u2019s what she hopes when she walks into the gym\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she opts to stay on the ground, while letting Ethan travel up to the higher platforms. She spectates the battle from below. She can hardly see what was going on, but from the sounds of it, things must be going well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ethan returned, and Lyra realized...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra observed Ethan and her Pokemon as they descended to the floor from the scaffolding up above. Omelette and Treat were out cold and being carried in the nine year old\u2019s arms, while Snack, while on the verge of fainting, was still awake and walked along the human as they made there way to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Lyra impatiently asked, tapping her foot on the concrete ground. \u201cDid you win? Where\u2019s my badge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, looking like a wreck and no better than Snack, wordlessly obeyed Lyra and digged into his pockets to reveal a metallic pin shaped like a pair of wings. Excited, Lyra snatched it out of his hand without permission and quickly knotted it to her too small vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra made a mental note to get some new clothes soon. Her nipples were pushing up against the tight fabric, with her cleavage exploding out of the top of her vest like rising bread in an oven. Her soft, well fed tummy bulged freely, fully exposed as it spilled over the sides and fronts of her panties, which struggled against her massive butt and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Ethan, we gotta-!\u201d Lyra was about to issue the next plan for the duo, but was interrupted as Ethan finally fell asleep from rest deprivation and fell forwards against Lyra. She looked down past her breasts to see his head brush the underside of her boobs as he got some well needed rest. Even Snack thought it was a good time to take a nap as lied on his back and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Lyra would be pissed that Ethan and her Pokemon were being so fucking lazy, but instead she just sighed and took Treat and Omelette from his arms and pushed them down her boobs for safekeeping. They had all worked hard, and got her the Zephyr Badge from the gym leader Falkner. They deserved a small break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra picked up Snack and stuffed him in her snuggly butt crack, opting to switch the places he normally places him with Treat. With a slight chuckle, she grabbed Ethan by his sides and began to carry him in her arms out of the Pokemon Gym. Too onlookers on the streets, it looked like the snoozing boy could be her son, and it wasn't helping that he was unconsciously hugging against her enormous bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra and Ethan had already unpacked from their room at the Sprout Tower, but their things were still at the restaurant they ate breakfast at earlier. She told the people in charge that she was coming back for her victory feast.The staff said they were not responsible if they got stolen, but Lyra with her imposing figure and threatening stare made them change their policy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven foot tall Lyra sat Ethan down in a chair in a patio table. She took a seat next to hum, her huge buttocks big enough to crush the chair under her if it wasn't reinforced by her request. A nervous waitress came to take the duo\u2019s order, intimidated by the older women\u2019s height and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello! Welcome (again) to the Ivy Basil! May I take your order?\u201d She asked with a stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna have a bowl of macaroni and cheese,\u201d Lyra pointed to the still out cold Ethan in his chair, \u201cMy Pokemon will have...whatever it is you feed Pokemon, and I\u2019m gonna have one-no...TWO of everything this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo...two of everything? R-r-r-right away, ma\u2019am\u201d The poor waitress meeped obediently, zipping off into the main restaurant towards the kitchen to tell the chefs to stop everything their doing, for there was a hungry monster on the loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, by the time the food came by a platoon of staff pushing carts and holding trays, Ethan and the Pokemon began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...huh?\u201d The small child questioned as he rubbed his eyes, finally well rested. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, your finally awake ya lazy bum!\u201d Lyra greeted the now awake Ethan with a playful punch to the arm, but not knowing her own strength left a bruise. \u201cYou fell asleep in my breasts like I as your mom or something. It\u2019s funny, I never pegged you for the brat who preferred larger women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blushed crimson red at Lyra\u2019s teasing, which she personally found cute. It wasn't a surprise to her. Such a large, voluptuous women all to himself, of course he was head over heels for her! She mindlessly fished the Pokemon out from the folds of her body so they can eat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiters and waitresses had to clear the patio fo other patrons and tables to make room for Lyra\u2019s feast. It was her largest meal yet, but with her increased stomach capacity, she confidently dug into the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is one fat butt.\u201d Ethan commented as he ate his relatively meager bowl of macaroni. He tried to look away and pay attention on his food, but he couldn't help but watch Lyra\u2019s gigantic ass sway from side to side as she guzzled down enough food to feed a family for a week, her huge thighs rubbing together hypnotically. \u201cWhy do my pants feel funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn under half an hour, Lyra polished off the last bit of edible matter in the restaurant. The patio looked like a warzone, littered with dishes and plates licked clean. The staff watched in awe as she dug into her purse and pulled out enough money to pay for the meal. Her fat stomach bulged out several feet in front of her as the food inside her settled and began to melt into goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan followed Lyra out the restaurant. He was surprised to see his traveling partner not hindered by the weight in her stomach in the slightest. How strong could she be if she was able to stay up with all the belly in the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lyra was weighing her options on how to proceed. By the time she digested her meal, she could no longer be able to pretend that her clothes fit her fine. She patted her bulging, overflowing breast flesh that was her cleavage, feeling her Pokemon toss in turn within. Treat opted to travel with Ethan, but he couldn't stop stealing gazes at her glorious booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could go the Poke-mart to get some new clothes before she blew this dump...that is if they even carried clothes. Or she could just go out on Route 32 right now, and if her clothes got to small...well, going naked didn't sound too appealing. But it would feel nice not to be contained by tight fabric and just let everything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to ask Ethan his opinion on what to do, but she stopped herself as she caught him staring at her booty like his pervy Pokemon. She blinked before slowly smiling warmly. It felt nice to be stared at, it made her feel like a Goddess. The poor boy was blushing and turning his head away as to not meet her gaze. She could talk to the twerp how she didn\u2019t mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she came to a decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had some unfinished business to attend to before leaving this boring little town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s slaughtering the bellsprouts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sages of the sprout tower were running around the second floor in a disorganized mess, trying to prepare for battle. Most of their forces were lying limp on the third floor, knocked out by the might of a mysterious stranger\u2019s big, fat booty. They were largely pacifists, and did not train for battle. By Arceus\u2019 name, she had a fire-type Pokemon! How could they possibly defeat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hall was filled with the echoing booms of a man loudly tapping his cane on the ground, and the sages froze in place. They all stared in awe as the tower\u2019s elder, Li, emerged from his quarters with a stoic look on his face. \u201cCalm yourselves. I will repel this threat,\u201d he said, simply. The other sages all cheered and clapped as Li bravely ascended the staircase, certain that he\u2019d defeat the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his old age, Li had seen many terrible things in his life, but what he saw on the third floor of Sprout Tower was still able to chill him to his core. Lyra - that hulking, gluttonous, mountain of a girl - was sitting there rubbing and patting at her unbelievably huge, bulging gut. He could only watch helpless as the girl raised another struggling, crying bellsprout to her lips, and swallowed it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was standing on the sidelines, seeming equally horrified by the display. He respected the ancient history and traditions of the sages of the Sprout Tower - their pacifism was the antithesis to Lyra\u2019s hedonism. Thus, he was horrified to watch her destroy what they had spent centuries building. He rushed over to the elder, tears on his face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! She just keeps eating them! I can\u2019t convince her to sto-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the old man rears back, and slaps Ethan across the face! He falls to the floor, crying louder. \u201cQuiet, stupid child! Out of my way!\u201d He yelled, angrily, walking past the crying boy to confront Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lyra had just finished tucking the last of the bellsprouts down her throat, dooming the entire tower\u2019s stock to the salad-like malaise within her belly. She was content to just sit there, enjoying the feeling of stretching her gut to the limit for a while\u2026 but she was knocked from her stupor when she saw the old man slap Ethan! <b>\u201cHey! Leave him alone!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra very slowly, laboriously pulls herself to her feet with a loud grunt, almost losing her balance with the huge weight of her belly slowing her down. Not only was she stuffed with food, but she was stuffed with dozens bellsprouts now, too. Luckily, bellsprouts were mostly just vines, and were really easy to gulp down en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing each other's determined expressions, they both knew a Pokemon battle was imminent. Lyra pulled Snack out from between her tits, and tossed him onto the floor in front of her. Meanwhile, the old man summoned a weakling little bellsprout, which cowered at the sight of the huge woman it was facing off against. \u201cYou have no respect for Pokemon! None at all!\u201d The self-righteous old man called out angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSays the guy with the level 8 bellsprout,\u201d</b> Lyra rolled her eyes. <b>\u201cSeriously, did you ever train your Pokemon at all, gramps?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks even angrier when she insults his power. \u201cThey do not need to be high level! Their bond with me makes them strong enough to overcome any obstacle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s amused by his piosness. <b>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see about that!\u201d</b> She said, before pointing and shouting. <b>\u201cSnack, use Ember!\u201d</b> Snack reared back, and a huge fireball launched from his mouth! The grass-type didn\u2019t have a chance. When the dust cleared, the bellsprout was lying there, scorched and unconscious, with little spirals for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, the old man sent out his next bellsprout, only for the result to be exactly the same. The elder was stunned by easily she was defeating him, his delusions of grandeur beginning to slip. Perhaps it has be a long time since he last battled\u2026 but no matter! He still had his stronger Pokemon left! With it, victory was certain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent out his hoothoot\u2026 only for it to also get clobbered with a single attack! Stunned and miserable, the old man immediately falls to his knees, wondering how he could\u2019ve failed to protect his tower. Meanwhile, Lyra laughs at the pathetic display. <b>\u201cWow. Looks like I know more about Pokemon than any of you losers do,\u201d</b> she said, feeling overwhelmingly smug in her victory. <b>\u201cNow, it looks like it\u2019s time for desert\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips as she waddled over to his unconscious Pokemon. They were all quite burnt by Snack\u2019s fireballs, making them even tastier. The old man could only watch in horror as she gulps down his last remaining bellsprouts, one by one, his eyes following the bulges they make in her throat before they disappeared. When she held his precious hoothoot over her lips, though, he panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d He said, leaping forward. Seeing him move, Lyra immediately swallowed the hoothoot\u2026 only for the man to shove his arms down her throat, grabbing on to the hoothoot before it could descend to deep! \u201cMonster! Vile wretch!\u201d The old man desperately, futilely tried to pry his Pokemon from Lyra\u2019s gullet\u2026 but he only succeeded at impressing her with his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his entire arms were down her throat. Perhaps, just maybe, she could swallow the old man, too! For a while, she tries to fit her mouth around his head and shoulders while he stubbornly holds on to his precious hoothoot\u2026 but eventually, she just gives up, confirming her knowledge that she simply wasn\u2019t big enough to gulp anyone down yet. The old man was about 6 feet tall, so following the rule of thumb, she\u2019d have to be 12 feet to eat him with any ease\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she was tired of his pathetic struggles, Lyra started swallowing with extra vigor, and the old man cries out in anguish as he feels his hoothoot get pried from his grip by her powerful throat muscles. He can feel it disappear deeper and deeper, until it finally vanishes into her belly. Once that was done with, Lyra pushes him away, forcing his arms from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by the horror he had just witnessed and experienced, the old man fainted, landing on the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ethan had been watching the entire display, rubbing at his sore cheek, now heavily bruised where the old man slapped him. He hated to admit it, but watching Lyra swallow the old man\u2019s Pokemon was actually rather cathartic. He had completely lost all respect for the sages when realized how hypocritical and self-righteous the elder was. Plus, it didn\u2019t hurt that he actually liked the look of Lyra\u2019s huge belly almost as much as her booty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lyra was basking in the joy of humiliating yet another weakling trainer! Truly, she was the greatest Pokemon trainer of all time! She was about to walk off\u2026 only to nearly fall of balance by the immense weight of her gut! <b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 think I might\u2019ve bit off a little more than I can chew here\u2026\u201d</b> She groaned, realizing she wasn\u2019t going anywhere soon. She huffs as she takes a seat on the ground, looking up at Ethan. <b>\u201cThink you could you give me a hand?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was confused for a second\u2026 before realizing what she was asking. Hesitantly, he walked forward and sat on his knees in front of her huge, grumbling belly. It was bigger than his entire body! He massaged the squishy, stretched-out skin with his small hands in awe, hearing it loudly gurgle as the belly rub she was giving her helped speed up the digestive process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoothed by Ethan\u2019s belly massage, Lyra laid back and rested her eyes, resolving to let her belly do all the work. Eventually, though, Ehan worked up the courage to say something. \u201cHey, Lyra?\u201d She lazily opened an eye. \u201cI just wanted to say\u2026 thanks for sticking up for me back there.\u201d He was actually rather surprised that she seemed to care about him so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHeh! No problem!\u201d</b> She laughed, amused by his gratitude. In truth, the primary reason she defended Ethan was just because she felt like he was her property, and she didn\u2019t like other people damaging her property. But, on a deeper level, she actually was starting to like Ethan. Sure, back when he always bitched and complained, he was annoying, but he\u2019s gotten much more bearable now that he seems to have come down with a bad case of stockholm syndrome, and has fallen in love with her beautiful boy and bad habits. Amused by that thought, Lyra wrapped her arm around the boy\u2019s neck, and gave him a rough noogie! <b>\u201cNobody\u2019s allowed to bully you except for me! Remember that, champ!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan laughed and giggled as he squirmed out of her grip. Soon, while Lyra relaxed, he got back to massaging her huge belly, occasionally curiously pressing his ear against it to hear the gurgles within\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse joy stood at attention as Lyra lumbered through the front doors of the Pokecenter. She looked exactly like the last nurse Joy, which filled Lyra with immediate hatred. Hopefully, they don\u2019t have any problems here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digesting her meal for a couple of hours, Lyra had already gained 2 inches and 20 pounds, putting her at 7\u20192\u201d and 370 lb. Her meal wasn\u2019t even halfway digested, though, so she knew she was still going to gain a lot more weight in the next few hours. She already felt like she was on the verge of bursting out of her outfit\u2026 in a couple hours, she was probably going to be walking around in the buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to buy a new outfit\u2026 but that meant she also had to come up with a new look. That weird mix of city girl and farm girl aesthetics she usually rocked just didn\u2019t fit her anymore. She had to think of something else...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, Lyra found a pair of clothes she liked and went into the changing room to check them out. She made Ethan and the Pokemon wait right outside while she got dressed so they could tell her how she looked. Ethan feared that none of the clothes in the store would fit her, but apparently she found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigantic, incredibly fat humans like Lyra are not exactly uncommon in the Pokemon World. Most of them, however, make a point to only live around major cities where people are more accepting of their hedonistic lifestyles. Not all of them eat Pokemon as voraciously as Lyra does, but they are insanely gluttonous for food, and range from sizes of 7 feet, like Lyra is now, to the height of a skyscraper and the width of a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, there are many companies that make clothes specifically for these types of people. They specialize in incredibly elastic and stretchy material that reduces the times they need to buy new outfits. And although Violet city was barley an actual city, it was considered populated enough for the big and tall clothes to be sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lyra opened the door of her changing room to reveal her new outfit to Ethan and the Pokemon, and giggled in amusement as they all dropped their jaws in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was wearing an incredibly skimpy two piece outfit...and nothing else. It covered her private parts, but other than that, EVERYTHING was on display. She had chosen the skimpiest style the store offered, a bikini top whose straps were practically strings, and cups were just triangles meant to cover as little chest as possible. The string, however, was stretchy and designed to accommodate for three more cup sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bikini top was paired with a matching thong. The fabric was skin tight and looked painted on her massive, pillowy booty. Lyra gave her ass a playful smack and watched it jiggle before tuning back to Ethan and the Pokemon. \u201cWell boys~\u201d she teased, cupping one of her blubbery boobs in a pudgy hand, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she look? From the three Pokemon and Ethan\u2019s perspective, she was a humongous bombshell. Lyra towered over the four of them with her incredibly voluptuous body in an outfit that let absolutely nothing to the imagination. The flabby women walked towards them, her whole body shaking as she did. Ethan in particular was transfixed on her bulging stomach, still digesting her meal and padded with soft pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you look...really nice, Lyra!\u201d Ethan stuffed with a blush on his face. \u201cBut, are you sure you can go out walking like that? It looks great and all\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra chuckled and patted Ethan on the head dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty lil\u2019 head, pipsqueak. If anybody has a problem with how I look, they can take it up with me. Now come on, I\u2019m gonna wear this out.\u201d With that, Lyra tore off the tags from her sexy outfit and walked over the counter to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ethan heard something hit the ground. He looked down to see Snack and Omelette hovering over an unconscious Treat, who had passed out from a nosebleed watching Lyra\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them soon arrived at the beginning of Route 32. The Nurse Joy at the Pokecenter had the nerve to wish to see them again. Why the actual fuck would someone ever wish for their Pokemon to get thrashed so she can treat them? Girl must have some sick fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of weak Pokemon, Lyra finally noticed that Snack, while stronger than he was yesterday, had still not evolved into a Quilava. At first, she was pissed at Ethan for going against her orders and bringing him back unevolved, but calmed down when she remembered that all the Pokemon on Route 32 were as weak as hell. Snack was too overpowered to gain much experience from battling smallfry Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her Pokedex from her purse to check Snack\u2019s stats. It said that he was LV. 13, and looked like he only needed to win one more battle to evolve. Unfortunately, all the wild Pokemon were avoiding them, deathly afraid of Lyra\u2019s massive form as she stomped her way through the tall grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two of them were assaulted by the high pitched screech of a very familiar Pokemon Trainer they had met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFya!\u201d The youngster Joey cried as he ran past Ethan and Lyra and forced the two of them to stop walking as he blocked their path. \u201cWe meet again, old foe! You won\u2019t be so lucky this time, however!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look Ethan, it\u2019s that retarded fuck from Route 30! Do you think I\u2019m big enough to eat him this time?\u201d Lyra ignored the spastic child\u2019s ramblings as she addressed her property. Ethan looked at her incredulously. It was one thing to eat Pokemon, as vile and evil as it was, but eating...humans? The thought of Lyra eating someone alive and whole made him feel tingly in a way he didn't understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Ignoring me, huh? Well, you\u2019ll won't be ignoring me for long! Go, Raticate!\u201d Joey threw his only Pokeball to the ground to reveal that his top percentage Rattata had evolved into a Raticate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-lyra! Be careful!\u201d Ethan warned. \u201cRaticates only evolve when they're LV. 20, which means its r-really strong!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked down at the small Pokemon at her feet. It barely reached her ankles, but it looked a tad more confident than the shriveling mess it was before. Lyra was almost impressed how this idiot managed to level up his Pokemon so much so fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, than ya little shit. You want a Pokemon battle so badly? Snack, Omelette, I choose you!\u201d Lyra cried in typical Pokemon Trainer fashion ash she brought up her Cyndaquil and Togepi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, treat! Get you orange ass out here and fight for me!\u201d Lyra commanded to Ethan\u2019s Buizel, who was traveling in the little boy\u2019s arms. The water type scrambled and hopped down to the Earth to join Snack and Omelette as they circled around the Raticate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No fair, you can\u2019t have more than one Pokemon fight against each other!\u201d Joey whined like a little bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not like most trainers, brat. Snack, use Ember! Treat, use Water Gun! Omelette, use...whatever it is you know how to do!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Pokemon obeyed Lyra and fired their attacks all at once. With their combined force, they were able to knock out the level 20 Raticate. \u201cNo! How could this happen!\u201d Joey cried dramatically. He picked up his Raticate and pointed his finger at Lyra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear me, fat lady! One day, I\u2019ll come find you again, and I will beat you!\u201d He proclaimed, and then ran off at a speed akin to most cars. Once again, Lyra and Ethan were left in confusion as the small child faded into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet I\u2019ll be able to down him the next time we see him.\u201d Lyra commented, patting her gut. She had finally digested the last remnants of her massive meal from before. She had gained 30 more pound and two inches, leaving her at 400 Lbs and 7\u20194\u2019\u2019. Like her two piece outfit promised, the cloth and strings stretched and expanded over her newly fattened flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Pokedex in Lyra\u2019s purse began to flash like crazy, but before she could take it out, she was distracted by Snack starting to glow bright white. The two humans and other Pokemon started at the confused Cyndaquil as he glowed brighter and brighter and began to change shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my Arceus...is this evolution?\u201d Ethan muttered awestruck at the sight in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s so...beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, finally!\u201d said Lyra exasperatedly, having been imapatine for Snack to finally evolve. The sight of evolution didn't warm her cold, black heart like Ethan\u2019s, but she had to admit it looked pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack\u2019s body finally stopped glowing and his new body was revealed. He looked exactly liked the diagram showed at the Pokemon School, but Lyra noticed something she hadn't before: she could see it\u2019s eyes now. Before, his eyes were squiggly lines on his face, but now, she could see his sparkling, ruby red irises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Ohmyarcuesyouaresoprecious!!!!!\u201d Lyra screeched as she picked up her Pokemon new body and hugged him against her exposed mammaries, smothering him in sweaty tit fat, kinda like how they first met back in Professor Elm\u2019s Lab. Snack struggled against her grip, but softened up after a while, used to his trainers behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Snack's astonishment, despite the fact it was now two feet tall, he fit perfectly in between Lyra\u2019s breasts as she stuffed him back in his home. The fire on his head and tail was smothered out by his trainer\u2019s sweat and blubber. Lyra patted the top of her massive boobs affectionately and squeezed them together slightly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnion cave looked like nothing particularly special from the outside, but on the inside, it was actually rather gorgeous! Sure, it was mostly just a bunch of old rocks, but what she didn\u2019t expect to see was the water from the nearby rivers flooding the lower parts of the cave, a few paths being submerged in dark blue water. <b>\u201cHey, this cave\u2019s actually pretty cool looking.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan followed along quietly behind her. With her new \u2018outfit\u2019, Lyra was practically naked, and Ethan was memorized by her huge, jiggly booty swaying back and forth as she walked. For some reason, part of him was starting to envy the way Snack gets to rest between her tits, or even the way Treat sometimes gets to cuddle up in her pants\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lyra was instead entranced by the beautiful little subterranean lakes dotting the cave. As she looked into them, she could swear she saw movement. <b>\u201cHmm? Are there actually fish down there?\u201d</b> She said, intrigued, not even knowing such a thing is possible. She leaned over the water, trying to spot any more movement beneath its surface\u2026 only for her weight belly to knock her off balance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh shit!\u201d</b> She let out a scream as she accidentally plunged face-first into the water, immediately thrashing like wild. She tried her best to keep herself floating, but with her immense weight, it was difficult. Eventually, though, she managed to lift her head above water. <b>\u201cEthan! Heeeelp! I can\u2019t - ack - swim!\u201d</b> She yelled as she splashed around, frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was, of course, alarmed by the display. What the hell was he supposed to do? Try to lift her up out of the water? She was 400 pounds at this point! Eventually, though, he realizes that the pools of water around here probably weren\u2019t nearly as deep as she assumed they were. \u201cTry standing up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his advice, Lyra hesitantly tried to right herself\u2026 and felt her feet press against the bottom of the pool! With her height, when she stood up, the water only came up to her chest. <b>\u201c... oh. Heh! Thanks,\u201d</b> she laughed, relieved that she wasn\u2019t drowning anymore. The water was actually comfortably warm, in fact, to her surprise. Ethan didn\u2019t respond though, as he was too busy staring at her chest, his eyes wide and his cheeks flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plunge had ripped her bikini top right off! Ethan stared in awe at the mountain of a woman\u2019s huge, round, pillowy breasts in all their glory. This was the first time he\u2019s seen a woman\u2019s tits before, and he was truly blown away. Meanwhile, her Pokemon had also been knocked from her cleavage, and the poor dears were now swimming back to shore.  Lyra was a little confused by the look he was giving her, until she looked down and realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHehe\u2026 like what you see?\u201d</b> She giggled, pushing her breasts up with her hands, a teasing look on her face. Overwhelmed, Ethan immediately looked away, covering his face with his hands. Chuckling, Lyra turned to try and find her top\u2026 only to feel a small fin press against her thigh for a moment! <b>\u201cOh! Well, what do we have here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, only to clearly see movement beneath the water! There really were fish in this pool! She froze up, trying not to startle them\u2026 only to suddenly thrust her hand down into the water! The fish she grabbed immediately started squirming with all its might, but the huge woman was easily able to overpower it, pulling it up by its tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a goldeen! Lyra smiled and licked her lips as it wriggles around futilely in her grip. While trekking down Route 32, her powerful stomach had completely processed her huge meal\u2026 and she was always in the mood for seafood! Ethan peeked through his fingers, watching with shameful interest as Lyra held the goldeen up above her lips, and dropped it in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cooed at the taste as she leaned back, only the fish\u2019s tail still poking out from her lips, thrashing around while Lyra savored its taste. Eventually, she slurped up its tail like a noodle, and a big round bulge slipped down her throat, disappearing into her waiting, churning gut. Invigorated by the taste, Lyra immediately dived beneath the water for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a familiar sight. Once Lyra was overcome by gluttony, nothing could stop her. A countless number of magikarps and goldeens easily slipped down her throat one by one, while Ethan could only watch with awe. Eventually, Lyra was the searching the pool for more\u2026 until realizing there wasn\u2019t any more! She had devoured every single Pokemon in the entire pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out an aroused coo as she rubbed and patted her once again huge and bulging gut, turned on by the knowledge she\u2019s completely transferred all the pools Pokemon to instead swim around in her gastric acids. She always likes feeling like she\u2019s single-handedly wiped out a community, however small it may be. There were many other pools in Union cave, though, so if she wanted to wipe them all out, it would take a while\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had no such ambitions. These fish, while they didn\u2019t fill her up completely, did enough to sate her appetite for now. She glanced around, finding her bikini top floating around in the pool, and slid it back on again before climbing out of the wall. <b>\u201cMm, mm!\u201d</b> She smiled, patting her gut, amused by the look on Ethan\u2019s face. She\u2019d never get tired of a belly full of Pokemon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group continued on their way. Lyra noticed she didn\u2019t even have to stuff her Pokemon between her tits for them to follow her anymore; through her abuse, she had whipped them all into a group that was loyal, and secretly attracted, to her. That thought made her smile. Everyone in Johto should be looking at her with the same awe and devotion Ethan and her Pokemon seemed to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they descended deeper into the cave, passing by many more strange pools, they suddenly heard something huge slithering around in the distance, its every movement echoing through the cave. Lyra stopped in her tracks\u2026 and Ethan noticed that even she seemed to be a little frightened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a giant fuckin\u2019 snake made out of rocks showed up! It was almost thirty feet from its head to its tail, and it had a pissed off look on its face! <b>\u201cHoly shit, it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 huge!\u201d</b> Truly, something of this size must be absolutely unstoppable! She immediately turned around, ready to flee, when Ethan suddenly poked her in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra\u2026\u201d He said, looking up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s just an onix. They\u2019re\u2026 not actually that much stronger than any other Pokemon.\u201d Lyra turned back, looking nervously up at the onix. This huge thing was just as weak as all those geodudes and rattatas running around here? That was hard to believe\u2026 but it at least seemed to be more interested battling than killing her, so, might as well give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUmm\u2026 okay. Uh, Snack! U-use Ember!\u201d</b> She points up at the onix. Snack unleashes yet another fireball, hitting the giant rock Pokemon right in the face\u2026 and Lyra watches in awe as the entire, huge serpent creature was knocked back, immediately slamming to the ground, unconscious. <b>\u201cWhoa! That was badass!\u201d</b> She cheered for Snack, and the quilava seemed pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra strutted confidently through the rest of the cave, now certain that her team could overcome any obstacle the world throws at them. When they reached the end of Union Cave, she stuck her Pokemon back between her tits, and basked in the warmth of the sunlight as she stepped back into the outside world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 33 was lame. There was like one hiker there who tried to challenge Lyra to a battle, but she just walked right past him. Overall it was a fuckin\u2019 boring route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally approach Azalea town, they hear two men bickering loudly about something. She peeks in to see some young man in a goofy black outfit arguing with an old man, saying something about \u2018team rocket\u2019. Suddenly, the rocket dude rears back and punches the old man in the face! Lyra laughs uproariously at the sight, as the old man runs away crying like a bitch. She likes this guy\u2019s style!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man in the goofy outfit seemed to be guarding some kind of old well. Lyra didn\u2019t mind this. After all, why would she care about some boring fuckin\u2019 well? So, she just easily walks on by, deciding to mind her own business unlike that whiny old man. She had come to azalea for a single purpose; getting another gym badge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made it to azalea town, it\u2026 kind of sucked. It was about as big as New Bark, but a lot shittier, with houses with old thatch roofs that went out of style literally centuries ago. Really, the only reason anyone ever comes to Azalea is for the gym. The gym that\u2019s run by a little kid, by the way, meaning it\u2019s a terrible gym. Basically, everything about Azalea town was just awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra sighed, trying to keep her eyes on the prize. Sure, Azalea town sucks, but she\u2019ll only have to stay here for a day or two. Then she can move on to Goldenrod City; the best and biggest city in all of Johto! Right now, though, she had to find a place to stay around here. It was getting late, and the sun would be setting soon....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Near the Bug Type Pokemon Gym, there was a small house with a comically oversized chimney that was constantly spewing out black smoke. There was a sign placed on the front lawn of the place, that read: \u2018Azalea Charcoal Kiln / B&amp;B\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Kiln?\u201d Lyra tilted her head as she read the sign. \u201cWhat the fuck is a Kiln?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a old oven thing that people used to make bricks and clay.\u201d Ethan answered for her, having conveniently known the information like the little nerd he was. Lyra rolled her eyes slightly, of course the little shit would know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they got a roof to sleep under and free breakfast, I\u2019m seeing all green lights. How about it, Ethan?\u201d Lyra turned her body towards the small child, making her whole body wobble. She knew she didn\u2019t have to ask, she could have easily just marched up to the door and Ethan would follow her without protest. But she wanted to test something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked up at Lyra with a sad frown on his face. \u201cYou mean...you want us to sleep in a charcoal factory?\u201d He questioned, not seeing any appeal in staying a night in an archaic wood furnace. To him, roughing it out under the stars seemed like a more preferable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lyra grabbed Ethan by his sides and lifted him off the ground with ease. The little boy made a surprised gasp, but knew better than to struggle, which would only make the grip around him tightened. Without an warning, his body was pulled into a bear hug as his kidnapper pressed him against her soft, fat, sweaty, naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ethan~\u201d Lyra cooed manipulatively as she brushed the nine year old\u2019s head as it rested between her pillowy tits. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me! All of the sudden you looked so small and cute, and I just wanted to give ya a big ol\u2019 hug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face was so red it could have been mistaken for a tomato. His whole frame sunk into Lyra\u2019s heavy padding, quivering like jello before settling and molding over him. He was lost in a sea of blubber and warmth, his mind muddled as he couldn't help but return the hug. Finally, Lyra released him, and he stepped back in a bit of a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo...what was that about staying here Ethan?\u201d Lyra asked the confused boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh...I think it\u2019s a great idea Lyra!\u201d Ethan faked a grin. \u201cC-c\u2019mon! We don\u2019t wanna get caught out in the dark!\u201d With that, he walked ahead of Lyra towards the front door of the Kiln, leaving his traveling companion smiling evilly as he did so. She had the little shit wrapped around her fat thumb so much, he couldn't say no to her at all. True, he probably won\u2019t ever warm up to her eating live Pokemon, but she knows she loves her body. And it was only gonna get bigger the more she ate, more fat flesh for her lil\u2019 Ethan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ethan ringed the doorbell, the two of them felt the Earth underneath them shake a little bit. At first, Lyra thought nothing of it, but soon the tremors intensified and grew louder with each passing second. Just when it seemed to reach their peak, they had all but abruptly stopped. Following the tremors, the front doorway frame all of the sudden burst open in an explosion of splinters and bits of wood, which scratched Ethan\u2019s skin and only bounded harmlessly off Lyra\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were joined by a bit of concrete too, as the surrounding wall had cracked and given way quite a bit as well as a massive women from inside the small house forced her bulk through the hole in the wall she made to greet the visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there you two, what can I help you with today?\u201d The gargantuan women from inside spoke warmly and with a southern drawl. Ethan and Lyra looked up in awe and alarm at the sight of her. Her skin was cocoa brown, her hair a bright blonde, but most importantly, she was fat. Fatter than Lyra, that was for sure. Her breasts were larger, her butt was larger, even her belly was larger than the eighteen year old\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, Lyra was a tad jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi!\u201d Ethan waved his hand weakly at the sight of the dominating women. She was fully clothed in a pair of overalls and white tee, but that wasn't distracting from how huge she was. \u201cUmm, we were just heading into town, and your sign said B&amp;B, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more, sonny!\u201d The obese women chuckled. \u201cSure, I got a room ready for some weary travelers. Why don\u2019t you come on in for a while? Supper\u2019s almost ready!\u201d With that, the big women ducked her head back into her house, shaking her ass on purpose as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, what a showoff\u2026\u201d Lyra muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house itself was a lot bigger on the inside than it looked from the outside. Most of the building was actually underground, with the structure on ground level a decorative remnant from the old house that used to be there. It seemed to be both a home for the gigantic women, and a heavily organized and industrialized charcoal plant. The women had a standing army of a hundred Farfetch'd that manned the whole operation while she reaped the benefits. The poor Pokemon worked tirelessly chopping down the trees to turn into charcaol to sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been running this here operation for about six months now!\u201d The giant women proudly exclaimed, the four of them gathered around a massive dinner table piled with enough food to feed a starving family of nine. \u201cIt\u2019s only been such a short spell, but I\u2019ve already chopped down a couple thousand trees from Ilex Forest, and the money don\u2019t lie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thousands?!\u201d Ethan explained, obviously shocked. \u201cB-but I thought that the Ilex Forest was a environmentally protected preserve!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was sugarcube~\u201d the bigger women giggled. \u201cBut us fat folk decided to cut down the whole place! Where expanding, lil boy! In more ways than one!\u201d She patted her stuffed belly with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shuddered in disgust as Lyra nodded at the women\u2019s statement through a mouthful of grilled Miltank. Are they're really more women like Lyra out they're that only care about getting fatter...and fatter...and fatter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook himself out of his fantasies. \u201cUm...I don\u2019t mean to pry miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, you can just call me Octavia! No need for any Ms of Mrs around here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Octavia.\u201d Ethan countinued, \u201cBut could you...I mean, what do you mean by \u2018more ways than one\u2019?\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was a pretty vague answer you gave him. If you gonna say something, say it right.\u201d Lyra commented rudely as she washed down a hamburger with a swig of bubbly cola. Ethan, at first, thought the two of them would get kicked out for being so impolite, but Octavia just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like you style, small fry! Sweet and straight to the point! Alright, kid, here\u2019s the lowdown,\u201d Octavia than got up from her steel reinforced chair and began to move down Sears the air right next to Ethan. The small boy blushed as the massive women sat down, her side belly and thighs spilling into his world of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see sweetie, up where I\u2019m from, Goldenrod City, there\u2019s a whole bunch of beautiful gals like me. We just love eating more than we love breathing, and nothing makes us feel more happy than getting ourselves more and more cuddly and blubbery!\u201d Octavia patted her tanned gut like a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, the bigger we get, the more food we need to keep ourselves full, and less space for us to walk around. So, we got together and decided to bulldoze that measly little tree field to pave way for Goldenrod\u2019s new City district. Plus, all the Pok\u00e9mon that used to live there makes it one big buffet, so it\u2019s a win-win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked up at Octavia with a flabbergasted expression. She spoke about the destruction of an ancient ecosystem and thousands of Pok\u00e9mon so casually! It made Ethan sick to his stomach, but oddly enticed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW- what about Celebi, the Guardian of the forest? Won\u2019t they give you a hard time?\u201d Ethan asked, remembering the legend of the mythical Pok\u00e9mon that protected the Illex Forest from Destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t you worry your lil\u2019 head about me, tiger! That speck of salad hardly gave me any trouble at all!\u201d Octavia assured with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...wait\u2026\u201d Ethan looked down at the burgeoning side belly in front of him. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Thing didn\u2019t stand a chance against a strong girl like me!\u201d She patted her belly triumphantly, fondly remembering the meal like a long ago dream. \u201cIt was my 4th month into this operation, and things were going so smoothly. Than this angry thing started buzzing around in the air, launching attacks against my Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it wasn't very cocky after a flattened under mah big booty.\u201d Octavia snickers and slapped her ass hard. \u201cIn the end, it tasted kinda skimpy, but now there's no one stopping us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait, back up a second!\u201d Lyra interrupted as she swallowed the last bits of Poffin Cake. \u201cThis new Goldenrod place...will it have food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure darling, of course!\u201d Octavia chuckled. \u201cWere gonna call it the Restaurant District, it\u2019s gonna be dedicated to big gals like us! And after we cut down the Forest, We\u2019ll get the rights to bulldoze this boring ol\u2019 town into a place where people will actually wanna come here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Lyra seemed to get sparkles in her eyes. If what this lard ass is saying could be true\u2026\u201dTell me more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra got up from her seat to sit next to her much more fat hostess, which happened to be Ethan\u2019s seat. Before he could a get a word of protest in, her fat butt came crashing down on his lap, and was silenced from the world as waves of back fat filled his mouth and covered his eyes. Thankfully, the immense pressure caused by her weight was canceled out by the plushness of her fat booty. It hurt, but not as much as he thought it would.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan was outraged that these huge fatties were ruining Johto in the name of their gluttony! Before he could squeak out a word in protest, though, Lyra suddenly sat on him without warning, wanting to be close to Octavia! He was pressed tightly up against her huge, jiggly, bare booty flesh, which smothered most of his small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis complaints were muffled by her rolls of fat, and all he could do was wriggle around beneath her until he wedged his way into a more comfortable spot. The weight was immense, but it was actually quite comfortable, and being pinned against her butt made him feel funny. He knew why Treat liked it here so much, now. With that\u2026 all he could really do was get settled in and wait for her to get up eventually\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lyra\u2019s quickly warmed up to Octavia! She thought Johto was completely filled with complete morons\u2026 but when she talked to her fellow larger gals, she felt like she had finally found her people! Lyra was ecstatic about their plans to turn this side of this boring region into a veritable utopia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the ladies didn\u2019t share her relentless appetite for Pokemon, but they certainly had a robust taste in food! Their seemed to be a seemingly infinite surplus of meals served up on her plate over the night, and the way all the other ladies chowed down so easily made Lyra really want to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Ethan felt the pressure bearing down on him grow bigger and bigger as Lyra stuffed herself silly, chowing down on exotic and perfectly-prepared foods from all over the world. All the while, she laughed and chatted loudly with her new comrades. They all seemed to find Lyra\u2019s jokes and frank observations about how stupid all the scrawny trainers were hilarious, so she fit right in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew by fast, and before she knew it, this simple \u2018dinner\u2019 had stretched on for a few hours. She only realized just how much time had passed when the other women started to retreat to their quarters, eventually leaving her and Olivia alone. Eventually, Lyra realized that Ethan wasn\u2019t moving a muscle beneath her anymore, and for a moment, she was concerned she might\u2019ve smothered him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted herself off of the boy\u2026 only to find that he\u2019d been lulled to sleep by the comfiness of her booty, a smile on his face as he slumbered peacefully there. Octavia piped up upon seeing them. \u201cAaawww! Look at \u2018im! He\u2019s like a little teddy bear!\u201d Ethan was suddenly torn from his slumber when the woman easily lifted him up in her tubby arms, and he found himself suddenly smothered in belly flesh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis yelp was muffled by her big, fully, sloshing belly as Octavia swung herself back and forth, snuggling the small boy. Eventually, she pulled him up, letting him get some fresh air. \u201cYou are just so cute! I could eat you up!\u201d She said, as Ethan looked at her huge, round, smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis addled mind immediately misinterpreted her statement, and he started squirming in her grip! After seeing what a smaller woman like Lyra\u2019s capable of, he knew that a woman Octavia\u2019s size could gulp him down for sure! \u201cNo! Please! Don\u2019t!\u201d He whimpered, trying to pry her tubby fingers off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Octavia just laughs. \u201cPffft! Calm down, sugar cube! It\u2019s a figure of speech,\u201d she said, before tapping her chin. \u201cThough, on second though, you do look pretty tasty\u2026\u201d Ethan let out a little yelp when she leaned forward and sent her massive tongue along his cheek, savoring his flavor like he was some kind of popsicle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra chuckled at his horrified reaction, though seeing the hungry look Octavia\u2019s face, it seemed she might actually just straight-up eat him. That prospect intrigued Lyra somewhat. It would certainly be a cool sight to see! Instead, though, after licking him like a popsicle for a while, Octavia just set Ethan on the ground, leaving him a little wobbly and disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust kiddin\u2019, sugar pie!\u201d She giggled, leaving Ethan with a big blush on his face as he\u2019s filled with confusing feelings. With a roll of her eyes, Lyra lifted him up and set the exhausted boy down on her big, comfy belly, which was now stretched even bigger and rounder than it was after he little seafood binge back in the cave. Apparently, she had lost track of how much she\u2019d been eating. Meanwhile, Octavia turns to Lyra. \u201cJust about ready to call it a day, huh? How\u2019ve you been like Azalea town so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, this kiln is great, of course,\u201d</b> she smiled, <b>\u201cbut the rest is the lamest fuckin\u2019 town I\u2019ve ever seen. And I\u2019m from New Bark!\u201d</b> They both laughed. <b>\u201cI guess I did run into some guy in black straight-up deck some old dude. That was pretty cool.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia raises a brow. \u201cGuy in black?\u201d She asks. \u201cYou mean, by the well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah,\u201d</b> Lyra nods. <b>\u201cHe seemed to be guarding it. He was wearing some goofy fuckin\u2019 uniform.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia rolled her eyes. \u201cUgh! Those bastards,\u201d she mumbles, sitting back down again, her metallic chair creaking beneath her weight somehow. \u201cThat was a Team Rocket grunt. Y\u2019know, those scrawny little shitstains that think Johto belongs to them, and hates us \u2018fatties\u2019. They\u2019ve been a huge thorn in our side through this whole operation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve never heard of \u2018em,\u201d</b> Lyra looked up at her, inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d Octavia groaned. \u201cNow that you\u2019re in Azalea, though, you\u2019re going to get tired of them quick. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to keep us out of this town, thinking we\u2019ll bulldoze the place. We used to have a nice slowpoke tail operation going in that well, but then they came and shut us down. Now, they\u2019ve even added a \u2018no fatties\u2019 rule to the local gym!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was taken aback! She\u2019s heard of skinny idiots getting up to typical skinny idiot things, but this was beyond the pale! How could these big, powerful ladies tolerate all this?  <b>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just, like\u2026\u201d</b> she shrugs. <b>\u201c... eat \u2018em?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia sighed. \u201cEverything they\u2019re doing is technically legal, so so far, we\u2019ve tried to deal with them through legal means. We can get away with a few things here and there, but mostly, we have to follow some laws, or we\u2019ll lose our funding!\u201d She explains. \u201cFor example, harming humans is a no-go, but Pokemon don\u2019t have any rights, so we can do whatever we want to \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra tapped her chin. <b>\u201c... would you lose your funding if someone else happened to take care of them for you?\u201d</b> She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia stares at her, before smirking. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cIf somebody were to, I don\u2019t know, rough \u2018em up, eat their Pokemon and scare them out of town, we\u2019d certainly be grateful.\u201d Lyra nods, obviously interested. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re interested, you should talk to that old coot, Kurt. He\u2019s the only other person to volunteer to help us, since he apparently loves fat chicks. Unfortunately, he\u2019s skinny, which basically means he\u2019s useless. You might be able to get some intel out of him, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stood up, jostling Ethan around a bit, as she was filled with dedication. <b>\u201cOn it!\u201d</b> She said, with a fiery smile on her face\u2026 but Octavia laid a hand on her shoulder, and gently pushed her back down into her chair, extinguishing her fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now. You should get a good night\u2019s rest, first!\u201d Octavia insisted, and Lyra sighed, unable to disagree. \u201cCome. There\u2019s an open bedroom fit just perfectly for a girl your size!\u201d Lyra was a little excited when the larger woman led her into a huge room. It was rare she got to sleep in a bed that was exactly the right size for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra dropped the sleepy boy and her Pokemon down on the bed, and they all instantly get cozy and drifted off. After going and getting ready for a while, she eventually joined, snuggling up with them all and enjoying the feeling of them cozied up against her big, flabby body. With a sly smile, she drifted off to sleep, feeling the happiest she\u2019s felt in a long while\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, she immediately rushed over to a mirror! Over the night, she had gained forty more pounds and 3 inches, so she was now at 7\u20197\u201d and 440 lbs. Soon, she\u2019d have a high enough BMI to be considered truly, morbidly obese. That thought filled her with glee! At this rate, soon, she\u2019d be Octavia\u2019s size again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning played out much like the night\u2019s feast. Lots of laughing and chewing, huge women hanging out, and Ethan getting teased and his cheeks pinched by a half dozen big, beautiful ladies. Once again, Lyra stuffed herself silly, the little kiln seemingly exuding an infectious sense of gluttony. Eventually, she stumbled out the door, with a huge, sloshy, gurgling gut once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2026 back to business! She had to take out these team rocket fucks. It was the least she could do for her new \u2018comrades\u2019. The only problem; should she really go and talk to that old perv, Kurt, for advice? That\u2019s what Octavia recommended, but it seemed like a waste of time. Surely, it couldn\u2019t be too difficult to just head down to the well and beat the shit out of a few grunts...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome on, Ethan! Keep up!\u201d The borderline morbidly obese eighteen year old tapped her fat foot impatiently on the cobblestone streets as she waited for Ethan to catch up with her. Lyra\u2019s increased height had elongated her legs, making walking long distances much easier for her. But, she constantly forgets that her traveling companion was much slower than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small nine-year old panted heavily as he finally caught up to Lyra after running. Azalea town may have been small, but Kurt\u2019s home was still far away from the Kiln, and Ethan was not prepared for an early morning sprint. \u201cIt\u2019s *pant* not my fault *dying wheeze* your so fa- healthy!\u201d He corrected mid gasp for precious, life giving air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mix of annoyance, sympathy, and amity going through Lyra\u2019s mind as he eyed Ethan with his hands on his knees, bent over to catch his breath with Treat rubbing his ankle to see if he was okay. There was something so...so captivating about his innocence and frailty, slowly but surely being squashed out as the real world catches up with him. The poor kid must have lived a pretty sheltered life up until she essentially stole him from New Bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, it was Lyra eating his two best friends for Pokemon, Furret and Marill, now fat on the same booty that he now worshiped. Than it was the fact that the same meat he had been eating was in fact his beloved Pokemon companions. Than the pretentiousness and self-righteousness of those hippie shits from Sprout Tower. Now, he had learned that Ilex Forest, Johto\u2019s famed ecological wonder, was being bulldozed to make way for a buffet district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the same time, Lyra felt like she had an obligation to the brat to...keep him safe. Granted, she may beat the living shit out of him if he ever crossed her, wouldn't hesitate to belittle and bully him, and just genuinely takes pleasure in seeing him suffer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Ethan gasping for breath on the ground in front of her, just made Lyra want to hold him close and never let go. He was a cute little thing, a little irritating, but not as much as before. She smirked as she walked over to him, her huge form casting a shadow over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u201d Lyra retorted to Ethan\u2019s previous comment. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an excuse for being a fucking slowpoke! Honestly, Ethan, I take you on a Pokemon Journey, and this is the best you can do? If this is the work ethic your gonna put in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 440 pound young women bent down, making her fat quake in all directions as she locked eyes with Ethan, before grabbing him by his sides and lifting him into the air. The situation was familiar to Ethan, but it never stop becoming surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you might as well stay with Snack and Omelette!\u201d Lyra said cheerily as Ethan\u2019s feet made contact with her soft tit flesh. Lyra made a surprised gasp. She couldn't possible thinking of stuffing him in their with her Pokemon, can she? But more and more of his lower body was swallowed by the cavernous breast flab, answering his own question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-lyra, put me down! I can\u2019t g-g-go in-in-in-\u201d Ethan stuttered as more and more of his small body was surrounded by jiggling cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax, ya big moron.\u201d Lyra rolled her eyes. \u201cDid you honestly think you could stay down their forever? I\u2019m only gonna get bigger, lil\u2019 man, and since you\u2019ve shown me you can't handle keeping up with all this\u201d She squeezed a roll of her belly to emphasize her point, \u201cThan staying up here, is the only logical way, isn't it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and don\u2019t think I forgot you my lil\u2019 morsel!\u201d Lyra bent down again to grab a nervous Treat from off the ground to stuff in her ass. He instantly got comfortable and settled in for the long haul, happy he could get to rest in the pillowy surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, with his chest sticking out from the top of Lyra\u2019s tits, silently folded his arms with a blush on his face as Lyra walked with a confident strut to the old geezer\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to Kurt\u2019s house did prove to be helpful. The old man, being yet another pervert fr fat teenagers, showed Lyra hidden pathways and entrances that Team Rocket most likely didn't know about, meaning she could get the jump on them. Charging in blindly is fun and all, but without a plan, Lyra could get seriously hurt. Pokemon can pack a punch! The old coot even offered to accompany Lyra and Ethan to help fight the grunts, but Lyra rudely turned him down. Looking at his face, Lyra realized that he was the same old idiot that got punched earlier. He was probably more of a burden then a help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt also fished out some special Apricorn medicine before she headed off. They were pills made from a very rare breed of Apricorn, with it about to go extinct since it could only be found in Ilex Forest. It made the digestion process speed up, making more room for meals and faster weight gain, which Lyra all but happily agreed to. She tucked it in her purse alongside her rare candies. She made a mental note not to get them mixed up. Two different types of experimental consumables that drastically alter her body? Sounds like the plot to B-movie monster flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally came to the well outside of town, and deposited Ethan and her Pokemon on to the ground before heading in. They had to be ready to be useful for when the battling starts. Snack and Omelette cracked their backs after being stuffed in their trainer's breasts. Normally, it was kinda comfortable, but since she suddenly wanted to force Ethan down in their too, there was a whole less room to move and settle. They like Ethan just fine, but they secretly hoped that Lyra would grow bigger already so they could have some more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, she had planned on just knocking out the grunt guarding the well and charge forward, defeating the skinny pricks who got in her way and eat all of their Pokemon. But, because she went to Kurt\u2019s house first, she now had the option to do go about this a different way. Around the corner, there is a secret entrance to the bottom of the well, conveniently where all the Slowpoke are being kept. She could catch them by surprise and get it over with faster, but it seemed less fun when compared to her original plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of deciding, Lyra chose to go in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well\u2026 if Lyra bothered to go talk to that old coot in the first place, she might as well try this \u2018genius\u2019 little strategy he cooked up. Otherwise, the entire thing would\u2019ve been a waste of her time. Sure, she might have a bad case of the sunk cost fallacy\u2026 but fuck it! With a grunt, she wandered over the little cavern entrance hidden away in the forest, which lead deep into the sprawling caves beneath the well. With a triumphant smirk, she stepped inside\u2026 only for the ground to immediately give way beneath her! <b>\u201cOh, fuck!\u201d</b> She screeched, as the soft mud and loose debris that composed the floor here collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sent flying down into the depths of the caverns, the last thing she saw being the cold, hard stone floor\u2026 and then, there was nothing. A while later, she awoke, immediately groaning at the splitting headache she had now. She must\u2019ve gotten some sort of concussion! With a groan, she pried open her eyes\u2026 only to realize she was tied up! Those damn team rocket grunts must\u2019ve found her while she was unconscious! <b>\u201cDamn it! Next time I see that old dickhead, Kirk, I\u2019m gonna beat the shit out of him!\u201d</b> She groaned out loud, blaming her situation on that old man\u2019s stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wriggles a bit, trying to escape from her binds. Her size made her strong, but the rope was stronger. She looked around, noticing that she wa on some sort of island of rocks in the center of a little underground lake, on the lowest floor of the well. Ethan and her Pokemon weren\u2019t anywhere to be seen. Before she could ponder her situation anymore, the dumbest-looking man she\u2019d ever seen walked out in front of her. He had a goofy black uniform, an atrocious green haircut, and an insufferably smug look on his face. \u201cHey, fatass.\u201d He smirked. \u201cDid you really think you could interfere in the affairs of the venerable Team Rocket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cLet me go, you scrawny fuck!\u201d</b> Lyra roared, enraged. She HATED the feeling of being helpless! Her quest to become bigger and fatter really came down to a desire to never feel weak or overpowered. It cut her down to the core, and filled her with rage! In response, though, the scrawny fucker only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? And let you stand by and watch you destroy this gorgeous region to sate your own gluttony?\u201d He taunted her. \u201cJohto belongs to Team Rocket. And right now, you are going to serve as a warning to the other fatties not to meddle in our affairs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a foot up against her fat belly, prepared to push her into the water\u2026 and Lyra realized what he had planned! <b>\u201cW-wait! You\u2019re not gonna fuckin\u2019 d-drown me, are you?\u201d</b> She said, filled with a mixture of furious indignation and a hint of genuine fear. <b>\u201cThe police will be on your dumb ass in an instant!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cackled, stepping back. <i>\u201cOh, officer, it was just terrible! She tried sneaking on, but the floor must\u2019ve collapsed right under her or somethin\u2019! She just fell right in the water!\u201d</i> He mimicked in a mocking voice, looking up and pressing his hands against his cheeks. <i>\u201cPoor girl sunk like a rock! We tried to rescue her in time, but she just too heavy\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to come up with a convincing argument\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have any. So, instead, she just tried insulting him. <b>\u201cIs this the best leadership Team Rocket has?\u201d</b> She growled. <b>\u201cThey expect me to scared of Captain Shit-For-Brains here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know my name is Proton. One of the most feared members of Team Rocket\u2026 and you\u2019re about to find out why.\u201d He pushed her up to the edge of the water. A single extra shove, and she\u2019d sink like a brick. \u201cAny last words?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared down at him. <b>\u201c\u2018Proton\u2019 is the dumbest fucking name I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</b> And with that, Lyra was dunked into the freezing cold water! She let out a scream, but all that escaped her mouth was a few bubbles. She squirmed frantically against her ropes, but even if she did manage to break them, she didn\u2019t know how to swim anyway. Eventually, as she sunk deeper and deeper, the lack of oxygen got to her, and she started to lose consciousness. This was how she was going to die, down here in some dark cave, murdered by a man with fuckin\u2019 green hair\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shot open, however, when she saw a familiar orange face; it was Treat! Lyra let out an excited shout as the buizel swam up to her. He blew a huge bubble, which engulfed Lyra\u2019s head, giving her a bit of air. She immediately gulped down as much air as she could, filling her lungs. It was stale, but it was better than nothing. With that, the buizel swam over to her butt and pressed against it, before spinning his tail like mad, propelling the two of them up towards the surface! Eventually, he managed to push Lyra up onto the shore of the rocks, watching her gasp for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat was fuckin\u2019 awesome, Treat!\u201d</b> She eventually smiled, once she was done coughing up water. The little buizel saved her life, and has thus earned her eternal respect! It was good to know that he was so loyal, he\u2019d save her even when he had no real benefit to doing so. Lyra and Buizel spent the next few moments tediously pulling the ropes off of her. After the fall, her meager clothing fell off, and she was completely naked, leaving her a little chilly after her plunge into the freezing pool. <b>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ethan and the others?\u201d</b> She asked, and the buizel pointed up a nearby ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to climb the ladder very carefully, as it stained beneath her weight, but eventually, she made it up and started hearing voices. She immediately hid behind a rock, peeking out at the activity occurring beyond. She noticed a few team rocket grunts all around\u2026 and most importantly, she noticed Proton bullying Ethan! \u201cWe saved you from that fatass, and this is how you repay us?\u201d He yelled at the crying, bruised boy. Snack and Omelet were nowhere to be seen. The Rocket grunts probably already stole them with their fancy Pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not gonna let you have Buizel\u2026\u201d Ethan cried. Lyra realized that Ethan must\u2019ve been the one to release Treat, and whom sent the buizel to go rescue her! Her respect for the boy reached an all-time peak, which is why it enraged her so much to see Proton bully him. With one last slap, Ethan fell to the ground at Proton\u2019s feet, crying. Furious, the man with the green hair pointed at two of his grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! You! Go find that buizel!\u201d He shouted. With a nod, the two walked towards the ladder. It wouldn\u2019t be long until Lyra was found! She had to rely on the element of surprise. Her Pokemon were mostly stolen, so she was going to have to rely on her sheer strength for this one...</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t know if he would be able to take on the Team Rocket Admin without direction, but is was certainly better than being forced up against two meatheads. Lyra patted him on the head and pointed the finger at the scrawny ass man who had bullied Ethan to tears. And while he dealt with him, she will deal with the grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArceus damnit!\u201d Grunt 1 exclaimed in frustration him and his partner traversed through the cavern. \u201cWhere the hell is that stupid Buizel?! It can\u2019t be that hard to find, it\u2019s fucking orange for crying out loud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you complaining about it aint gonna make it come out, asswipe!\u201d Grunt 2 smacked Grunt 1 on the back of his head. \u201cJust keep your trap shut an\u2019 we\u2019ll find it eventually!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two grunts began to hear something from behind them. Turning around, they only saw darkness in front of them from an absence of light, but they could definitely hear footsteps running towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look at that! Complaining about it did make him come out!\u201d Grunt 1 said smugly as he bent down to capture the rare water type running towards them. \u201cCome here lil\u2019 moneymaker, come to papa\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dude. I don\u2019t think that -\u201d Grunt 2 interrupted after realizing the footfalls sounded too heavy to be a tiny Pokemon\u2019s, but was rudely interjected by Lyra\u2019s fat foot smashing against Grunt 1\u2019s face, breaking his lower jaw and re-aligning his nose. Grunt 2 watched in horror as his partner was punted across the cavern floor by the portly trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunt 2 looked back at Lyra, \u201cYou-y-you bitch!\u201d He exclaimed angrily. \u201cYou should be dead! Our boss put in the water! Fuck it, it doesn't matter. If water won\u2019t kill you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Team Rocket flunky snagged a Pokeball from his belt and threw it to the ground. It opened and a stream of light erupted from the split. The light soon materialized to reveal...the most disgusting Pok\u00e9mon Lyra had ever seen. It was a purple, spherical Pokemon with vacant eyes, a toothless mouth, and pores all over that constantly spewed out toxic gasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan poison will!\u201d The grunt continued. \u201cKoffing, use Smog!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poison type Pok\u00e9mon obeyed it\u2019s master and gushed up a storm of bacteria laced gas into the air around Lyra. The morbidly obese trainer coughed and wheezed as the bad air got in her mouth. She held her breath and thought up her straty through the toxic smog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I can\u2019t eat it, that\u2019s for sure. The fucking thing probably rolls around in shit to get that smell.\u2019 Lyra pondered. \u2018I just got to wait for it to come to me, than BAM!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKoffing, use Tackle!\u201d The grunt commanded. Sure enough, the Pokemon charged it\u2019s way into the smog cloud. Lyra couldn't see where it was coming from, so in a desperate attempt she started to throw punches and kicks everywhere at once, hoping that one of them would strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the Koffing had as much trouble as Lyra did at finding it\u2019s target. The poison cloud was to dense even for it to find its way through. Suddenly, one of her stray kicks managed to straight into the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s underside, and the spherical Pokemon was sent flying to the cavern ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Koffing was knocked unconscious, and the smog cloud dissipated as it stopped spewing gas. The Grunt was fuming with rage as Lyra smirked at his confused face. How did she do that? She\u2019s just some fatty without any Pok\u00e9mon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can dodge poison\u2026\u201d The Grunt seethed, his face red with fury. \u201cBUT YOU CAN'T DODGE BULLETS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lyra\u2019s surprise, the Team Rocket grunt pulled out a pistol from his belt and pointed it at her with his finger on the trigger. She was confused why he would call out his weak ass Pokemon instead of bringing the actual weapon out. But she didn\u2019t really care, she was more concerned with the lethal weapon inches away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny last words, bitch?\u201d The grunt cocked his gun dramatically to emphasize his point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen your pal wakes up, tell him when I get big enough, I\u2019m gonna come back to this stupid piss stain you call a town, and I am going to eat all of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDIE!\u201d The grunt shouted as he squeezed the trigger. The bullet when flying from the barrel, but to his astonishment, Lyra simply move out of the way at inhuman speed. The fuck? Does being fat make you faster too? He aimed at her again, but before he could pull the trigger, the pistol was slapped out of his hands and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grunt instantly went to grab it, only for Lyra to place her fat foot down on his back, pinning him down as she put all 400+ lbs of her body on the lithe man. He screamed in pain as she grinder her soles into the man\u2019s spinal cord, not finding the strength to grab the gun that was only 3 ft away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I said. I\u2019m gonna come back. And next time. You. Are. Food.\u201d With that, Lyra kicked the struggling bully\u2019s head and knocked him down for the count. She got off his still body and looked down in disgust at the gun next to him. What a cheap trick. Who needs bullets when you have brute strength?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra made her way back to where Proton was, to find that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That buizel\u2019s water gun was like a pressure hose, and apparently Proton had taken a blast directly to the face. <b>\u201cGood job, Treat,\u201d</b> she nodded at the buizel with a smile, walking up to the agonized little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a yelp as she lifted him up by his shirt collar, easily hefting him up into the air with her incredible strength. His struggles and squirms were completely useless, only serving to amuse her. He looked in horror at the smug, triumphant look on her face. \u201cWhat? No! Y-you\u2019re supposed to be dead!\u201d He whimpered, shocked to see her still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she dropped him flat on his face on the ground, and he groaned. He let out a little whimper of fear when Lyra straddled him, her huge booty hovering over his head. <b>\u201cYeah, well, this \u2018fatass\u2019 is full of surprises.\u201d</b> Suddenly, she dropped all her weight down on his head, and she could hear him lose a few teeth as he smashed his face into the ground! When she stood up, he was knocked out, and probably had brain damage or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was taken care of, she walked over to Ethan, untying the bruised, crying boy. He immediately whipped around and hugged her, wrapping his arms around her flabby belly, not seeming to mind her nudity. \u201cL-Lyra!\u201d He sobs, tears soaking her flabby flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey, Ethan,\u201d</b> she smiled, wrapping her arms around him and patting him on the back of the head. <b>\u201cWere you the one that released Treat?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her, nodding. \u201cYeah! I wanted him to go get you!\u201d He said. \u201cI knew you could beat up these grunts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, shit. You pretty much saved my life, then, y\u2019know,\u201d</b> she said, impressed, as they broke the hug. <b>\u201cThese scrawny shitheads were about to murder me?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what!?\u201d Ethan said, seeming shocked. \u201cWe need to go to the police!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUuuh! Let\u2019s not get the police involved,\u201d</b> she immediately stuttered, wagging a finger. Most of the things you were doing on your Pokemon journey weren\u2019t exactly legal, so you doubted the cops would be your ally here. <b>\u201cWe should just go tell Olivia.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, a while later, after they\u2019ve freed Snack and Omelet from their Pokeballs, Lyra and her loyal comrades were climbing up out of the well, their mission accomplished. Now that emotions weren\u2019t quite as high, Ethan was starting to be a little more disturbed by Lyra\u2019s nudity; especially when he climbed up below her on the ladder, giving him a clear view of her unmentionables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally pulled herself up from the well, she started shivering in the cold, every single inch of her skin bare to be assaulted by the wind. With that, they rushed back to the Kiln. Lyra did like showing off her body, but running around naked wasn\u2019t entirely pleasant, even if she was amused by the confused looks passersby were giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they made it to the kiln, a new outfit was Lyra\u2019s first order of business. She decided on something decidedly more \u2018normal\u2019 this time. She donned a more typical trainer vest and jeans, though her outfit was obviously designed for girls like her, as it clearly showed off her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they sat down with Olivia, and told the much larger woman about everything that had happened. \u201cSo it\u2019s come to that, huh?\u201d Olivia frowned when Lyra mentioned that Proton had genuinely tried to drown her.  \u201cThose Team Rocket bastards are trying to start a war they can\u2019t win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou know\u2026 I know your hands and tied and all, but I do wonder if you\u2019d appreciate someone \u2018dealing\u2019 with those guys\u2026 permanently,\u201d</b> Lyra said with a sly smirk, patting her big, round belly. Olivia responded with a smirk in kind, realizing what the smaller girl meant by that. Lyra was going to have to get a lot bigger if she was going to start eating people, though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s put a pin in that.\u201d Olivia waved a hand, dismissively. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s discuss payment. You\u2019ve done us a great service taking back that well. Slowpoke tails are a very lucrative business. Besides, after everything you went though\u2026 I think you deserve a proper reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was excited at the thought. <b>\u201cReward? Like what?\u201d</b> She asked. <b>\u201cI already have more than enough money.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it depends on what you desire, really. If you\u2019re not interested in money, perhaps there\u2019s some sort of dish you want to try? Maybe some particularly rare Pokemon?\u201d Olivia offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra perked up immediately. <b>\u201cRare Pokemon?\u201d</b> She smiled. She always liked rare Pokemon! <b>\u201cWhat kind of rare Pokemon do you got?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an amused expression, Olivia rummaged around through her bag, before finally pulling out a fancy white Pokemon. \u201cWell, if you request a species in particular, we can go find one for you. The only one I have on me at the moment is this\u2026\u201d She pulled out a Pokeball, and pressed the little button on the front, and a Pokemon appeared in a blinding flash of red light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 Arceus\u2026\u201d</b> She muttered under her breath, staring down at the smiling, fluffy little Pokemon on the table in sheer awe. Just when she thought she\u2019d seen the most adorable Pokemon in Johto, this trumped them all. <b>\u201cThis is\u2026 the most precious cuddly-wuddly little cutie patootie that has ever walked or crawled on this green Earth!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately wrapped her arms around it, hugging it tightly into the soft, squishy folds of her belly as she practically squealed in excitement! In response to the huge woman\u2019s bear hug, the little Pokemon just cooed happily, evidently used to being manhandled by big, fat ladies like Lyra. It was a little, fluffy brown-furred fox creature, but with a flat face like a cat\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm. That\u2019s an Eevee. Fascinating little buggers. Their DNA is all messed up, so they can evolve into almost any type you could imagine,\u201d Olivia nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re usually used as designer Pokemon for rich folk, but they\u2019re decent in battle, too.\u201d Meanwhile, the little eevee seemed to be loving all the attention she was getting from Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Pokemon watched on with envy as Lyra played with the eevee, squealing and giggling over how adorable the damn thing was. Even Ethan was starting to feel a little jealous. Eventually, though, the novelty wore off, and Lyra simply stuffed her newly-acquired Pokemon between her tits. It was so warm and fluffy, it felt great between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she sent Snack and Omelet there too, and settled Treat in his favorite spot in the back of her pants. Ethan silently wished he\u2019d have the opportunity to slip back into her cleavage again, but he\u2019d probably look pretty weird now that Lyra\u2019s walking around in public. Satisfied with her gains, Lyra stepped happily out of the kiln, feeling ready to take on the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of her wants to head straight to Goldenrod\u2026 but she knows she has to get this gym\u2019s lame badge before she can head out...</span></div></div>",

Maybe even see the construction of the urban extension was coming along. But, she was a Pokemon Trainer, which meant that she should probably try to collect the Johto Gym Badges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra doesn't really have any interest in becoming the Pokemon Champion or master, whatever it\u2019s called. But she does have an interest in asserting her dominance in life, so she supposed that being the best damn trainer in the world was something to gloat about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of turning to the slowly eroding Ilex Forest, she walked with Ethan in tow to the Bug-Type Gym. She could feel her newly acquired Eevee squirm around and play in her titflesh much to the annoyance of Omelette and Snack. It seemed the adorable Pokemon was bred from day one to practically worship fat humans, as it should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Ethan, we\u2019re here.\u201d Lyra stated as she stopped at the entrance to the Gym. She let out all of the Pokemon hiding in her folds of fat and turned to the small child. \u201cNow win me another badge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ethan looked at Lyra incredulously. \u201cBut I won you a badge last time!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well tough shit.\u201d Lyra put her pudgy hands on her meaty hips in a scolding fashion. \u201cI\u2019m not going in that insect garden, the Pokemon inside are super gross! Besides, Bug-Type\u2019s don\u2019t sit well with my stomach.\u201d She patted her soft, exposed gut for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan groaned, but knew better than to protest further. Lyra always gets what she wants, one way or the other. He put on his best trainer smile and picked up Treat while Snack and Omelette followed him wordlessly into the building. The Eevee paused for a moment, not wanting to leave it\u2019s master, but decided to follow anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, speedster!\u201d Lyra exclaimed, making the Eevee stop in its tracks to look back at her. She was looking down at the brown Pokemon with a sly grin. \u201cWhere do you think your going? Before you can battle on my team, don;t you think we should...spend some time to know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee blinked before jumping up and down in excitement. It ran up to Lyra\u2019s feet and sat down with it\u2019s tail wagging like crazy. She chuckled smugly at the innocent expression on her Pokemon\u2019s face. This was almost too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s head some place a bit more private. We don\u2019t want anyone interrupting our fun, do we?\u201d Lyra asked with a shake of her hips. The Eevee shook its head eagerly, and it\u2019s master began to confidently strut to the back of the Gym where no one could find them. It covered in shade with some stray bits of litter floating around. Dark and grungy, the perfect place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that no one can see us, let\u2019s play some games, alright?\u201d Lyra picked up the Eevee by the scruff of its neck and set it down against the back wall of the gym. It looked up at her a bit confused, wondering what she has in store for him. \u201cI call this one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra suddenly turned around, revealing her humongous rear end to the small Pokemon, looming over him threateningly. \u201c...Wearing in the Eevee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyra plopped her fat ass down on the poor Pokemon\u2019s body, crushing it  under her 400 pounds of weight. It struggled against the denim clad ass, but it\u2019s whole body was pinned down, unable to find the strength of fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten seconds, Lyra lifted her big butt off of the flatted Pokemon...only for it to fall back down instantly. The Eevee cried out in pain as it\u2019s furry body was pancaked to the concrete, cold ground beneath him. It\u2019s master scooted her butt back to reveal it\u2019s face to the world, but other than that, it\u2019s body was completely engulfed in clothed ass fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen to me you disgusting bag of fucking shit\u201d Lyra cursed at the small Eevee, who was wondering what it had done to deserve this. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much you love me, worship me, or fucking even masturbate to me. This right here, is all that you are ever gonna be: a tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra raised her ass again and slammed it back down on the Eevee\u2019s body, this time focused on its hind legs. The poor thing screamed in agony as more weight was put on it\u2019s frame. \u201cRight now, your my ass cushion. But who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be my dildo next, or my afternoon snack? I get hungry so much, you know, it\u2019s how I got to be a total fatass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra raised her butt one last time, and watched in glee as the horrified Eevee\u2019s face as squashed under her superior ass. She squeezed her cheeks around the Pokemon\u2019s face, becoming crushingly tight despite the layered flab. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure a chubby chaser like you just loves the idea of helping your big beautiful trainer. You\u2019re not gonna cause trouble. You\u2019re not gonna fight back. Because even though I\u2019m crushing the life out of you, you love being back their, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee grunted as it heard Lyra\u2019s words through the muffled butt fat. It was true, so horrifyingly true. Despite the fact that it\u2019s bones were rubbing against one another, it;s silky soft coat of fur ruined by the grime from the ground beneath, it couldn't help but love be absolutely dominated by such a perfect ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lyra finally got up for real, giving the poor Pokemon some well needed air in it\u2019s crushed lungs. It looked like a mess, but it had a dopey, pained smile on it\u2019s cat like face. Lyra smiled and slowly picked it up and raised it\u2019s disheveled body to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for being a good lil\u2019 boy.\u201d Lyra cooed sweetly. With that, she planted a huge, slobbery kiss on the Eevee\u2019s forehead, making the crushed thing shivering in delight and pain. She slowly dropped it\u2019s body back into her cleavage to rest, the soft, war. blubber around it lulling the brown Pokemon to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra patted her big breasts and began to walk out from behind the Pokemon Gym. She had to hand it to the Pokemon, it had been so long since she had any sort of sexual tension release, and it felt so good to just let it all out. The poor thing was such a good sport about it, too. The smile on its face just cannot be bought with money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what to name you?\u201d Lyra tapped her double chin contemplating as she pondered on what to Nickname the dozing Eevee in her boobs. \u201cTool? Nah, too mean, even for me. Appetizer? Eh, I don\u2019t know. I wanna try having a Pokemon that isn't named after how tasty it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeping Pokemon shifted it\u2019s aching body in it\u2019s sleep. Damn, even when it\u2019s fur was partially mucky from before, it was still so soft. Lyra giggled slightly as the insides of her cleavage was bristled by the Eevee\u2019s snugly pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I\u2019m gonna call you.\u201d Lyra squeezed her rack affectionately. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re name is Pillow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the Eevee, now known as Pillow, woke up from it\u2019s soft confines, having slept well into the day\u2019s afternoon. The first thing that came into view was Lyra\u2019s huge breasts puffing out from her trainer\u2019s vest. From its position, they formed two mountains on its neck scruff\u2019s horizon. It\u2019s paws poke and prod at the huge spheres, squishy like jello in it\u2019s palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that while Lyra waited for Ethan to com out, she took a snooze herself and fell asleep on a nearby bench. She must have set Pillow on her huge tummy so it wouldn't fall onto her face while dozing. The Eevee noticed how his body sunk slightly into the extra soft padding. It slowly grumbled and growled in impatience, hungry for its next meal. Pillow wondered whatever it could be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ethan finally came out of the Gym...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t tell whether or not he was triumphant from the bored look on his face, but he damn well better have been. If he had lost, he would get the squishing of a lifetime! Sure enough, though, the boy walked up and begrudgingly held out a little, shiny medal, in the shape of a ladybug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatches it from his hand with a smug look on her face, placing it in her badge case and stuffing her Pokemon back between her tits.<b>\u201cI would say \u2018good job\u2019, but\u2026 let\u2019s be honest, you didn\u2019t really do shit, did you?\u201d</b> She teased him. <b>\u201cWith Pokemon as powerful and well-trained as mine, a braindead chimp could clear these pathetic little gyms!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan could take comfort in one fact; he was the one who was actually earning these badges. Lyra may get to parade them around, but those badges technically belonged to him. Thus, he was basically fulfilling his dreams of Pokemon a powerful Pokemon trainer, and Lyra was just along for the ride. He kept those opinions to himself, though, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGuess we can finally ditch this shithole of a town!\u201d</b> She said, excitement welling in her chest as she started making her way towards what remained of Ilex forest. At this rate, she would conquer every gym in Johto by the end of the month! Before she left town, though, she stopped in her tracks, remembering one last loose end. <b>\u201cOh! Wait. One last thing\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Kurt is lounging around his crappy little hut when he hears someone knocking loudly on the door. That must be that fat girl he\u2019d helped earlier! Filled with excitement, he rushed to answer the door\u2026 only to be greeted by a huge, chubby fist colliding with his face! He stumbled to the ground, his nose bloodied and broken as Lyra loomed over him. <b>\u201cYour plan fuckin\u2019 sucked, old man!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 aaand with that out of the way, off they went! Lyra\u2019s eyes immediately lit up when she laid eyes on the construction of the restaurant district! It looked like an absolutely massive project, and she was impressed by the sheer size and opulence of the restaurants they were constructing. It looked like an absolute paradise in the making!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, despite going on for months, it was still in its very early stages, as one would expect from a project of this scale. Only a few buildings have finished construction, and even all the trees still hadn\u2019t been cleared; there were still little patches of forest where the few surviving Pokemon hid in misery and despair, terrified of the huge ladies around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe admired the construction progress as she strolled through. It was mostly scrawny, underpaid workers, being led by big, pudgy forewomen who impressed them all with their sheer strength. A few of the workers gasped at the sight of a 12-foot tall woman carrying a steel girder like a Conkeldurr! Lyra just giggled at the sight. Truly, fat was the future\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she navigated the complex construction zone, though, she couldn\u2019t help but notice her loudly growling belly. Apparently, her near-death experience has really caused her to work up an appetite, and the sight of all these restaurants being constructed can\u2019t hurt. Eventually, she found one that seemed to be open, and curiously stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking braindead idiot! You probably couldn\u2019t even cook fuckin\u2019 mac and cheese!\u201d She heard a loud, familiar voice yelling. \u201cGet the fuck out of my kitchen! Out, out, out!\u201d A scrawny little chef emerged from the kitchen, tears in his eyes as he stumbled out of the restaurant. Meanwhile, Lyra just perked up, straining her ears to identify the source of the shouting. Could it be\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s heart leaped in her chest as she glanced into the kitchen. There she was! Irene - one of the most famous celebrity chefs in Johto, and one of the fattest, too! Her white uniform barely squeezed around the curves of the massive, 20-foot tall woman. She was truly a breath-taking sight to behold! She was probably the biggest woman Lyra\u2019s seen on her adventure so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe constantly yelled at any abused the scrawny chefs that worked under her for the tiniest of mistakes. It was actually pretty hilarious to watch, though Ethan seemed to be disturbed by the sight. Eventually, though, Irene noticed Lyra standing there at the front desk, and seemed relieved to see a fellow fatty. She barked some more orders to the poor chefs before slipping out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, sorry about that! It just gets so frustrating! I swear, these scrawny fuckin\u2019 morons wouldn\u2019t know how to cook if-\u201d She was about to ramble, only to blush when she realized she was being crude with a customer. \u201cAhem! Sorry! I get a little passionate sometimes.\u201d Lyra noticed Ethan hiding behind her, obviously frightened by Irene\u2019s sheer size. Not to say that Lyra wasn\u2019t a little intimidated herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked up at Irene in awe. She had actually looked up to the chef when she was little; mostly for her size and power, though. Cooking was never her passion. <b>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay!\u201d</b> Lyra insisted. <b>\u201cI mean\u2026 skinny people are pretty stupid, yeah. Why don\u2019t you hire chefs that are a little more\u2026 robust?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene sighed, wiping some sweat from her brow. \u201cThe problem with that is, fat chefs always end up eating all the food!\u201d She complained. \u201cBesides, these scrawny pricks can suffice if you run a tight enough ship. But anyway, you don\u2019t have to listen to me ramble. What can I help you with today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuttered, having momentarily forgotten why she had even walked in here. <b>\u201cW-well\u2026 I was just wondering if you were open yet?\u201d</b> Lyra asked, patting her own, comparatively smaller belly. <b>\u201cI just got done beating up some Team Rocket chumps in Azalea town, and I think I worked up an appetite\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene perked up. \u201cWhat? Really? Well, I\u2019ll be!\u201d She smiled, impressed by the smaller girl\u2019s work. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to put the boots to those bastards myself, but you know how it is. It seems the law favors the scrawny nowadays\u2026\u201d Irene gave a big, forlorn sigh, her belly expanding with air for a moment as she inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, yes, we\u2019re not really set up yet, but we are up and running. Right now, we\u2019re only serving larger gals, though,\u201d Irene explained. Lyra seemed a little sad, thinking she didn\u2019t make the cut. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019re more than large enough, dear. Here, right this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene led her and Ethan to a table\u2026 which was a little weird for the head chef to do, but it seemed they didn\u2019t have any service staff yet. There were a few other women her size eating at the nearby tables, but for the most part, the restaurant was empty. With a satisfied sigh, Lyra sat down with Ethan at one of the booths, excited to see what this restaurant has to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re only serving larger gals at the moment. Well, this restaurant is trying out some new cuisine\u2026\u201d Irene said, pulling out two distinct menus for some reason. \u201cUnlike our regular menu, it\u2019s all free of charge, but it\u2019s also very\u2026 experimental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra perked up, a little intrigued. What, exactly, did Irene mean by \u2018experimental\u2019? She supposes there\u2019s only one way to find out. After a moment of consideration, she chose the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra, being the adventurous eighteen year old, decided to take a trip on the wild side and chose the experimental menu. She had more than enough money to pay for regular food, but if it was food specifically made for fatties like herself, than that\u2019s what she should be eating, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene smiled down at the comparatively lithe fatty and handed her the experimental menu. Ethan, however, found himself completely ignored as Lyra read from her menu and he had none. After getting beat up by some Team Rocket grunts and beating the Pokemon gym back in Azalea, he was understandably hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he finally worked up the courage to ask the massive chef for some food, Lyra cut him off before he could utter a single syllable. \u201cI\u2019ll think I\u2019m gonna go with the \u2018Rare Candy Pancake Surprise\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent choice!\u201d Irene smiled as she was handed back the mysterious menu. \u201cI would get something for your friend over here, but we\u2019re only serving fatties right now.\u201d She glanced down at Ethan who sunk into his seat under her gaze. \u201cNothing personal kid, but I\u2019ve had it up to here with you skinnies today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright! Ethan here has a thick skin!\u201d Lyra patted him on the head like a pet, making him blush hard. \u201cI should know, I helped him grow it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you did.\u201d Irene chuckled. There was no doubt in her mind that this girl had basically stole Ethan away from wherever he was. The way he constantly eyes her body yet is deathly afraid if it, the way Lyra talked to the kid was like a bully trying to express her emotions for her victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of common with the fat community. Men are seen as toys, slaves, pets, and only sometimes equal. Only women can ever get the physical condition to bloat with muscle and fat. So, with such a power gap between the two genders, it\u2019s obvious which one would be in charge of the relationship. The way Lyra treated Ethan reminded Irene of how she mercilessly teased the boy she was sweet on was she was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I those scrawny asses in the kitchen to fix up your meal, you do know what happens when a fatty like you and me eats rare candy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s like, some kind of superfood that makes you put on weight like crazy.\u201d Lyra patted her empty gut as Ethan stared up at her. That\u2019s how she grew a couple of days ago in Cherrygrove!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...ma\u2019am?\u201d Ethan piped in quietly. \u201cAren\u2019t the reason why Rare Candy is so rare because...it\u2019s outlawed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Lyra shifted her gaze from Irene to Ethan in confusion. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Why would anyone \u2018ban\u2019 food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene rolled her eyes in slight annoyance. \u201cIt WAS outlawed, skinny boy. But much like how this forest used to be protected land, it isn't now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Lyra asked, genuinely confused. \u201cWhy would it have ever been illegal in the first place? Sure, it\u2019s kind of a cheap trick to gaining weight quick, but that shit\u2019s amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene smiled and suddenly sat down into the booth with Lyra and Ethan. Although the wood and steel groaned under her heavy ass, it was specifically made for girls her size. Ethan felt small and insignificant as the massive chef scooted her away towards him, and he found himself squashed between her and Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is amazing, that\u2019s why we fought to bring it back.\u201d Irene chatted. She had motioned to one of the chefs in the kitchen to start making Lyra her meal, so she could have time talking to her. \u201cThe reason why it was banned is because it\u2019s made out of Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what?!\u201d Ethan shouted, clearly shaken about the load of information dropped on him. Lyra was surprised as well, but she only raised her eyebrows in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene continued \u201cThe way you make Rare Candy is that you take around a hundred of this delicious creatures and super squish them to extract their essence. Back than, when Pokemon training just started, it was called Poke Candy. But some Tree hugging dipshits got so fussy over it that it got banned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil now, that is.\u201d Irene chuckled, making her whole fat body wobble and jiggle. \u201cThose candies are incredibly calorific, so when a Pok\u00e9mon eats it, it turns into energy that makes them level up. When someone like your friend here eats it,\u201d she motioned to Ethan getting swamped in thigh flab from both girls, \u201c he\u2019ll probably turn into a Lucario or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when a fatass eats it?\u201d Lyra asked with a cheeky grin, knowing full well what the answer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene matched her smile. \u201cWe get fatter. That\u2019s gonna be the whole theme of this place once it opens for real: getting bigger fast. Oh sure, the skinnies are gonna complain about us eating Pok\u00e9mon and destroying the environment and all that bullshit, but who gives a fuck? This piece of salad, this forest, is only the beginning. We got big plans for Johto. And if a couple species of Pok\u00e9mon go extinct because of that? We don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked up at at Irene with fear and apprehension. He felt like...like he was in a world on the verge of the apocalypse. Lyra only nodded with Irene\u2019s statements, finding nothing but agreement in her words. How is it possible for these two to be so casual about the potential death of thousands if not millions of Pok\u00e9mon for the goal of making their already obese bodies even bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...how was it possible that only heard about all of this until now? No one back in New Bark ever talked about how girls bigger than Lyra or her mother, or how meat came from Pok\u00e9mon, or how Ilex Forest has been in the process of deforestation for six months. Could Lyra had been right, could they all be\u2026idiots?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on one second, girl. I\u2019m gonna see why my retarded cooks aren\u2019t finished with your meal yet. HEY! DICKSLICES!\u201d Irene shouted across the dining room, with only Ethan looking disturbed as the other fat ladies kept guzzling down food. \u201cWHERE THE HELL IS THE FOOD FOR TABLE 53!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, a visibly disturbed cook came out of the kitchen rushing with a moving tray filled with multi colored pancakes. He parked the cart next to the table not a moment too soon, or else he would have been fired. With that, he exited back into the kitchen to fix up more food for the gluttonous women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here we are! Rare Candy Pancake Surprise, a personal favorite of many. Go on, try it out!\u201d Irene encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...kinda skimpy, isn't it?\u201d Lyra complained as she eyed the cart if breakfast food. True, to a normal person it would be a lot, but for Lyra, it was more like a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, people who eat from the experimental menu get a complementary feast of three of everything we got.\u201d Irene smiled. \u201cEating Rare Candy leaves an empty feeling in your gut, and we wouldn't want anyone leaving this place hungry, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree of everything!? Man, you can\u2019t argue with that logic!\u201d Lyra guffawed and began shoveling in the colorful pancakes at breakneck speed. She started at swallowing one at a time in single gulps, than two at a time, than five! In seconds, she was already a sixth of the way done with her meal. She was careful not to let a single splotch of syrup go unlicked, no crumb not slurped down. As Ethan looked on in awe, Irene looked at the scene with a supportive smile. With an appetite like that, she had to be destined for bigger and better things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lyra had put away all of the experimental foodstuffs in her blubbery belly with a dopey smile. It  wasn't long until a familiar sensation in her abdomen began to bubble from the surface. She was getting fatter, and it was starting now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how big will she get?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan sat there in terror, hating every moment of their trip to this restaurant. Irene\u2019s description of their plan to take over Johto was frightening to the boy. The cruel way Irene was treating her chefs... was that the way ALL skinny people were going to be treated in the near future? If so, his only hope was that he\u2019ll be protected somewhat by his friendship with Lyra, who didn\u2019t treat him THAT badly in comparison\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it seemed that Lyra was giving into bad habits herself. The way she was gobbling down those pancakes\u2026 ugh. Ethan could only hope she doesn\u2019t get as big as Irene was. He didn\u2019t know if he could handle a building-sized Lyra. He grit his teeth, bracing himself for whatever happened once Lyra finishes her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra downs the pancakes in seconds, leaning back and patting her belly in satisfaction. They were actually surprisingly filling for such a meager meal! She sat there for a while, waiting for their effects to kick in\u2026 but nothing seemed to be happening. Eventually, Irene looked concerned, as if worrying that the experiment hadn\u2019t worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when they were about to give up, Lyra was suddenly overcome by a powerful sensation! Every single inch of her body seemed to be overcome with this incredible energy, and she felt a strong warmth in her core. <b>\u201cOh! Ah! I feel\u2026 I feel\u2026 ooohhh\u2026\u201d</b> She shuddered a bit, letting out a moan as the tingling sensation caused her to tense up in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, right before their eyes, Lyra started to grow. In just a few seconds, she had gained about 5 inches - then 10 - then 20! She was getting proportionally thicker, too, and Ethan found the space between her and Irene growing smaller and smaller by the second. Still, he was mesmerized by the sight of her breasts, butt and belly growing right before his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were practically rolling back in her head as she was overwhelmed by the sheer sensation. Ethan felt a little uncomfortable with just how\u2026 \u2018sensual\u2019 her moans and sighs sounded as she rapidly expanded. Meanwhile, Irene was watching with a huge smile on her fat face, admiring the incredible efficacy of her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra just sat there in a state of ecstasy, getting bigger\u2026 and bigger\u2026 and bigger. In under a minute, she passed the 10 foot mark, with no end in sight! Ethan was starting to get pressed tightly between the fat rolls of the two women, much to Irene\u2019s amusement. Still, it seemed that Lyra was only going to get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Ethan thought she\u2019d keep growing forever and ever, her growth suddenly stopped all at once. Lyra eyes snapped back into focus, as if she had awoken from a trance. She was still visibly shaking after the orgasmic feeling of such incredible growth. She was almost a little disappointed that it was over\u2026 until she looked down and gasped at the sight of her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of just a couple of minutes, she had gained over 1,500 pounds! Now, she weighed almost a ton! Her belly was officially big enough to fit an entire person, and her butt was big enough to squish somebody. At a staggering 15\u20194\u201d, she\u2019d have a difficult time fitting in most houses, and any furniture that\u2019s not heavily reinforced will be destroyed beneath her weight. Somehow, her clothes seemed to have grown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d</b> Lyra suddenly jumped out of her chair, filled with energy. Ethan had never seen her look so happy or excited. With her size, she could do whatever she damn well pleased and nobody could stop her! No putting up with dumbass nurse joys, or almost getting killed by pathetic Team Rocket grunts. <b>\u201cI\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 goddess!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, slow down there! You still have a long ways to go,\u201d Irene wagged a finger. \u201cAlways remember our motto; NEVER be content with what you have. Always demand more, more, more\u2026!\u201d Lyra\u2019s smiled widened. The thought that she could get even bigger than this invigorated her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah! I get ya!\u201d</b> She said, practically shouting now, just imagining all the possibilities. She just wanted to get fatter, and fatter, and fatter, until the entirety of Johto sinks beneath her weight! <b>\u201cShit, by the time I\u2019m done with this little adventure, I\u2019m gonna be the size of a damn mountain! And even THAT won\u2019t be enough!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Irene smiled. \u201cNow\u2026 are ya hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s enthusiasm was deflated somewhat, when she realized she was, indeed, starving. Her massive belly was growling loudly at this very moment, demanding to be filled. <b>\u201cUh\u2026 shit. Yeah, I am,\u201d</b> she said. <b>\u201cAre the chefs ready?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey damn well better be, or I\u2019m putting THEM on the menu!\u201d Irene laughed. With that, she stood up and walked back into the kitchen, and the two of them could faintly hear her yelling again. Lyra chuckled, before sitting back in the booth besides Ethan, chuckling as the blushing boy admired her humongous curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo what do you think, Ethan? Like my new look?\u201d</b> She teased, striking a pose that showed off her huge breasts and immense belly. Ethan was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look\u2026 great,\u201d he sheepishly confessed. While he was loathe to admit it, he actually really liked watching Lyra grow bigger and bigger. He let out a little gasp when Lyra suddenly wrapped him in her huge, pudgy arms, and the boy was pressed tightly up against her humongous, firm, pillowy belly. It was bigger than his entire body! And\u2026 so incredibly soft\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost disappointed when the hug ended, and Lyra set him back down again. Eventually, miserable-looking chefs started carrying big plates of food out from the kitchen, placing them on the table before Lyra. They move as quickly as they can, but they can hardly keep up with Lyra\u2019s appetite, and she keeps clearing plates faster than they can bring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan watches in awe as Lyra\u2019s appetite reaches new heights. Now, she can clear an entire plate in a single gulp, before tossing it aside and moving on to the next one. Meanwhile, Lyra was thrown into a gluttonous trance by the sheer quality of the food! She thought the stuff the instaovens cook was delicious, but this was the greatest food she\u2019s ever tasted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a truly incredible amount of food to fill Lyra\u2019s now humongous belly. She quickly devoured enough food to feed a hundred men, and still he hunger was insatiable. Ethan could only watch in awe as an incredible amount of food disappeared down her greedy throat, and her big, round belly expanded wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had devoured three of everything the restaurant had\u2026 and she still had room for more! She and Irene said her goodbyes, and Irene encouraged her to keep getting bigger and bigger as much as she can. With that, they were off. All eyes were on Lyra as she strolled the rest of the way down the path, her huge body jiggling with every Earth-shaking step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, once they were out of sight, Lyra stopped and gazed and Ethan. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 your legs getting tired?\u201d</b> She asked, for some reason. Ethan was a little confused, and was about to say \u2018no\u2019, but before he could, Lyra suddenly lifted him up into the air! He wiggled a bit in his grip, surprised he was able to lift him so high. <b>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest somewhere warm?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Ethan could do was brace himself before he was suddenly surrounded by warm, pillowy flesh on all sides. She had shoved him right between her tits! She disappeared him completely into her cleavage, and there was not a single trace of him left visible to the outside world. He was completely surrounded sweaty, jiggling titflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed a bit, actually finding it pretty comfortable. He noticed Snack in there with him, gazing curiously at him, as if wondering why Lyra had suddenly gotten so big. \u201cHey, Snack,\u201d he smiled a bit, patting the Quilava on the head. He noticed a fluffy Eevee nuzzling his side, and chuckled. \u201cOh! And hey, uh, Pillow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyra was on her way, strutting happily through the construction site on her way to Goldenrod proper. She was feeling happier than she\u2019s ever felt before, and sometimes tells her that when she finally makes it to the big city, things will get even better! Unfortunately, there was one last obstacle in her way before she could make it to Goldenrod...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lyra continued to make her trek with all of her Pokemon and Ethan tucked away on her body, the dwindling and dying forest around her slowly paved way towards the more developed area of the vast construction site. The urban extension was still not done, but it was much more complete on Route 34 than it was in the Ilex Forest. This was where all the homes and apartments were being built, with almost all of the trees bulldozed except the ones for decoration, and the natural cove nearby being reclaimed for seaside villas. The dirt paths were paved with concrete and asphalt, like a yellow brick road leading Lyra to the wonderful city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it wasn't the city proper, the streets were still bustling with activity, every street crowded to the tipping point with bloated women and reinforced cars. Looking at the ravenous crowds, Lyra was grateful that her Ethan and Pokemon were safe and sound strapped against her body. She was proud of her vulgarity and glad to finally be with the people who accepted her, but some of the other women on the streets made her look like an uptight prude. The poor kid wouldn't last a second on these streets. They all seemed to mind their own business, though, too caught up in their gluttony to pay much attention to her. The few ones that did just gave her a welcoming smile from one fatty to another and went on their way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ethan was trying to get accustomed to his new arrangements in between Lyra\u2019s bloated mammaries. He was completely pinned from all sides, but not totally unable to move, but the suffocating warmth and plushness only made each movement more energy draining. Snack seemed to have gotten used to it and tried to play with Ethan in an attempt to help him stay awake, while Pillow did the same. Suddenly, he felt Lyra\u2019s gait come to an abrupt halt, and the constant jiggling around him slowly stopped. Confused, the small boy gripped both sides of the boob flesh and thrust his torso upwards to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Lyra, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Ethan questioned as his head peaked out from the valley of her cleavage. She didn't respond, however, just looked ahead of him with an angry, dumbfounded scowl with an occasional eye twitch. Curious, he turned his body around after much maneuvering and saw what had stopped her from making it to Goldenrod Proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me!\u201d Lyra cursed with venom as she eyed the same brat that had stopped her twice before: Youngster Joey. \u201cI mean, seriously, how the fuck did you even find me here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Irritating child trainer grinned at her like dopamine injected shark and pumped his chest with pride. \u201cHaha, no one is incapable of being tacked down by me! Now, call out your Pokemon, for this time I WILL defeat you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked back at Lyra, scared she was going to pop a blood vessel she was so angry. She was soooo close to standing in the city of her dreams, and this stupid retard was blocking her! At first, she just wanted to push the pitiful boy down to the ground with her gut and walk over him, but...but then she remembered the last time he had fought her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I bet I\u2019ll be able to down him the next time we see him.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...no.\u201d Lyra\u2019s anger slowly washed away from her face as she realized her own prophecy had come true. \u201cNo more battles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?! You can\u2019t deny someone a Pokemon battle, it\u2019s the rules!\u201d Joey defended himself, keen on proving his self worth to his rival. \u201cYou can't just...hey, hey what do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d The small boy grimaced as he noticed Lyra walking ominously towards him with a hungry look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra licked her lips as she eyed Joey all over. She was still rather stuffed from all the food she had just eaten at Irene\u2019s restaurant, but the feeling of a too full gut was meager in comparison to never having to be annoyed by this brat again. Plus, this would be her first living, human meal, and that idea was too tantalizing to pass up. To Ethan\u2019s horror, she bent down and picked up the annoying pest off from the ground and into the air with ease like she had done with him earlier. \u201cHey, let go of me you fatty!\u201d He protested, wiggling hopelessly in her grasp. \u201cWhat are you gonna do...eat me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra answered Joey\u2019s question by opening her maw wide and, without any verbal warning, thrust the kid\u2019s head inside her mouth. Her eyes rolled back in ecstasy as her fat tongue rolled over his head. It was better than...it was better than everything! A human might just be her new favorite food! Joey, still not comprehending how mortal his situation was, kept pitifully demanding to be spat out and have a proper Pokemon battle. Meanwhile, Ethan looked up as more and more of his body disappeared between her lips. He felt like he should be helping him, but instead, he kept silent, not wanting to get caught up in her haze of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ethan could feel Joey\u2019s body ride down her esophagus, his form making a large bulge in his neck and pressing out her boobs even further. It was horrifying and disgusting, but at the same time gratifying to him in a way that made him feel shameful. He liked seeing Lyra eat, get bigger, more domineering. \u201cThat could be me if I\u2019m not careful\u2026\u201d he muttered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all that was left of Joey\u2019s existence was a pair of well-worn sneakers, and with one last slurp they were popped off from his feet and discard down to the sidewalk like a piece of garbage. The bust crowds around them saw the whole affair go down, but instead of calling the police or being mortified, they gave a congratulatory cheer. A girl\u2019s first human prey is no small moment, and Ethan was shocked at how supportive and encouraging everyone around him was towards the brutality. Was this a normal occurrence to them?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was blown away at how it was possible for something, anything in the whole wide world to taste so. Fucking. Good. It was as if all the countless Pokemon she had devoured in her life, all the sweet foods and cuisine came back in full force one, amazing, heart-stopping barrage of taste. And the knowledge that other of her fellow human beings could be next was enough to bring her to her knees. She grit her teeth as a couple drops of sexual fluid dripped from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I just ate a person\u2026\u201d Lyra panted as she forced air to go into her lungs after using so much time on swallowing instead of breathing. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten tiny Pokemon before, but...but this?!\u201c This makes me feel like a fucking Goddess!\u201d She smacked her belly loud and hard, amazed at how the small kid\u2019s struggles didn\u2019t even make a bulge like the piece of food that he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Lyra had finally had a taste of the forbidden fruit, there was no going back. \"Ethan, from now on, try to keep out of my eating radius.\" She pushed the small boy's head down back into her boobs with Pillow and snack, finally walking again as she set out to Goldenrod City with a whole new outlook on life. \"Today marks my first day as a Humanitarian!\". After passing through the great gates that separated the restaurant district to the main city, she was instantly taken aback. It was a huge, sprawling metropolis, beautiful and incredible...and all for her to enjoy. She instantly booked a room at one of the many hotels in town with the money she had stolen from that old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Joey still digesting away in her stomach, and with some lodging in order, Lyra set out to make the most of her first day in Goldenrod City. But the question was: what did she want to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Golden Hotel was an imposing, nine-story tall structure that stood on the edge of the ocean. While the old building was opulent and imperial looking and had been refurbished and strengthen over the development of the city, it always seemed to lean backward, as if it could fall into the ocean at any moment. It was covered with little statues of water Pokemon, serving as some nice looking decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra chose the Golden Hotel over all the other accommodations in Goldenrod City because it was the fanciest looking. The institution was arranged so that the people with the greatest weights were at the bottom and the smallest at the top, so the structure wasn't in danger of actually falling backward. The obese girl was only average sized by local standards, so she was put on the fifth along with Ethan and her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was just big enough to fit Lyra comfortably, even if it was still a tight squeeze. It was shaped like a big rectangle equipped with reinforced furniture for her to lounge in so that she could lounge around without breaking anything. Still, the floor underneath her fat feet creaked and groaned ominously, and each step she took made the whole place quake. Satisfied with her lodgings, she fished out her Pokemon and Ethan to throw them down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we're in Goldenrod City, what do you want to do first?\" Etha grunted as he pushed himself off from the floor, making sure that the other Pokemon were alright before walking to the glass door to the porch. Their room had a beautiful view of the ocean, and the light on the water made a nice show for the nine-year-old boy. 'We could go challenge the Gym Leader, or check out the department store, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan...you're looking at the extent of what we're doing today!\" Ethan turned around to face Lyra lying atop of the only bed in the room, snacking off from a bag of crackers from the minibar and watching a bit of television...in the nude. The pre-adolescent boy gave out an eep of shock and covered his face, not to avert his eyes but to cover up his blush. \"Haha! Aw, come on, brat, don't you think I'm pretty as fuuuuck?\" Lyra purred as she cupped one of her big boobs to squeeze it erotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...o-of course Lyra! It's just that...\" He quickly looked around the room for an excuse for Lyra to put back on her clothes. His eyes landed on Treat, Pillow, and Omelette, and the answer came to his head. \"Don't you think that's more for a...private showing?\" He nodded his head to the small Pokemon who stared on desperate love and arousal, totally under the thumb of their big, fat Goddess of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra blinked and looked at her Pokemon and back to Ethan, before forming a wide and evil grin on her fat face. \"Ohhh...I know what you want, you naughty boy...\" Lyra cooed, quickly picking up the phone on the nightstand to call reception. \"Hello, Hotel staff? Do you guys gut a daycare for Pokemon or something?... Great! Come to Room 71X, I got some for you to pick up.\" She slammed the phone down into the receiver, looking triumphant while Etha groaned. Great, now he was going to be left alone with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't look so down, Ethan. Here, come take a load off with me on the bed and watch some T.V\" Lyra offered, patting the little bit of the wide bed that her gigantic ass didn't take up. Ethan was reluctant but eventually obeyed, climbing up the mattress to cuddle up against Lyra's doughy hip. The vulgar women smiled and hugged the frail boy deeper into her soft flesh as the door was opened by the Hotel Staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of friendly looking skinnies came into the room quickly and quietly picking up Lyra and Ethan's Pokemon from the floor without much hassle. As soon as they came, they were gone, leaving Ethan and Lyra alone with each other. Lyra smiled and patted her stomach a few times, content to watch it quiver and wiggle like the surface of a lake. The struggles of the annoying trainer called Joey had long stopped. His body was nothing more than some soup for her to digest into more fat. The thought of her taking a life through her stomach alone put her in a mood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked over past the horizon of her cleavage at Etha, who looked back up at her when he felt he was being stared at. \"...you're so cute, Ethan.\" The giant girl swooned as she grabbed the small boy's shoulder forcibly to swing him onto her belly and bosom. The small child gasped and blinked as his vision was suddenly flooded by Lyra's face. \"Arceus, you are so fucking cute. You're like a little meat doll I can do whatever I want with...such a cute little brat~\". Something was off, Ethan noted as beads of nervous sweat began to run down his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, thank you, Lyra...\" Ethan grunted as he tried to regain his balance in Lyra's comfy fat.  She kept staring at him like a delicious piece of chocolate, making him uneasy. She was hungry, but not in the way he was accustomed to. \"I'll make sure not to mention all this to my mom when I get back home...getting a face full of boob from the person who kidnapped me...\" The moment he referenced his mom and his life before Lyra had invaded and took over it, she gave out a deep sigh of contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ethan...you know I'm never going to let you go, right?\" Lyra smiled and stared deeply into the eyes of the little boy perched on her cleavage. He looked taken aback, the reality of his situation dawns on him. He tried laughing it off, but Lyra silenced him by slowly smothering his face with her fat tits. \"Ethan...even if I do take you back to New Bark Town to see your mom, it would be so I could squash your house and eat her in front of you. I've already eaten that annoying Joey, and I'm just gonna keep growing bigger and bigger and bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel your erection, Ethan,\" Lyra smirked like the devil as she leaned into the boy smothered in her tits, making him blush and squirm in deep embarrassment. \"You don't even know what it means, Arceus you're precious...it means you love me, Ethan. It means that no matter how bad I treat you, no matter how many Pokemon friends of yours I eat...you'll love me. You love me and my big fat tits and ass, you love to see me grow fatter and fatter...don't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was taken aback by all of this. Love her? That was the most ridiculous notion he had ever heard?! She had made his life a living hell, there was no way in a million years he would ever love her! He wiggled his way out of Lyra's vice grip and stood defiantly atop her bosom. He was about to refute every word she had said...when suddenly she leaned in and planted a kiss on his lips. The little boy lost his balance and fell back into the canyon of boob fat as Lyra invaded his mouth and rolled her tongue over his diminutive one. The kiss lasted around a minute, probably more, until Lyra pulled out, leaving him dazed and confused. \"Ethan, look at yourself. No women aside from me would give you a second glance. You're scrawny, pale, always nervous, and what did you do all day before I took you on my journey? You spent all your time with shitfaced Pokemon and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a geek, Ethan, and a big one at that. I love that about you, I love how sad your life is, I love how much you hate and despise me, I love how fucking easy it was to make you a slave to my big, beautiful body! Some kids are destined to do pretty great things in their lives...but you, Ethan, you were born to be my toy.\" Ethan'sbody was shaking with fear and shock, so much so he couldn't move from his comfy position in Lyra's boobs, not even a pathetic wiggle. Never the most assertive boy, he stayed timidly silent under his dominant kidnapper's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ly...Lyra...\" He moaned as he was lifted ou from Lyra's boobs and into the air. \"Please,...you're scaring me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...good.\" Lyra purred. \"Now, before I work out some pent up tension, I gotta ask...what's your favorite body part of mine?\"</span></div></div>",

I-It\u2019s so big and powerful, always hungry and so perfectly round\u2026L-Lyra, it hurts\u2026\u201d The authoritative teenager tilted her head a small bit at that last statement, she didn't think she was holding onto him that hard. She was about to call him another round of weakling related insults when she realized he was talking about the throbbing bulge in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra let a wide smile go across her face as she observed the poor, squirming boy struggle with his emotions. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brat...I\u2019ll make the pain go away\u2026\u201d With a powerful thrust she ripped off Ethan\u2019s pants and underwear right from his body, leaving his legs naked and his erection open to the world. Lyra mercilessly giggled at the sight of his pitiful manhood. \u201cAwww, it\u2019s so small and cute!\u201d She gripped his dick hard, making him wince in pain as she fondled the growing shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Ethan...you\u2019re gonna prove to me how much you love my belly, mmkay?\u201d She dropped the little boy from her grip and shoved his body down her sloping belly so he was positioned right in front of it on the bed. \u201cAh, you\u2019re so small...but just the right size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra began to grope her breasts, teasing Ethan as she slowly slid her hands down to her monumental stomach to rub it heavily. She stopped at her midriff, her fat, pudgy fingers circling around her cavernous navel. \u201cTell me, Ethan...have you ever seen a belly as soft as mine?\u201d Aroused, confused, scared and in love, Ethan reached forth and pressed his hand into her gut to see how much give that subtle, oh so plush flesh gave to his touch. Nowhere on her body did any of the flesh sag, yet he couldn't feel anything until his hands were lost up to the wrists. \u201cMmm, I bet your stupid Marill is still floating around in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra could feel Ethan\u2019s tiny boner poke up against her belly, making her give a wider smile. \u201cNow,  imagine your tiny winy wittle penis completely smothered in all of it. A whole world of softness...all for you, brat.\u201d Her hand slowly circles her cavernous button before she plunged a finger into it, her hand going past her own wrist before drawing it out with a pop. \u201cNow, how does that sound to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan refused to give an audible response, instead he opted to just stare at Lyra\u2019s navel the entire time as he was entranced by the fantasy that she wove in his head. She noticed his stupefied expression and laid down on her back, anticipating what was to come. Getting the hint she was playing at, Ethan hopped back onto the belly he was shoved down earlier and began to climb up it like a mountain. He lined up his crotch with her cavernous belly button before falling forward to grope and cuddle the great sphere, letting his member plunge into her deep pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s virgin phallus twitched and stiffened even harder as it was surrounded by the softest meat in the whole, wide world. He let out a scream of both pleasure and pain into Lyra\u2019s impossibly sized belly, his voice muffled by the blubber and sending shock waves through her body. He gripped her belly hard and began to pull his boyish hips back and forth, letting his member go in and out of her middle as it squeezed him ever so gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra wrapped her bloated arms around Ethan\u2019s back and began to hug him into herself as he gave her belly the most wonderful massage she\u2019s ever had. She slapped the gut in question hard, making it slosh and quake along with his body. \u201cJust imagine it, Ethan...imagine me eating everything and everyone you love, leaving nothing for you in this world but me.\u201d She ruffled his hair affectionately. \u201cI\u2019ll grow even bigger than I am now. Imagine me weighing a ton, or ten tons, or a hundred! Imagine my boobs the size of planets, my ass sitting atop the world as you keep thrusting into my big, fat, stomach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan huffed and wheezed as he continued to thrust into and grope Lyra\u2019s expansive belly, the massive organ underneath him churning the last remnants of Joey away into more plush fat. With one last, big thrust, he gritted his teeth, arched his back, and let out his very first load. He panted and whined like a baby as he slowly pulled back his member, now placid and smothered in his own seed, before falling back to her tummy with heavy breaths. Lyra smiled and leaned over her bosom, smirking at the sight of the exhausted child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my, you certainly had a nice time, didn't you?\u201d Lyra patted Ethan on the back for a job well done. \u201cYou really do love my belly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ethan suddenly moved his head upwards so he could meet Lyra\u2019s face. \u201cNo, I hate your belly. I hate it so much. It\u2019s too small. You\u2019re not big enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked into Ethan's eyes. They were different now, they no longer had that boyish innocence. She had completely won over him, and he had finally given in. She was almost a little scared at that she had created...but the way he talked back to her was kind of a turn on. \u201c...okay, Ethan.\u201d Lyra grabbed the phone from the nightstand to call reception again. \u201cYou want me to get bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than anything in the world.\u201d Ethan begged in a horse voice. Lyra was only too happy to oblige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she order from room service?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra was making her way up Route 34 towards the glittering metropolis that was Goldenrod City. It\u2019s gold and silver skyline glittered the afternoon sky and blinded the eyes of Pok\u00e9mon in flight. To Lyra, it was like a beacon of luxury and power, and was drawn to it like a moth to to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 34, once a lush green path only known for it\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Daycare ran by an elderly couple, had been totally devastated by the construction for Goldenrod\u2019s expansion. It was much more developed than the Illex District, but still nowhere near completion. The grassy fields where Pok\u00e9mon used to play were now hard concrete and asphalt, and the surrounding trees were bulldozed to make room for new restaurants and homes for the fat population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra smiled brightly at the sight. The future was looking up! She gave her massive cleavage and affectionate pat as Ethan continued to get used to his surroundings. He had already technically been they're this morning, but back than she was a twig, and only his legs could fit. Now, no one could tell that Ethan was even in there. The pale titflab stifled movement and muffled his voice, so he was basically at the whims of the morbidly obese Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s billowing gut let out a low gurgle. It was no longer hungry after it\u2019s meal back at Irene\u2019s, but it was not exactly full. She was sated, but not exactly satisfied. She gave it a reassuring rub, making it calm down. They're was a plethora of restaurants open around here, but she didn\u2019t feel like regular food right now. What she really needed was not dead meat and more bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed it to squirm in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as luck would have it, a meal presented itself to her when she heard a loud and authoritative voice yell at her from behind. \u201cStop right there, Lyra!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stopped in her tracks immediately. Not because she was even remotely afraid of the voice behind her, but because it sounded vaguely familiar. Before turning around to face whoever was stupid enough to talk to her like that, she pondered on whoever it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it have been the old man from Cherrygrove whom Lyra stole millions of dollars from? Could it have been that green haired fuck banned Proton from the Slowpoke Well? Or was it that annoying dipshit who keeps following her wherever she goes. Lyra had no qualms about any of them being her first human victim, but when she turned around, she was not greeted by any of them, but rather\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Gold!?!\u201d Lyra gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of Lyra was the diminutive mother of Ethan, with her hands placed in her tiny hips in an angry fashion. She looked winded and deprived of rest, probably from chasing after the her across the region \u201cWhere the fuck is my son?!\u201d She seethed and snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like you finally got over your headache.\u201d Lyra taunted. \u201cAnd if you must know, he\u2019s currently appreciating the curves of a real women, and not some rail thin bitch called his mom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gave her soft, pillows breasts another pat to emphasize where Ethan was, making the two orbs wiggle and jiggle. Ms. Gold was only more upset at this realization, her face turning bright red with anger. \u201cGive him to me! Now!\u201d She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra wanted nothing more than to gobble up the skinny women right than and they're, but she knew that Ethan would probably never forgive her. And as much as she loved to see him hurt...that might be a bridge too far. With a roll of her eyes, she fished out the small boy from the inside of her boobs and set down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, after being cast in darkness for so long, was blinded by the sudden influx of bright light, and only after his eyes adjusted did he notice his fuming mother. \u201cM...mom?\u201d He asked, not sure I\u2019d he was seeing things or not. \u201cMom! It\u2019s so good to see-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was cut off as Ms. Gold slapped him hard in the face, and he was sent to the ground. \u201cDo you have any idea what kind of hell you put me through?!\u201d Ethan\u2019s mother screamed as he started to cry. \u201cYou up and leave me, drag me halfway across Johto looking for you, and now you\u2019re telling me Lyra is your fucking girlfriend?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lyra shouted at the scene unfolding. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who gets the talk to him like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, excuse me Lyra!\u201d Ms. Gold mocked, \u201cBut it\u2019s not my fault that my son abandoned me and made out with the town whore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, p-please! She kidnapped-\u201c Ethan tried to explain the situation to his mother, but he was once again silenced as her foot collided with his face. \u201cShut up, Ethan! I don\u2019t wanna hear it! You are going to come home with me, and when you do, you are going to get the punishment of a lifetime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan staggered back to his feet to face his mother, and put a hand to his nose as he felt liquid pour out from it. He held his fingers in front of his face and saw that they were covered in blood. His nose was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s eye twitched as her blood boiled with rage. Ethan was hurt. Only she got to hurt Ethan. He was crying on the ground. Only she ever gets to see that happen to him. Her fists shook with rage as she tried to level her mind, but nothing was working. With a snarl, she bent down and grabbed Ms. Gold by her sides roughly, and hoisted her skinny frame into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What the hell do you think your doing?! Let me down you bitch!\u201d Ethan\u2019s mother struggled in Lyra\u2019s fat hand, but she wasn't going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I always hated you, ya know that?\u201d Lyra started to Ms. Gold. \u201cYou always looked at me like I was some kind of freak, ever since I was a kid. And for a while, I kinda actually believe it. But after seeing all this.\u201d Lyra used a free hand to motion to the construction around her, \u201cproves that you were wrong all along. I\u2019m not a monster, you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you done with your little speech?!\u201d The lithe women shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d And with that, Ethan watched in horror as his only family was hurled into Lyra\u2019s waiting mouth. Only her bony legs stuck out, which she happily slurped up like a noodle. Ethan wanted to stop this from happening. He wanted to scream and shout at Lyra to make her stop. But he couldn\u2019t. His nose was broken and tears were flowing down his face, and he felt like the whole world had came crashing down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lyra gulped down Ethan\u2019s mother with a satisfied grin. She had finally done it, she had eaten a Human! She felt like celebrating, like partying, like she could take on the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan she heard Ethan trying to stifle his sobs, and she was brought back to reality. She had just eaten the brat\u2019s mom. Granted, it turns out she was not a very nice mom, but...that doesn\u2019t shake the fact Ethan just watched his mother be doomed to digest in her stomach. That\u2019s going to put a strain on their relationship. \u201cErr...hey, Ethan.\u201d Lyra tried to break the ice between them. \u201cSoooo...I just ate your mom...yep! That happened...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Ethan take this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra had tasted some delicious foods. Countless Pokemon, Irene\u2019s fine cuisine, rare and experimental treats\u2026 but all that was nothing\u2026 NOTHING compared to the taste of a fellow human being. Sure, that might sound terrible, but it was true. When Lyra shoved the woman headfirst into her huge, greedy maw, she was blown away. How is it even POSSIBLE for something to taste this good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but the knowledge that another human being was going to fall victim to her appetite was orgasmic to her. To be honest, she\u2019d never been this turned on in her life. When the woman\u2019s feet finally disappeared down her throat, Lyra was panting and gasping loudly, trying to calm herself down and resist to urge to just drop trough and start doing some m\u00e9nage \u00e0 moi right here in the middle of public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grit her teeth, trying to suppress an aroused moan as she looks down at her huge, round belly, realizing an entire person was trapped inside. Before, Lyra had just devoured a ton of really tiny Pokemon all at once, and their individual struggles only tickled. But this\u2026 by Arceus, every movement the woman made sent shivers up Lyra\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s struggles didn\u2019t even manage to make bulge in her belly. She was doomed to be slowly and easily digested, like a piece of food. The fact that her stomach was so powerful and inescapable was incredible for Lyra. Her body was so powerful, she could easily eliminate anyone who got in her way. She was, without any doubt, truly a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her orgasmic bliss faded a bit, and she was able to focus enough to look over at Ethan\u2026 who was sobbing like hell. The poor boy had just been beaten, and then had his mother murdered - not just murdered, but cannibalized - right in front of him. When she looks at him, the despair on his face is suddenly changed with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMONSTER!\u201d He screamed at the top of his lungs. The sheer, passionate, guttural roar was almost frightening. She didn\u2019t know Ethan was capable of making such a sound. Before she could say anything, Ethan bolted down the path at an unbelievable speed, disappearing down the route to Goldenrod City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to think of him as just being a whiny brat again, but\u2026 well, she HAD just eaten his mom. That seems like something reasonable to be upset about. Lyra sighed, wondering how she was going to patch this over. She wasn\u2019t exactly a people person, nor was she good with kids\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should probably chase after him\u2026 but fuck, the sensation of somebody squirming in her huge, loudly gurgling belly was just too fucking good. She tried to take a step, but she noticed she was visibly shaking. She was going to have to\u2026 \u2018take care\u2019 of this before doing anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbles, almost in a daze, into a nearby restaurant, ignoring the service staff as she stumbles over to the bathroom. She locks herself inside, before immediately stripping down to nothing. Sure, it wasn\u2019t the sexiest place, but at least it was private. She was overwhelmed as she admired the sight of her huge, jiggling body and round belly in the mirror, knowing there was someone inside, just beneath the skin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the other patrons at the restaurant noticed a loud, frantic moaning coming from the bathroom, but decided to think nothing of it. After all, such sounds weren\u2019t uncommon in a place like the restaurant district\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome indeterminate amount of time later, she stumbled out of the bathroom, her hair messy and a doped-up smile on her face. That had been\u2026 amazing. Even now, the woman was still squirming, and Lyra beamed at the knowledge that someone was imprisoned inside of her, getting slowly soaked in gastric juices. With that, she stumbled out of the restaurant, ignoring the weird looks she gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her more carnal urges have been dealt with, it was time to find Ethan. Unfortunately, he could be damn anywhere by now. She looked around the restaurant district for a while, hoping he had come back, but nope. He must be somewhere in Goldenrod City by now. Just how the hell was he supposed to find him in a huge city like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHe better not have fuckin\u2019 ran to the police\u2026\u201d</b> She muttered to herself as she walked down Route 34. His sadness was understandable, but snitching was unforgivable. Something tells her he wouldn\u2019t stoop so low, though. After all, Lyra\u2019s been raising him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the trainers on Route 34 had learned to avoid huge woman like her, so her journey was rather straightforward. Eventually, she arrived at the entrance to Goldenrod City. It was the biggest, most beautiful city Lyra had ever laid eyes on. It was more incredible than she could\u2019ve ever imagined\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t fully enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could think about was Ethan. It may seem stupid, but she was actually\u2026 worried about him? In a town like this, with such a high population of fat woman, a lone boy like Ethan might actually end up as somebody\u2019s lunch. Besides, she just doesn\u2019t like travelling alone, without someone to admire her curves\u2026 shit. Was she coming down with lima syndrome or some shit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends all day searching for Ethan, asking around to see if anybody\u2019s seen him, but it\u2019s no use. In a sprawling city like this, it\u2019s easy to disappear if you really want to. Eventually, as night falls, Lyra sadly booked a luxurious hotel room overlooking the ocean, built specifically to house woman her size. By now, that woman she had devoured had long been digested\u2026 and Lyra spent the entire night \u2018enjoying\u2019 that fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, her first day in Goldenrod City sucked. The next morning, her first thoughts are of Ethan, before deciding\u2026 fuck him! She doesn\u2019t need him anyway. She\u2019ll go on adventures all by herself, without some dumb kid dragging her down. At least, that\u2019s what she tells herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling out of the hotel early in the morning, she decides she was going to make the most out of her visit to Goldenrod. This was something she\u2019d dreamed about for her entire life, after all! The only question is; where to head first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Goldenrod Department Store was the biggest commercial building in Johto, and it showed. In a society that valued the pursuit of pleasure over everything else, it was the tallest building in the Goldenrod Skyline. The building itself is 60 floors high, with each floor big enough and strong enough for the fat population to shop and eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, pretending that she was over her traveling buddy Ethan, decided to visit the Department Store first in her stay at Goldenrod. She let her Pok\u00e9mon out from the folds of her body and gave them enough food to last the day alone in the luxury suite. She would have taken them with her, but she didn\u2019t want to risk them getting gobbled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of navigating the golden paved streets, she finally made it to the Department Store. Walking in, she was blown away from the sight of the interior. Like everywhere else, the building stuck with the theme of Gold and Silver, but it was so meticulously made to entrance her in its beauty that she stopped for a few minutes just to admire the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a directory, Lyra saw that the building was essentially broken down into sixths. Each ten floors was dedicated to a certain theme. The first ten was the essential Pok\u00e9mon Trainer crap that the skinnies perused, buying potions and toys for their friends. The other fifty was essentially dedicated to people like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloors 11 through 20 were basically the store\u2019s food court, lined to the brim with restaurants serving greasy, fattening foods. Floors 21 through 30 was dedicated to those special elastic clothes that could withstand rapid weight gain. 31 through 40 was the pharmaceutical section, 41 through 50 was the miscellaneous stuff like kitchen utensils and T.Vs, and the last floors\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra\u2019s eyes widened at the description for floors 51 through 60. They called it \u201cPokemon\u201d, nothing more. Everything else has a specific function, but the last floors were worded very vaguely, almost like it was need to know information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, the information desk was conveniently located in the center of everything. Walking up, Lyra was the attendant; a 10 foot and 4 inches girl weighing around 900 lbs. \u201cWelcome!\u201d The girl greeted Lyra sweetly. \u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, yeah.\u201d Lyra fumbled her fingers, unsure of how to phrase her question. \u201cI was looking at the map of this place, and the I was wondering what \u2018Pokemon\u2019 meant for the top floors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giddy girl\u2019s smile slowly changed from an innocent to an evil smirk. \u201cOh! Well, levels 51 to 60 are for those who think that Pok\u00e9mon are...sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Huh?\u201d Lyra mouthed, not following the attendant\u2019s wordplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d the girl looked around to make sure her skinny boss wasn't looking. She squeezed her flabby body and spoke just above a whisper, \u201cSweet enough to eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was lost for a few seconds before the cog wheels in her mind started turning. Matching her devilish smirk, Lyra walked off to the reinforced elevator and punched in the numbers for any of the 50+ floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator ascended to the 57th floor, more fatties like herself crammed their behemoth sized bodies into the shaft. They all shared secret winks with one another, some of them were even drooling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time?\u201d A 16 foot fall women asked Lyra, nudging her in the side coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Lyra said, kinda excited and eager to see what these semi-secret floors looked like. \u201cWhat's it like up they're anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly bigger women chuckled, making her body quiver up and down. \u201cYou\u2019ll see~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the doors opened to at the 57th floor, and the layout was revealed to Lyra in all its glory. She went on a hunch on what these floors were about, and it turned out she was right! It was about Pok\u00e9mon...eating Pok\u00e9mon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was lined from wall to wall with \u2018shops\u2019 that sold and served live Pok\u00e9mon to hungry gals who need more than regular food to eat their appetite. The sounds of crying, miserable Pok\u00e9mon could be heard from every corner of the place, and it was music to Lyra\u2019s ears. She looked to her right and saw a baby Pichu get separated from it\u2019s family to be eaten in front of them! To her left, a pack of exotic Lucario from Sinnoh was being devoured in seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLost for words?\u201d The bigger women from before gently asked after noticing Lyra had been still for a choke minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in, I know. I was speechless myself the first Tom I came up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...This is paradise!\u201d Lyra finally exclaimed, jumping up and down in excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I ever dreamed about! I don\u2019t know where to start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell honey, whatever you do, remember to take it slow. They'res plenty of Pok\u00e9mon to go around, and they can still pack a punch if your not careful.\u201d The more experienced girl patted Lyra on the back. \u201cI\u2019m going to head over to Kalos section. I heard they got a new shipment of Greninja yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyra was all alone to contemplate her actions. Everything here was amazing! She didn\u2019t know where to start first!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyra could have gone over to talk to that experienced women from before, maybe get along and make a new friend. The two girls had plenty of common; they were both incredibly fat, they both loved to eat Pokemon...and that's really all you need for two people to bond! They always say that the way to the heart is through the stomach, and everyone on this floor seemed to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra could have gone over to not only the biggest on the floor or the whole department store, but the city and maybe even the region\u2019s women, currently making a spectacle by trying to beat her all time record of how much Pokemon she can down under ten minutes. She was Whitney, the Normal Type Gym Leader of Goldenrod City. She has enough influence around these parts, she's practically the mayor! Getting on her good side could definitely be beneficial to Lyra in the long term, especially when she inevitably faces her for the gym badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, Lyra could have just wondered around by herself, taking in the sights and states that the semi-secret floor had to offer. She could have bought some new Pokemon to fill out the rest of her team, super rare and strong Pokemon that could beat any wimpy ass kid to the ground. She could have even glutted herself to new levels and lose herself in a feeding frenzy like Whitney was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did not do any of those things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Lyra\u2019s eye was caught by the appearance of a hastily built day care center for kids as they\u2019re mothers went out shopping, rambunctious chubby girls fighting over who gets to eat the last Eevee, and timid looking boys waiting patiently to be picked up from this hellhole, twiddling their thumbs in an annoying fashion. And among that throng of brats, sitting on his hands was a boy in disheveled clothing, messy hair, and a crooked nose from when he was slapped so hard in the face that it broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra suddenly found herself sprinting as fast as she could towards the mostly unattended day care facility as soon as she identified Ethan inside. But why was she? Why did she care about that annoying prick at all? She couldn't possibly want him back, he's been nothing but an obnoxious, annoying piece of shit the entire way here. She took him on the adventure of a lifetime, and he repays the favor by running away. The little bastard deserves to get mistaken for a whiny Pokemon and get gobbled up by a passing mother on a shopping spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite what she kept telling herself, she couldn't stop from barreling over the other kids in an effort to get to him. The manager was largely removed from the situation, smoking a cigarette and reading from her magazine. Some of the smarter kids realized who the determined stranger was trying to get to, and got out of her way as she whizzed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stopped in front of Ethan, her shoes skidding a little on the tiled floor. He was sitting in a plastic chair, looking down at his feet. He barely made any indication that Lyra was in his presence, refusing to look up. Lyra, for once, did not know what to say. What did she think she could do in this situation? Apologize? She ate his mother and masturbated over her struggles in a restaurant bathroom. That is not something that a person can typically forgive another for. Was she going to force him to come with her, carry him out of the store and forget that any of this had ever happened? Lyra knew that if someone ever hurt her mother, she would remember it for the rest of her life, and Ethan is probably no different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was Lyra here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of role reversal between Ethan and Lyra, it was him who decided for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ethan muttered under his breath, barely above a whisper, but loud enough for Lyra to hear. Lyra was caught off guard by the mute boy\u2019s sudden words. He was the one that was sorry?! How?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow!?\u201d Lyra stopped thinking to herself and began to voice her thoughts to Ethan. \u201cHow in the name of Arceus can you be sorry!? You\u2019re not the monster that ate my mom! You didn\u2019t drag me across Johto just so you wouldn't be lonely! You didn't belittle and humiliate me because that\u2019s the only way you know how to say you like someone! I did that, I did all of that to you! I\u2019m the bitch who supposed to be groveling at your feet, begging for forgiveness, NOT YOU!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole day care center went silent for a moment, before it went back to being it loud self. It was best not to get in the middle of something that was none of their business. Lyra fell to her knees, shaking the ground slightly under her immense weight. Hot streams of water were gushing from her eyes, over her red cheeks and dripping onto the floor. She can\u2019t remember the last time she felt so small and helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saved me.\u201d Ethan finally raised his head up, showing to Lyra that he was crying too. \u201cMy mom, she...I told myself that I loved her, that she loved me, but\u2026\u201d She stopped to wipe the tears off of his cheeks. \u201cIt was a lie. She changed after Dad died. She started drinking and got angry at me for little reasons. She actually told me...she told me that she wished she never had me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom was hungover when you came that day. I was...sort of happy that I was leaving. It was scary being with you, and it still is. But being in that big house alone with her...looking back now, she\u2019s pure evil. She let me grow up in a sheltered bubble, not telling me where meat came from, that Pokemon like battling each other, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Ethan tried to stifle a sob, but was not successful. He put his hands to his face, aggravating his bruised nose, to try and stop more tears from trickling down his face, also in vain. He continued, \u201cI\u2019m...I-i\u2019m glad that you brought me along Lyra. It\u2019s been...the best days of my entire life! I know I\u2019m annoying and stupid and an obnoxious little s-s-shit.\u201d he was still not used to cursing, but he figured he\u2019d have to learn sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut can I come back?\u201d Ethan concluded, leaving Lyra speechless. \u201cI won\u2019t run away, I swear! I\u2019ll help you catch Pokemon to eat! I\u2019ll worship you body and help you get even bigger! Please, Lyra, just don\u2019t make me go back home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was silent for a very long time. Ethan was wondering if she had already rejected him. Until, Lyra finally spoke up, \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d She began \u201cI\u2019ll squish you, squash you, and break you with my big, fat body. I\u2019ll call you names and make you cry and make you feel like you're the worst thing in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d Ethan responded, knowing all the risks that traveling with Lyra posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll break your spirit until your nothing but my slave that will worship me. I\u2019ll force you to feed me so I can get even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll destroy everything that was ever important to you. I\u2019ll eat more people, people you like. I\u2019ll eat more Pokemon, Pokemon that you like. If there is something in this world that you think is beautiful, no matter how big or small, I will destroy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lyra couldn't control herself. She grabbed her Ethan from the plastic chair and brought him into her heaving chest for a hug. \u201cI Love you, Ethan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled and returned the hug by wrapping his arms around as much breastfat that was possible. \u201cI love you too, Lyra.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The restaurant\u2019s door opened wide as Lyra came inside with little Ethan following behind her colossal ass like the obedient pet he was. The panicked cries of Pok\u00e9mon of all shapes and sizes rang in her ears like silver bells on Christmas. Sighing with a smile she took a big step forward into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secret floor in the Goldenrod Department Store, despite being dedicated to the pursuit of eating as much Pokemon as possible and then some, only had one real restaurant. Most of the patrons just devoured the poor creatures right after buying them in the stores and stalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant in question, which was the very same that Lyra and Ethan were now in, was known by the people that frequented it as \u2018The Sour Cherry Diner\u2019, named after it\u2019s signature sour, but still sweet Pokemon based food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was all that the Diner actually served, really. As Ethan perused a display menu that was mounted near the server\u2019s podium, he noted a distinctive lack of fruit and vegetables offered. They didn\u2019t even serve any drinks save for MooMoo Milk. Indeed, if one would want to eat food that did not come from, or is, a Pok\u00e9mon, they would have to eat somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being in a place where people came specifically to eat Pok\u00e9mon, it appeared that no one wanted to eat anywhere else period. Although the venue was, by Fatty Standards, \u2018small\u2019, it seemed to do very, very well for itself. It was neither the breakfast or lunch rush, yet the place was still virtually packed to the brim with fat giantesses bursting with fat and blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, having skipped breakfast in her eagerness to explore the sights of Goldenrod, decided that with her heartfelt reunion with Ethan out of the way, it was finally time to put some more food in her starving stomach. However, the staff on hand were a tad busy tending to the needs of the other guests, so it would be a while before the two of them could actually be served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Ethan...\u201d Lyra turned herself around to look down at the small boy past the horizon of her breasts. \u201cHow the fuck did you end up in that crappy daycare place anyhow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan rubbed his left arm uncomfortably and tried to turn his head to avoid Lyra\u2019s prying gaze, \u201cIt\u2019s...kind of a long story\u2026an older woman thought that I looked like one of her kids and basically kidnapped me off the streets. She left me in the daycare sho she could beat her record at how much Snorlax she could eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you do kinda look like a generic template for all the kids around here!\u201d Lyra noted with a cheerful smile, happy to have Ethan back at her side, while still working in a teasing insult. However, her smile faded when she replayed what he said back in her mind. \u2018Wait...did you say that she was going to eat Snorlax?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yeah? Why, do you know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?!\u201d Lyra was flabbergasted. \u201cThat was Whitney! The Whitney! Goldenrod\u2019s Gym leader, ya dummy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls in the Sour Cherry Diner briefly looked up from their meals to glance towards Lyra and Ethan, mostly centered on Ethan. Whitney was one of the biggest woman in the entire Pokemon World! And this little dipshit from nowheresville got mistaken for her kid? Does she even have kids?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-r-really!? That\u2019s...that\u2019s news to me!\u201d Ethan stuttered as he realized most of the eyes in the restaurant were now on him. \u201cWell...that\u2019s good isn't it? Maybe we can go talk to her after this and see if she\u2019ll take us back to her gym and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was not permitted to finish his sentence as he was suddenly brought into an embrace from Lyra, his entire body sinking into her soft, fatty form. \u201cOh God Ethan, you have no idea how much I love you right now~\u201d She squeezed his head into her sweaty, heaving tits and ruffled his hair cutely, to which he blushed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...thanks Lyra! I don\u2019t know what exactly I did, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry, I tell you all about it during brunch.\u201d Lyra licked her lips greedily, remembering the hunger in her stomach. Finally, a server had came and brought Lyra and Ethan to a table near the window. The gold and silver view of the Goldenrod Skyline was impressive, but the real show stopper to Sour Cherry was it\u2019s decor. It featured fictional accounts of several legendary Pokemon getting devoured by hungry fatties not unlike the patrons in the diner itself. Lyra was most captivated of a terrified Lugia, held almost universally as a symbol of power and strength, being brought down to tears as it\u2019s head stuck out from the smiling maw of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked over the menu, trying to find a meal that wasn't too caloric for him. It was okay for girls to consume enough sugar and lard to stop a Wailord\u2019s heart, but for a boy his size, just looking at the descriptions was making him full. He settled on a Chancey\u2019s Lucky Egg, which was touted as being able to fix his broken nose by the girly waitress. Meanwhile, Lyra was ready to fully enjoy the Goldenrod experience. No holds barred, she asked for the food to just keep coming until she was stuffed. This order was not uncommon in Goldenrod, and the chefs wasted no time in getting it prepared.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few more stares from the other restaurant patrons settled on Ethan again, not fully believing that he didn\u2019t know about the Normal-Type Gym Leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Haven\u2019t you seen her ya idiot!? She\u2019s, like, four times as heavy and big as my mom, and boy half her age! Arceus, I know I only learned about her yesterday, but...I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s like the bitch that I wanna he someday, get it? Only, you know, even bigger!\u201d. Lyra sighed drummed her stomach as she leaned back in her reinforced chair, giving Ethan an impressive view of her wobbling rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s like your role model?\u201d Ethan gulped silently. He was happy to be back around Lyra, but he wasn't going to lie to himself, a rampaging Goddess Lyra scared the piss out of him. During the brief period he was under the care of Whitney, he didn\u2019t really get to talk to her much, which was weird since she thought he was her kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ethan was given more than enough times to drink in the entirety of her humongous body. Whitney had to be one of the biggest living creatures in the whole world, standing at a staggering and dominating 38 feet and weighing around 4,000 pounds. The Two tone women shook the whole street whenever she walked outside her gym, which in turn had to be demolished and rebuilt as her size and weight increased over the years. Positioned right enough, she could have squashed his old home under just one of her colossal butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...yeah, I guess so!\u201d Lyra seemed to brighten up at that statement. \u201cShe\u2019s so huge and big, she can do whatever she wants, whenever she wants it! That\u2019s, like, my fucking childhood dream\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid anyone tell you how she got so...healthy?\u201d Ethan questioned further, a little uncorrectable calling other people fat. Sure, the person they were talking about was without a doubt fat, but common courtesy and politeness was imbedded into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra than began to tell the story of Whitney\u2019s rise to corpulence and power, which she gathered from snippets of other people's conversations around Goldenrod City. Her parents were dirt poor Miltank Farmers that owned a small little operation north of the gold and silver city. When they died and the young girl inherited it, she quickly put the place\u2019s checkbooks back in the black by selling Miltank for their meat as well as their milk. She was the only other ranch providing meat, and soon she had a monopoly on the meat trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney began to buy out all the other farms in the area and renamed the whole place \u2018Moo Moo Farms\u2019. Trees had to be bulldozed to make way for more slaughtering plants, Pokemon had to be displaced as their homes were destroyed, and all the while the Gym Leader\u2019s wallet got fatter, as well as her waistline. That\u2019s when MooMoo Farms really began to expand. She raised enough money to essentially buyout Route 35 from the government for graze land. Than, the Pok\u00e9athlon Dome to make way for her new packaging factory. Finally, she made enough backhanded deals and not too legal transfers of money to purchase the beautiful National Park, soon leveled to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the people around Goldenrod praise Whitney for single handedly starting the \u2018Fat Revolution\u2019, or the resurgence of popularity of being fat and powerful. She was basically the de facto leader of the fat population, and a lot of the plans for Goldenrod\u2019s expansion went through her. The craziest thing as that she had done this all just under a decade. She started when she was sixteen, and now she was twenty five, still young enough to hold tons of ideas and plans for the future. Lots and lots of plans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blinked silently as Lyra finished her story. A whole load of information had just been dropped on him, and he needed time to process it. One would think that after being exposed to so much violence and destruction, he wouldn't be shocked at the news that everything north of Goldenrod City had been turned into an industrial killing zone. But, he hadn't. The blatant evilness of these women still shook him to his core, and despite trying to keep a straight face, Lyra could since he was uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ethan. Are you okay?\u201d Lyra asked, secretly enjoying the terrified look on Ethan\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually feel bad about those stupid Pokemon, do ya? I believe your exact words were \u2018I\u2019ll worship your body and help you get even bigger\u2019, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what he promised, ethan quickly nodded his head up and down. \u201cY-yes, Lyra! I didn't forget, it\u2019s just...just\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Lyra tapped her chin thoughtfully. She knew that Ethan practically worshiped her for her sexy curves, but he still held that annoying moral fiber that kept him from devoting himself all the way. Maybe he just needs some \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning whatsoever, Lyra suddenly reached over the table to grab Ethan by the scruff of his shirt. He let out a surprised gasp but did not struggle as she hoisted his body over the table onto her lap. His torso instantly sank into the ever so soft flesh that was Lyra\u2019s belly fat, while his legs were getting swallowed up by Lyra\u2019s twin pillars for thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust imagine it, you stupid fucking braaaat~\u201d Lyra cursed in a sing song voice. \u201cOne day, i\u2019ll be so fucking huge and fat, you can get lost in my tits for days! My glorious ass sitting on your house. And every day, I\u2019ll get even bigger and bigger, eating more and more retarded Pokemon...and you love that, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWah...what\u2026?\u201d Ethan was so comfortable, resting against Lyra\u2019s belly, that he couldn't fully respond. He was hanging onto every word that Lyra said, but he couldn't protest a single bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go on and on about how Pokemon are these Gods of friendship or some bullshit, but in the bed you know that all they're good for is another layer of fat for you to snuggle up against~.\u201d She massaged her bulbous stomach flab around Ethan\u2019s head, muddling his mind even more as of the fat molded over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnn...no\u2026\u201d Ethan tried to say. He felt himself sink, sink, sink forever in Lyra\u2019s pillowy gutm, all the while he felt funny. This was;the first time that he had gotten excited about Lyra\u2019s body, but this time seemed to be the most intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember your scrawny ass Marill?\u201d Lyra ruffled his hair sweetly. \u201cYou LOVED that fucking thing more than anything else in the whole world. And now it\u2019s dead. It\u2019s souls don't go to heaven, it\u2019s not still alive as fat on my body, It\u2019s dead and it\u2019s never ever gonna come back. And everyday you ogle at it\u2019s remains as luscious padding on my boobs, butt and belly, and you want nothing more than to feel and grope at it like crazy. And the more Pokemon I eat, the bigger they get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger\u2026?\u201d Ethan asked, trying to turn his head towards Lyra\u2019s face, but was blocked by rolls of fat and her gigantic boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Snack and the others are safe for now, but for how long? Once I\u2019m done with them and this journey, it\u2019s a one way ticket to fatsville for them. You\u2019ll probably cry your pathetic heart out and beg me not to, but i will anyways. And afterwards, for being an annoying shithead, I\u2019ll stuff you in my asscrack as psunsihemnt for a week. But do you know why I\u2019ll keep you alive when everything else you except me is gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoooove\u2026\u201d Ethan yawned as he curled up against Lyra\u2019s belly, the sound of it\u2019s gurgles of hunger lulling him to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, because I love you Ethan, and you love me. I love how easy you are hurt and make fun of, and because your too cute for your own good. Do you know why you love me, Ethan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...faaaat\u2026\u201d Ethan murmured in a low voice as he was on the verge of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. And what makes me get even fatter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPo...po...kemon\u2026\u201d And with that, Ethan had fallen asleep. Lyra grinned lovingly down at her Ethan as he slept like a teddy bear. He slowly raised him up, this time careful as to not wake him from his slumber, and gently placed him within the valley of her cleavage. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wasn\u2019t this town supposed to be peaceful? The moment he stepped foot onto the nearby route, his ears were wracked with the most horrific screaming he\u2019s ever heard! Something terrible must be happening over there! Was somebody being attacked by wild Pokemon or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan froze in fear, wondering what to do. Should he go find a police officer or something? No, there might not be any time! Judging by the way this guy was screaming, he might be\u2026 dead by the time he made it back. Then again, if Brendan tries to rescue them by himself, he might just suffer the same fate. He looks back and forth, unable to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 then he remembers his mother mother. She taught him always to be brave, and always do what\u2019s right, even if it means sacrifice. To live up to her example\u2026 he HAD to do this. He had to see if he could rescue this guy, no matter how dangerous it might be. With that thought, he took a deep, frightened breath\u2026 before rushing down the path!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected to see a guy being torn apart by poochyenas, or covered in webs by wurmples. What he didn\u2019t expect to see was the guy being chased around by a massive mountain of a woman! He immediately froze in place, looking up at the woman in unparalleled awe. He had never SEEN somebody this huge before! She had to be at least twenty feet tall\u2026 and probably weighed over a ton!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was entranced by the sight for a few moments. He couldn\u2019t help but find the sight of such a giant woman a little alluring. But eventually, the screams of the man she was chasing around knocked Brendan from his trance. \u201cYou! Please! Help!\u201d The man yelled. \u201cIn my bag! There\u2019s a Pok\u00e9ba-\u201d Before he could finish that sentence, he was interrupted by the woman grabbing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan watched in awe and terror as the massive woman easily lifted the squirming man up in the air, staring at him hungrily. When the woman licked her massive lips, he realized what she was planning! Overcome by horror, Brendan glanced all around, searching for the \u2018bag\u2019 the man had referred to, only to find it lying strewn on the grass by his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got in his knees and started digging desperately through it, eventually pulling out three Pok\u00e9balls. He\u2019s never used one of these before, so he didn\u2019t really know how to open them. When he glanced up, though, he realized that the man had been reduced to a pair of kicking legs hanging out of the woman\u2019s mouth! He had to act quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he\u2019d just try throwing one of the Pokeballs\u2026 but no. It just sort of bounced off the ground with a little clang. In his desperation, he tried throwing another one, this time underhand. That didn\u2019t work either! He looked down at the last Pokeball in horror, wondering just how to get the damn thing open. Maybe\u2026 maybe he had to press the button on the front?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the moment he pressed the button, the little ball began to open. Immediately, he tossed it down the field towards the giant woman, and the Pokeball exploded open in flash of blinding light! Brendan had to shield his eyes for a moment\u2026 and when he looked again, a Pokemon he had never seen before was standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was met with what looked like some sort of\u2026 lizard? Brendan has never seen a Pokemon that walked around on two feet before! It was like a little human. Judging by its color, he could tell it was probably a grass type. As he stood there, gawking at it, the lizard looked up at him with a confused expression on its face. Just who the hell was this kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan was so fascinated by the lizard, he almost forgot what he was doing\u2026 at least, until he looked up, and realized that the man had been reduced to a huge bulge in the woman\u2019s throat! She was swallowing him whole\u2026 and she had an orgasmic look on her face! Brendan gasped in terror, before lifting a finger. The lizard turned around, only to be just as shocked by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUmm\u2026 attack!\u201d</b> He didn\u2019t know what this Pokemon was called, nor did he know what moves it had. Luckily, \u2018attack\u2019 was all it needed to hear. The tiny little thing ran across the ground at an incredible speed, and used tackle, launching itself right into her side! For the woman, the attack was comparable to getting punched in the kidney!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan was awed to see such a small Pokemon easily bring the huge woman to her knees. Immediately, the woman coughs up her attempted \u2018meal\u2019, the man landing in a puddle of saliva on the grass. Meanwhile, she\u2019s in too much pain to even speak, or do much else but shiver\u2026 which gives the lizard the perfect opportunity to jump through the air and collide with her forehead, knocking her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very earth shook as the massive, 2000+ pound woman finally collapsed onto her back. Meanwhile, her victim slowly climbed to his feet, coughing and looking a little dazed after nearly taking a journey down a woman\u2019s throat. He was wearing a now soaked lab coat, and was a little on the heavy side himself. <b>\u201cS-sir, are you okay?\u201d</b> Brendan asks, walking up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, I\u2026 think I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d The man said, panting in exhaustion, surprisingly calm after what had just happened to him. He looks down at the saliva soaking him in disgust, gagging a bit. \u201cFine as I could be, I guess. Thanks for saving me, kid. I thought for sure I was a goner!\u201d He shakes Brendan\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan wasn\u2019t nearly so nonchalant. Adrenaline was still running through his veins, and he was still blown away by the seemingly impossible event he had just witnessed. <b>\u201cWho was that woman?\u201d</b> He asked. <b>\u201cSome kind of\u2026 Team Aqua secret weapon? Some never-before-seen hybrid of human and snorlax? Some\u2026 some\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. That was my wife,\u201d the man shrugged, waving a hand dismissively. \u201cNever get married to a fat chick, kid. Trust me. I don\u2019t care how much \u2018cushion\u2019 they have. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Brendan stood there, baffled, as the man patted him on the back and walked over to his bag. \u201cSo who are ya, anyway? I haven\u2019t seen you around town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Brendan. I just moved in today\u2026\u201d</b> The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! Well, I guess that was a rude welcome, huh?\u201d The man laughed as he collected his bag and Pokeballs. The grass lizard returns to his side. \u201cListen, I\u2019m gonna skip town before she wakes up. Give her a while to cool down. If you want, though, you can come visit my lab before I leave. I\u2019ll scrounge up something to reward you with. After all, I really owe ya, buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis\u2026 lab\u2026? <b>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d</b> Brendan gawked. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re a Pokemon Professor?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \u201cWhat? The coat didn\u2019t make it obvious?\u201d With that, he put the lizard back in its Pokeball, before walking off. \u201cSee ya around, kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Brendan finally returned to his new home. It was unfamiliar to him, and he didn\u2019t like it nearly as much as his old house, but his mother assured him that he would come to love this place. Unlike the mountain of a woman he had met on the route, Brendan\u2019s mother was only a little bit chubby, at 6\u20193\u201d and 200 lbs. She planted a kiss on his cheek when he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Honey!\u201d She smiled, busily cooking something in the kitchen. Brendan could only mutter a little \u2018hey\u2019 back, which disturbed her. She glanced at him, and noticed the shaken expression on his face. \u201cOh, dear. What\u2019s the matter? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan quickly had to make up some kind of story. <b>\u201cI was\u2026 walkin\u2019 around town, when I went near Route 101. And I heard a guy yelling for help, so I went and\u2026</b>\u201d He shuddered. <b>\u201cSaw him getting attacked by... some poochyenas.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looked concerned. \u201cOh my!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHe had dropped his Pokeballs, though, so I\u2026 brought out this weird little lizard thing, and it scared them all away,\u201d</b> he explained. <b>\u201cAfter that, he invited me to his lab.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s my boy! So brave!\u201d She smiled, giving him a hug, before considering something. \u201cWait\u2026 you must be referring to Professor Birch! A swell fellow, he is. You should go see him right away! After what you did, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to part with one of those rare Pokemon he\u2019s been collecting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan perked up at the sound. Now that he was old enough to be a trainer, he figured that his move to Hoenn would be the perfect opportunity to go on his first Pokemon adventure. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have a Pokemon, and didn\u2019t know how to remedy this problem. If he had a Pokemon as strong as that lizard\u2026 why, he\u2019d be unstoppable! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, I think I will,\u201d</b> he nods. <b>\u201cThanks, mom!\u201d</b> After getting another kiss on the cheek, he rushes out the door to Birch\u2019s lab, fantasizing about what kind of Pokemon he might get. He doesn\u2019t know the town, but by following the map, he eventually makes it to the lab. When he knocks on the door, it\u2019s pulled open to reveal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Brendan stood the second fattest women he had ever seen in his life, followed by Professor Birch\u2019s wife from before. Although not as obese as the other, she was still incredibly bloated fat at a staggering height of 12\u2019 3\u201d! She had long brown hair secured by a red and white kerchief and blue eyes with long eyelashes. Her huge and blubbery breasts and belly was practically exploding out of her red and navy blue shirt, while her white mini skirt and blue shorts could only contain half of her humongous rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan stood there with his jaw agape for a couple moments at the sight of the mysterious girl. Were all the women in this region Amazonian fatties? He certainly hoped that he was wrong. Soon, he snapped out of his shock and looked up at the stranger's face, who was looking down on him with a hungry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d the massive women patted her exposed belly, making it wobble and jiggle hypnotically. \u201cAren\u2019t you the cutest little morsel I have ever seen!\u201d Without any warning she bent down and grabbed Brendan by his sides and lifted him up into the air. He gasped and immediately tried to escape her grip, but it was all in vain against her strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat girl giggled as Brendan struggled in her grasp. Suddenly, she brought the tiny boy in for a smothering hug. The poor boy shuddered as his body was engulfed in pale, sweetly fat. Everything from the neck down was forcibly squished into the women\u2019s bulging stomach, while his head and face pressed up against her pillowy boobs. Brendan blushed heavy as the overly affectionate stranger continued to hold him in her embrace, and even began to nuzzle his mop of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger let out a satisfied sigh, totally content. \u201cOh, Arceus. You are just soooo sweet! Sweet enough to eat!\u201d She cried out in joy. Normally, that was a phrase that most people would pass of as a harmless term of endearment. But after seeing that poor man almost get eaten, he immediately assumed the worse. It wasn't helped that she kissed his forehead, which he mistook for a tasting lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay! Please set down that poor boy! Your scaring the daylights out of him!\u201d A strangely familiar voice rang out from behind the fat women. The girl, now named as May, turned around to face whoever was talking. Out of the corner of Brendan\u2019s eye, he could make out Professor Birch tapping his foot impatiently on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoops! Sorry Dad!\u201d May exclaimed. She let go of Brendan, letting him bounce off of her soft belly and onto the ground hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Brendan grunted as he got back on his two feet. He looked towards Professor Birch, who could only offer a sheepish grin at his  \u201cYou mean that she\u2019s your daughter!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, silly!\u201d May giggled. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the resemblance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d Birch waved his hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re here for your new Pok\u00e9mon, right? Come on, I won\u2019t keep you waiting any longer.\u201d He than gestured the new kid in town to follow him into the laboratory. Brendan did, but let out a little yelp of Surprise as the ground underneath him shook. He looked back and saw May smiling down at him like he was a stuffed teddy bear, following him into the building. Brendan quickened his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laboratory seemed to be both the scientific workshop for Professor Birch, as well as the official Birch Residence. Next to a line of highly advanced computers was a guest are of sorts, and the living room was littered with charts and graphs about Pok\u00e9mon. Finally, they come to the area where the starting Pok\u00e9mon were kept; the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Brendan was it? Brendan, here\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. I\u2019m going to give you a choice between these three Pok\u00e9mon to choose for your starter,\u201d He made a motion with his hand that directed Brendan\u2019s attention to the three Pokeballs on the kitchen counter. Were they planning on...eating them? No! Of course not! That would be immoral and absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...after that I\u2019ll give you a Pok\u00e9dex, a map of the region, a couple of Pokeballs, and than I\u2019m off to Petalburg to lay low while my better half cools off.\u201d Brendan noticed a few suitcases nearby, packed and ready to go. He got ready to leave...quick. Like, REALLY quick, as if this was a common thing that happened around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, are you leaving daddy? Did mom try to eat you again?\u201d May whined. \u201cCan\u2019t I go With you this time? I love being with mom, but I want to try exploring the region a little! Instead of just staying here watching T.V\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay, you and I both know the real reason you want to leave is so you can even fatter.\u201d Professor Birch shook is head and gave out a sigh. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019ve gotten so fat off of regular food, imagine how much you\u2019ll blow up if you started eating Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Brendan asked, confused by that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs big as a mountain\u2026\u201d May cooed dreamily, closing her eyes to scratch her blobby belly lovingly. She was no stranger to eating Pokemon already, but she never got to really pig out like her mother. Birch probably had enough trouble keeping his Pokemon alive with one fatty behemoth around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, could you repeat what you said earlier?\u201d Brendan asked again, getting a little nervous. But like last time, he was ignored as the Professor scratch his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, May, how about this?\u201d He offered. \u201cI can\u2019t let you come with me, you\u2019re a bit too much to handle outside the house.

The bulge, that remained disappointingly still throughout it\u2019s whole descent, disappeared into her chest, jostling her supple bosom as it passed underneath, to became the forth and final Psyduck-shaped mound in her already packed and bulging stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer meal finished, the Sinnoh Champion sighed in satisfaction and dropped to her tush against the wall of Caf\u00e9 Cabin, her fat rump squashing outwards at the incredible weight resting upon it. Displaced air surged up from her gut, causing her to let loose a responding belch that echoed throughout the entire route, strong enough to shake the trees around her. Many a Pokemon and many a person cowered in fear or fled for the cover of the tall grass at the demonic noise. But it\u2019s not like she cared. She was far more interested in churning up her current, boring prey and adding them to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stretch, the behemoth known as Cynthia shut her eyes and relaxed against the wall, listening to the gurgles of her belly as it started getting to work on the dumb ducks. How unresponsive they were to being digested was extremely disheartening, as the final, futile fight against the chamber was always the most exhilarating part for her. The struggling that weakened over time, the threats and insults that would melt into begging and pleading, the silence and stillness that accompanied their complete transformation into chyme. It made her whole being, her very soul, <i>tingle</i> with elation. The Psyducks weren\u2019t giving her any of that, and it made her huff. Still, she got some cruel satisfaction from listening to panicked chattering leaking from the wall of her caf\u00e9 behind, whispering about the \u201cmonster\u201d outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the gentle howl of the wind, she picked up the sound footsteps approaching her. Lazily, she cocked an eye open in that direction to see Professor Rowan\u2019s aspiring trainer staring down at her nervously. She couldn\u2019t help licking her lips at the sight of them. She had, begrudgingly, promised the Professor she would not try to eat them until they challenged her at the Pokemon League, but they just wouldn\u2019t stop teasing her with how delicious they looked\u2026</span></div></div>",

It had been a long road for the aspiring ten year old, fighting members of this new organization called Team Galactic along the way did not make it easier. However, with his trusty Infernape by his side, he believed that he could overcome any obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shattered that belief into a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas Platinum came to Route 210 under the pretense that it was blocked by a wall of Psyducks, suffering from severe headaches. He had bought some special medicine from the PokeMart back in Solaceon Town in an attempt to cure them and continue on with his journey undeterred. But, as he made his way towards Cafe Cabin, where the Psyducks had lines themselves. The young boy was shocked and appalled to see an enormously fat women gulping down the defenseless creatures with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon a second glance, this woman was none other than the Pokemon Champion of Sinnoh herself, Cynthia. Lucas could feel his knees turn to jello as he watched the gluttonous monster of a women from afar. Cynthia was more infamously known than even Team Galactic. Because of her position as Pokemon Champion, nad because the Pokemon League was the only semblance of an Organized Government in the region, she held the \u2018right\u2019 to do whatever she wanted to trainer and Pokemon that were defeated by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely, she would eat them. Whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, her form had exploded in both height and weight from this high calorie diet. Lucas would have almost had a crush on the well endowned women, had she not have been mistaken for as a spawn from the distortion world. The trainer wanted to get away from the scene as fast as possible, but before he could make an attempt to go through the path now devoid of confused Pokemon, the Pokemon Champion lazily opened her eye. Her gaze fell right on Lucas, and she smacked her lips gredley at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d Cynthia stood up from the creaking bench ominously as she kept her gaze on the poor Lucas. \u201cIf it isn't Professor Rowan's champion in the making\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Lucas was scared to death of this women, he still found it incredibly impolite not to converse with someone who was already talking to him. Forcing a smile, he took out his arm and held it in front of him. \u201cHello! My name is Lucas Platinum! And-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what your stupid name is, you retarded hick!\u201d Cynthia spat, making the poor boy grimace. The language of this woman! Did she talk to everyone like this? Nonetheless, he kept up his cheerful persona, even as the most powerful women in Sinnoh glared daggers at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia spanked her large, bulging stomach still filled with unresponsive Psyduck before talking again. Lucas blushed at the sight of the pale belly flab wobbling like gelatin, which Cynthia noticed. \u201cPokemon Trainers like you are a dime a dozen. You come from some dirt poor town from the boonies, you get your best friend for life from the old windbag Rowen, you get all the badges, you beat the elite four...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia bent down, giving Lucas a view of her ample bosom jiggling like crazy \u201c...and than you die. You think your so special, you think you\u2019re gonna be the one to break the streak, and then you melt into more flab for the next trainer to ogle at before I eat em\u2019 too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas backed away from the dominating women, but she merley walked forward, almost knocking him to the ground as her heavy stomach collided with his torso. \u201cScared? Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not gonna eat you yet. You still have three more badges to get before I can do it legally. So, since I\u2019m bored and you probably need more experience for your Pok\u00e9mon\u2026I\u2019m gonna give you some help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh!?\u201d Lucas exclaimed as Cynthia easily lifted him up from off the ground. But...w-why?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you already dipshit, I\u2019m bored! I\u2019m not gonna lounge around the Pok\u00e9mon League every day until you grow enough balls to face me. No, I want a real challenge, and who better to teach you than the champion?\u201d Cynthia smiled at the disgruntled child, before flinging his body over past the cafe. With a heavy thud he collided with the ground, and as he got up he saw Cynthia looking over him, licking her lips hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, your kinda cute for an obnoxious brat~.\u201d She teased the child in her shadow. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go easy on you and make you my slave when I win. Now get your scrawny ass up! I\u2019m gonna teach you what it really means to be a Pok\u00e9mon Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas shivers at the prospect of being this evil women\u2019s servant for the rest of his days and obeyed. Before long, he was walking along the rest of the Route, only now he was accompanied by the Pok\u00e9mon Champion herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Lesson Cynthia taught Lucas, was...</span></div></div>",

A day to watch what few Flying Pokemon that visited the town depart almost as quickly as they arrive, in search of greener pastures. Or to observe the waves pass the town by, heading mindlessly onwards to more exotic locations. Or to go mad counting the ceaseless spinning of the Pokemon Lab\u2019s wind turbine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr to do as most do, and stay inside and watch TV \u2013 the favorite pastime of the tiny town\u2019s few citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for three young teens, today was a day of unrivaled significance. Today was the day all three would finally escape the overwhelming boredom of their hometown; the day were they all would choose their very first Pokemon and begin their Pokemon adventures! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd absolutely <i>nothing</i> was going to get in Bianca\u2019s way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoood afternoon, Ms. Black!\u201d The bubbly blonde bellowed as she barged into the Black family household. Despite her still relatively normal size, she slammed through with enough force to rip the door from it\u2019s hinges and denting the wall behind it. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of pride in her heart at her own display of strength, and briefly pondered how powerful she\u2019d be once her diet became a little\u2026 <i>feistier</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intended recipient of her call turned her attention from the television to look at the intruder, and her face cracked into a smile. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the Tepig from next door!\u201d The older woman laughed, not at all cornered about the ruined state of her front door. She stood up, rising to a height that dwarfed Bianca, and advanced towards the girl. Each step she took shook the floor beneath her, the house creaking as it struggle to support the behemoth, and caused her massive belly and breasts to jostle and jiggle like an endless, fatty ocean that utterly mesmerized Bianca. Finally, Ms. Black came to a stop and lowered herself down to softly jab the girl in her somewhat chubby stomach. \u201cOr should I say Pignite? Looks like you\u2019ve been \u201cleveling up\u201d quite a bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca giggled. \u201cYes, mam. But I\u2019m looking forward even more to all the \u201cexperience\u201d I\u2019ll get from the wiggling food on my journey.\u201d She proudly proclaimed with a few pats to her tummy. She couldn\u2019t wait to become a goddess like Ms. Black or Professor Juniper, and to crush all who doubted her \u2013 such as her weak and pathetic parents \u2013 beneath her gigantic girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic woman\u2019s lips curled up into a proud smile as she took in the girl\u2019s statement. She straightened up and trekked to the kitchen, giving the blond a clear path to the stairs. \u201cMy waste-of-space son is upstairs with that\u2026 Seren boy, or whatever.\u201d She said as she opened up the massive fridge and began skimming over the contents, musing on what to stuff down her throat. \u201c\u2026 I do hope you\u2019ll be a fine Emboar someday.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca nodded with utmost confidence. She moved to the staircase, and pressed up towards her destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were delivered to Hilbert\u2019s house, so Hilbert gets first pick. And then you can choose after him, Cheren.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert and Cheren paused, sparing surprised glances with each other. Bianca wasn\u2019t one for letting others go first. Maybe, once upon a time, when the trio were extremely young kids she did. But not anymore. The boys knew there had to be a catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert bit the Boldore first. \u201c\u2026 A-are you s-sure?\u201d He hesitantly asked the girl who had commandeered his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t intended on stuttering, Bianca knew, but growing up with his monster of a mother had left him a boy who struggled to speak clearly, always fearful he\u2019d say or do something that\u2019d get him smacked into oblivion. Bianca felt a sliver of pity in her heart for him. A teeny, tiny sliver that was easily dwarfed by the admiration she had for his mother, but it was there, perhaps enhanced with finding him somewhat cute. So, she decided to cut him some slack this time. \u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d She commanded, voice dropping threateningly low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert swallowed and nodded. Shakily, he advanced towards the present and removed the lid. The sight of those three Poke Balls, the embodiments of the trio\u2019s freedom, took his breath away. With the power of one of these Pokemon, he could finally be free of his tyrant of a parent. Free! Free! <i>Free!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, he reached for one before stopping himself, his hand so close to touching the top of the sphere, and spared a glance at Bianca out of the corner of his eye, whose gaze was locked firmly on the box. There <i>had</i> to be a catch for her generosity. Would he or Cheren be punished if they picked the Pokemon she wanted? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Only one way to find out</i>, Hilbert begrudgingly accepted. He reached out, his time determined, and grasped a Poke Ball tightly in his hand\u2026 </span></div></div>",

He lightly pressed his right index finger into the button in the middle, and the containment device suddenly erupted out of his hands, spewing bright white energy onto the floor. The energy began to materialize and took shape, and after a few moments it was revealed to the trio that Hilbert had picked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTepig!\u201d the Fire Pig pokemon squealed in delight as it eyed it\u2019s new master from head to toe, satisfied. It leaped up from the floor into Hilbert\u2019s lap, surprising him, and proceeded to assault it\u2019s trainer with licks and nuzzles. Hilbert, however, was less ecstatic about the current situation than his new Pokemon, mainly because the plump blonde sitting on his bed was red in the face with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you little shit!\u201d Bianca screamed, scaring the fire starter into hiding under Hilbert\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou knew I wanted a Tepig since we were fucking Toddlers! Is this some kind of a sick joke?! \u2018Cause I ain\u2019t laughing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I...I\u2019m sorry Bianca!\u201d Hilbert pleaded as he shrunk under Bianca\u2019s glare. \u201cI don't know I would pick him, honest! If you really want it so bad, you can have it!\u201d He tried to remove the Tepig from the inside of his shirt, but the poor thing was too scared to come out. It\u2019s trainer would protect It from the big bad blonde outside, It just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as fast as Bianca\u2019s temper came, it faded away as if it had never happened. She blamed herself, realizing that it was her fault for trying to be nice for once in her life. Nothing good ever comes out of helping people. At first, she wanted to smack Hilbert upside the head...but she couldn't. As much as she tried to suppress the feelings down, she did feel bad for making Hilbert so scared, and after observing how strong of a grip the Tepig had on his torso, she knew she blew her only chance at having one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd than she got an idea in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what!? Just...just forget it \u2018bert\u201d, Bianca sighed, letting out all of her frustration in a single breath. Bianca was infamous for getting explosive temper tantrums at a moment\u2019s notice, and instantly forgetting about what made her mad in the first place after it had subsided. \u201cYou can have that stupid, fucking...cute lil\u2019 bundle of awesomeness, but it\u2019s going to cost ya\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert signed under his breath. Here comes the catch. When the three were kids, Hilbert and Cheren were forced to get Binaca food if they ever wanted anything from her. The two got many a bumps on their head for trying to sneak food out of their mother\u2019s kitchens for her appetite. But this time it was different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get to come with you on my journey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert down on his lower lip hard, almost enough to draw blood, from shock. \u201cBut...but Bianca! Isn't the whole point of getting our Pokemon, going on a journey to go our separate ways and make something of ourselves in the world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, dipshit, I know that. But I figure it\u2019s a fitting deal. See, you took my Pokemon, therefore you took my journey. So, I'm gonna take your Pokemon\u2026\u201dBianca than picked up the last remaining Pokeball with Snivy inside, with Cheren already have taken Oshawott, \u201c...and ruin your journey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...Snivy isn\u2019t my favorite Pokemon\u2026\u201d Hilbert interjected. \u201cI can\u2019t choose out of all the Pokemon in the world which one is my favorite. I love them all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, than I\u2019m just gonna have to make sure to eat all of them before you can catch any, huh?\u201d Bianca gave out a hyena sounding cackle, making the two boys and Pokemon grimace. Bianca had been talking non-stop about how much she was going to \u2018level up\u2019 during her Pokemon Journey, and she planned to do that by eating other Pokemon. They detested it, but couldn't really do anything with how strong their female friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if there's nothing left for us to do, I\u2019m gonna head on out. See you guys later!...and good luck \u2018bert\u201d. Cheren whispered once last message into his friend's ear and whisked himself out of the bedroom, disappearing from the Hilbert\u2019s and Bianca\u2019s lives...until they see each other on the road again. It happens more frequently than one would think in the Pokemon world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca felt a pang of sadness as she saw Cheren leave, but drowned it out by focusing on all the fun she was going to have on her Pokemon Journey! She knew she was going to have fun, but now that she had Hilbert for a traveling partner it was going to be even better. She could have him rub her belly after a full meal, or make catch more Pokemon for her to eat! Ohh, the future looked delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert nervously tapped Bianca on her meaty shoulder to snap her out of her daydream. \u201cUhhh...so, shall we say goodbye to my mom? I think she has some food ready for us...but I think it was really meant for just you.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With still an ever apparent slush from the remaining Pokemon goop inside your stomach, Bianca raised her puffy, fat arms over her head as she woke up from her sleep. She scratched her stomach absentmindedly, padded with hefty flab that did nothing to lag her movements. She rolled the sheets of her bed off of her body and heaved herself onto the floor, her globe-like belly squashing as she bent down. She gave a girlish squeal as jolts of euphoria were sent up her body as the fluids inside her from last night\u2019s meal were processed further and absorbed into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, Emboar, did you have no survival instincts? You should have known better than to let your trainer talk you into being eaten.\u201d She smirked darkly as she smacked her heavy gut. Bianca White, the assistant to Unova\u2019s Professor Juniper, had last night eaten the last remaining Pokemon of her former team from when she was a Pokemon Trainer years ago. She was such a naive shit back than, before she ate her first Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered it like it was yesterday. She had just left Accumula Town, and was all ready to catch some new Pokemon Friends on Route 2 with her trusty Tepig. That\u2019s when she saw it: A shiny Lillipup! She had to have it! Tepig took the thing down easily, but when she reached into her purse, she realized she had forgotten to restock on Pokeballs at the PokeCenter, along with having lunch. With no other way to carry her new Pokemon, and was pretty hungry, Bianca deposited the unconscious Pokemon in the safest place she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incident sparked a flame. A voracious, all consuming fire that ordered it\u2019s host to eat more, and more, and more. Since than, Bianca had become a cruel, gluttonous fiend that only wanted to devour more food. Her once trusted companions had become tools, and over her journey her frame expanded and ballooned with fat as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Bianca was a Wailord of a women. 900lbs, 13\u20195\u2019\u2019ft, the eighteen year old girl smiled in bliss as she examined her blubbery body in the mirror in her bedroom. Women like her were not uncommon in this Pokemon World. She had a physical condition that most all other female humans had: the fatter you are, the stronger you are. Naturally, gals get addicted to the rush of strength and dedicate their whole lives to becoming bigger, but most are content the way they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Bianca, however. She pulled out a tight fitting, latex like garb that was custom built for her out from her dresser. It\u2019s stretchy fabric drew attention to her luscious curves, and hugged her body better than her skinny ass mother ever could. The color scheme sort of matched up[ with her old attire: light green leggings, white trunk, orange sleeves...but other than that, she had long abandoned her urban/rural fusion get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on her clothes (which felt tighter and tighter every day), the busty and semi-full Bianca walked out of her massive house provided to her my the ever so gracious Professor Juniper, who was more or less around her size in terms of height and girth. It was far away from her home town in Aspertia City, but she didn't mind. Her mother disowned her after she found out about her new hedonistic lifestyle, and Hilbert and Cheren slowly faded away from the picture. Fuckers, who needs them when you got a full stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her purse and opened it up to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything. Sure enough, there was three Pokeballs sitting idly, each one containing a rare starter Pokemon. Professor Juniper assigned her to give out these things to some kid who lived in town with her. She couldn't remember if it was a boy or a girl, but she didn\u2019t care. All she wanted to do was get this whole ordeal over with and get some well needed breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did the fucking brat chose the lookout for the meeting spot!?\u201d Bianca shouted to herself as she stood on top Aspertia's famous viewing platform. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing up here, and the view isn't\u2019 even that good! Just some dumb trees and rocks\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Bianca saw a small figure ascend the concrete stairs. It must be the brat, and not a moment too soon. The last bits of her old Emboar had finally digested away, and she had gone from being semi hungry to being plain hungry. Her belly gurgled for food impatiently, while she patted it soothingly to calm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning sun rose over the horizon in the Kalosian Sky, and the humble village of Vaniville shifted off the lasts wisps of nighttime. It\u2019s denizens began to wake up and greet the day with a happy smile, grateful to be alive in such a wonderful era of peace and brotherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost everyone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, just last week, Vaniville had accepted a Kantonese Family to move to their quiet hamlet. The people were ever so excited. People from another region, how interesting! They couldn\u2019t wait to learn all about Kanto culture and their way of life, never thinking anything negative of the soon to be neighbors. However, once they did arrive, their welcoming faces turned to uncomfortable frowns. The family, known as the Biggs, were very, very different from the normal Kalosian citizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, they were fat. Immensely, inhumanly fat. They were a mother and daughter, and were the fattest and largest human beings any of them had ever seen. The daughter, Serena, was an incredibly well fed girl, weighing in at about 431 lbs, with a height of 7\u201d1\u2019. She was fat, that was for sure, but most of her weight accumulated around her ass and breasts. She had a potbelly, thick thighs and arms with a chubby face and multiple chins, but the real showstopper was the immense proportions of her bust and rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother on the other hand made her look like a grape in comparison. The blood het daughter, Ms. Biggs weight was more balanced, all 1,048 lbs of it in her 9\u201d4\u2019 frame. While Serena was a bombshell, her mother was a mountain of a tank, with each footfall she leaves an indent in the ancient cobble streets of Vaniville, with each sway of her hips a sidewalk fixture gets pummeled to the ground. The house they bought was obviously meant for much smaller people, yet the Biggs did not care, opting for the mother to just bulldoze her way through the front door and wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing that was so strange about the new residents was that they particularly enjoyed to eat the local Pok\u00e9mon population. The residents of Vaniville were shocked to see the duo casually scarf down on poor, helpless Pok\u00e9mon from the nearby route to Aquacorde, and found that even their own pets were not safe from their appetite! When asked about the morality of this, they would laugh in your face and tell you that Pok\u00e9mon are useless piles of shit that only exist for humans to do whatever they want with them. The intolerant behavior of these two women floored the village so much that they were publicly ostracized from the community; not like they cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe now cut to a sleeping Serena laying down on her bed as naked as the day she was born. She was currently having the most wonderful dream about Pok\u00e9mon and all the different ways you could go about eating them, when she was rudely interrupted by the annoying chirpings of a disgusting little fletching that broke into her room and settled down on the cushiony surface of her right tit. No sooner then it had done that, the frail bird Pok\u00e9mon was caught in the nude girl\u2019s fist and tossed into her mouth to be swallowed. Serena let the bulge travel down her throat and patted her wobbly belly affectionately. It gave out a low growl, telling it\u2019s host that it needed more, which Serena was more than happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese brunette got out of her bed with much sloth and lazily put some clothes on; nothing she could go out in, but fine for lazing about the house. She exited her room with a tired yawn, making the floorboards of the old house creak under her portly frame. As she made her way down the hallway to the stairs, she heard the voice of her mother call out from below. \u201cSerena! Wake up ya fucking fatass! It\u2019s breakfast!\u201d She shouted, to which Serena only smiled. Such crass language was accepted, even encouraged in this household, and the mother and daughter could tell the difference between when they are fake angry and actually angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ruining the stairwell just a little bit more since the Biggs moved In, Serena dropped down to the first floor, where her nose was assaulted by a variety of different smells coming from the kitchen. Her mouth watering, Serena instantly made her way to chow down and fill her noisy gut...</span></div></div>",

Her monstrous hunger, something she was undoubtedly sure she had inherited from her monster of a mom, simply refused to be sated. Her gigantic, Tyranitar-sized breakfast had already been broken down into nothing, not a single ounce left to add to her skinny body. Now it yearned, as it had many times before, for something far more\u2026 feisty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie shook her head and softly repeated her mantra under her breath. She glanced out over the conservation area, hoping to find something to take her mind away from her screaming gut. She spotted Ms Wicke on a distant walkway, observing the Pokemon below with clipboard in hand. Unlike her mother, who was a mountain of gelatinous fat and flab, Wicke was supply and shapely, an increasing rarity in this world of slobs and blobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also unlike Lillie\u2019s mother, Wicke was a kind soul who detested the idea of devouring people or Pokemon, another increasing rarity. She was always the one to comfort Lillie or her brother when their mother\u2019s temper flared. Always the one to offer the Aether Foundation's aid to people the president would simply scoff at. Always the one to get her hands dirty nursing countless Pokemon back to health.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Wicke, that amazing person, giggle as one of the Corsola she was observing playfully tackled another into the water. She absorbed the way her body subtly jiggled, her succulent breasts softly bouncing beneath her clothes. Her eyes trailed down to the older woman's ass, taking in all that they could of that delicious rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie felt her mouth begin to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe\u2026 Maybe a little taste wouldn\u2019t\u2026</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senses returned.

Get away from this hunger!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had managed escape from the clutches of her mother with Nebby in tow, Lillie would eventually discover that the hunger that burned within her veins was not so easily gotten rid of.

The sun soaked Archipelago Region was all of these things...until suddenly a fat phenomenon took over the world, and tourists from other regions got hungrier, hungry for something more than vegetables, berries, bread and dead meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no they needed it to...squirm on the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the Island Kahuna\u2019s were so opposed to the notion of people eating Pok\u00e9mon, that for a  brief, but impressive, time after the world decided that Pok\u00e9mon were better as food than friends, Alola trudged On with their traditions and values. But soon after the tourism industry tanked, an industry that the Melting Pot nation depended on dearly. So they had no choice but to do the unthinkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlola still is a beautiful gemstone in the sun, a fact that is blatantly obvious considering the industrialized state the rest of the world is in, but one would have to be pretty dumb not to notice some of the contemporary changes. The water is no longer as clear as crystal, the vegetation and wildlife less abundant, and the sky not as brilliantly blue as before. But it is still a jewel...just a little scratched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most noticeable scratch being the Aether Foundation in the middle of the Island Chain, a non profit philanthropic organization dedicated to cure hurt Pokemon. At least, it is on the surface. In reality the Foundation and it\u2019s leader are the main people putting pressure on Alola\u2019s Kahuna\u2019s to lax the Pok\u00e9mon Protection Laws and stuff their faces even more. It.\u2019s come under the media\u2019s spotlight after the leader\u2019s son, Gladion, ran away with a extremely rare and delicious Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as of last night, her daughter Lillie, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrawny, yet incredibly ravenous, teenaged girl walked through Iki Town, a spiritual village close to the Island's Guardian Spirit, and so far away from the tourist itinerary that the locals have not yet been swayed by the Blob mindset. She clutched the straps of the bag she held over her arm and pressed it to her thin waist. Nebby was her only real friend in the world now, and she needed to stay strong so she could protect it...no matter how tasty it looked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lillie shouted out loud whilst shaking her head, her iconic sun hat almost falling off. \u201cI\u2019m not like my mother, I am better than my mother! Pok\u00e9mon are friends, and humans are living people with hopes and dreams! I could never eat them...c-could I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello they're, young lady.\u201d A gruff, masculine voice behind Lillie spoke up. She jumped and turned around to see an elderly man, tanned and vie despite his apparent age. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for eavesdropping, but it appears to me that you are going through a...internal crisis. My name is Hala, I am Melemele\u2019s Kahuna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh!\u201d Lillie shriveled up like a dying flower and blushed crimson red. \u201cNo, you misheard! I love Pok\u00e9mon, and I would never, ever even think about sinking my teeth into their soft...supple\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle lady,\u201d the Kahuna put a hand on Lillie\u2019s shoulder and smiled. \u201cThey're is no reason to lie. If you are indeed struggling with yourself, than I would like to offer you some helpful advice.\u201d He pointed his hand to the tip of the biggest mountain on the Island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to the Ruins of Conflict, and seek out our Guardian, Tapu Koko. He shall give you the tools to emerge victorious from your conscious battle.\u201d He nodded sagely. \u201cWhen the time comes, he will ask you to make a very important choice...I know you will make the right choice. And with that, he bowed and walked away to attend to his duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTapu...Koko?\u201d Lillie echoed. Her stomach gave an annoyed grumble, reminding it\u2019s host of it\u2019s ever gnawing hunger. \u201cMaybe...he can help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNebby get back in the fucking bag right now, or I swear to Arceus I\u2019ll stuff you in and never let you out!\u201d Lillie yelled with the rage of ten skinny teenagers as her Pokemon floated happily up Mahalo Trail. She let it out for a quick second to get some fresh air, and now it was dancing and giggling all over the place. The hungry girl grumbled and swore under her breath as she climbed the mountainous trail after it. \u201cI bet Gladion\u2019s stolen Pok\u00e9mon doesn't rum away from him! Why are you being so difficult!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of exhausting climbing, Lillie made it to the top of an incline, and was ready to scream and grab Nebby from the ground...but it wasn't they're. Instead, the rare Pok\u00e9mon was floating over a rickety bridge, with a scared expression on it\u2019s face as bird Pok\u00e9mon overhead hovered menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...oh no oh no oh no!\u201d Lillie tugged at both ends of her hat and hit her lower lip hard. Nebby didn\u2019t know any moves, so it couldn\u2019t defend itself. And the bridge looked like it couldn\u2019t support an ounce of weight, let alone her. Her Pok\u00e9mon was trapped, and she was stuck. If something wasn't fine soon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Lillie cried out. She clamped her hands over her mouth and screamed as loud as she could. \u201cPlease, anybody, save my Nebby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd someone did come to save Nebby. But the question is...who exactly?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was also another reason that May gained weight: Max. Max had decided to take up cooking due to the fact that the seven year old was still to young for being a Pokemon trainer. As May feared that Max would make her obese she convinced professor Birch to give Max a Pokemon as long as Max didn\u2019t try to start his journey. That Pokemon was Treecko. Some time later Max befriended some strange steel type called Meltan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day May was sitting under a tree while Max was playing with Treecko, Meltan and some of May\u2019s smaller Pokemon. May gasped as she saw an all too familiar balloon, it was team rocket. However before May could utter a single word a giant claw jutted out of the balloon and grabbed Max bring him up to the basket. To May\u2019s surprise rockets appeared out from the back of the balloon propelling them forward. \u201cAfter that balloon!\u201d May shouted as she, with some degree of difficulty started chasing after the balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was brought up to the basket of the balloon and he gasped at what he saw. It was Jessie but she was much, much bigger. Oddly enough while the redhead was several hundred pounds lighter it appeared to Max that all of the weight only went into her breasts, butt and belly. The woman having each individual breast being larger than her head, A fat pillow belly and while he couldn\u2019t see she also had an impressive rear. \u201cHello twerp, I bet you have a whole lot of questions. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll answer them. How did I get so big and where are Meowth and James? Well you see not too long ago I hit the jackpot and ended up winning twenty seven lotteries. I bought a huge house, some stocks in the stock market, I kept gaining weight from eating food, James and Meowth came by and said that they haven\u2019t seen me in a whil and that they missed me. So I solved their problem by eating and digesting them so they could stay on my body as fat. I bet you are wondering why I\u2019m in Hoenn rather than finding twerp. I only want, sorry I mean wanted his pikachu. However twerp would doesn\u2019t make good boy toy material, which is what you are my adorable little pet. Jessie purred petting the struck silent boy\u2019s hair <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they made it to Jessie\u2019s massive mansion. \u201cThis is your new home twerp. Nah you\u2019re no longer a twerp, you\u2019re new name is <i>pet</i>\u201d Jessie said patting her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jessie want from Max?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Max was incredibly confused by this mornings turn of events. One moment, he was out playing with his Pok\u00e9mon and big sister, and the next he was being held against his will by Jessie. He stumbled out of the basket of the hot air ballon as the redhead shoved him, and craned his neck up to see the impressive building in front of him. In the middle of an incredibly dense forest, hidden away from civilization, was an old mansion looking a tad bit worse for wear. It was three stories high, probably five of it had a basement and attic, with paint peeling off the sides of the rotting wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove, Pet!\u201d Jessie smacked him on the back of his head, ordering him to keep walking. \u201cYou can take in the view later, get inside for your first task.\u201d Max grumbled, but obeyed, not wanting to incur the fat women\u2019s wrath any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the mansion, a cold wind moved across Max\u2019s face. It was just as old and musty on the inside as it looked on the outside. The furniture was falling apart, dust coated everything in a thin film, and he could hear the whole structure groan and moan against the wind. \u201cI thought you said you won the lottery, why does this place look so...bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie smirked and patted her pet on the shoulder assertively. \u201cSilly Pet, this place is just a roof over my head to me. This place is so old and decrepit that no one wanted to live here, so I bought it for a steal! Plus, it\u2019s far, far away from everything\u2026\u201d she leaned her gigantic dome of a stomach over the smaller boy\u2019s body \u201c...which means it\u2019s just you and me, forever and ever~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no way!\u201d Max move away from Jessie, trying to stay in control of the situation. \u201cMy s-sister will save me, she\u2019ll find me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Pet. Sweet, innocent Pet. That is so. Freaking. Stupid.\u201d Jessie snarled wickedly as she reasserted her domination over the child by picking him up by his waist. \u201cI ate my partners James and Meowth, what makes you think I can\u2019t eat her? Not that she\u2019ll be able to find this place. Now, since your getting adjusted, I\u2019ll let that back talk slide. But anymore?\u201d The abusive glutton licked her lips hungrily, and Max instantly understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstand? Good.\u201d Jessie dropped Max down to the floor with a thud. \u201cNow, get in the kitchen on the left. I\u2019m hungry, and I gotta eat now. I don\u2019t care what it is, as long as it\u2019s edible.\u201d With that, Jessie walked away to another location in the large, yet falling apart mansion. Max turned around and made a b-line to the kitchen, now realizing how much mortal danger he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the double doors, Max found out where most of the money Jessie won went to. The kitchen had to be the one place in the whole mansion that wasn\u2019t old or run down. The appliances were brand new, the tabletops shined, and everything had a clean, sparking look to it. As he got aquatinted with all the fixtures on the room, he discovered the pantry, which was so large and overflowing with food it was more of a miniature warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, Max soon got to cooking, hoping that Jessie might treat him a little nicer if he does a good job. He made a veritable smorgasbord of food, dishes hailing from several different regions and all of them packed full with enough calories to sate a Snorlax, and hopefully Jessie. Poffins, Malasada, Moo Moo Ice Cream, grilled Taurus steak, it was enough to make his mouth water at the sight of his own creation. But before he could evan think about taking a little something to eat, he heard the heavy footfalls of his new master coming from outside the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm, smells good Pet! Jessie smiled hungrily, instantly zeroing I\u2019m on the wide array of food piled on the dining table. \u201cBetter be enough, I worked up quite the appetite walking down here~\u201d. With that, she dove right into the feast, devouring plate after plate of delicious food. He didn\u2019t want to, but Max blushed as he noticed the way the redhead\u2019s stomach ballooned outwards as more food was deposited inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only less than a half hour, Jessie was done. She let out a deep belch and patted her disgended gut affectionately.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The former Team Rocket member took the young boys\u2019 arm and, by force, dragged him out of the kitchen into the main foyer. \u201cW-what sort of reward are you p-planning Jessie?\u201d He asked, being led up the stairs and onto the second story landing. The whole time he was dragged by her, he couldn't help but find himself fixated on her jiggling rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething I\u2019m sure you and I will both want~\u201d Jessie purred at Max seducingly as she opened a door in the hallway. The doorway revealed a bedroom, presumably hers, with the walls covered with video-game posters and provocative photos of herself. Jessie walked in whilst making sure that Max followed her, before slamming the door shut and locking it. Without any warning, she turned around to face her pet before leaning down to wrap her flabby arms around his head to pull him in for a kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax tried to pull himself away, but Jessie's\u2019 hold on his head was too strong. After what felt like minutes, she finally pulled away, wiping off a strand of drool that escaped her mouth in the process. \u201cDid you like that, pet?\u201d She questioned, putting her hands onto her meaty hips as she awaited an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was...electrifying.\u201d Max answered, which was the truth in every scene of the way. He had never been kissed anyone before, much less by his captor who threatened to turn him into fat if he disobeyed. The way her surprisingly agile tongue invaded his mouth felt so alien and overwhelming that he didn\u2019t know if it was a good or bad experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because that was just the first bit of your reward. Now, strip your clothes and get on the bed.\u201d Jessie ordered, undoing the straps on her clothes in advance. Max, afraid of what is to come, but more so of what would happen to him if he disobeyed her, did what he was told folded his clothes neatly on the floor by the wall and took his place on her bed. He looked over at his new master, who was now only dressed in a pink bra and panties.Her two gargantuan, grey cheeks wobbled against the other as she walked over to the bed. \u201cLay down.\u201d She instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax obliged Jessie and lied his back onto the blanketed mattress. The moment he did so, Jessie turned around to show her massive backside to him. She gave off a cute giggle before dropping it down onto his body, completely engulfing him. Max tried to gasp out of shock, but all he could get into his mouth was Jessie's\u2019 butt flab. The weight was bearable,but it still pressed down onto his bones hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying your reward?\u201d Jessie asked while giving her butt a playful wiggle. What Max did offer a response, it was completely inaudible. It was like he was responding from the underground. Jessie took his silence as affirmation and grinned to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessie let out a coo as soon as those Max\u2019s delicate hands started to massage her front once again, only this time it was focused on her practically naked boobs. Her stomach squished lightly while large hands began to pet down her pet\u2019s head. The former Team Rocket member  breathed in and out, causing Max to squish into the bed even deeper with each breath. The young boy gave a happy murr and leaned in to nuzzle the soft, yet strong chest, inhaling briefly while he was smooshed into it gently. Jessie sighed quietly and closed her eyes, cuddling tenderly with her pet as she started to feel something wet rub against her left nipple.  Another smile crept along her lips as she heard a moist suckling nose, her hand ran down the back of Max's head once again and along his shoulders while he kissed and suckled on her nub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure ran through the women's body as her chest was treated to the formerly timid Max's lips and tongue.  She groaned happily and administered a gentle squeeze as the suckling continued, though he heard Max whimper quietly as his free hand caressed the other fat nub that adorned Jessie's impressive chest.  Jessie groaned and her nipples quickly became erect with the attention, teasing her large form as she held the younger male nice and snuggly.  However, the moment was interrupted by a hungry growl from the pit of the women's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax perked his ears and ceased his efforts, panting a little while he gazed up to Jessie.  \"It...sounds like you're hungry,\" he noted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big women chuckled and nodded, \"Yeah, it's impossible to keep this tank of mine satisfied for very long.  I had a big breakfast, but I've got something right here though that should keep it happy for a while...\" She mused quietly and nuzzled at the top of Max's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie's tongue slowly slipped from her lips and lapped over Max, but all she heard in response was a soft groan and she felt that smaller form practically cling to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd...have room for me?\" The boy asked as sweetly as possible.  Deep down it looked like he knew the answer, but he still wanted to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women just kept smiling, such a cute little pet she had in her grasp.  \"I could easily make room, then you'd fit no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words made Max wiggle faster and his blush returned, though before the curious boy could ask how room was going to be made, Jessie opened her mouth nice and wide and let loose a massive, nearly earth shattering belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRLLLLLPPPPPPPP...ahhh...\" Jessie groaned, the expulsion of so much gas at once left her feeling rather content.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that burp, the Max\u2019s face was rather moist with saliva and hot, heavy breath that wafted from those massive jaws.  All Max could whisper though was another 'wow' as the fumes floated around his head and Jessie held him by the waist and started to scoop him closer to her large lips. Those strong arms gave him another affectionate squeeze, coaxing him to almost melt in the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the ride, pet,\" the big girl mused and licked her lips, maw already starting to salivate more as she opened her jaws nice and wide, blowing more of her powerful breath that smells faintly of breakfast into the boy's face before her mouth started to close around Max's form with practiced ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie's maw was so large she easily fit Max inside from his head down to his chest.  Her tongue slurped greedily over his bare skin, making it nice and slick while she got mouthful after mouthful of flavors and murred very heavily all the while.  Jessie nibbled gently on Max's chest, her massive tongue started to tease over his lithe form.  She suckled carefully, not swallowing just yet while she kept one hand on the boys back and the other grasped his backside slowly and used that to ease him further inside.  Her gullet relaxed and soon took hold of the boy's entire head and shoulders, claiming them with a wet, squishy gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie let out a deep murmur as her tongue continued to lap and savor over Max's form, and at the same time her throat began to slightly bulge with the upper portion of her live meal. She slowly eased her jaws further down the boy's form, working her way over the stomach with another greedy gulp.  Her maw continued to soak his skin in more of her fluids and her throat kept a soft, yet powerful grasp on Max.  She swallowed again and lurched her hungry mouth downwards to encase the boys entire upper half inside of her throat, hearing him make muffled sounds inside of it while her large tongue slurped and tasted over the now wiggling Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving a gentle push on the boy's rear, Jessie reclined back slightly and tilted her head upwards as she rested her hands on her fat stomach.  She started to rub herself idly while she took very slow and relaxed gulps, drawing more of her lunch down that slick passage.  Her lips soon sealed around Max's knees as that lump in her neck and chest was inched closer to her waiting stomach. Jessie took one last powerful gulp, tugging the twitching feet into her greedy maw to join the rest of the tasty pet.  She kept her hand holding onto her gut as it felt the weight finally sink in, causing her belly to bounce on her lap slightly before it started to conform around 'lunch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was still slowly wiggling, and his body was rumbling quietly in content.  Jessie stroked the contained boy, feeling the occasional nuzzle from the devoured being as she enjoyed the silence that came after eating such a tasty, and cooperative meal.  That silence was soon broken however.  A thunderous, wet belch erupted from the women's jaws and made the room shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh,\" Jessie groaned, looking very proud of herself as she gave her belly a light pat and licked her lips, still tasting Max on them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max immediately connected it to Meltan, but instead of being smaller than one foot, it was big enough to tower over Jessie. It walked forward, shaking the room under its\u2019 heavy, liquid metal, and to their surprise May and the other Pokemon were behind them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie scowled at May, giving her in turn a prideful smirk. \u201cH-how in the hell did you find this place!? And...w-what is that thing?!\u201d She pointed at Melmetal, somewhat afraid of how it was much bigger than her. She wasn't used to being dominated in a very long time, and now painful memories were flooding back into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis \u2018thing\u2019 is Melmetal.\u201d May patted the massive Pokemon on the \u2018back\u2019 boastingly, not phased by the slightly sticky, fluid surface. \u201cYou can thank him for leading us here. I can go into detail later...after I have a little snack~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any more warning, Melmetal wrapped its\u2019 hexagonal nut hands around Jessie impressive waist and holsted her up into the air. The women let out a scream of anger and demanded that she be let down immediately. \u201cLet me go you oversized muk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelmetal was only too happy to oblige. He walked towards May, who gave the much more massive Pokemon a wink. Taking that as its\u2019 cue, he slowly dropped Jessie down...into Mays\u2019 open mouth. Max let out a gasp as she witnessed the sight occurring in front of him. He knew that he would be saved eventually by his sister, but he didn\u2019t know it would happen...this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing!? I can\u2019t go out like this, I\u2019m supposed to be eating you!\u201d Jessie protested as more of her body passed Mays\u2019 lips, dooming her to a fate inside her stomach. She grinned and continued to gulp down the massive meal quickly and happily, feeling up her tummy as it grew to even more ridiculous proportions to accommodate the latest portion of her feast. Half-digested food was squished to the bottom of her groaning tummy by its new occupant, and the greedy organ glorped and gurgled in anticipation of digesting the mountain of delicious meat it had just been given. The rest of Jessie\u2019s body went down smoothly and quickly, and soon enough her toes were vanishing into her gullet and the entirety of the former team rocket member was deposited into her over ripened stomach. Once her meal was completely and her throat free of any more further tasty obstructions, May sighed and rubbed her jiggling and bulging tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, you tasted really good too!\u201d she announced, patting her belly lightly. \u201cOof, and you filled me up pretty well too! I\u2019m almost full now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of Jessies\u2019 protests and cries, May slid two hands under her belly and hefted her massively rotund gut, her fingers squishing delightfully into the softness of the digested goop in the bottom of her belly. \u201cHey Max, do you think you could get me some food from the fridge? I\u2019m still kinda hungry\u2026\u201d Max was still a bit tired from serving Jessie, but obliged his sister with a happy smile, the other Pokemon and Melmetal urged to join him as well. The doors of cupboards across the kitchen flew open one by one, and each had their contents disrobed of packaging and shoved into May\u2019s salivating maw, further filling up her wobbling gut. Jessie voiced quite a few protests about the further masses of food that were likely raining down onto her, but May could hardly hear her muffled complains and paid them no heed. Approximately fifteen minutes after her human meal, May had finally finished stuffing her tremendous tummy with food, having made sure that every inch of her gut was filled up with delicious snacks for her to thoroughly digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Panting slightly with effort, May slowly made her way into the living room of the house and flopped onto the couch, her huge belly making the poor furniture groan and creak as she impacted the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cOoohh\u2026 I\u2019m so fuuuuull\u2026\u201d she groaned, massaging what parts of her tummy she could reach. \u201cThat was really good foooooood\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to, - Urp - , eat the rest of it tomorrow! Hehe, but for now, I had better rest up and let my belly gurgle all these goodies into chub\u2026\u201d Max sighed from afar, shaking his head. His sister really was a glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Slowly, May drifted off into a food-coma, utterly heedless of Jessie\u2019 pleas and protests as she was churned into mush along with the rest of the food in her belly. Max and the other Pokemon took their time to explore the mansion while she slept, not wanting to disturb her. They all found some suitable rooms to sleep in, dispute the sorry state the building was in. As the brunette drifted off, her belly kicked into digestive overdrive, gurgling and glorping loudly around its meal and slowly reducing everything and everyone within into an easily-absorbable and highly nutritious goop, perfect for the growing girl. May spent the whole day, and the entirety of the night that followed, napping on the couch while her belly grew smaller and her body grew softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh wow, I\u2019m so big \u2018n soft now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay stood in front of the mirror in one of the mansions\u2019 restrooms, admiring the effects of her feasting on her body. Overall, she had gained quite a bit of chub, and likely no small part of it was from Jessies\u2019 contribution to her hunger. Her belly had fattened up nicely into a soft and squeezable bit of paunch, just enough for her to squeeze and jiggle to her heart\u2019s content. Her arms grew a tad wider and her bust grew fuller, though it remained just as perky as always. May thought her top felt a bit tight on her now, but it would likely survive at least one or two more feasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The most noticeable contribution to her body, however, was to her hips and thighs. All of the calories from her mountainous feast had gurgled up and swirled together to add layer after layer of delicious fat, plumping up her thighs massively. The girls\u2019 backside was absolutely enormous now, two massive and soft cheeks that rubbed together as she walked and bounced with every small step! May absolutely loved the growth, and she spent a good while kneading and jiggling her soft and flabby cheeks, before a sudden grown from her tubby tummy reminded her that it was time for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cDon\u2019t worry tummy, I hear you!\u201d she cooed to her stomach, pinching a big of flab and jiggling it. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you up with whatever\u2019s left here, and then we can go find something else to eat! Hehe, I just hope there\u2019s enough food left to fuel the trip. All that food and that tasty girl made me sooooo big and fat! I bet my greedy gut can hold twice as much now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Giggling happily, May bounced out of the room and jiggled her way into the kitchen, intent on making good to her claim.</span></div></div>",

Max climbed into his bed, he did love his sister but he didn't know how long he could wait to start his journey before May becomes to large to handle. Max was only seven so that meant he had to wait three years. How big could May get in three years? Max shuddered at the thought. Maybe Max could call Ash and possibly invite him to Hoenn? Max shook his head, Ash was busy in Sinnoh. Eventually Max decided to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow eating an apple larger than one's own body is sure to cause some weight gain, but how does May grow?</span></div></div>",

HE stretched his arms over his head and sat up, scratching his back. The young boy got out underneath his blankets and put his two feet on the floor, ready to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked himself over in a mirror. Today with the big day. It was his tenth birthday, the day he would be able to start his Pokemon Journey around Hoenn. He hasn't really changed much in appearance since he was seven, save for some minor height growth. He already had Pokemon to battle with, and had already gone around Hoenn once with Ash, so he felt pretty confident of himself. He put on some clothes and walked downstairs to greet his Mom and Dad, knowing it would be the last time he would see them for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Mom, good morning Dad!\u201d Max greeted, walking into the kitchen to see them working away on breakfast. But something seems off to him, the tone of the room wasn't as jovial as usual, and the two adults had frowns plastered on their lips. \u201cG-guys, whats wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s mother signed and put down a frying pan full of bacon to walk over to Max. She knelt down on a knee to get eye level with him and placed a hand over his shoulder affectionately. \u201cHoney, I...I know you were really looking forward to going on a Pokemon Journey, but...it\u2019s your sister\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour older sister is a lot to handle, Max.\u201d Norman butted in. \u201cAnd we made a decision as a family that...we need you here with us to look after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Max shouted, recoiling from his mother\u2019s touch. This was a massive blow to him, he had been looking forward to this day for years! But it wasn't as if he didn't understand the situation his parents were in. May had gotten big in the past three years. Really, really big. He thought that when he gave her that size changing ray from jessie Mansion, she would have used it to shrink him down or something. But instead she just used it on food, more eager to fill her gut than anything else. At first, the family didn\u2019t mind because it cut down on food costs. She only ever needed one foodstuff a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was three years ago when May was still under a ton. Skip to today, where she was now 25 by 25: 25 feet tall weighing 25 tons. In three years, May had blossomed from a mere glutton to an apex predator where anyone can become food for that gut of hers. Currently, she was resting in the backyard, having not woken up yet, filling up the whole space of it with her flabby body and spilling over into the forest behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...b-but\u2026\u201d Max tried to think of a solution to all of this. He had to go on a Pokemon Journey, it was practically a rite of passage. If he wouldn't go, than he would forever be seen as a meek little kid in the eyes of society, no matter how mu he trained and no matter how smart he was. \u201cWhat if...May comes along with me on my journey? I went around the region with her before, and she would love to do it again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s mother and Norman looked at each other worryingly before turning back to Max. \u201cMax...your sister's stomach is a black hole. I\u2019m not saying that out of anger of her, i\u2019m saying it as a fact, she is an impossible to satisfy. What happens if you run out of food on the road with her? You know we\u2019ve caught her...eating Pokemon in the past.\u201d She shivered. \u201cYou are very mature for your age, and you know May more than evan we do. But we have to keep her here, it\u2019s for her own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-why don\u2019t we let her decide than?\u201d Max sputtered out. \u201cShe\u2019s 21 now, a legal adult. You can\u2019t keep her here if she doesn't want to stay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s mother sighed, knowing that Max was right. \u201cOkay sweetie. Go outside and ask her, and will support whatever happens next. Just know that I love you and your sister very much, and that we only want the best for you two.\u201d Max smiled an hugged his mom and dad before heading out into the yard.</span></div></div>",

But while most kids leave on their Pokemon journey May had to stay behind because of her brother\u2019s condition. May\u2019s little brother; Max was a half inch tall. Now the reason why Max wasn\u2019t all over the news for being extremely tiny was because his mother decided to do a home birth. Once Normon saw Max he immediately filed for divorce. However May\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t signed the papers yet. May had to stay behind to look after Max while her mother worked as Normon refused to pay money to support them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause May only stayed home to look after Max she had gained weight. May had a large chest and rear end, but her stomach was big enough that if people saw her on the street they would automatically think she was overdue with twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Max was smaller than an inch he was almost indestructible. He had been accidentally sat on, and eaten and turned out fine. However Max\u2019s impressive durability didn\u2019t apply to sharp objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night while Max was asleep May was talking with her mother. \u201cMom, please let me go on my journey, I\u2019m eighteen, I can\u2019t stay here forever.\u201d May exclaimed to her mother. \u201cBut what about Max, I can\u2019t quit your job since your father has left us.\u201d May\u2019s Mother said holding her hands together. \u201cJust sign the papers and make him pay alimony.\u201d May suggested, while she would like her parents to stay together she knew it was a lost cause as she knew her father wouldn\u2019t stand the idea of raising a tiny child. \u201cNo, I can convince your father to come back I just need time.\u201d \u201cHow about this I can take Max with me, I already take care of him at home it will be no different if we\u2019re on the road. Besides if anyone tries to mess with us I\u2019ll break their legs and take their money.\u201d May said smugly, May\u2019s mother sighed before giving her final verdict.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know I have a way with getting what I want.\u201d She smirked cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay\u2019s mother sighed. \u201cI know you do, May...just like your getting your Pok\u00e9mon Journey. Fine, you can take Max and go out to see the world. Just...promise to keep in touch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay\u2019s eyes widened. After eight long years, she was finally getting to go on her Pok\u00e9mon Journey! Barley containing her excitement, she promised. \u201cY-yeah Mom, I\u2019ll call every day! Oh Arceus, this is really happening!\u201d She jumper in the air and pumped her fist in a celebratory manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, knowing her daughter\u2019s appetite, May\u2019s mother cooked up as much food as she could for breakfast as a going away present. Secretly, she was relieved May was leaving so she had more money not spent in her food budget, but it was still sad to see her go. May came downstairs with her younger brother Max in his usual place in between her breasts. Their mother still wasn\u2019t comfortable about how much she \u2018loved\u2019 her brother, but it was about to be out of her hands very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, thanks Mom!\u201d May smiled cheerfully as she saw the large array of food prepared for her, walking over to give her mother a big hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I told Max about what\u2019s happening. He said he wanted to stay here with you, but I just couldn\u2019t take him seriously when he looks so cute~\u201d. Max shifted around her older sister\u2019s tit flesh uncomfortably. He was going to miss his mom and house, but they're was never any stopping May when she wanted something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay gave Max a few crumbs of food before going all into the feast before her. He always felt...weird seeing her sister glut out like that. This type of eating was very routine, and each time she ate, her body would always feel softer later. He blushed, realizing he wanted his sister to get bigger so his \u2018usual place\u2019 could be more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the feast was cleared away, May let out a large belch and said goodbye to her mom, sad to leave and nervous of what lies ahead, but excited to finally start her life with her younger brother Max. She walked over to the Laboratory owned by Professor Birch to get her Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're was just one problem. May had grown attached to the idea of being a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer, not being a Trainer in of itself. She didn\u2019t really know anything at all Pokemon related, and Professor Birch was not going to give such a big responsibility to her easily. But he did feel bad for her situation, and having known her brother Max to be exceptionally smart for his age, he allowed it after much persuasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Pok\u00e9mon did she Pick?</span></div></div>",

He even thought of his own dream team of what he would use if he wasn't tiny. Max realized maybe he could be a trainer through May, he could possibly convince her to catch some of the Pokemon that Max had wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering the first gym leader uses rock type Pokemon you should use Treecko.\" Max said, May looking at the grass type. \"Are you sure it doesn't really look all that cute, Mudkip is cute and it beats rock types.\" May argued, \"Well I know that there is a Pokemon that the rock type gym leader uses that knows an electric type attack.\" Max argued, thankful he did his research. May sighed her brother was smart enough to know the right choice but she decided that the next Pokemon she wants she will catch it despite what Max says. \"Okay I'm going to pick Treecko.\" May says to the professor. \"Good choice, here is your Pokedex and Treecko's Pokeball.\" Professor Birch said handing the items to the chubby girl. \"Thanks professor.\" May said putting Treecko into it's ball before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was now on route 1 she took a deep breath. \"Man, that fresh air is nice, isn't it Max?\" May asked, Max taking a breath itself, even though he was surrounded by his sister's flesh he could still smell the hair. \"Yeah it is nice?\" Max said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

She was absolutely overjoyed, she was finally a Pok\u00e9mon trainer with her own Pok\u00e9mon! A whole open world for her to explore, it was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Max was thinking up ways to make sure he could live out his dream of being a Pokemon Trainer through May. She loved her bigger sister, but he knew that she didn\u2019t really know anything about being a Pokemon Trainer. He could give her tips and tell her which Pokemon to catch, that way it could be his adventure as well as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a rumbling in the bushes to the side of them on the road. The foliage kept rustling for a while until out popped a Zorua, looking for something to eat. \u201cOh. My. Arceus. It\u2019s so cuuuuute!\u201d May gushed, instantly enamored with the little fox Pokemon. \u201cI just have to have it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay May, get Treeko out and get ready to catch it with another Pokeball.\u201d Max reminded her big sister. May noded, fishing out Treeko\u2019s Pokeball. Before she threw it, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you talking about Max? I don\u2019t have any other Pokeballs.\u201d May lowered Treeko\u2019s Pokeball in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Didn't Professor Birch give you some Pokeballs to start out with?!\u201d Max cried out, not believing how forgetful her big sister could be right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, nope! I guess not!\u201d May giggled, while Max just groaned. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that Maxie Waxie, I got this all figured out. Go Treeko!\u201d She threw Treeko\u2019s Pokeball at the Zorua, initiating the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Max telling May what to do most of the way through the fight, Treeko won. Zorua passed out on the ground, too tired to keep going, while May beamed. \u201cNow, to catch my very first Pokemon!\u201d. Without any Pokeballs, May walked over and picked up the unconscious Pokemon by the scruff of it\u2019s neck and pushed it deep into her breasts along with Max. \u201cI figured since I keep you they're, why not my Pokemon too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax wiggled his way around to make room for Zorua, but couldn't find too many flaws with his sister\u2019s logic. \u201cUhh...I guess this works for now. You should probably head to a Pokemon Center to heal it now, it doesn't look too good.\u201d Max suggested as the dark Fox Pokemon writhed a little in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut is isn't it supposed to be in pain?\u201d May questioned, gripping both her boobs and wobbled them around to get the fox to shut up. \u201cI mean, I did beat it, and it could have run away when it saw me, but it chose to stay and now he\u2019s paying the price.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t use him in battle if he\u2019s too weak to fight.\u201d Max reasoned, trying to get his big sister to be a good trainer. \u201cAnd you need to fight to battle other trainers, and if you win that\u2019ll give you money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoney?!\u201d May looked down at Max, surprised by this revelation. \u201cReally? Huh, well I bet there isn't anymore cool Pokemon on this route anyways. I guess we can head to Oldale town, than i\u2019ll think about healing it. The Pokemon Center has food right? I know I just had a big breakfast, but I could eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yeah May, they have free food for trainers.\u201d Max rubbed Zorua\u2019s paw, trying to make it feel better. \u201cBut to be clear, we\u2019re going there to heal your Pokemon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh yeah, sure sure\u2026\u201d May trailed off, already focused solely on the food that laid ahead. \u201cMaybe after I get some food we can think about healing them. Do you think there is any restaurants in Oldale town Max? We could stock up on snacks at the store if not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed. May was more in love with the idea of being a trainer than actually being a trainer. It looked like this trip was just an excuse for her to fill her gut to bigger levels. Well, that wasn't true, she said something about seeing Dad, but he never got to know him so he didn't pay much attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Oldale, what was the did may decide to do first?</span></div></div>",

Without waiting for his approval, she turned around and dropped the young boy into her butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed, wishing May could be more gentle with him. Still, she never really would hurt him, and being in her butt was not as bad as one might think. She took very good care of herself, so it was essentially a lot like where he was before, only his big sister couldn\u2019t hear him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay nodded, enjoying the feeling of Max wiggling around her rear end. She walked over to the buffet table and piled her tray with as much food as it could carry. She walked to a nearby booth and sat her fat ass down, squishing Max underneath her weight. She grabbed the two Pokeballs from her purse and released Zorua and Treeko. \u201cYou, feed me food.\u201d She pointed at Zorua. \u201cYou, rub my gut.\u201d She pointed at Treeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreeko and Zorua exchanged glances before turning back to their master. Treeko calmly shook his head, while Zorua simply whimpered and looked down at his paws. Angry that she wasent getting what she wanted, May grabbed the two Pok\u00e9mon in her meaty fists and rose up from her seat on the booth. With a scowl, she threw the two underneath her large behind and sat down again. Unlike Max, Treeko and Zorua were not impervious to pain, and felt the while weight of May compress their delicate bodies. She repeated to sit up and down on the seat, further squashing her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while minute if this ordeal, May grabbed Treeko and Soria and set them back on the table. They were bruised and battered, and looked like they needed to be treated again. Leaning in close, May snarled. \u201cI am your Pok\u00e9mon Trainer, and you will do as I say.\u201d She remarked coldly. \u201cDisobey me again, and I\u2019ll send you down my gullet to turn into fat. Now, you feed me, and you rub my gut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified that May will live up to her promise, Treeko and Zorua instantly sprang to their jobs. The grass type gecko began to knead May\u2019s jelly belly like dough, while the illusion fox scrambled to get as much food his little paws could carry before dropping it into his master\u2019s waiting maw. \u201cFaster.\u201d She ordered, and the two already exhausted Pokemon doubled their pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they're was no more food on the tray, and Sorua breathed a sigh of relief before May flicked him in the forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not done. Get me more food.\u201d May pointed at the buffet table, and Zorua sadly raced to it with the tray being balanced on his back. \u201cMhmmm..,oh yeah, work those paws.\u201d She moaned as Treeko\u2019s massage helped her stomach digest faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zorua came back with a another full tray of food, bones and muscles aching. Without a beat, he began to shovel more food into May\u2019s waiting Maw. This cycle continued itself for five more times, until both Pok\u00e9mon couldn\u2019t go any further. \u201cWhat? Is that all you can do? Arceus\u2026\u201d May muttered. \u201cWelp, back into the Pokeballs you go.\u201d With that, the glutton called back her two exhausted Pok\u00e9mon and sat up, stretching her arms over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay\u2019s stomach had distended to the point it looked like she was carrying sextuplets, round and fat, full of digesting food. She slapped, watching how it sloshed and jostles for a few seconds before walking out of the cafeteria. \u201cFunny, I\u2019m still not full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay checked into her room, already falling into a food coma, and plucked Max out from her butt. \u201cH-hey May\u2026\u201d Max asked as she threw herself onto the bed, the frame groaning slightly underneath her weight. \u201cAre Treeko and Zorua okay? I couldn\u2019t hear very well, but they sounded...pained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay shrugged casually. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to them a Trainer can\u2019t do to their Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d With that, she set Max down on her stomach, still digesting all the food she ate. He was miffed that his bigger sister decided to sleep when he didn\u2019t feel tired at all. It was only the afternoon! Still, he was content to lay down on May\u2019s bloated belly, shrinking down over time as it became more and more plush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen May awoke from her nap, what did she look like?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn't the first time that she had eaten him, in fact one could even say it was a regular occurrence. Because of the young boy\u2019s durability, he wasn't affected by the stomach acids, and even though he didn\u2019t want to be in they're always, it was pretty hard to argue with someone more than ten times taller than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay swallowed Max\u2019s struggling form and traced a finger down her neck as she felt his bulge travel down. She lifted her arms over her chest and got up from the bed, ready to tackle the rest of the day. She looked in the mirror placed near the complimentary close to truly take in her new form. While it appeared that she had lost weight, all that nutrients ended up going to her height instead, shooting her stature up to an impressive and dominating 7\u20197\u201d feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to May, she felt unsatisfied with her new growth. Her body no longer had that amount of plush softness she had grown to love. She had less definition in her curves, which was assented by the fact her clothes were no longer able to fit her. She than took the time to ponder how she would get back her previous form while still able to keep growing up in height. Than it occurred to her that most of the food in the Pokemon Center Cafeteria was relatively healthy. It stood to reason than that if she wanted to grow out instead of up, she would need to eat greasy, fattening foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined look on her face, May took her leave of the room and made her way to the indoor store for trainers down the hall. It catered to everything a traveling Pokemon Trainer would need, from potions and escape ropes, to Clothes and snack food. May took out her wallet and opened it up to see a some seed money that Professor Birch had given to her to make sure she would be well stocked on her journey in the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the money she had, she bought a new set of clothes specifically made for more heavyset women. It looked baggy and a tad ridiculous on her now, but she planned to grow into them very soon. With the rest of her money, she cleared out all of the junk food in the store, and even bought an extra bag to carry them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d The male clerk behind the counter deadpanned at the distinct lack of anything related to Pokemon being bought. \u201cShouldn't you be spending your money on Potions or heals for your Pokemon?\u201d He asked, trying to help the presumably new trainer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s my money and I get to do what I want with it.\u201d May explained with a bored expression on her face. The clerk begrudgingly rung up the items, and May walked out of the Pokemon Center carrying enough pre-packaged calories to feed a family of four for a week. May honestly didn\u2019t understand why that guy suggested buying potions. They're magical creatures, they should be able to heal themselves. She remembered how hard Zorua and Treeko worked earlier to feed her even though she still left the place hungry for more. She made a mental note to catch more Pokemon in the future so she could be serviced more efficiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs May walked out of Oldale Town, she was already beginning to feel quite hungry, but chose not to eat because Max was still squirming away in her stomach. She once ate with him still in their, and he came out covered in half digested food and spit. He certainly wasn't happy about that. Still, she was getting more and more peckish as she walked, and her mind began to drift to other solutions. She was joking with her Pokemon earlier when she threatened to eat them if they misbehave, but as she thought on it, maybe it wasn't. Maybe if her brother was someplace hidden, she could get away with it without him causing a fuss.</span></div></div>",

She wiggled her uvula to regurgitate her stomach\u2019s contents, and her younger brother popped out from her lips into her open hand. \u201cSorry, Max.\u201d She explained. \u201cI know you were having fun, but I really gotta eat right now.

She would have ordered her Pokemon to feed her instead, but they were busy playing with Max, so she decided to give them a break. Wrappers flew everywhere as she guzzled down the unhealthy treats, filling up her belly quite nicely as she ate and ate and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Max inspected the various wounds Treeko and Zorua had acquired during the earlier battle. He tried to rub some of the pain away, but what they needed was professional help. \u201cUh, May? If you\u2019re not too busy, could you spray your Pokemon with some Potion. They look like they're about to pass out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t buy any potions.\u201d May stated between gulps of food, demolishing the feast of snack food in the bag at an astonishing rate. Max gaped and shook his head a little miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? We were just at the Pokemon Center, and Professor Birch gave us plenty of money to buy some.\u201d Max argued, trying to make the Pokemon feeling better by massaging around their bruises and scrapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spent it all on food.\u201d May explained before giving off a huge belch. Max looked appalled, while May just tilted her head to the side, confused. \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t give me that look. You know how hungry I get. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re seriously worried about them, they're Pokemon! Us humans knows what\u2019s best for them, and I say they look perfectly healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay, please!\u201d Max pleaded, but May just rolled her eyes. \u201cUm, u-um...money! You don\u2019t want to lose money, right? If you challenge a trainer and your Pokemon lose, you have to give them money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay widened her eyes at this revelation. She gave an angled huff and relented. \u201cFine, I guess we can go back to the Pokemon Center to heal them and get some potions or whatever...right after I\u2019m done eating.\u201d She turned away from her brother and resumed her feast, while Max just sighed. It was going to be a long, long journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter May finished her food, the bag she had bough was empty and plastic wrappers were littered all over the grass and dirt path. Her stomach was looking bloated, and she was eager for it to all turn to some nice plush on her curves. She recalled her Pokemon and shoved Max back into his spot between her tits, walking back to Oldale to heal Treeko and Zorua and buy smoke potions with the money she just won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way to Petalburg City...</span></div></div>",

Robin was also fat, having a large gut, huge breasts, and a big butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had noticed that all of the other regions had a champion but not Alola, so she convinced everyone to have a competition to declare who the champion would be. Needless to say, Robin won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvertime Robin continued to get bigger and bigger, at the rate she was going Robin had to make a difficult decision. Robin had a massive underwater facility built onto the floating island known as the Aether foundation and moved into it with her husband, Chrom and some others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to choose another champion Alola the region went back to they\u2019re the previous state. However this time. The trial captains abused their power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral years later Robin and Chrom had two children, Lucina and Morgan. Lucina was a fatty like her mother while Morgan was a skinny little thing but thanks to his father\u2019s side of the family Morgan\u2019s body was capable of taking lots of punishment, in fact, he was even immune to stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was aware of cruelty the trial captains had gained and Robin didn\u2019t like that so she started a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNineteen-year-old Lucina was walking with her eight-year-old brother, Morgan to see their mother. \u201cI wonder why our mother needs us,\u201d Lucina said before approaching the massive door leading to their mother's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered and saw Robin sitting on her couch. The reason why Robin had the underground facility made was that she correctly predicted she\u2019d get too big to live on one of the islands. In fact, Robin was so large that if she stood on Ula\u2019Ula no one would be able to see the sky due to how large she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucina, Morgan so glad you could make it. As you know that the Alola trial captains are corrupt and abusing their power. As much as I\u2019d like to take care of it I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone so I want the two of you to take care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gasped \u201cI will do it but what am I supposed to do to the trial captains?\u201d Lucina asked tilting her head, Robin smiled \u201cSimple, eat them.\u201d Lucina was surprised but considering how big Robin was Lucina knew she could accomplish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand why you want Lucina to do this but what am I supposed to, Lucina\u2019s a better trainer and fighter,\u201d Morgan asked with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s simple you\u2019re supposed to motivate your sister and provide her companionship,\u201d Robin explained knowing Morgan occasionally felt inferior to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lucina and Morgan were on a boat heading to one of the islands of Alola.

From when her mother Robin was the champion, the Island was described as a jewel in the sun, and brilliant emerald picked out by Arceus and placed in the sea. There was only one trail captain on the Island, the Kahuna was a kindly old man named Hala. Strangely enough, news about the Island cut off sometime after Hala died and the Trial Captain stepped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Lucina and Morgan set out towards Melemele Island on their boat, they were surprised when the actual landmass came into view. The whole place was covered in a cloud of thick, smokey smog, with only a few patches of greenery left whilst the cities hand expanded everywhere else. The water around their vessel became less and less clear. Whatever happened since the time Robin retired, it was most certainly not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Lucina?\u201d Morgan stammered as he observed the slightly scaring looking Island. \u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t just...turn back and tell mom that the Alola Region is fine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sighed and turned to face her younger brother with a comforting smile. She inherited her mother\u2019s propensity for easy weight gain, standing at an impressive seven feet and weighing around less than half of a ton. Her clothes, while custom made, were already showing signs that she had outgrown hem, breast flesh spilling from out of her bra, a shirt that only went down to her navel, and jeans that left her crack exposed to the open air. \u201cMorgan, don\u2019t worry. Whatever happens, I\u2019ll be right there with you. No one is going to hurt you on my watch.\u201d This seemed to relax him, if only a little, and prompted him to give his big sister a great, big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big do you think I'm gonna get...you know after I do...the deed.\" Lucina scooped Morgan up so she could return the embrace, still uncomfortable about the concept of eating another person, while also a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Morgan paused and looked back at Melemele Island, still as ominous looking as ever. \"Enough to finally get a new pair of clothes.\" Lucina chuckled and patted his head affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat finally makes it to Hau'oli City.

As well in the other thing, Lucina was by herself while in this she has Morgan, also Melemele wasn\u2019t all polluted and such. Back to the actual chapter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Morgan arrived and were surprised by the people of Hau\u2019oli city for two reasons.

The two had no idea that life was so bad here! \u201cWh-what are we going to do now, Lucina?\u201d Asked a very terrified young boy as he mulled over the prospect of being turned into belly fat. As the fat bluenette looked down at her crying brother, she noticed some duct tape and a long length of cloth in the corner of her eye. Suddenly, she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan, I have a plan, but I need you to trust me.\u201d Lucina told Morgan, who reluctantly nodded. \u201cOkay...here it is.\u201d She whispered it into his ear, and was a bit taken aback by how unorthodox it was. But maybe...maybe it could work. He nodded, and Lucina grabbed the duct tape and placed a little strip of it on his mouth so he would keep quiet. She lifted the now silent boy up under her shirt and began riding his hands and feet to her various folds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from an extra bulge in her outfit, Morgan had completely disappeared, now hidden from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Morgan, it was almost as if he was back in the womb again, only fully grown this time. It was warm and soft, yet a very large weight pinning against him. On instinct, he tried to struggle, but thanks to those restraints they ended up giving Lucina a belly massage. She felt her younger brother\u2019s feeble struggles and it made her pick up her speed as her power over him was immensely satisfactory. She loved her brother with all her heart, but she would be lying if they're wasn't a part of her that liked this scenario, that she could carry him hidden in her, the thought alone made her knees wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina waddled back into the open streets of the city and began to take in the sights, Morgan now safe and sound. Other than being tied up, he was actually feeling very comfortable, her fat warm and cozy. As she walked on, the vibrations made him feel sleepy and he dozed off. Meanwhile, Lucina happened upon a multitude of locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most prominent feature of the city was the amount of restaurants it had. It seemed to be encouraged here that all women eat and get fat. People were even looking on at the Bluenette with jealousy! Her gut rumbled as she realized she was hungry. Surely it wouldn't hurt to have a little food, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, than they're was than just one type of restaurant on the Island. As she walked, she noticed that half of them specialized in serving live Pokemon! At first, she felt disgusted, but than Lucina realized that she was going to have to eat the Island Kahuna and Trial Captain sooner or later. Perhaps...it would be best to practice on something much smaller? No one else seemed to mind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, surely it was a better idea to get a proper lay of the land before she does anything, right? She noticed that the city had a visitor center where people can get information about the Island. She could find out who the Kahuna was, who the captain was, and the history behind how the island turned from a verdant paradise to a smokey slum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option Lucina could think of was to just go to the Captain of the city and get the fight over with...but was it the best idea? What if she was bigger than her, what if she ends up eating her, what if Morgan is\u2026!? No, she would not let that happen, she couldn't. What would she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, there is a reason for it: it's a very specific thing to look for that many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears ago, I came across a story on Deviantart about an officer Jenny who used cruel and sadistic tactics t become an immobile blob of a tyrant of the world. The first time I read that story, I got shivers. Not fear shivers or disgust shivers, but some sort of high. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is it\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought to myself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what I want more of\u00e2\u0080\u009d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I tried to chase after my dragon, I came across a blank void on the internet. Which makes sense: the story was not well known and the content I was looking for just didn't match anyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I am creating this Interactive. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for a niche group, people who want to see a 10ft, 3,400 lb Misty boss Ash around as he journeys through Kanto, or an obese Serena threatens to eat her Pokemon to keep them in line. This is a story for a very specific type of people, and I want to help those people find what they are looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like what you are reading, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine!! This is just my silly little post on the internet that I personally like. There are hundreds of more stories out there that you might like, even love. But this is mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the people still with me, I would like to go over what kind of things I will allow and not allow in this Interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALLOWED<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery Fat<br>\r\nHyper fat<br>\r\nFat Play<br>\r\nMacrophilia<br>\r\nMega Macro<br>\r\nSize Differences<br>\r\nGrowth<br>\r\nFemale Weight Gain<br>\r\nCorruption<br>\r\nDegradation<br>\r\nDiscipline<br>\r\nHumiliation<br>\r\nStockholm Syndrome<br>\r\nLima Syndrome<br>\r\nAbuse<br>\r\nAge Difference<br>\r\nUnderage<br>\r\nBondage<br>\r\nCrushing<br>\r\nSadism<br>\r\nSoft Oral Vore<br>\r\nUnrealistic Vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT ALLOWED<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight Loss<br>\r\nMale Weight Gain<br>\r\nMale Growth<br>\r\nHard Vore<br>\r\nExcessive Gore<br>\r\nScatology / Watersports<br>\r\nNecrophilia<br>\r\nAlternative Vore Methods<br>\r\nExcessive Slob Behavior<br>\r\nExcessive Smut<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Pokemon can gain weight and grow if you want, but the main focus of the story should center around human females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Besides burping and musk, most slob behavior is not allowed. This is my personal preference, and I am sorry if that limits your creative flow when writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Please keep choice chapters to a minimum. I know that they are necessary, but there comes a time when you just need to start the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to delete and edit chapters that are too short or ungrammatical for the benefit of the story. I will notify you if I have done this with tips on how to rewrite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon and all other related media are owned by the Pokemon Company, Game Freak, Nintendo, and Creatures. I am so sorry Satoshi Tajiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(EDIT): Alternative vore methods are now tolerated, as long as they are clean. Meaning that Anal Vore cannot have Scat, Cock Vore cannot have watersports, etc.</td>",
