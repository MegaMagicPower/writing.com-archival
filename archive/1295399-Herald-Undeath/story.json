You swing the car door adjacent to the driver's seat shut, releasing a soft sigh and grimacing after a long and exhausting day of scholarly persuits. An old three pouch back pack hangs from a strap off of your shoulder. Shifting slightly, the strap slides up closer to your neck, relieving you a bit from the dull pain put on from the pressure of the three hard covered course books inside your pack.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n    Sauntering down the dirt path that leads to your parent's porch, you are serenaded by the chirps of the crickets that surround your two story farm house. You pay no mind to the beautiful canvas of stars above, your mind set on relaxing in the comforts of your home. You carry yourself up the the three wooden stairs that leads to your bleach painted porch. Following the two paralell railings on the top platform, you unlock your door with your house key and proceed inside.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     There is no luxury sweeter on a summer's night then central air. You can't help but bite your bottom lip and fondly gasp at the chilling air that blankets your skin. Briefly glancing to your left, you spot yourself in the long bodied mirror near your front door.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n     You stand 6 foot tall, your skin tanned from exposure to the sun. Your hair is cut short, raven black, and your eyes are hazel green. Your attire consists of a pair of dull khaki shorts and a black an white striped polo shirt.  Your name is Demetri Larson, you are twenty-one years of age and you are living with your parents. You go to college at a small community institute and live in a southern Michigan farm home a few miles from a lake community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your back pack lets out a thump as you drop it in the corner of your white carpeted living room. A yawn escapes you, followed by a slight struggle to keep your eyes open. You've had a busy day, and with the assignments given today, you're looking to a busier one tomorrow. Looking to the the T.V set do you..<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Sinking into the cushions, you rest your head on a pillow while turning the television on. With a soft buzz the television presents a picture. Two white middle aged news anchors stand before a desk, behind them video footage of what they describe to be nation wide pandemonium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a bead of sweat rolling off his brow, the male anchor says, \"The president has called upon a State of Emergency as the nation has errupted into delirium. Mass riots have taken ahold of nearly every major city. As of yet, we do no know what is the cause of such violent hysteria, but we urge everyone to remain in doors while civil defense units get ahold of the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The camera pans away from the speaking anchor, the montage of chaos and destruction now displayed fully on the screen. It was odd, as you watched image after image of destruction, you couldn't exactly tell how you felt. This wasn't a joke, something was going on. Your eyes remained glued to the T.V, as you traced the list of unsafe cities streaming across the screen. Adrian, the city your parents work, and the city no more then 10 miles away was listed on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the dial tone stops and an automated message plays, telling you they are not available. You try once more, still to no avail. Third times charm? Nothing. Cursing aloud, you try for the local athorities, hoping you'll get an answer. The busy tone denies you any absolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your fingers quickly go about the task of calling your girlfriend Melissa, but then it hits you. Her parents haven't paid the telephone bill.

Her leg was bleeding pretty badly and they had managed to bandage it at home only moments before she began to catch a fever. 911 was busy taking care of injuries from the riots in the city, so their father told them to go to their rooms and he would look after her for the rest of the night. Several hours later they heard screams coming from their parents room, opened the door and found their mother over their father covered in blood. Their father managed to shout at them to get out of the house before their mother had begun to disembowel him. So they ran...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shouts at you to watch out!</span></div></div>",

Adam's story alone sent a shiver down your spine, but how could it be true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It's obvious the three of them were siblings, for all of them sported a golden crown of curly locks. Their eyes were blue, and each of them seemed to be in physical shape. Ofcourse, Adam appears the dominant of the three, and no doubt the most coherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Speeding across the field, you shoot a glance towards Adam and the remenants of his family.

You don't necessarily like the idea of abandoning your girlfriend, but these kids are in need, and after such a traumatic experience, you don't want to expose them to any more danger. If anything, after you insure they are safe, you can go and retrieve your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your Malibu Max rumbles violently as it spans across the empty field.

Blair Witch, eat your heart out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You eventually come to a clearing, and from that you find what appears to be an abandoned lodging. The home is made entirely of wood with a few glass pane windows set around it. In front of the wooden construct is stump with a rusty ax wedged into it.

Soft moans come from out in the darkness and grow louder....until the windows shatter revealing several hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to and realize that you have probably broken both of your legs, your wrist, several ribs, and an asortment of other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too bad you didn't have anybody in the car to warn you about the pileup...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move, the last thing you see is the body of a little girl with matted blonde hair and milky eyes drag herself over to you and lunge at your throat, ripping everything out. You struggle for several moments as everything turns a fuzzy red color, all attempts at screaming result in a muffled gurggling sound as the blood comes rushing from your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes black.</span></div></div>",

I swear I will!!\u201d Your hands are shaking badly you never did enjoy hunting when you were younger when your father took you out to the shooting range, but this is unbelievably different; the man still shambles forward groaning horribly, when suddenly the policeman sits up wheezing as if having a blocked nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took a dive forward as if he tripped but he took a swing as if to grab you, out of surprise and fear you pulled the trigger, but all that happens is a quiet \u2018click\u2019 \u201cW-what?\u201d You reel backwards to get away from the now crawling man and the policeman who\u2019s making his way over to you showing a horrible gaping wound in his neck, it looked like a bite wound!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realising the safety was on; you flick it off then take aim at the man whose now grabbed your leg.

The slim slit of well trimmed hair above his upper lip remarks upon him wanting to be like the cliche mustache wearing road cops you see in films.

His attire consists of a pair of hiked up jeans and a button up long sleeve shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You can tell how horrible you sound, your voice cracking and waning at the pace of your sobs, and still you can not do anything about it. \"I..What's going.. on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm not sure..

With a longing yawn, you fill your lungs with oxygen while groggily rubbing your eyes with your knuckles.  As you reach the bottom step, you acknowledge that the smacks you had heard earlier this morning have now increased in decibel, providing a bit of dissonance that wracks your nerves.  As you proceed into the living room, you turn your head towards the window and suddenly realize where the noise was emanating from.<br>\r\n\tReleasing an audible gasp, you stagger backwards, tripping over your feet and landing safely into the embrace of your sofa. Between you and pane of blood smeared glass a pair of hollow and diluted eyes stares at you. They belong to a ghastly looking man dressed in blood soiled attire befitting to that of a farmer. His hands slide down the window, issuing out a squeak as their descent is marked by a smear of scarlet.<br>\r\n\tYour mind begins to race as a series of questions lash out at you. Who was this unidentified intruder? What the hell is he doing? What is wrong with him? It looks as if he is hurt, and might need help. That would give him proper cause for such actions; still, he isn\u2019t verbal about his plight aside from a projection of distorted moans. You remember you have a first aid kit in the bathroom, should you tend to him and then call 911? Or vice versa? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One bite and you'll be hooked. The city near you is a small one, so it's not exactly too large. Also, they live in a farmland area as well as the epidemic is just starting, so the chaos will not be that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It is a summer climate.
