Bring it over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demand came to you from Dr. Jillian Harding, a brilliant young scientist who, a little over a year ago, had left her position as top scientist in the military to take up a position with a powerful bioengineering and pharmaceutical firm headquartered in the Saratoga Falls area called Protean Industries. While a major partner for the military, Protean was also it's own company and the atmosphere was a bit more free wheeling and relaxed, caring more about results over procedure. It was an environment which suited the much more free spirited Jillian. Though respected as a brilliant mind and one of the leaders in bioengineering, she had a reputation for being a bit eccentric and difficult to work with. They were problems you had never really had to deal with much before but you had constantly heard stories while listening to Lt. Claire Briggs, one of Jillian's few friends while she was in the military and the only person from her former life that she kept in regular contact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was due to her age. Jillian, at 25 (a good three years younger than yourself), was was quite young for someone so respected and revered in her field. She was a regular child prodigy however, having graduated from John Hopkins University when she was 20 and immediately moving into a career in the military. For all her supposed difficulties, however, the two of you had hit it off immediately. You appreciated her wit and easy going nature, as well as her slightly curvy appearance. She definitely looked the part of the cute, Hollywood scientist at the very least. Jillian for her part appreciated your general kindness and attentiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Mark, hello Mr. Taylor! Do you copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...  mostly attentive anyway. You hadn't realized you had gotten lost in thought there. Jillian's voice snapped you out of your reverie though. \"What?\" you ask coming back to reality, \"Oh, um... yeah Jillian sorry, I--\" and that's when it happened. The jolt of being taken out of your thoughts had distracted you enough that you lost a bit of your bearings and clumsily wound up tripping over your own feet. To your horror, as you fell to the ground so to did the vial you were holding. And to your even bigger horror, the vial hit the ground, smashing open and splashing you over the arms and face with the chemical that had been inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The SX-3!\" Jillian exclaimed, dropping what she was doing, hitting a small red button on the wall and rushing over to your side. \"Mark, Mark!\" she exclaimed being careful not to touch you and get any of the chemical on you, \"Are you alright?! What... what happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and begin sitting up, \"No I'm fine. It... it doesn't burn or anything.\" you say surprised, \"In fact it doesn't feel like anything at all... like do you remember that old toy from the '90s called Gak? It feels kind of like th--\" you stop yourself again as you notice the blue SX-3 compound on your arm... for a brief moment. You suddenly get a weird, discomforting feeling as it looks like the SX-3 becomes absorbed into your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Jilian asks, \"The SX-3 it... absorbed into your skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably through the pores, yeah.\" you state, \"So what do we do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian helps you to your feet, \"I already hit the silent alarm so they're gonna send a crew in here to clean up and ask questions.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye her queerly, \"Clean up what? All of the SX-3 was absorbed into my skin. The only evidence something even happened is a broken vial with nothing around it.\" Suddenly a look of concern spreads over your face. \"We can't tell them it was the SX-3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?!\" Jillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"I'm serious. We can't. I... I don't want to be some potential test subject. I don't want to be hunted down.\" you look down and sigh, \"I don't want what happened to David last year to happen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian puts an arm around you, \"But Johnson never became a test subject. He just kind of disappeared. We don't even know if he actually really went anywhere and if he's just been hiding out in various bodies around the city.\" she says trying to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it.\" you sigh, \"I don't want to lose... well, this. My job, my life... you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mark...\" she begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" you say, a bit of a pleading tone in your voice. \"Just... we'll tell them it was some harmless chemical. I'll get checked out, get a wash... maybe they won't find anything. But please, don't tell them it was the SX-3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian thinks about it for a second and as she sees the the crew coming in the direction of the lab she relents. \"Mark, I promise you,\" she states looking you directly in the eye, \"I won't say anything.\" she finishes with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the next morning and you were busy rooting through the pantry. You were up probably earlier than you should be as you were having trouble sleeping. All night you tossed and turned unable to get comfortable, you felt generally restless and hot no matter how cold you turned the air down (cold enough to wake up Jillian who told you, rather sleepily, to knock it off) and at one point you nearly freaked out as it looked like your hand was melting a bit though you quickly brushed it off as your mind playing tricks on you. You WERE more than a little freaked out after all; your accident could've potentially been a sequel to what happened to David Johnson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid Johnson had been your next door neighbor along with his parents and his sisters. He had been a senior at Eastman High School until an accident involving a chemical Jillian had been working on called SX-2 changed him. He had disappeared, or so it seemed, until it was found that he existed as a gooey blue worm who could enter and control a living being. The military at Fort Suffolk had dedicated all efforts to finding him however after a month, while they still had resources dedicated to finding him, they removed finding him from their top priority list as he had seemingly dropped off the grid. Given that SX-3 was essentially a continuation of Jillian's work with the military and thus you feared ended up being hunted in the same way Johnson was. Thankfully, however, you had shown no signs of any sort of mutation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like yesterday, you were caught up in thought as a knock on the door snapped you back to reality. Opening the door you were surprised to see Darcy Whitehead, a freshman at Keyserling College, intern at Protean and assistant to Jillian, standing there. \"Oh, uh, morning Darcy.\" you greet her with a friendly smile. Darcy was a nice girl, sharp as a tack, but could be very right-to-business and goal-oriented at time, an attitude that could be off putting for most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mark, is Jillian around?\" she asks. Right to the point as always with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only like quarter to seven, she's still sleeping.\" you answer, \"Any reason you're here this early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I've got this test in European History at 8 so I've been up all night studying. My time's just been thrown all out of whack.\" she replies. She begins digging through her messenger bag and pulls out a couple of pages of paper. \"Here, she wanted me to look through some of her old notes on SX-2 and print them out for her. Not gonna be able to come in today because, you know, the test and all. I just want to take it, go home and get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks. I'll make sure Jillian gets them.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go to take the papers however, you begin feeling weird. You notice Darcy drop the papers as your hand approaches her's and notice that your hand is taking on the same melting look it appeared to take last night. And before either of you can react your hand engulfs her's, your whole body begins feeling unstable as you notice that more and more your body seems to engulf Darcy's and pull her into you before, in a matter of seconds, she's gone. You clutch your side and groan as you feel your body shifting and changing. You can feel your height shrinking, your hips flaring out, your facial features and jaw, protrusions on your chest. And just as quickly as you absorbed her, the changes are complete. You head to the mirror that hangs on the hallway wall to see what greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're Darcy Whitehead, you're 19 and attend Keyserling College. You had come over to give some papers to Jillian but then... no, you shake your head. You're Mark Taylor but for some reason you... absorbed Darcy into yourself and now you're her. You have her roughly pretty face with its steely blue eyes and slightly hooked nose. You have her long, curly brown hair. Her small chest but slightly large ass... even her clothing. More than that you have her memories, her personality, her very being. The SX-3, it must've done this. Mutated you, changed you. Just like David...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um good morning Darcy. What are you doing here? And where's Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! You turn towards your bedroom to see Jillian, having just woken up and wearing a bathrobe, standing outside it. Here you are wearing the appearance of Darcy Whitehead having just been put on the spot by your girlfriend and Darcy's mentor. What are you to do? Telling her would be the obvious thing but is it? You don't know how she'll react or what she'll do. Maybe you should make up an excuse, pretend to be Darcy and go to the lab; do a little research into what happened. But... no you can't do that, Darcy has a test, she has classes. You've got her mind, you could take them for her. Besides, it might be a good way to clear your head and collect your thoughts anyway.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s just a question of how to tell her.  How to break the news you\u2019ve absorbed her prot\u00e9g\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJillian, Jill,\u201d you begin hesitantly.  \u201cI know this is going to be difficult to understand, but\u2026  Mark\u2019s right here.  I\u2019m Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d says Jillian, shaking her head.  \u201cI must still be half asleep, because I thought you said you were Mark there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said,\u201d you explain slowly.  \u201cThe SX-3, I think it did something to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it Darcy,\u201d replies Jillian, her voice trembling on the ragged edge of hysteria.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.  You can\u2019t be Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink Jillian,\u201d you interrupt, grabbing her by the upper arms and giving her a gentle shake.  \u201cWho else knows about the accident in the lab, the SX-3 spillage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must have told you,\u201d Jillian shouts.  \u201cPlease stop this Darcy, you\u2019re frightening me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how scared I was that anyone would find out about the accident,\u201d you say, shaking her again.  \u201cWhy would I tell anyone else about it?  You promised not to tell anyone about it, because you knew how much it meant to me.  We\u2019re the only two people that know, think about it Jillian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian stares at you silently for a moment, tears starting to make their way down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d she asks softly.  \u201cOh <i>God</i>, Mark.  How did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently lead Jillian over to a sofa, sitting her down before you explain things.  She sits quietly and attentively as you relate what happened when you tried to take the SX-2 papers from Darcy.  From time to time she sniffles, but for the most part she manages to keep her emotions in check.  When you finish, she sits silently for what seems like an age, thinking your story over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Darcy is inside you now,\u201d she finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, at least as far as I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we get her back out,\u201d Jillian asks, staring into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..\u201d you hesitate for a moment.  Jillian turns to look away. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to run tests at the lab,\u201d she says, still looking to the side.  \u201cWork out what\u2019s happened to you.  Work out how to Darcy back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let anyone at Protean find out what we\u2019re doing,\u201d you insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful,\u201d replies Jillian.  For a moment she tries to hold your hand, to reassure you, then she thinks better of it.  \u201cBesides, Darcy is always coming into the lab, so no one will think anything of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would be lying if you said you weren\u2019t scared.  Walking straight back into Protean Industries is risky, but you can\u2019t deny that the labs have the best facilities to research your condition.  Reluctantly you agree go with Jillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Protean is unnerving.  As usual, there is a noticeable security presence in the main foyer.  A couple of guards mill around and there are a series of card operated gates to get into the main elevator.  Even though you have Darcy\u2019s ID card, and even though you look, sound and act like her, you half expect a klaxon to go off and a squad of heavily armed goons to jump out and detain you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou submerge yourself in Darcy\u2019s persona, relying on it hide your nerves behind a veneer of apparent calm.  Swipe the card, through the gate and smile at the guards, everything seems to be fine.  Jillian ushers you in to an elevator and you finally relax as you make your way up to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning is taken up by a bewildering array of tests and examinations, which Jillian performs with a brusque efficiency.  She takes just about every kind of tissue sample you can think of; blood, skin, hair and more.  You get dragged around the labs for an hour to all the different scanners, having X-ray, ultrasound and MRI images taken of you.  Jillian explains it to your co-workers as \u2018showing the intern the machines\u2019.  By the time lunch is approaching, you have been poked, prodded and investigated in just about every part of the body you can think of, and some you never imagined of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it is quite thorough, and leaves you feeling tired and drained.  You find a nice seat to rest in while Jillian looks over the results she has already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she murmurs half to herself.  She\u2019s comparing on of the X-ray plates with one she took of Darcy when she first started as an intern.  \u201cWhere did all the extra mass go?  The tissue density should be greater to account for the mass of two people in the one body.  The two X-rays are practically identical.  I need to see the DNA tests\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, that does sound odd you think.  You are about to get up and go take a look yourself when an intense pain rips through your stomach.  You shriek involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok Mark, I mean Darcy,\u201d says Jillian, looking up from the results.  You double over clutching your stomach as a second wave of pain washes over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d you say hoarsely, lifting yourself from your seat before stumbling and falling to the floor.  Your stomach turns somersaults and you feel something rush up from inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it gets really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw opens wide to accommodate the sheer volume of vomit, distending far beyond what should be natural. The fluid is warm and sweet. Viscous, it seems to start solidifying as it leaves your mouth. The flow stops for a moment, giving you a chance to realise what\u2019s happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJutting out from your impossibly wide mouth is another Darcy. Or her head at least, possibly even the real Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating profusely, you raise a hand to just in front of your face. It as if you are melting, the fingers of your hand fusing together like a glob of molten wax. Slowly the colour fades from your skin and it takes on a bright blue hue, matching the tone of the SX-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to think on this as another swirl of liquid starts to move around inside your stomach. It swells and grows and, just as you think the pressure will make you burst open, well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplitting vertically right down the middle, your torso opens and Darcy comes tumbling out. She lies on the clean surface of the lab floor. Her breathing seems shallow and she is unconscious. Otherwise, she appears unchanged from when you met her earlier this morning. You rise unsteadily to your feet, by this point little more than shapeless blue mass with only the vaguest approximation of human form. Then something snaps within you and your form returns, exactly the same as it was before you absorbed Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least we got Darcy back,\u201d says Jillian with a wan smile.  She looks as if she is about to be sick herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I need some fresh air,\u201d you grunt.  You stumble over to a window and open it.  \u201cDo I have a spare set of clothes here, I can\u2019t leave in a bathrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you had something in your locker maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d you interrupt.  \u201cFuck.  Fuck.  <i>Fuck</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d says Jillian, thoroughly appalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome over here,\u201d you explain.  \u201cQuick, out in the car park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jillian comes over, you point out the reason for your outburst.  Winding their way through the car park outside are three olive drab humvees.  It\u2019s a military convoy from Fort Suffolk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could they know,\u201d you say quickly, starting to panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d says Jillian, placing one hand on you shoulder.  \u201cThe Army comes here all the time, they\u2019re major partners in Protean.  That\u2019s how we got our jobs here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say edgily.  \u201cI need to get out of here, as fast as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, if you run off that\u2019s as good as letting them know.  You need to calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about Darcy,\u201d you say so quickly that words run together.  \u201cHow are they going to react when they find her unconscious on the floor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell her there was an accident at the house this morning and that we need to run some tests.  And  I do need to run more tests.  On <i>both</i> of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should just absorb her again,\u201d you interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Jillian, slapping you across the face.  \u201cYou\u2019re hysterical.  Snap out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overcome with the urge to flee and to flee now, you break free of Jillian and make a bolt for the door.  You are halfway across the room before she even has time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d she calls out.  \u201cMark, wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skid to a halt by the door, your feet slipping on the hard surface of the lab floor.  You open the door, sticking your head out to check if anyone else is around.  The corridor is empty, clear in both directions.  Unfortunately, your lab is at the far end of the corridor from the elevator, a good seventy metres or so.  And that\u2019s past another two labs too.  Even the emergency stairs are about twenty metres in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t run that distance, not without attracting attention.  The lab walls are large plate glass windows.  Most of the researchers have put up blinds or screens for their privacy.  While that would obscure you from sight, it\u2019s highly likely they\u2019d still see a shadow passing by.  Running would only make it more likely that they spot that shadow out the corner of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jam the door behind you, somehow managing to snap off the handle.  You always thought they were poorly made.  Dropping to your hands and knees you start to shuffle along the corridor to the lift.  You pass Dr Ingawa\u2019s lab, ignoring the rattling of the door from behind you.  Ingawa\u2019s doing some sort of research into genetically modified crops.  The man spends all day watching plants grow, he\u2019d probably come chasing after you if he saw you just for the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next lab is supposed to be empty, awaiting some hotshot from Europe to clear immigration.  It shouldn\u2019t be a problem to get past, except that you overhear a conversation inside as you shimmy by.  Since the lab is sealed and no one should be able to get inside, you find that strange.  Your curiosity gets the better of you and you stop to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 completely isolated,\u201d says a first voice, a man\u2019s \u2013 deep and smooth.  It sounds familiar, but is muffled the wall.  You can\u2019t quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHermetically sealed,\u201d replies a second voice, also a man \u2013 raspy this time.  \u201cNothing gets in or out unless you want it to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou read the papers I supplied,\u201d interrupts the first voice impatiently.  \u201cYou know what we\u2019re likely to be dealing with.  Is it proof against that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says the second voice confidently.  \u201cI\u2019ve made several modifications myself to account for the spectrum of possibilities you outlined.  And the previous case as well, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d says the first voice.  \u201cGood.  I take it you were discreet?  I don\u2019t want Lord finding out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord who, you think.  Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the guy from Europe they\u2019re expecting?  They still have lords over there, don\u2019t they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe knows nothing,\u201d says the second voice.  \u201cYou want to proceed with the lab seventeen accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, next week at the latest.  I\u2026\u201d the man stops mid sentence.  It sounds like his mobile has gone off.  \u201cAh, excuse me for a moment\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLab seventeen is your lab, the one you share with Jillian.  Whatever these guys are planning, whoever they are, it involves you.  You don\u2019t want to stick around any longer than you have to.  Jillian can look after herself.  No, that\u2019s not fair:  You\u2019ll warn her when you get the chance, but right now your priority is getting out.  You crawl the last few metres to the elevators and hammer the call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slide open after a minute or so and luckily the car is empty.  Pulling yourself back to your feet, you enter the elevator.  The foyer is likely to be crawling with security.  The military might even still be there.  Instead you press the button for the basement, where the deliveries entrance is.  That should be much easier to sneak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slide close and the elevator starts its slow descent.  Floor five, floor four, floor three, it never seemed this slow before.  Floor two and then the panel chimes.  The car comes to a stop.  Fuck, someone must have pressed the call button on the second level, where all the clerical staff work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slide open to reveal a tall thin man in a bad suit.  He looks to be in his mid thirties, hair starting to thin on top.  You\u2019ve never seen him before, or at least you don\u2019t remember seeing him before.  You haven\u2019t had much to do with the pen pushers downstairs though.  Luckily, he\u2019s facing away from you, evidently finishing off a conversation with a colleague<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, in a second he\u2019s going to turn round and see you.  In a second he\u2019s going to see a man dressed in little more than a bathrobe.  In a second all sort of awkward questions are going to be asked.  If only you still had Darcy inside you, he wouldn\u2019t think twice if he saw her.  You shudder involuntarily, horrified at what\u2019s about to happen:  It feels as if your skin is trying to crawl off you and hide.  As the man turns to face you, he almost seems taller and more imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello miss,\u201d he says with a smile as he enters.  The doors close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself, trying to work out what\u2019s just happened, only to see a pair of smallish breasts snugly contained within a simple white camisole top.  The action dislodges a few strands of curly brown hair which fall across your field of vision.  Darcy!  You must be Darcy again, even though she\u2019s lying on the floor of your lab, you can still become her.  You try reaching for her memories, but find nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you reply, testing your theory.  Your voice matches Darcy\u2019s perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasantries exchanged, the man turns round and presses the button for level one.  You seize the opportunity presented to you, moving directly behind him and wrapping your now thin feminine arms around his waist.  He barely has time to react before you start absorbing him and changing.  The process is frighteningly fast.  By the time the elevator reaches level one, only one man remains inside.  You step smartly out and walk calmly to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Thom Allan, thirty four, married with two grade school aged children.  You work as an accountant on the administrative level of Protean Industries.  Oh, and apparently you hate your dull life and secretly fantasize that something interesting would happen.  The kernel of the real you hidden under Thom\u2019s thoughts and memories can\u2019t help but smile at that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom has nothing to do with your own research, so you confidently stride past the security and head for the exit.  There\u2019s a crowd of military types clustered round the reception desk, working their way through the process of signing in for visitor passes.  You recognise Captain Eric Sanchez amongst them from your time working at Fort Suffolk.  None of them turn in your direction as you walk past<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass through the doors without incident and take a deep breath: Free.  Now what?  From sifting Thom\u2019s memories, you know that he was meeting his wife at a nearby coffee house for lunch.  Keeping the lunch date would give you time to think about your next move.  You also know that Thom\u2019s car is parked nearby and it is very tempting to get in and drive off, as far away from Saratoga Falls as you can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, one small part of you, the voice of your conscience perhaps says turn back.  The conversation you overheard back on floor five keeps nagging away at you.  Perhaps you should go back and warn Jillian.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You\u2019ve been running on pure adrenaline since you spotted the military arriving in the car park, it would be a good idea to slow down and think.  Keeping Thom\u2019s lunch date with his wife would give you a breather.  Besides, you and Jillian used to go to that coffee house all the time, it\u2019s pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to walk the short distance to the coffee house, which sits just on the edge of the Keyserling College campus.  It\u2019s an independent operation, not part of any big chain and just a little bit upmarket.  The prices keep it mercifully free of students, unless they work there of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom\u2019s wife, Karin, is already waiting when you arrive.  You\u2019d been reviewing Thom\u2019s memories on the way over, but they didn\u2019t quite prepare you for his wife.  Karin was pretty enough once, you now know, but she never quite recovered her figure after bearing her children.  The extra weight she\u2019s carrying sits unpleasantly on her figure.  It\u2019s made worse by the clothes she wears, which might be more suitable if she was ten years younger.  Throw the terrible pixie cut hairdo and dye job on top of that and you can begin to understand why Thom is so unsatisfied with his life.  You sit down opposite her.  A pretty Asian barista with a name tag that reads \u2018Summer\u2019 takes your order and you favour her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you smiling at,\u201d says Karin accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, the final piece of the puzzle:  Her voice.  Thom\u2019s memories don\u2019t quite capture the sheer jaw-dropping awfulness of it.  She\u2019s high pitched, nasal and retains a thick New York accent.  You could probably use her voice as a paint stripper.  Or a torture device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing,\u201d you say, immersing yourself deeply into Thom\u2019s character.  It\u2019s probably the best way to get though lunch without killing her.  \u201cI was just thinking of a joke someone told me at work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it funny,\u201d she asks, obviously not quite believing you.  Thom actually found Karin\u2019s voice cute for the first year of their marriage, less so for the other nine years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re an accountant dear,\u201d you lie.  \u201cYou see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind that then,\u201d she interrupts impatiently.  \u201cGo on, as me about my day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what have you been up to today dear,\u201d you ask wearily, adding self absorbed to the list of Karin\u2019s character flaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShopping,\u201d she exclaims with glee, reaching under the table and holding up several bags.  Expensive looking bags.  \u201cI saw these darling shoes that I just had to have, and once I bought them, well I needed some new clothes to go with them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at this point that your mind shuts down \u2013 a defence mechanism that Thom\u2019s built up over the years.  On the outside you appear to be listening to what Karin is saying, making appreciative noises and saying \u2018yes dear\u2019 in all the right places.  You\u2019re mind, however is elsewhere.  Thom usually daydreams, but you are thinking over your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, Protean Industries isn\u2019t safe.  Someone there is preparing to experiment with the SX-3 and from what you\u2019ve overheard, they don\u2019t plan in doing it in a legal sort of way.  One of the voices mentioned \u2018the previous case\u2019, and after some thought you think they might have been discussing David Johnson.  Johnson was exposed to a previous iteration of SX-3, SX-2.  The details of what happened to Johnson are shrouded in speculation and mystery, few hard facts are available<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..and don\u2019t you think that color suits me,\u201d says Karin as you drift back into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear,\u201d you say on cue.  Actually, you just noticed a familiar face behind Karin:  Lieutenant Claire Briggs.  Claire is a friend of Jillian\u2019s from back at Fort Suffolk.  She\u2018s sitting reading a paper.  You think she\u2019s waiting for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then I just had to <i>mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah</i>,\u201d continues Karin as you drift back to thinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSX-2 reduced the Johnson boy to a blue residue, not unlike what you seem to look like while changing, now you think about it.  Jillian managed to infer that he remained fully conscious after this and was able to bind himself to nerve and brain tissue and absorb, redirect and interpret synaptic impulses, or as she put it Claire once back at Fort Suffolk \u201cthat\u2019s science for \u2018he can possess people\u2019\u201d\u201d.  Thinking about it, you realise that the voices at Protean are working on the assumption the effects of SX-3 are similar.  They don\u2019t have a clue what powers you have.  That\u2019s an advantage you can exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go back and get the other one later,\u201d continues Karin, pulling your attention back to what she\u2019s saying.  \u201cDo you think that would be a good idea Thom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely dear,\u201d you respond with barely a thought.  Behind Karin, Claire looks at her watch impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so too, there\u2019s still a little left on the <i>mwah mwah mwah</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you don\u2019t know the full extent of your powers either.  You can absorb people, look like them and think like them.  You can even look like them after you\u2026  Now what would be a good word for it \u2013 eject maybe?  Yes, you can look like them even after you eject them, but maybe not have their memories any more.  That leaves a lot of unanswered questions: how many people can you absorb at once, how long can a person be safely absorbed for, can you combine bits of people?  Protean would be the best place to find out, but it\u2019s not safe.  That leaves maybe Keyserling College, although you have no idea how good the facilities of the science faculty there are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me dear,\u201d you interrupt, ignoring Karin\u2019s appalled expression.  Even with Thom\u2019s ability to fade in and out of a conversation, there\u2019s only so much of this harpy that you can take.  \u201cBut I really need to go to the toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and make your way through the door at the back of the coffeehouse, down some stairs, past a storage cupboard and into the men\u2019s room.  Standing at the urinal, you let your thoughts drift back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re safe, at least for now.  Thom isn\u2019t a great long term prospect for you though.  Sooner or later the mystery voices at Protean will start thinking about how to detect SX-3 and hit upon the bright idea of checking all their employees for it.  Maybe Karin is more fun to be than to listen to?  She certainly gets to take Thom\u2019s credit cards on wild trips.  Either way, you\u2019ll have to find a new identity before you kill the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the stream finishes, you place your member back in your pants, zip up the fly and then wash your hands. Walking back outside the toilets the little basement corridor is more busy now.  Claire walks past you and into the ladies room.  The pretty Asian barista from earlier is busy pulling a mop and bucket out from the storage cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you wanted a new identity, here are a couple of opportunities:  Most of the staff in the coffee house are students, so the barista could be an avenue into Keyserling, where you could continue your research.  All you need to do is shove her inside the store cupboard and you can absorb her in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there\u2019s Claire.  You could take a chance and follow her into the ladies room, absorbing her there.  It\u2019s risky:  You don\u2019t know if there is anyone else in there with her.  And it would put you right bang in the middle of the army at Fort Suffolk, although right now they seem a lesser evil than Protean Industries.  Given the two are joined at the hip, being Claire might even give you the chance to investigate Protean.  You could even make contact with Jillian again, since she and Claire are friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you can forget about taking a new identity for now.  With Claire and, to a lesser extent, the barista, it\u2019s possible that someone could walk in on you.  Maybe a new opportunity will present itself later, and if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s always Karin.  Sometimes bad things <i>do </i>happen to bad people.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The barista is the obvious choice:  She\u2019s a lot shorter than Thom, thin rather than athletic.  It should be easy enough to overpower her, even with your lack of experience at fighting of any kind.  Claire has undoubtedly been trained in CQC and she might react badly if you tried to absorb her.  That\u2019s assuming you can even have two people absorbed at the same time anyway.  Yes, the barista is by far the safer option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk purposefully towards her.  Then, just as you get close, her cell phone rings once.  You stop for a second, not wanting whoever is on the other end to overhear you. She fishes it out of her pocket, looks at the screen and starts fiddling with the buttons.  It\u2019s a text message.  Excellent, the extra distraction makes it even easier for you to walk up behind her and seize her.  You cover her mouth with one hand, restraining her arms with your free arm.  The barista drops her phone to the floor in shock.  It takes her precious seconds to realize what is happening and by the time she reacts you have already pushed her inside the store cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to struggle frenziedly, but by now you have already started thinking about taking her.  As she tries to open her mouth to scream, all that happen is that your liquefying hand gushes inside, muffling any sound she makes.  She thrashes about, right then left.  Some brooms get knocked over, but she only gets drawn deeper and deeper inside you with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she is gone, and the changes begin.  Bones grind and pop as they shift themselves into new shapes. Flesh bubbles and swells, padding out some areas and thinning in others. Impossibly, you can feel you hair starts to lengthen, even lift itself up of its own accord and ties itself into the bunches the barista had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Summer Nguyen,  19 years old and an arts student at Keyserling College.  You only work here to help make ends because you are estranged from your father.  He doesn\u2019t approve of your being a lesbian, and he certainly doesn\u2019t approve of your current girlfriend Rhonda.  Rhonda who had just messaged you to let you know she was going to be kept late at college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immediate rush of Summer\u2019s memories subside and you pick up her cell phone to complete the reply she was creating:  \u2018Going to DiMarcos with Courtney + friends, come over later\u2019.  The tiny keyboard on the phone is easy to manipulate with Summer\u2019s slimmer fingers.  You hit the send button and slip the phone back into a pocket in your freshly formed tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer isn\u2019t an ideal catch:  She\u2019s an arts student rather than the scientist you would have hoped for.  You\u2019d be lying though, if you said you weren\u2019t just a little bit curious about what her love life is like.  Even dredging up Summer\u2019s recollections of it makes your new cheeks glow red.  Regardless, it\u2019ll be easy enough to sideways hop through her friends, and then their friends and so on until you find someone more appropriate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you don\u2019t need Thom any more.  It takes a moment to recall the sick to your stomach feeling that preceded your ejection of Darcy.  Within a minute, an unconscious Thom Allen lies on the floor of the storage cupboard.  He\u2019s breathing shallowly, but is otherwise fine.  As you close the door of cupboard behind you, you can\u2019t make up your mind if it would have been more cruel to keep him inside you rather than leave him at the mercy of Karin\u2019s ire.  Probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you smiling at,\u201d asks one of your new co-workers as you return to the main floor of the coffee house.  A quick examination of Summer\u2019s memories reveals her to be Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d you reply, glancing briefly at where Karin Allen is tapping her hands impatiently on a table.  \u201cI asked Rhonda to come over to Di Marco\u2019s with us later.  That OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Courtney replies with a smile.  \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly she\u2019s going to be a little late,\u201d you explain slightly nervously, matching Summer\u2019s personality.  \u201cShe\u2019ll be stuck at Keyserling for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine Summer,\u201d insists Courtney.  \u201cSometimes it\u2019s like you\u2019re still that shy little girl at Eastman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush in a very Summer like way at Courtney\u2019s mention of Summer\u2019s former school.  From her memories it seems Summer was actually very retiring right up until her senior year when she came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you smile brightly.  \u201cI better get back to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a start on mopping the floor now that the lunchtime rush in the coffeehouse is dying down.  It\u2019s hard work, especially for someone with Summer\u2019s physique.  You do enjoy a moment of guilty pleasure when Thom finally emerges from the restroom area and gets chewed out by his wife, but otherwise the afternoon is a long, boring, grind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Di Marco\u2019s is a cheap and cheerful pizza place with a fake Italian name just off campus.  Courtney drags you to it immediately after your shifts end, a little too eagerly.  Your Summer memories are starting to ring little alarm bells inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said we were meeting friends,\u201d you say as the pair of you make your way inside.  It\u2019s still early and the place is quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are,\u201d exclaims Courtney.  \u201cLook, there they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney waves in the direction of one of the tables, where a couple of guys and a girl are sitting.  One of the guys waves back.  Ah, those kind of kind of friends, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Courtney,\u201d says one of the guys.  He\u2019s a bit of geek and, if you\u2019re being completely honest, reminds you of yourself at that age.  The thick rimmed glasses he wears are probably responsible, although it\u2019s not as if the rest of his clothes are exactly stylish either.  \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul, this is Summer,\u201d explains Courtney, taking the seat next to the young man.  \u201cSummer this is Paul.  We met at a party last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Summer,\u201d says the geek, before turning to introduce his two friends.  \u201cThis is my mate Aaron from my Genetics class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy, who is pretty much a better dressed version of Paul \u2013 a geek with money really \u2013 waves his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is Chels,\u201d he finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who is holding onto Aaron at the arm quite tightly you notice, looks you over.  A very brief look of disgust flashes over her face before she breaks into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d she says.  With her librarian glasses and honey blonde hair tied into low bunches, Chels seems like a bit of a girl next door type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird thing is, there is something naggingly familiar about both Aaron and Chels.  You\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a Mark memory or a Summer memory, but you\u2019ve definitely seen them before somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi everyone,\u201d you say taking one of the remaining free seats at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four settle down into discussion, you pull out Summer\u2019s phone and tap out a quick message to Rhonda: \u2018Looks like a triple date\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing Summer,\u201d ask Chels, looking at you with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you two know each other,\u201d asks Courtney<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m letting Rhonda know where we are,\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMet in class on the first day,\u201d explains Paul.  \u201cWhat with us both being from out of town and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Rhonda,\u201d asks Chels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOriginally,\u201d interrupts Aaron.  \u201cMy father runs a biotech firm here now though.  Keyserling is pretty good for life sciences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy girlfriend,\u201d you explain.  You cell phone rings to let you know a message has arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill thick as thieves though, right mate,\u201d says Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour\u2026\u201d  Chels\u2019 face is unreadable for a moment.  \u201cGirlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad someone does all the science and stuff,\u201d giggles Courtney.  \u201cI kinda suck at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes,\u201d you reply, looking at the text.  There are only three letters: \u2018lol\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw it\u2019s not that hard Courtney,\u201d laughs Paul.  \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t write your essays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to go to the girls room,\u201d says Courtney before turning to you.  \u201cCome on Summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney practically drags you from your seat and locks one arm round yours.  The pair of you walk across the pizza parlour, with Courtney stopping halfway to turn and wave coyly to Paul, to the restrooms.  Inside, she heads straight to the mirrors and pulls a compact makeup kit out her handbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he cute?  What do you think,\u201d asks Courtney.  \u201cIs he cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at her for a few seconds.  This is exactly what the real Summer would have done too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right,\u201d giggles Courtney.  \u201cBut he is cute, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy,\u201d you say equivocally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be so serious girl,\u201d replies Courtney.  She finishes applying a coat of lipstick and inspects herself critically.  Evidently satisfied, she puts the make up away and walks out, passing Chels at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl ignores you as she walks to the mirror and pulls out her own, rather larger make up kit.  You suddenly realise that her no makeup look has, in fact, been achieved with lots of makeup.  Even her clothes, a simple jeans and tee combo are designer gear.  She\u2019s not a girl-next-door, she\u2019s what a fashonista imagines a girl-next-door looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mystery, very interesting.  There\u2019s one very easy way to find out what\u2019s going on here: absorb her.  The restroom is empty apart from the pair of you, so it would be very easy.  You\u2019d even be one step closer to the kind of student you are looking for, in Aaron and Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you really are curious about Rhonda.  It\u2019d be nice to take a break and live Summer\u2019s life for a few days.  You could catch up with Paul later on easily enough anyway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't help yourself. There's something about this Chels girl which is stirring feelings of familiarity and as a scientist your natural sense of curiosity is getting the better of you. So you act quickly and wrap your arms around her. In a surprised manner she lets out an audible gasp but surprisingly doesn't seem to make much of any other noise as you begin the process of absorbing her into yourself. As the process continues you notice something slip out of her mouth. Vomit? You haven't seen anyone you've absorbed so far vomit during the process but once again this isn't something you have much experience with. As Chels absorbs further and further into you so as to disappear, you feel the increasingly familiar reshaping process begin. The whole process takes no longer than a minute and at the end of it the very attractive Chels is staring back at you in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then much like the other times the first thing to enter your mind is the identity of the newest acquisition and it's one that's quite shocking indeed: Chelsea Cooper. She was, during her time in school, the head cheerleader at Westside and was well known, even among people who were long out of high school, for two things: her beauty and her bitchiness. She ruled Westside during her time there with an iron fist. Living within close proximity of David Johnson and his younger sister Joanna, Dana Pak and her younger sister Sarah, you heard plenty of the latest gossip circulating between both Eastman and Westside. Though of course you never paid much attention to it as you had more pressing concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chels is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea Cooper, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn towards the entrance of the bathroom to see Courtney standing there, arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I want to be.\" she replies walking towards you. \"I can be lots of people really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes practically bug out of your head. \"Johnson. David...\" is all you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stops, once more her arms fold across her chest. \"You know me but I don't know you. Who are you... <i>what</i> are you? Some military black ops monster sent to hunt me down? Someone they experimented on?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... David, it's me.\" you reply. You don't know who's listening but you need to show David that you're no danger to him. \"It's Mark Taylor, your neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney smirks. \"My neighbor's a 51-year-old producer going through a midlife crisis and trying to get me to be his mistress.\" You see Courtney's shoulders slump a bit, a less guarded look in her overall body language. \"But I remember you, of course, Mark. I still remember everyone. Shocked that someone still remembers me though.\" At that you notice the faintest hint of sadness in Courtney's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Hiding right under the military's nose the whole time. Hiding out as Chelsea Cooper. I can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" comes the reply, \"Not long after the... accident, Haley Solomon had a concert a few cities over. I... hitchhiked, I guess you could say, over there and moved into her. Lived her life for a while. But being in that intense of a spotlight... I wasn't used to it at the time. That's when I ran across Chelsea. She'd moved out to L.A. after graduating, wanting to make it as an actress thinking she could get by on her looks. Must've been right, or she must've sucked off the right guy, because she worked up to some incidental roles. One-off roles. Then she got cast in a supporting role in a show Haley, I, was doing.\" Courtney gives you a smile before continuing. \"Changed her name to Chels Snythe, that was her mom's maiden name, by the way. We didn't start shooting for a few months later so Chels decided to return home for the time being. I needed a break. So, well, you can figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going back? Are you going to keep being Chelsea?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney responds with a shrug of the shoulders. \"I'll go back as her, be her for a while, afterwards... I dunno. I've been enjoying it. But what about you Mark? What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the whole spiel. About your relationship with Jillian, the SX-3 research, the accident and discovery of your abilities and where you were now. You then decide to do David a favor and expel Chels from yourself. He's quick to transfer from Courtney back into her; you grab Courtney so she's not laying completely on the bathroom floor. Chels turns, getting ready to leave before you speak up. \"Hey, Johnson.\" you call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops and turns back towards you. \"Chels.\" she simply states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, yeah. Chels.\" you correct yourself, \"So what should I do? I... I want to tell Jillian. I love her so much and I don't want her to suffer without me but I can't... Protean has their fingers in deep. I don't know what they might try and get out of her. I wonder if I should run away, start over in another place. As another person. I took this girl, Summer, to try and get close to the labs on campus to continue my research but part of me wonders if I shouldn't just take some time and enjoy the ride so to speak.\" you sigh, \"You've got... experience with this. What should I do? What would you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my opinion,\" Chels begins, \"don't go looking for answers. Embrace what you can do. Embrace your new existence. If you want to run, run. If you want to stay, stay. If you want to be her for the rest of your life, do it. If you want to be others, do it. Just... don't worry about finding answers. The military can be vicious, a company like Protean can be even worse. You'd know, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Courtney stirs back to consciousness. \"Summer? Wh-what happened?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fainted right outside. Me and Chels dragged you back in here.\" you say thinking quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChels turns around and begins walking out of the bathroom. \"Think about what I said. I'll see you back at the table Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you help Courtney back to her feet, you wonder: David's advice made sense. It had worked for him after all. But you weren't David Johnson... you weren't sure who, or what, you were anymore. David's advice came from a sense of paranoia though one that wasn't unwarranted. You weren't some kid given incredible powers and hunted, you were a scientist. A researcher. And you were wondering if you should continue looking for those answers that David, Chels... whoever he was now had warned you against searching for.</span></div></div>",

You watch as the barista goes about her business, and Claire walks out of the ladies' room, your chance missed. Karin is still talking, stroking her pixie-crop and its out-of-a-bottle blonde strands. She looks at you, as if mentally firing daggers into your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was rude!\" she snaps. \"It goes to show though, haven't I been telling you that you should see a doctor recently, <i>mwah mwah mwah</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to talk all the way through lunch. As Thom, you sit there, letting his mind block out her droning, chipping in only with 'yes' and 'no dear' every so often to keep the stream coming. All the while you plan out your next move. Heading back to Protean is, as you've already decided, a bad option. And a cold shiver of sweat runs down your back as you wonder if they'll check the security tapes. It's just too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was going to meet Vicky North later, get our nails done, and then, <i>mwah mwah mwah</i>\". You frown with irritation at Karin's' nasal New York tone, and go back to your planning. You shouldn't have run from Jillian, and somehow you need to get word to her you're OK. That's when it hits you. Vicky North... isn't she the wife of Dr North, who works just a few doors down from your own lab? That could be a perfect way to keep tabs on the facility, but in a way nobody would ever suspect. They might scan every employee, but they wouldn't scan an employee's family, would they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Karin, and give a smile. The frame, uncomfortably turning to fat in places; the awful haircut; the voice. But she's your best option right now. You keep up the pretense, letting Thom block out her complaining and gossip, and hatching your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, and she's demanding that you carry her items to the car boot. You do so, Thom's arms holding the excessive amount of shoes, clothes and accessories Karin's piled on to your - or at least Thom's - cards. You lift the backs up into the boot, depositing them down. Then you turn to Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?\" She demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear,\" you say, walking towards her and placing your lips on hers. Then your hands on hers. Then, as your bodies merge, flesh becomes one and identification becomes an irrelevance. You watch as her eyes bulge in horror, before the eyes are sucked into your frame. Then the muscles unknit and twist, the bones crack and reform, the flesh bulges out at your chest and around your thighs and butt. Your hair becomes tighter, a horrendous shade of fake blonde. Your lips pout and turn a violent, lipstick red. Your nose thins as breasts erupt from your chest. And, as you step back in your new body, heels and clothes that should be worn by a woman ten years your junior tight against your flesh, you let Thom slip out. You look around to make sure nobody saw you, then look down at your husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin's thoughts fire through your brain: no real concern if he's all right, just irritation he's keeping her from a date with her friends. She's really an unsympathetic woman, and as you flick her hair and scratch her earrings as she always does when she's thinking, you try and search for a redeeming feature. She does seem to be a good mother at least, but you intend to be away from her life as soon as you can. After all, her form isn't the most appealing, and then there's the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. You forgot about that. You cough. \"Testing, testing. Hiya, I'm Karin Allen. Oh man, Thom I have no idea how you put up with this. I have no idea how she does, either, just listen to me, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the up side, nobody is going to suspect you'd choose to be someone so... irritating. And as Karin, you'll still be able to get access to the research data through Thom. Looking through her memories, there's a lot of fun to be had too, spending money with reckless abandon. Or you could go after Vicky North: she's a better choice for a more permanent residence, you think; although you'd still have to put up with Karin on their weekly pampering excursion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overcome with the urge to hide and to hide now, you break free of Jillian and dive across the floor to where Darcy lies.  You grab her as you fall on top of her and your momentum carries you onward, rolling several times before coming to a tangled rest on the opposite side of the lab from Jillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian has barely managed to turn round in this time.  Her mouth is hanging open in shock at what you\u2019ve just done.  Before she has time to marshal her response, you will the change to begin, hoping that you can absorb Darcy quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not working.  Quickly, you think back to what happened this morning:  Darcy arriving at the door.  Darcy getting the papers out her bag.  Darcy giving you the papers.  No.  That\u2019s not right, she dropped the papers as you reached to take them.  That\u2019s when it happened, when you tried to take something from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like a long shot, but what other option do you have.  Her body, her memories, her very identity.  You feel it as your flesh begins to lose its solidity, engulfing Darcy and drawing her within yourself.  The changes come on quickly after that.  Bones grind and pop as they shift themselves into new shapes.  Flesh bubbles and swells, padding out some areas and thinning in others.  As the changes climax, you draw yourself to your feet and look straight at Jillian, who still hasn\u2019t moved from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take any chances,\u201d you explain, half apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done,\u201d says Jillian quietly, a hard look in her eyes.  She starts walking across the lab slowly and carefully.  \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t get Darcy back again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d you reply quickly and insistently, almost shouting.  \u201cNo one can know.  No one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of control Mark,\u201d says Jillian, seizing you by the arms.  Her expression is a curious mixture of rage and sadness.  A tear trickles down one cheek.  \u201cI want to help you but you have to let me help you.  If you keep on like this\u2026  If you keep on like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops mid sentence for a moment, staring right into your eyes.  Somehow she manages to convey the full depth of her feelings with that look.  How her love for you is driving a conflict within her.  She\u2019s caught between her need to protect you and her need to cure you.  It makes you feel guilty, but you also have a sinking feeling as you begin to realise what she is trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep on like this, I\u2019ll have to tell people what happened,\u201d Jillian finally says.  She\u2019s crying now, tears smudging her make up.  \u201cIf it\u2019s the only to get you the help you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you shout shrilly, operating purely on instinct.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to let them take me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d exclaims Jillian, her jaw dropping in an expression of surprise.  Her tears dry up almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look intently at her face, trying to work out what\u2019s changed.  She\u2019s not looking directly at you anymore, you realize.  You follow her gaze, looking down at yourself, to where she has grabbed your arms.  Her fingers have sunk into your upper arms.  Not fully, as they are still visible, but they\u2019ve depressed into your flesh more than is natural.  The effect looks similar to squeezing play-doh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have partially triggered absorbing her.  It\u2019s not progressing any further but she\u2019s stuck.  You watch as Jillian tries to pull her hands clear, but they barely budge at all.  She only succeeds in stretching your flesh a little, which snaps immediately back into place like elastic and pulls her hands further into you.  You look up and see the fear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she pleads.  \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you say quietly as you grab Jillian by the waist and pull her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, impassively, as a look of terror settles on her face.  She struggles ineffectually all the way as each part of her is pulled in.  Your flesh wraps itself around her legs, her arms, her body, dragging her inside you until only her neck and head are left, jutting out just in front of your face.  You lean in close to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a moment of darkness, then the last of your girlfriend is sucked inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jillian in the mirror has been crying.  Her eyes are red and puffy, her cheeks are stained where her makeup has ran.  You lift your hands to wipe your eyes and the Jillian in the mirror does the same.  You run some water from a tap and splash it onto your face, the Jillian in the mirror does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are her and she is you.  You have absorbed your girlfriend completely and are now wearing her form and persona as an impenetrable disguise.  This sort of thing is probably not good for your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rush of Jillian\u2019s feelings that you experienced when you absorbed and became her probably isn\u2019t good either.  You didn\u2019t realise the depth of feeling she had for you.  Worse, with the mask of her personality you are now wearing, you realise she is unlikely to ever fully forgive you for what just happened.  So the flood of tears that you have wept over the last five minutes are partly Jillian\u2019s and partly your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have more pressing concerns than the wreckage of your relationship.  By now, the military convoy you observed will be parked and the occupants making their way through the foyer down on the ground floor. With hindsight, you realise Jillian was right \u2013 they do come to Protean a lot.  You could fix your make up and walk straight back to the lab.  Continue with the tests.  With Jillian\u2019s mind, and you now realise she is a lot cleverer than you, you could make some real progress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut can you take that chance?  You now know for sure that Jillian kept her promise not to tell anyone about the SX-3 spillage, but that doesn\u2019t preclude anyone else finding out.  It might be safer to run.  No one should be looking for Jillian, yet.  Even if they are, you could probably find another identity to escape in on the way out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was foolish to come to Protean Industries.  Staying a moment longer than necessary would be even more foolish.  You take a moment to dry your eyes and fix your make up \u2013 you don\u2019t want to draw any more attention if possible.  Then you walk out the rest rooms, submerging yourself inside the Jillian personality you hold within yourself, matching your gait to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab you share with Jillian, number seventeen, is directly opposite the toilets on this floor.  You ignore it and instead move down the corridor to the elevators.  They are some seventy metres distant, but researchers are always coming and going from their labs.  All your co-workers will see is Doctor Jillian Harding on her way out from her lab.  Jillian\u2019s shoes clack loudly on the tiled floor of the corridor as you confidently make your way down it.  You even give the geneticist Doctor Ingawa a friendly wave as he spots you through the plate glass windows of his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of lab nineteen, which is supposed to be unoccupied, opens in front of you and a security guard ushers himself out.  He locks the door behind himself.  The guard is tall and broad shouldered, powerfully built although his stomach is starting to run towards fat and strains against his tight uniform shirt.  Greying hair is cropped close in a buzz cut.  He turns and looks at you with hard eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor Harding,\u201d he greets you guardedly with a rasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make out a livid red scar curving up his neck and instantly identify him from both your and Jillian\u2019s memories as Chip Henklemann, the chief of Security at Protean.  The stories that you\u2019ve heard say that he is a former police officer.  The scar is a result of an attack from a drug dealer\u2019s dog.  It ruined his vocal cords and got him pensioned off the force.  A hard and uncompromising man by all accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Henklemann,\u201d you nod curtly as he falls into step beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Chip,\u201d he smiles.  It is a brief thing, only a slight upturn at the edges of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChip then,\u201d you reply.  \u201cI thought lab number nineteen was empty.  Is there a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoutine check,\u201d he growls.  Everything he says comes out ragged it seems.  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a new arrival any day, I wanted to make sure the lab was ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that fell under your remit,\u201d you say as you reach the elevators.  Henklemann presses the call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a security aspect,\u201d he replies.  \u201cYou know that much of the work the researchers do here is secret.  My job is to make sure nothing gets leaked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses for a moment as the elevator arrives, stepping inside once the door slides open.  Following him in, you press the button for level one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take my job seriously Doctor,\u201d he says, pressing the button for level two.  \u201c<i>Very</i> seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d you say politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d he grunts.  \u201cBecause I wanted to talk to you about the accident in your laboratory yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA minor spill,\u201d you say quickly, letting go of Jillian\u2019s persona instinctively.  You realise your mistake immediately and try to slip back into her thoughts before Henklemann notices.  \u201cNothing serious, what\u2019s so important about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yesterday</i> was nothing serious.  Next time?  Director Rosenstein has advised me that some of the chemicals you are using do present a security risk,\u201d he explains.  He stops and stares at you for a good few seconds longer than is comfortable.  Does he know something already?  \u201cI want to put contingencies into place to prevent a breach of security.  Rosenstein tells me such a breach would be \u2018significant\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know about Johnson,\u201d you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the place to talk about what I know and don\u2019t know,\u201d says Henklemann.  He pauses for a second to adjust his belt, making you acutely aware of the ugly looking gun holstered there, before continuing in a more conversational tone.  \u201cLook Doctor, if I\u2019m going to be honest, what I <i>have</i> read scares me.  I don\u2019t want to be left holding the can if there is a repeat incident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator slows to a halt and chimes as it reaches level two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stop,\u201d he says brusquely.  \u201cBe seeing you Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slide open and Henklemann strides out, brushing past a tall man in a bad suit who was waiting on the other side.  The man, evidently one of the pen pushers from downstairs, looks glumly at Henklemann for a moment before stepping inside the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello miss,\u201d he says sheepishly before turning round to press a button on the control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors close and the elevator resumes its journey.  It doesn\u2019t take long to reach the foyer.  When the doors open again your confidently stride past security and head for the exit.  There\u2019s a crowd of military types clustered round the reception desk, working their way through the process of signing in for visitor passes. You recognise Captain Eric Sanchez amongst them from your time working at Fort Suffolk.  He recognises you, well Jillian, and waves as you pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass through the doors without incident and take a deep breath: Free. Now what?  It\u2019s tempting to just get the hell out of Saratoga, find a bus or train or whatever and leave.  An unexplained disappearance like that will set alarm bells ringing though.  Since you still feel a bit guilty about absorbing her, you could find somewhere quiet and try to free Jillian.  Maybe even try to explain to her, although you know from your access to her personality that you are unlikely to get anywhere with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, some small part of you thinks it might be an idea to stay as Jillian.  It may now be the only to stop yourself from losing her.  A quick rummage through her memories reveals that she was planning on meeting her old friend Claire Briggs at a nearby coffee house.  That would be a good place to start your new life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling guilty about the entire set of circumstances, you quietly take Jillian\u2019s body out to the parking lot and get into her car.  You fasten your safety belt and glance into the mirror.  Seeing her reflection was bittersweet\u2026you\u2019d wronged her\u2026jumped into her body and controlled her just to save yourself, and that was wrong\u2026no two ways about it.  On the other hand, she was, in some sense, with you, and you could not stand the idea of being without her.  A single tear runs down you cheek as you turn the car on and head out of the parking lot.  You\u2019re not entirely sure where you\u2019re going to go, but you need to get Jillian out of this mess\u2026wasn\u2019t right to involve her in something like this.  It wasn\u2019t safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly jump onto the highway and head out of town\u2026not far, but far enough.  The buildings slowly fade into the distance, and the roads and gravel are replaced by corn and soybeans.  A few other cars dot the road as the sun begins to hang low in the sky.  Seeing your destination, you get into the right lane and exit, as the heart beating in Jillian\u2019s chest fills with sadness over what you have to do.  You pull into a gas station; the parking lot has only a couple cars in it, and a couple more are at the pumps filling up.  Parking the car, you step out and look over by the side of the road at a lone structure.  It isn\u2019t much, really, just a thin metal frame with some plexi-glass walls just to shield inhabitants from the wind.  Seeing one figure inside the structure, you set off in the direction.  Buses came through here every few hours, and one ought to be on the way just about now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the tiny bust stop, Jillian\u2019s heals kicking up a bit of gravel in the process.  The person sitting on the bench looks up.  She\u2019s got red hair.  She appears to be about forty years old with a figure beginning to show its age.  It\u2019s not that she was fat, but nor was she thin\u2014she had a full body, complete with an impressive set of cleavage and a little pouch in her belly.  This is to say nothing of the nice wide set of hips and wonderful backside upon which she sat.  The woman had make-up on, but it was smeared about her face as though she had been crying.  Giving a slight sniffle, the woman smiled slightly to acknowledge your presence.  She stuck out her hand to shake yours, \u201cI\u2019m Rachel,\u201d she said pleasantly.  \u201cJillian; my friends call me Jill,\u201d you answered.  \u201cGood to meet you Jill; what brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat next to Rachel, you paused.  \u201cWell,\u201d I sort of hurt the person I care most about in the whole world\u2026didn\u2019t mean to\u2026but\u2026.but that\u2019s what I did,\u201d you began, getting teary-eyed, \u201cand it\u2019s probably not safe for me to be here, so I\u2019ve got to be by myself, hence the bus stop,\u201d you answered.  Rachel smiled a little.  \u201cI have sort of the opposite problem,\u201d she sniffles, \u201cmy boyfriend\u2026with a beautiful 25-year-old body and a 12-year-old brain, threw me out of his bed this morning and told me I reminded him of his mother\u2026said I was sick for ever caring about him\u2026that I was good for sex and nothing else.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s a low blow,\u201d you said to comfort her.  \u201cYup\u2026yes it is.  I should have known the age difference would end us\u2026just didn\u2019t plan on ending up 43 and loveless, you know?\u201d  The two of you sat in silence for a couple minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any family?\u201d you asked.  \u201cNo,\u201d she answered glumly, \u201cyou?\u201d  \u201cYeah\u2026but I\u2019m a danger to them\u2026to her\u2026and I have to be invisible for her to be safe.\u201d  Rachel put her arm around you in a little show of support.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the bus will be here soon; last call to use the facilities,\u201d you said, setting your plan in motion.  \u201cIndeed,\u201d Rachel answered, getting up and heading to the gas station with you.  On the way in, you asked the guy at the desk for a pen and a piece of paper, which you received.  Heading over to a table near the window, you sat down and scribbled a note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Dearest Love,<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I did to you.  I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026.really.  This whole thing\u2019s a mess.  I love you more than I can say, and that\u2019s why I have to disappear\u2026to protect you.  I\u2019m not really going away, but you can\u2019t know where I am, so I think this is for the best.  I\u2019ll be around to keep you safe, but please don\u2019t look for me.  <br>\r\nBe safe, <br>\r\nMark\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the letter written, you stepped into the restroom to find Rachel standing at the mirror as tears began to form in your own eyes.  Handing her the letter, you said \u201cUm\u2026do\u2026do you think this is..you know\u2026a good letter?\u201d Rachel took it and read it.  She too got teary-eyed as she read.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walked around behind Rachel.  As she finished, she said, \u201cYeah\u2026yeah that\u2019s really nice, but who\u2019s Mark?\u201d  Choking back tears yourself, you quietly said, \u201cFor now, he\u2019s you.\u201d  With that, you wrapped your arms around Rachel\u2019s voluptuous body and willed her into yourself.  She kicked and struggled at first, but this became more futile as she merged more and more with you, her body consumed by the blue, viscous goo that constituted your form.  Finally, the last of her disappeared inside you.  You steadied Jillian\u2019s weakened body against the bathroom sink as you looked at her reflection in the mirror.  After what must have been thirty seconds or so, you felt something familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill\u2019s form began to crawl\u2026and bubble.  It was as though a million little beetles were crawling around inside her.  You watched as her hair turned red.  Glancing down, you saw her legs, belly, and chest plump up into the fuller, voluptuous features of the woman you\u2019d just absorbed.  After a transformation that lasted roughly a minute, Jill was gone.  Now wearing Rachel\u2019s body, you slowly bent down and picked up the letter, leaving the gas station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out a good distance from the building, you stepped behind a large tree and began to will Jill out of yourself.  Grunting, moaning and bracing Rachel\u2019s body, you felt the liquid moving around in your stomach, which had seemed to expand\u2026almost as if you were pregnant.  Your mouth opened to an absurd degree, and Jill\u2019s head popped out.  After a few more seconds, the rest of her emerged, unconscious but unharmed.  Breathing heavily, you carried her over and set her down gently on the ground.  You placed your letter in her pocket and, tears in your eyes, kissed her passionately on the lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hitchhiked your way back into town, happy Jillian was safe but heartbroken she was not with you.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You came to Protean Industries for a reason, and you will be damned if you don\u2019t finish what you started.  You take a moment to dry your eyes and fix your make up \u2013 you don\u2019t want to draw any more attention if possible. Then you walk out the rest rooms, submerging yourself inside the Jillian personality you hold within yourself, matching your gait to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab you share with Jillian, number seventeen, is directly opposite the restrooms on this floor.  Steeling yourself, you walk back inside and try to figure out where to pick up Jillian\u2019s investigations.  The test results are spread messily over a workbench to one side of the room.  Jillian had looked through most of them already, without much success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sift your mind through Jillian\u2019s mind, trying to work out where she would have gone next.  She still wanted to examine a couple of the tests more closely, but her next major avenue of exploration would have been Darcy herself.  The real Darcy, to check for any adverse effects as a result of her absorption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s a course that isn\u2019t without risks of its own: who knows how much Darcy might remember from her time inside you.  You trust Jillian\u2019s insight, however.  Releasing Darcy again is the next logical step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate on the sick to the stomach feeling that you had before you ejected Darcy earlier.  You feel your insides rumble and quiver.  Moments later, the grisly spectacle of you vomiting up Darcy repeats itself.  It takes less than a minute but leaves you feeling shaken and drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy is unconscious but breathing shallowly, just as she was before.  You reach down to take her pulse, suppressing any thoughts about reabsorbing her.  It is weak but steady.  You place her in the recovery position before returning to the test results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you can review the last of this morning\u2019s tests whilst waiting for Darcy to wake up.  Unfortunately, the last few pieces of paper prove to be dead ends as well.  There simply seems to be no way to tell that the person you were this morning was anyone other than Darcy Whitehead.  Even the DNA test was an exact match and there was no sign of any toxins or foreign substances in any of the tissue samples collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d comes an unsteady voice from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarcy,\u201d you reply, walking over and kneeling down by the prone girl.  \u201cAre you ok, you just kind of\u2026  Folded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJillian,\u201d asks the student, sounding surprised.  \u201cWhere am I, how did I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re at Protean, don\u2019t you remember,\u201d you improvise.  \u201cYou were at the house this morning and you felt faint.  You came with me this morning because I wanted to test if you were exposed to something in here by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d comes an assured sounding voice from by the door to the lab.  You stand up and spin round to see Levi Rosenstein, the director of research at Protean.  \u201cWe\u2019d get terrible press if we went around irradiating interns.  That was a joke Doctor Harding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy test,\u201d exclaims Darcy.  \u201cI\u2019ve missed my History test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTests can wait,\u201d replies Rosenstein, walking over to Darcy.  He leans down and helps her up off the floor.  \u201cYour health is much more important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d says Darcy coldly, pulling her hand free of Rosenstein.  \u201cWho is this Jillian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember Director Rosenstein,\u201d you say with a brittle smile.  \u201cHe approved your internship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course.  Sorry\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologise young lady,\u201d says Rosenstein with a smile that suggests precisely the opposite.  \u201cBut I am concerned with your health.  I would be upset if something untoward happened to you on my watch.  And if you have accidently been exposed to something, I simply must help you resolve the issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s something about Rosenstein\u2019s manner that you find off putting, even more so than usual.  For all his bonhomie, both you and Jillian profoundly distrust the man.  It\u2019s almost like he seems eager for something to have happened to Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your concern,\u201d however, is what you actually say, wondering what he is looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps a full round of tests,\u201d he suggests nonchalantly.  \u201cI would be happy to look over them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already carried some out, they were inconclusive,\u201d you explain, trying to dissuade him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, then perhaps you could forward the results to me,\u201d he says smiling wolfishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try again,\u201d you backtrack.  Far better for him to be looking at results from the genuine Darcy than from your SX-3 fuelled imitation.  \u201cThat is, if Darcy doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it strikes you:  Does Rosenstein know about the SX-3?  Perhaps he thinks Darcy has been exposed to it.  There\u2019s a far more sinister question lurking under that though:  Why is it so important to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think so,\u201d says Darcy, interrupting you chain of thoughts, sounding uncharacteristically unsure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt,\u201d you say.  \u201cMaybe we missed something earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid,\u201d says Rosenstein cheerfully, walking towards the door.  \u201cI shall expect a copy of the results on my desk tomorrow morning.  Farewell for now ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a creep,\u201d shivers Darcy once Rosenstein is out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo arguments from me,\u201d you reply.  \u201cLets get those tests done, if only to keep him off our backs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d  Darcy hesitates for a moment.  \u201cI\u2019m scared Jillian.   I don\u2019t remember anything from this morning.  Rosenstein seemed too keen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrible thought filters into your mind.  You\u2019re not sure if it is your own or something from the Jillian persona you are channelling, and you feel a little bit guilty for not discarding it immediately:  What if you set up Darcy as a diversion?  Falsify the test results to make it look as if she had been exposed to SX-3?  That would distract attention from yourself long enough to complete your own research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hardly believe you are even thinking of doing that though.  It would be monstrous, and a betrayal of the trust that Darcy has shown in both you and Jillian.  You really should protect her from the fallout of yesterdays spillage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI have those papers you wanted,\u201d you say, channelling Darcy\u2019s directness, almost instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no choice, you realise.  Memories of the David Johnson business come flooding back:  The military convoys screaming about Saratoga Falls.  The paranoia and mistrust at Fort Suffolk.  The stress suffered by Johnson\u2019s family.  It was not pleasant, and you have no desire to repeat the experience again.  And certainly not as the focus of the military\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that leaves you with no choice but to impersonate Darcy.  No one, not even your own girlfriend, can know about what\u2019s happened to you.  At least, not until you know where they stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d says Jill slowly.  \u201cAnd Mark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe door was open,\u201d you improvise.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry Jill, but I\u2019m really in a rush this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rush,\u201d repeats Jill unsurely.  Between the earliness of the hour and Darcy\u2019s brisk nature, you\u2019ve wrong footed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this European history test at 8,\u201d you continue, getting into the flow of things.  It\u2019s surprising how easy it is to mimic Darcy, and how easy it is to animate her personality and make it do what you want.  \u201cI\u2019ve been up all night studying and all I want to do is take the test and then find somewhere to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure,\u201d says Jill smiling fuzzily.  \u201cI guess I better let you get to it then.  I\u2019ll see you, what, this afternoon?  Or tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably tomorrow,\u201d you say, turning to leave.  \u201cBye Jill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, bye,\u201d she replies absent mindedly as you walk away.  Closing the door behind you, you can see Jill looking around the house.  \u201cMark?  Mark, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a pang of guilt, but then, the alternatives would be so much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your pen down on the desk and look at your, no Darcy\u2019s, watch.  It\u2019s an elegant silver bracelet, somehow and miraculously reproduced by the SX-3 in your body.  It shows twenty five minutes past ten, the same time as the clock on the wall at the far end of the hall.  That it seems to work poses some interesting questions about the SX-3 \u2013 how it was able to form a working mechanical system from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a question more relevant than the one you have just answered, a two and a half hour essay on the Thirty Years War.  The Darcy persona you\u2019ve submerged yourself in since this morning is tired, but relieved to have finished.  For you, it has been two and a half wasted hours.  You push the Darcy thoughts to one side and start to think on your own problems as the test papers are collected in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtean would be an obvious place to start, you think as you begin packing up your equipment.  As Darcy, you would have access.  It would be a limited access as she is only an intern, but an access of a sort.  At least she would normally.  By now Jill must have realised that you are missing.  If she\u2019s told anyone then things might be difficult,  doubly so if she has mentioned the incident with the SX-3 yesterday.  Laying low for a few days to see how things pan out might be wiser in that case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted as you leave the hall by someone shouting Darcy\u2019s name.  You turn your head and see another girl waving at you.  She\u2019s Asian, short (but then so are you now) and quite pretty in an alternative sort of way.  Her shiny black hair is layered with bright neon pink stripes, tied up in high bunches at the side of her heads.  A tight fitting tee and jeans show off her gentle curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you have no idea who she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach again for Darcy\u2019s mind, slipping again into her memories.  A name floats to the surface: Summer.  A friend, simply because she\u2019s the only other ex-Eastman High School student in this class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeya Darcy, how\u2019d you do,\u201d she asks, smiling brightly as she bounds over to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little stray Darcy thought slips through your mind: amazement at how much Summer\u2019s personality has changed over the last year since she hooked up with that Yves girl.  You file it away for future reference before returning her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d you reply.  \u201cI did spend all night studying after all, so I should do well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d she says.  \u201cKeen.  You must be tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d you acknowledge as you open the door for Summer.  \u201cI was going to go home and get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee,\u201d asks Summer, apparently ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m too tired,\u201d you begin, before clutching your stomach.  An intense, stabbing pain grips you and you double over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok,\u201d asks Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d you reply before bolting into a nearby toilet.  You have just enough time to push your way into an empty stall and close the door behind you before the pain returns.  Your stomach turns somersaults as you kneel over the bowl and you feel something rush up from inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it gets <i>really</i> weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw opens wide to accommodate the sheer volume of vomit, distending far beyond what should be natural.  The fluid is warm and sweet.  Viscous, it seems to start solidifying as it leaves your mouth.  The flow stops for a moment, giving you a chance to realise what\u2019s happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJutting out from your impossibly wide mouth is another Darcy.  Or her head at least, possibly even the real Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating profusely, you raise a hand to just in front of your face.  It as if you are melting, the fingers of your hand fusing together like a glob of molten wax.  Slowly the colour fades from your skin and it takes on a bright blue hue, matching the tone of the SX-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to think on this as another swirl of liquid starts to move around inside your stomach.  It swells and grows and, just as you think the pressure will make you burst open, well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplitting vertically right down the middle, your torso opens and Darcy comes tumbling out.  She lies on the floor, curled round the toilet.  Her breathing seems shallow and she is unconscious.  Otherwise, she appears unchanged from when you met her earlier this morning.  You rise unsteadily to your feet, by this point little more than shapeless blue mass with only the vaguest approximation of human form.  Then something snaps within you and your form returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit a you in your dressing gown.  Stuck inside the ladies toilets.  With a young lady lying unconscious on the floor in front of you.  It couldn\u2019t be much worse, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarcy, are you ok in there,\u201d comes a voice from outside the stall.  Summer has followed you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, so it could get worse.  It can always get worse.  You have no idea how you absorbed Darcy earlier, but it looks like the only way to get out of here is to repeat the process again.  Unless you want to try to absorb Summer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unless you do something Summer is likely to try to open the door herself in a minute.  You still have no idea what caused you to absorb Darcy within yourself this morning, but right now your best chance is somehow trigger it again.  You kneel back down on the floor beside her slumbering body.  Wrapping your arms around her, you try to will the change to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I come in,\u201d asks Summer, knocking on the stall door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not working.  Desperately, you think back to what happened this morning:  Darcy arriving at the door.  Darcy getting the papers out her bag.  Darcy giving you the papers.  No.  That\u2019s not right, she dropped the papers as you reached to take them.  That\u2019s when it happened, when you tried to take something from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start thinking about what you want to take.  Her body, her memories, her very identity.  You feel it as your flesh begins to lose its solidity, engulfing Darcy and drawing her within yourself.  The changes come on quickly after that.  Bones grind and pop as they shift themselves into new shapes.  Flesh bubbles and swells, padding out some areas and thinning in others.  You groan involuntarily in a low, masculine, register which rapidly rises in pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in,\u201d shouts Summer from the other side of the stall door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts pushing at the door, trying to get in.  You doubt it will hold long and starting willing the transformation to go faster, praying it will finish before Summer makes it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d you screech as the lock breaks and the door snaps open and hits you squarely on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry,\u201d says Summer as she helps you to your feet.  She doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed anything out of the ordinary so you guess you managed to luck out and finish becoming Darcy in time.  \u201cSo are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you snap, carefully modulating your tone to match the way the real Darcy would reply.  \u201cIt was just a stomach upset.  Something I ate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d says Summer a little insouciantly as she hooks her arm into yours and leads you away from the stall.  \u201cYou sounded a little weird there for a moment, like a guy or something\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment and turn to face Summer.  You give her a cool stare for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said sorry,\u201d she says, acting hurt.  \u201cSo how about that coffee then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you reply firmly.  \u201cI should get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer looks at you uncertainly for a moment, then with a cheery wave she bids you goodbye.  She walks out the door, leaving you alone in the toilets.  You inspect yourself carefully in the mirror, turning your head first one way then the other, making sure that the transformation is complete.  There is neither any hint of your real self, nor that you are anyone other than who you appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy had planned to go home and get some sleep after her test, and sifting through her feelings you can sense just how tired she would be by now.  It\u2019s tempting to give in to her tiredness, submerged as you are in her persona.  On the other hand, you, the core of yourself buried deep under the fake Darcy self, aren\u2019t tired at all.  What you really need to do is start researching your condition \u2013 work out what the SX-3 has done to you.  It wouldn\u2019t hurt to check up on how Jillian is reacting to your apparent disappearance either.  Both of these things would lead you back to Protean Industries.  Since Darcy is an intern there, you can walk straight in too.  With your mind made up, you spend a brief moment primping your hair before setting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtean is quite close to Keyserling, located on a modern research and business park not far from the college grounds, so it doesn\u2019t take long to get there.  You were able to walk in past security with no problems.  There were no extra guards, no worried looking faces and no sign at all that anybody is concerned over the sudden disappearance of Mark Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lab looks almost exactly as you left it yesterday.  There\u2019s no sign that anyone else has been in here, aside from Jillian.  She\u2019s leaning over one of the benches opposite the door, rummaging through a messy pile of computer print outs.  Jillian appears a little haggard looking, not quite herself.  You can\u2019t quite make out what the problem is from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJillian,\u201d you call out.  \u201cDr Harding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian looks up from her papers and gives you a forlorn little wave before resuming her deliberations.  Not wanting to disturb her any more than necessary, you start to walk across the lab to her position.  The clacking of your shoes on the hard surface of the floor rings loudly in the otherwise silent lab.  As you approach, you get a clearer look at Jillian.  She hasn\u2019t styled her hair with her usual care and attention, instead tying it up into a very rough ponytail.  Her make up is a little smudged, suggesting she\u2019s been crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright,\u201d you ask abruptly.  It\u2019s a typically direct Darcy question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d  Jillian replies, looking in almost every direction except directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem out of sorts,\u201d you state.  Darcy isn\u2019t the most sensitive people but even she would have noticed just how upset Jillian is.  She just wouldn\u2019t be very tactful about it.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Mark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian pauses for a moment.  She snuffles a little before answering.  \u201cHe\u2019s back at home.  He\u2019s come down with the flu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit guilty for asking.  Jillian\u2019s obviously upset, and your questions have upset her further.  However, you\u2019ve learned something important \u2013 that she\u2019s kept the promise she made yesterday not to tell anyone.  That\u2019s something that makes you think she deserves a little of your trust in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJillian, Jill,\u201d you say hesitantly, letting the mask of Darcy\u2019s thoughts slip from your mind.  \u201cI know where Mark is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you,\u201d she says shakily, not looking up from her papers.  \u201cHe\u2019s at home\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not,\u201d you say softly.  \u201cJill, look up.  Look up and listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops her paper to the desk and looks directly at you, misery etched on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to trust me,\u201d you continue.  \u201cPromise me you can stay calm for the next five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense Darcy,\u201d says Jillian flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d you plead.  \u201cJust\u2026  Just say you\u2019ll stay calm.  Just for five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can,\u201d she says unsurely.  \u201cYou\u2019re still not making any sense though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026  Just watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand still for a minute, trying to recall the feeling in your stomach from earlier.  A stabbing pain tells you that you have succeeded, and soon enough you feel the fluid starting to gush up your throat.  Even though you know what to expect this time, the process of releasing Darcy from within you is just as weird and sickening as before.  Hunched on the floor, sweating at the effort of it, you are unable to gauge Jillian\u2019s reaction to what she is seeing other than from an occasional shocked gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it is over.  Darcy lies unconscious on the floor as you stand back up, your blue waxy flesh solidifying back into your real from.  You look Jillian in the eye, unable to read the expression on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each holds some kind of weapon in their hands, pointed directly at you.  Not a gun, tasers of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the floor,\u201d one of them shouts at you.  The other two pick up the refrain and repeat it.  \u201cGet on the fucking floor\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the men.  They\u2019re all heavy set, strong looking ex-military or ex-police types.  That\u2019s the kind of people Protean hires for security.  You doubt you could take one, let alone all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the floor Taylor,\u201d the shouting continues, three voices not quite in synch.  \u201cGet on the floor Taylor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you, confused and unable to believe this is happening.  Jillian is shocked, unable to move.  The security guards are watching you warily, expressions of determination on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, not all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guard is different.  Not cut from the same mould as the other two, a little more overweight, a little less sure of himself.  You watch as a bead of sweat runs down the side of his face, as his fingers tighten uncertainly on the trigger of his taser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he shoots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moments nervousness on his part and he accidently pulled the trigger.  You feel the electric shock riding through your body but you somehow cling onto consciousness.  You look down at the darts sticking into your chest.  Where they\u2019ve hit, and for all the area around them, your flesh has become the waxy bright blue of SX-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up.  The guard is staring at you in amazement, still holding onto his taser.  On a whim, you grab the cables and tug.  They dig into the palms of your hands which turn the same waxy blue as your chest as the cables sink in.  Maybe it\u2019s broken somehow, or maybe it\u2019s just stupid design, but the taser is pulled with them.  The guard, still dazed, stumbles forward with the gun until you reach out and grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is stronger than you and he does struggle.  It makes no difference, all that happens is he gets himself more and more entangled in your melting flesh.  You draw him in with a sickening slurp.  The shouting all around you changes tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining security guards professionally manage to hold their tasers level at you, but you can see the bewilderment on their faces as your form starts to shift into that of the guard you hav just absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth guard enters by the broken lab door.  He is tall and broad shouldered, powerfully built.  Greying hair is cropped close in a buzz cut.  A livid red scar curves up his neck, instantly identifying him as Chip Henklemann, the chief of Security at Protean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake him down gentlemen,\u201d he rasps, staring coldly at you.  \u201cUse everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room starts to spin as you take another shock, and then another.  By the time Henklemann closes to take his shot, you are having difficulty keeping your eyes open.  Your vision starts to blur and everything turns mercifully black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up Mr Taylor\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a couple of times and try to survey your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up Mr Taylor,\u201d comes the voice again.  It is rich and smooth, full of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Lenny Davidson, retired cop and security guard.  No, that\u2019s not right.  Slowly your memories come back into focus.  You remember what happened in the lab, from your perspective and Lenny\u2019s.  You drag yourself upright and take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in a small room.  Very small, barely five metres across and the only furnishing is the hard bed you were just lying on.  One wall is entirely made of glass, through which you can see another, larger room.  It looks like another Protean lab, although the lighting is much lower than the one you share with Jillian.  A door is set in one wall of your room but there is seemingly no way of opening it, at least from this side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Mr Taylor,\u201d says the voice.  You recognise Protean\u2019s head of research, Levi Rosenstein, standing on the other side of the glass wall.  \u201cOr should that be Mr Davidson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at the man, still getting your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust who am I talking to,\u201d continues Rosenstein, a little more insistently this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark,\u201d you eventually admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would make sense,\u201d replies Rosenstein, smiling a little smugly.  \u201cI have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect this kind of reaction from SX-3,  not after reading the Johnson reports.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands silently for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were exposed to SX-3 Mr Taylor,\u201d he continues.  \u201cI am correct in that assumption, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you mumble.  No point hiding it now, you don\u2019t know how long they have been watching Jillian\u2019s lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that bring us to, shall we say, the heart of the matter.  This lab you are in, built to permit the study of an individual exposed to SX series chemicals.  All planed out for some time now, and then along you come before I am able to arrange exposure myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare mutely at Rosenstein, you can think of nothing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are inconvenient Mr Taylor, but also an opportunity.  You\u2019ve survived the exposure to SX-3 and apparently with unusual powers,\u201d  Rosenstein stops for a moment, his eyes narrow behind his trendy glasses.  \u201cYou are a subject of interest for Protean industries, so I\u2019m going to offer you a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence settles over the lab as Rosenstein stops talking.  From your previous encounters with the man, you know he can be fond of theatricality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can cooperate with us.  Let us run the experiments that we\u2019d like to.  You and Doctor Harding will be well compensated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to co-operate,\u201d you ask, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to carry out the experiments anyway, but forcing your compliance will be time consuming and unproductive.  We might be required to find an alternative test subject.  The good doctor perhaps?  Of course, we can\u2019t guarantee that an alternative test subject would survive the exposure as you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosenstein lets the threat hang in the air for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you will cooperate Mr Taylor, will you not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster,\u201d you say venomously.  \u201cThis would never have happened at Fort Suffolk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe army, Mr Taylor, does not have a board of directors to answer to,\u201d replies Rosenstein impatiently.  \u201cYou will find that they are considerably less forgiving than a senate committee or the joint chiefs.  Now I am waiting for an answer Mr Taylor.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, Mr. Taylor, are you ready to start today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rosenstein looks at you with a bit of a leer. You've realized, over the last two weeks or so after you agreed to cooperate with Rosenstein for his tests, that he is a very unsettling individual. His single-minded, results at all costs mindset leaves him about as warm as a glacier and with seemingly no care for the well being of those involved with his tests. It's left those who work with him, security, other scientists, executives and such to occasionally refer to him as Mengele; and the irony of referring to a man with a Jewish name as that isn't lost on them. In fact, Rosenstein is aware of it and seems to not be bothered, which makes him all the more unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah. Sure thing Doc.\" you say in a Texan drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. First thing's first Mr. Taylor, I would like to see how much, if any, of your previous... meals your form remembers.\" states Rosenstein in a matter-of-fact manner. \"If you would, please try to change into each and every person you've absorbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and with that your form begins changing, spending about thirty seconds as each person: Darcy Whitehead, college student and intern. Lenny Davidson, ex-cop and security officer for Protean. From there it was seeing how long you could hold a person for. For one day you were Kathryn Donaldson, Rosenstein's assistant. For two days you were Susanna Huffman, the newest secretary at Protean. You spent three days as accountant Thom Allan and then, on Rosenstein's orders, a day each as Thom's family: Thom's wife Karin, 12-year-old daughter Bailey, and 9-year-old daughter Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then change back into who you've spent the last four days as: Drew Williams, a contractor for TRS Solutions, a PMC currently based out of Fort Suffolk. It wasn't hard, the base and Protean have close ties and TRS contractors tend to be used as security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, excellent.\" says Rosenstein, \"Now then, if you would eject Ms. Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and think about ejecting her from your form. However nothing happens. You try again and still nothing. A third time, yet like the previous two times nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Taylor?\" asks Rosenstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Doc. I've been tryin' ta get 'er outta me but I'm gettin' nothin'.\" you state in a perplexed manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosenstein nods, \"And her memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her memories an' personality an' stuff, I got all'a that.\" you state. You then change shape back into Bailey Allan. \"But if I'm like this? Nothing about her mind is there. Same with anyone else I turn into. Unless they're part of me I don't have access to their mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, quite interesting indeed.\" Rosenstein nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuck a bit of brown hair behind your ear, \"What's so interesting?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to change back into yourself.\" states Rosenstein. He notices you give him a look, \"Please, Mr. Taylor, just give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and try to change back into yourself, into Mark Taylor. Much like when you tried to release Drew, however, nothing happens. A few more attempts but once more nothing. \"What the fuck?!\" you exclaim and it's very odd coming out of your current form, \"What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Taylor, please calm down.\" says Rosenstein. \"I'd like you to clear your mind. We've done this before, by focusing on just letting go of your form you're able to naturally shift back to your default shape. So give that a try, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and do as Rosenstein says. It works... in a way. You're surprised, however, when you shift not into Mark Taylor but Drew Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the shit?\" you ask in Drew's thick Texan accent. \"Why can't I turn back into myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I suspect that <i>is</i> yourself now.\" Rosenstein says as he adjusts his glasses. \"My own research combined with Dr. Harding's and your cooperation has given me a theory, if you would like to hear it.\" He waits until you nod, \"When you absorb someone, you're slowly digesting them into yourself. Any time between the absorption and digestion you're able to divest yourself of that person. However after a period they are completely digested and thus become a permanent part of you. It would seem that period is four days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that makes sense I guess. But that still doesn't explain why I'm stuck as Williams.\" you say, the annoyed tone obvious in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to continue my theory,\" says Rosenstein, \"What I suspect is that actually have no human form. Your appearance itself was nothing more than genetic leftovers. I suspect that when you digested Ms. Williams what was left was converted to her own. Thus you are now, by default, Drew William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then how come I still think I'm Mark Taylor?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosenstein's expression becomes more perplexed at that. \"That I am not sure of. Perhaps because your thoughts, your personality, what makes you you mentally is not genetic. Something needs to control your physical body. That's just a theory, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about if I digest someone else?\" you ask. \"Would I still be able to become Williams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. As I said, 'Mark Taylor' was just some leftover genetic code. Like scraping off dead skin flakes. Drew Williams is part of you now. If you digested someone else they would probably become your default form but I have reason to believe that you will not be able to rid yourself of Ms. Williams in that manner.\" You grumble at that and Rosenstein seems to show a rare moment of compassion. \"We've learned a lot in the short time you've been here today. Take the day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou stand in your bathroom, looking at the body that's replaced your own. Drew Williams is very much a butch type of woman and yet see that there's still a rough prettiness under that exterior. Light blue eyes, a narrow nose, full lips, bleached hair that was in a buzz cut but has since grown out just a tiny bit. Your body, clad in dark athletic pants and a sports bra, is lean yet muscular with rock hard abs and an A-cup chest. Being the peak physical health is something Drew takes a large amount of pride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a half-sleeve tattoo on your left arm done in a tribal style. On the inside of your right forearm is a simple group of tallymarks that represent the number of confirmed kills she had when she was still with the army. She spent her last couple of tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a sniper. She'd been a crack shot since the first time her dad had given her a gun. Her dad was ex-military himself, having served in Vietnam, as was her grandfather who was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. All of that, combined with growing up adjacent to Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, caused Drew to grow up with a healthy respect for the military; she eagerly joined the Army out of high school and once combat positions were opened up to women she eagerly transferred over and excelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow 33-years-old, her military career came to an end when she caught the attention of TRS Solutions and was given a discharge to join up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you doing?\" Jillian's voice comes from the bathroom doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look at her. \"Fuck, I dunno Jillian. This shit... so much's happened in the last few days and none of it's makin' any sense.\" you sigh, \"An' I'm worried that me bein' like this is gonna fuck up our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so silly.\" she smiles, \"I fell in love with who you were inside, not who you were physically. We'll make it work. Besides you can still be a guy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, inside I'm me and this chick and a middle-aged accountant and a 12-year-old girl.\" you state glumly, \"But yeah, I dunno. This girl goes both ways anyway so we could always...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you grab Jillian by the hand and she giggles as you drag her in. You have no clue if she'd go for it but you're about to test that \"not in love with who you are physically\" thing. Or you were until you hear your cellphone go off in the living room. You roll your eyes and head out to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you hang up and Jillian joins you out in the living room. \"Who was that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosenstein.\" you state, \"Turns out that he's been keepin' Protean's investors informed of what's been goin' on with me an' the SX-3 and they're mighty interested in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interested how?\" asks Jillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This company, Rosenstein said their name was Fane or some shit like that, has ties with Fort Suffolk but they feel that Col. Lord, the guy runnin' things there, ain't bein' on the up and up with 'em.\" you explain, \"So they want me to infiltrate it. Get close to Lord, keep an eye on him, report to Fane what he's doin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this woman, she works for that PMC based out of the base right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"Yeah but she ain't gonna be good enough. I'd have to get close to Lord. Someone he trusts. One of his right hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be Sanchez, then, right?\" asks Jillian, \"Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trails off and you know why. The other person is Claire Briggs, Jillian's close friend. Claire and Eric Sanchez are both Lord's number two at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they gave me a choice. Either I do that or I head to England, Cambridge I think Rosenstein said, to meet with some Fane guys personally.\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would... that would put us apart for god knows how long.\" says Jillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod once more, \"Yeah, an' they said it'd have to be me solo. But if I wint I would have a way of takin' you...\" Jillian looks at you, you give a small smile as realization sets in on her face. \"I absorb ya, fly over to England, eject ya in a hotel room. Me an' you, we can scope out these Fane guys together.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDarcy,\u201d yells Summer, thumping on the stall door.  \u201cDarcy, open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not good.  Not good at all.  Unless you do something Summer is likely to try to open the door herself in a minute.  You still have no idea what caused you to absorb Darcy within yourself this morning, or if you can even do it again.  Maybe you only get one shot at absorbing a person.  Maybe you can\u2019t ever absorb another person at all.  Either way, Summer is a more pressing problem than the unconscious Darcy.  Absorb her, knock her out, whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter just so long as you can get the hell out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming out,\u201d you try to say in falsetto.  Not the most convincing idea you\u2019ve had, but the strange thing is it works -  it doesn\u2019t just sound higher than your normal voice, it sounds exactly like Darcy.  You consider the possibility that the SX-3 has left you with some residual memory of being Darcy but decide to think more on it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Summer take a step back away from the door.  It\u2019s do or die time.  You fumble with the stall lock before opening the door as suddenly as you can.  Although Summer is looking directly at you she is simply too stunned at your unexpected appearance to do anything other than stare blankly at you with her mouth open.  That gives you ample time to take the two steps over to her and place your right hand firmly over her mouth.  You push the increasingly frightened looking young woman back against the row of sinks on the far wall, pinning her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmpf,\u201d she tries to say, her voice muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, you spin her round with your free arm, looping it round her chest and holding her in tight against her yourself.  Staring at your reflection in the large mirror that runs along the wall above the sinks you will the change to happen.  Below your own reflected image you can see Summer\u2019s eyes start to dart wildly from side to side.  She\u2019s struggling, trying desperately to break out of your grip.  You were never particularly strong, but Summer is at least a foot shorter than you and quite thin.  It\u2019s easy enough to hold her in place.  Again you will the change to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not working.  Panicking, you think back to what happened this morning:  Darcy arriving at the door.  Darcy getting the papers out her bag.  Darcy giving you the papers.  No.  That\u2019s not right, she dropped the papers as you reached to take them.  That\u2019s when it happened, when you tried to take something from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like a long shot, but what other option do you have.  You start thinking about what you want to take:  Her body, her memories, her very identity.  Just as Summer is trying to stamp the heel of her boot onto your foot, you feel your flesh starting to flow.  The boot sinks painlessly into your foot with a squelch.  Summer\u2019s eyes go wide for a moment as she spots the fingers of your right hand, the one held over her mouth, starting to fuse together.  Then she goes limp.  You watch, horrified, as she is drawn within your body, your melting flesh lapping round her, pulling her in.  She sinks within you, leaving a misshapen mess \u2013 still recognisably Mark Taylor but weirdly distorted and with unsightly bumps and protrusions all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burp loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the changes start to happen.  Bones grind and pop as they shift themselves into new shapes.  Flesh bubbles and swells, padding out some areas and thinning in others.  You watch as your hair starts to lengthen, turning a shiny black in places and hot pink in others.  Amazingly, it lifts itself up of its own accord and ties itself into the bunches Summer was wearing.  While you can barely feel the changes that write themselves across your face, at least in comparison to the ones on the rest of your body, they are fascinating to watch in the mirror.  It is as if your skin crawls, stretching itself into a new shape, pulling at your eyes to give them an exotic looking slant, squeezing your nose into a small delicate shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are Summer Nguyen, 19 years old and a student at Keyserling College.  Struggling to make ends meet because you are estranged from your father.  Tired out from the stress of studying and working part time, but ultimately happy because your life is your own.  At least it was until five minutes ago.  Hidden inside this shell is your real self, beyond the detection of the military and Protean Industries.  You cannot help but smile.  Just the way Summer would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll have time to investigate your new identity more thoroughly later you think as you pick up Summer\u2019s satchel from where she dropped it.  There\u2019s one last detail to attend to \u2013 Darcy.  She\u2019s still lying prone in the stall.  Finding out what she remembers of this morning would be useful, so you give her a gentle shake until she starts to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2026  Where am I,\u201d Darcy asks slowly as you help her to her feet.  \u201cSummer?  What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok,\u201d you ask, perfectly mimicking the kind of concern Summer would show in the situation.  \u201cI think you fainted or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u201d ask Darcy again, this time a little more insistently as she regains her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, the toilets,\u201d you respond a little mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously,\u201d replies Darcy a little wearily.  \u201cAnd where are the toilets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenn Hall, at Keyserling.  You mean you don\u2019t know how you got here,\u201d you add, feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask otherwise,\u201d says Darcy, staring meaningfully at you.  \u201cThe last thing I remember is\u2026 Oh god, the test!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready done, and you just told me you thought you did well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a moment of awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been pushing myself to hard,\u201d says Darcy, sounding uncharacteristically unsure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did mention something about being up all night,\u201d you respond, shrugging your shoulders.  \u201cYou really remember nothing at all until you got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.  I was at Dr Harding\u2019s, she\u2019s the one helping me out with my biosciences course,\u201d explains Darcy.  \u201cAnd now I\u2019m here.  Nothing in between.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s stress,\u201d you say, trying to conceal how pleased you are to hear that she doesn\u2019t remember what\u2019s happened to her.  \u201cYou should get some rest, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Darcy, although she doesn\u2019t sound convinced.  \u201cI should go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch you later,\u201d you say with a cheery wave as you walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy may be heading to bed, but Summer\u2019s day is just beginning.  Living out her life, keeping a low profile, seems like a good idea right now.  It will give you a chance to see if there is any major reaction to your disappearance.  Since Summer isn\u2019t directly connected to you in the same way Darcy is, it is unlikely that your new identity will attract immediate suspicion from anyone who starts to guess what the SX-3 has done to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind you spend an hour or so pottering about in the campus library.  Summer is an arts major.  Not exactly your strong suit, but with her mind at your command you easily manage the work she had planned.  After that, you make your way over to the coffee house where she works part time, arriving just in time for the start of her shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s an independent operation, not part of any big chain and just a little bit upmarket.  Sitting just on the edge of the Keyserling campus and close to the research park where Protean Industries is located.  The clientele is a mix of post-grads, lecturers and workers from the research park.  Students tend to keep out unless they work for the place.  As the lunchtime trade picks up, you find yourself kept very busy.  So busy you don\u2019t notice when someone you, the real you, know comes in until they order their \u2018coffee, just coffee, black with none of that junk you seem to insist on putting into it\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Briggs, Lieutenant Claire Briggs, is a friend of Jillian\u2019s, and her connection back to the military base you both worked at last year.  It\u2019s odd for her to be out this way, since Fort Suffolk is on the other side of Saratoga Falls.  You watch surreptitiously as she sits herself at an empty table and unfolds a newspaper and starts to read it.  She\u2019s clearly waiting for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a shock when her guest arrives.  Jillian walks in, orders a coffee from one of your co-workers and sits beside Claire.  The two immediately fall into a hushed conversation.  Despite your best efforts to hang around them, clearing tables and taking orders, you can\u2019t overhear anything more than the odd word from the pair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself desperate to know what is being discussed, and frustrated that there seems to be no way to find out.  The conversation goes on for some time as the lunchtime rush starts to calm down and the coffee house empties.  Yet still, you can\u2019t hear what\u2019s being said.  You are on the verge of giving up when Claire excuses herself and makes her way to the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked this morning, why not now?  You could follow her and read the conversation from her memories.  You could even wait and see if Jillian makes a visit.  On the other hand, the coffee house is still busy and you don\u2019t want to risk being seen.  It might be better to stick to your plan to lay low as Summer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You eye the door to the women's restroom for a moment unsure of what to do but eventually you shake it off and head out from behind the counter to go clean a table. You're curious to know what the conversation is between your girlfriend and the lieutenant is but at the same time you're still not quite sure on whether you could absorb Claire or not. Would you be able to? If so would you have to give up Summer? If you had to that might give Claire time to act before you can do anything. Even grabbing her might not be the best idea because as a soldier she's undoubtedly been trained in CQC and she might react in a manner that would put you in danger. Likewise say you try and grab her and it doesn't work? The last thing you need is a military officer pissed off and put on guard after being molested by a petite Vietnamese girl. That'd be real bad for the whole \"laying low\" thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you continue to clean, continue to take orders and deliver drinks, continue to make drinks and ring up the register all while trying to eavesdrop. Your efforts are in vain however as after about another 20 minutes Claire and Jillian pay another barista, a girl named Courtney Hamilton, who had been waiting on them most of the lunch hour and leave. You pull her aside and try a desperate, direct approach. \"Hey those two... any clue what they were talking about?\" you ask her. She gives you a look and you press on, \"Well I mean I always see those two with some other guy and now he's not there, you know? Kind of weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney just shakes her head. \"You're going on like you're still part of Alyssa's group.\" She replies referring to a group that Summer was part of back in high school. Courtney was another student at Eastman that was part of the same graduating class as Darcy and Summer so of course she knows all about the Rumoratti, although now the only ones still around are Tina and Mandy; the others went off to schools either in other parts of the state or out of state though they keep in touch regularly via Facebook and the like. She gives a smile though, \"I really can't believe you were so quiet until close to the end of the year. You're, like, way different now.\" she adds before heading back behind the counter as you go back to bussing a few more tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney is another friend that Summer's made since starting at Keyserling. As you continue Summer's shift you decide to lose yourself in her and her recent memories. Dating Chris Yves had been a good thing for Summer who had previously been very shy and withdrawn with plenty of confidence issues. Chris, however, had showed her that she was a pretty girl who needed to just show people the same confidence she had to other people that she had while the two of them talked. An attraction developed which allowed Summer to come to terms with her sexuality (something she had been struggling with throughout high school) and the two began dating. It wasn't to last, sadly, as Chris went off to school in Maryland. However the relationship had been a nice kick for Summer and by the time she started at Keyserling she had become a much more confident, much more outgoing and well-liked person around campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your break comes you get a call, almost literally as you're walking out the door. \"Summer, hey! You on break?\" comes a voice on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rhonda. Um, yeah it just started.\" you answer. \"You're out of class I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, yeah thank god.\" comes the reply accompanied by a gagging motion, \"Professor Winston's such goddamn bore. Oh but hey enough about me, what time are you off at?\" asks Rhonda. She takes your reply of 5 PM.happily. \"Alright cool. Let's meet up at that Japanese place on 57th when you get off then. It's been a few days since we've been out to eat, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an exchange of goodbyes you hang up. Summer has been dating Rhonda Turner, a 20-year-old sophomore, for about the last eight months when they met at a party that one of the sororities was throwing. Rhonda was a bit of a dork into stuff like comic books, video games and anime but she also had a large, outgoing personality and a generally adorable look that made people think of her as something akin to a cute little kitten... albeit a kitten with ear gauges and lip and eyebrow piercings. The two of them got along swimmingly and both being rather petite and cute had earned the nickname (coined by Courtney) of the Diabetes Duo and last month they both broke down, moved out of their respective dorms and got an apartment together. As Rhonda's father was the owner of one of the biggest car dealerships in the area affording rent wasn't a problem after all although Rhonda herself, not wanting to be one of those well-off kids who sponged off of their parents exclusively, did clerical work for her father's dealership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a feeling that made you a little better about not choosing to go after Claire as it reminded you a lot of when you and Jillian had moved in together and were practically inseparable. It was a comforting feeling and on one hand you felt a pang of guilt about not letting Summer herself experience this little date but on the other after the stress you'd been through in the last two days it would be nice to settle into something comforting for at least a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving back home from dinner you had decided to hop into the shower. You clean yourself off and becoming extra familiar with your current form making sure to catch one last appearance of it wet and glistening before drying off and wrapping a towel around you. Summer's still a pretty sight, even with her hair wet you think as you look into the mirror and think back to how you acquired her in the restroom. You remember the weird occurence of your pitch-perfect imitation of Darcy's voice. You've always been terrible at impersonations so you're surprised you were able to pull it off. Curious if you could still do it you clear your throat before speaking. \"Hello hello?\" you ask nobody, \"Testing.\" You're surprised, and a little delighted, when another perfect copy of Darcy's voice emerges from your mouth. \"Whoa, this is kind of neat.\" you say, wondering if it's a side effect of the SX-3. \"Hi, I'm Darcy Whitehead. I need to work on being a little less standoffish.\" you continue laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something happens that surprises you: you begin feeling weird in your face and head and you catch your features bubbling, shifting, re-arranging and molding until quickly Darcy's head is resting on Summer's body. \"Eep!\" you squeal, this time in Summer's voice, \"Wh-wh-what's going on!\" you wonder aloud as you touch your Darcy face. What the hell happened? What's going on? So many questions run through your head before your thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the bathroom door and Rhonda's voice calling from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer? You alright in there?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and concentrate on Summer's face and head wishing that you had it. You don't know how Rhonda would react suddenly seeing her girlfriend's head replaced after all. You hear the door open and your eyes shoot open relieved to see Summer's features once again. \"I heard you squeal.\" she says as you look over at her, a mop of sandy, curly hair sitting on top of a cute face that's a mix of white and black features (as Rhonda herself is the product of a black father and white mother), a nice-sized chest and wide hips all in a package that couldn't have been more than 5'2\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's nothing.\" you say trying to play it off, \"It's just this dumb towel started falling off and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that it?\" Rhonda replies, a sly smirk on her face, \"Well how about we slip it off and I really make you squeal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow yourself to slip back down into Summer's personality and giggle as Rhonda drags you off to the bedroom. As the two of you begin kissing you notice a bit of a queasy feeling in your stomach that quickly passes and you don't acknowledge. You're too caught up in passion to really care about something minor like a bit of butterflies in your stomach after all. The thing with Darcy's face was weird but you needed to push it out of your mind as right now there was a girl far more in need of your attention. There's no harm in ignoring it you think...</span></div></div>",

That'd be real bad for the whole \"laying low\" thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need an \u2018innocent\u2019 way to absorb her.  Something that will not arouse her suspicions if it fails.  As luck would have it, one pops into your head as you are making your way down the stairs to the restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the women\u2019s restroom, Claire is standing by the sinks, examining herself in the mirror.  Apparently preening is just as important for women in the military as it is for women elsewhere.  You put your masterplan into action and fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d you say, as you trip over your feet and fall heavily on the tiled floor.  And then again, just for the extra effect.  \u201cOw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, it doesn\u2019t seem like the best plan in the world but you are sure it will work.  It would take a heart of stone not to feel sorry for someone like Summer if they crashed to the floor in front of them, you\u2019re pretty sure Claire will want to help.  As you struggle to your knees, you see a uniformed arm reach down to help you back up.  You grab it with a free hand and Claire hauls you back up to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you say, starting to think about how much you want to take Claire\u2019s shape and memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she replies, trying to pull her hand back again.  Your own hand goes with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looks at her hand and yours in astonishment.  You do the same.  They look as if they have melded together and have an unhealthy bluish sheen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grabs you with her free hand, twisting your arm round, up and back as she forces you painfully to the floor face first.  It\u2019s a perfectly executed move that ends up with her pinning you to the floor by straddling your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d gasps Claire as she realises her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that she has done is made contact with more of your body.  You can\u2019s see what\u2019s happening (in fact all you can see is a close up of the floor tiles), but you know that everywhere she is touching you, flesh is melting together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel it as her muscle control slackens and you are able to drag yourself to your knees.  You catch a brief glimpse of what remains of Claire out of the corner of your eye and then she is gone, pulled inside your back with a glooping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself to your feet using the sinks as leverage.  For a moment Summer\u2019s face stares back at you from the mirror.  Then your skin seems to crawl and stretch, you clothes fold on themselves and you are someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Lieutenant Claire Briggs, United States Army and you are here on business.  Colonel Lord, the commanding officer at Fort Suffolk has asked you, Claire, to contact your, her, friend Doctor Jillian Harding and ask for her help at Protean Industries.  Sifting through your new memories, you now know that the Colonel suspects that Protean Industries intends to carry illicit research based on the SX series chemicals.  The colonel, being a wily old fox, wants to secretly tap Jillian for information whilst having another officer, Captain Eric Sanchez, head up an \u2018official\u2019 investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dip into Claire\u2019s memories, replaying parts of the conversation she had with Jillian moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is the research going,\u201d Claire had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Jillian had replied.  Claire had thought that Jillian had sounded nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSX-3?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtean can\u2019t research it without our permission,\u201d Claire had explained.  \u201cLord told me that\u2019s what you\u2019re working on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes,\u201d Jillian had said, even more nervously.  \u201cShould we be talking about it here I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be quiet,\u201d Claire had continued, leaning in closer.  \u201cLook, what I\u2019m about to say isn\u2019t exactly official.  We get reports from Protean about your work, but Lord doesn\u2019t exactly trust Rosenstein.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your recollection for a second.  Well, nobody trusts Levi Rosenstein, the director of research at Protean Industries.  Sure, he sounds so smooth and confident, but every time you\u2019ve ever talked to him, you\u2019ve left with the feeling he would quite happily stab you in the back if it suited his purposes.  You think back to the remainder of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it this way, do you remember the last project you worked on for us,\u201d Claire had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could hardly forget,\u201d Jillian had responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord thinks Rosenstein has filled in the gaps in the report we gave him.  I told the Colonel you would have had nothing to do with that and he agreed, but Rosenstein has contacts elsewhere.\u201d Claire had explained.  She\u2019d expected an angry response from Jillian but had been surprised when one hadn\u2019t come.  \u201cRosenstein knows about David Johnson and wants to repeat that \u2018experiment\u2019 in more controlled circumstances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Jillian had spilled some of her coffee.  Claire had assumed that Jillian was just shocked by the suggestion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s monstrous,\u201d Jillian had exclaimed.  \u201cCompletely unethical.  I would have nothing to do with anything like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Claire had said soothingly.  \u201cBut Rosenstein, Lord knows Rosenstein from before somehow and he\u2019s sure Rosenstein would.  I know it\u2019s a lot to ask but we need your help.  We need someone to keep an eye on things for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you investigate yourself,\u201d Jillian had interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can.  We are.  Eric is heading up the official investigation, but Rosenstein will have him chasing his own shadow.  That\u2019s why Lord wants someone on the inside to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had leaned back at that point.  Both she and Jillian had sat quietly for a minute, giving Jillian time for the enormity of what she had been asked to do to sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you do it,\u201d Claire had asked.  \u201cCan you help us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026  I need time to think,\u201d Jillian had stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d Claire had replied, standing up.  \u201cBut don\u2019t take too long.  Rosenstein is sure to start his experiments soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Claire had gone to the rest rooms.  What you\u2019ve just learned has shaken you deeply.  You want nothing more than to eject Claire out your body and pretend the whole thing never happened.  You could hide out as Summer while the army investigates Protean Industries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sooner or later, the army is going to work out that you were exposed to SX-3.  If you stayed as Claire, you could manipulate and redirect the investigation, ensuring that you or Jillian never come to any harm.  It would be hellishly risky, however.  You could even try to let the real Summer go free, she is an innocent in all this after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if you could be both?  Experimenting, you concentrate hard on Summer\u2019s image and watch as your skin warps again.  Within moments, the young student\u2019s cheerful visage is staring back at you from the mirror.  Another moment of concentration and you are Claire again.  You could live a double life, at least for a while until you decide what you <i>really</i> want to do.  </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Mark Taylor was a young man with a bright future. As a researcher at Protean Industries he had a great job at a company involed heavily with military contracts. However, while working on a new experimental compound called SX-3 an accident in the lab caused the small bit of experimental SX-3 to spill on Mark changing him. Mark Taylor's old life is now over but his new life is just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Mark's Powers</u></b><br>\r\nThanks to being doused in the experimental compound SX-3, Mark has gained a very special ability: the ability to change himself into anyone he desires. However there's a catch: he must absorb those who he wishes to become. By absorbing them he absorbs both their genetic memory and mental memories allowing himself to turn into a perfect replica of the person right down to how they think... but a problem has also come with it. While he permanently remembers the form of anyone he absorbs, he can only copy their mental patterns while they're absorbed into him thus if he absorbed a person he could look like the person, know everything they know and act like them. He can eject the person from his body however and once that happens he could still become them physically but without the immediate access to their mind he could no longer become them mentally. Furthermore if he absorbs a person he has about three or four days to divest them otherwise he will \"digest\" them, killing them and making them a permanent part of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>General Rules</u></b><br>\r\nThe same rules you've come to expect apply here. Spelling, grammar and the like must be minded. Sex is allowed however this is not a porn story. Chapters must be... involved, for lack of a better word. Nothing only a few sentences long or shallow... again for lack of a better word. I reserve the right to delete or edit chapters if I feel that they're not up to standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thing: this is an interactive story and thus a collaborative effort. You might have your own story to tell and that's cool but don't limit yourself to only adding to your own specific corner. Add to other storylines if you feel you have an idea for it. These stories are much more fun when authors play off of eachother. Don't worry so much about stepping on toes but be mindful of the story being told, what has happened in the chapter you're following up and where the story seems to be going. If you have a specific idea for a choice (or choices) at the end of your chapter, feel free to reserve it but don't get greedy and hoard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun and enjoy.</td>",
